  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effects of a soy supplement called Revival on memory, quality of
      life, and hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who are being treated with testosterone
      suppression therapy. Hypothesis: Treating men who have prostate CA with daily Revival will
      result in at least a 50% reduction in hot flashes compared to placebo.

      This research study will look at the effects of a soy supplement called Revival on memory,
      quality of life, and hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who are undergoing (ADT)
      androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be given either placebo or Revival.
      Participants will be asked to take their supplement once/day for 14 weeks.Blood will be drawn
      to check on liver, kidney, thyroid, cholesterol,and prostate health. Urine will be collected
      to check on bone markers. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires to test memory,
      attention span, and vocabulary.Possible benefits may include increase in memory, decrease in
      hot flashes, and a general increase in quality of life.

    <measure>Cognitive Function as Assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), Total Recall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. Approximately 20-25 min later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any words remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives, 6 semantically related, &amp; 6 semantically unrelated. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score ( -12) ; the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. A higher score = higher cognition.</description>

    <measure>Cognition as Assessed by the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) , Dominant Hand Time (Seconds)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GPT assesses eye-hand coordination and motor speed and thus requires sensory motor integration and a high level of motor processing. The test apparatus consists of a square metal surface (10.1 cm2) with a 5 × 5 matrix of keyhole shaped holes in various orientations. The task requires the examinee to pick up the keyhole shaped peg (3 mm in diameter) individually from the well just above the 5 × 5 matrix of holes from left to right and top to bottom as quickly as possible using the dominant hand. Because the holes are in various orientations, examinees must manipulate each peg in their hand (usually between the index finger and thumb) so that the peg aligns with the orientation of the hole. A faster time, indicates greater cognitive functioning.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function as Assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), Total Recall Score</title>
        <description>The test consists 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. Approximately 20–25 min later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any words remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives, 6 semantically related, &amp; 6 semantically unrelated. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score ( -12) ; the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. A higher score = higher cognition.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function as Assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), Percent Retained</title>
        <description>The test consists 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. Approximately 20–25 min later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any words remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives, 6 semantically related, and 6 semantically unrelated. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score ( -12) ; the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives.A higher score= higher cognitive function.</description>

        <description>The GPT assesses eye–hand coordination and motor speed and thus requires sensory motor integration and a high level of motor processing. The test apparatus consists of a square metal surface (10.1 cm2) with a 5 × 5 matrix of keyhole shaped holes in various orientations. The task requires the examinee to pick up the keyhole shaped peg (3 mm in diameter) individually from the well just above the 5 × 5 matrix of holes from left to right and top to bottom as quickly as possible using the dominant hand. Because the holes are in various orientations, examinees must manipulate each peg in their hand (usually between the index finger and thumb) so that the peg aligns with the orientation of the hole. A faster time, indicates greater cognitive functioning.</description>

        <title>Cognition as Assessed by the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) , Number of Dominant Hand Drops</title>
        <description>The GPT assesses eye–hand coordination and motor speed and thus requires sensory motor integration and a high level of motor processing. The test apparatus consists of a square metal surface (10.1 cm2) with a 5 × 5 matrix of keyhole shaped holes in various orientations. The task requires the examinee to pick up the keyhole shaped peg (3 mm in diameter) individually from the well just above the 5 × 5 matrix of holes from left to right and top to bottom as quickly as possible using the dominant hand. Because the holes are in various orientations, examinees must manipulate each peg in their hand (usually between the index finger and thumb) so that the peg aligns with the orientation of the hole.</description>

        <description>The test measures recognition memory for the elements of the Rey complex figure, and assesses the respondent’s ability to use cues to retrieve information. Scoring of drawings is based on the widely used 36-point scoring system. Each of the 18 scoring units is scored based on accuracy and placement criteria. Items of the figure can earn points:
Correct Image: placed properly (2 points), placed poorly (1 point)
Distorted or Incomplete Image, but recognizable: placed properly (1 point), placed poorly (1/2) point
Absent or not recognizable: 0 points
Scale ranges 0-36. with 36 being greatest cognitive function.</description>

        <title>Daytime Sleepiness as Assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</title>
        <description>The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most people engage in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person’s average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their ‘daytime sleepiness’.</description>
