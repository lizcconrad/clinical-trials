      Primary objective : To evaluate the quality of fractures setting and osteotomy of the facial
      massif osteosynthesised with resorbable device PLLA/PGA compared with usual Titanium plates.

      Secondary objective :

        -  To evaluate the resorbable device ergonomy versus Titanium.

        -  To evaluate the clinical tolerance of resorbable device versus Titanium.

      Hypothesis :

      Osteosynthesis with resorbable device demonstrates a non inferiority success probability
      regarding the success observed in osteosynthesis with Titanium, with a less important
      probability of re-operation.

      Study duration : 14 months for each patient.

      Study treatment :

        -  Group I : Resorbable device PLLA/PGA.

        -  Group II : Titanium device.

      Study visits :

      - Screening visit - Baseline with randomization and surgery - Day1 - Day 21 - Day
      45(Traumatology)/Day 90 (orthognatic) – Month 6,12 and 14.

      Randomization : Stratification by centres, mono or bimaxillar surgery and traumatologic or
      orthognatic criteria.
