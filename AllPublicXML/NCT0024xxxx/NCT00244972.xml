    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together
      with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with biopsiable cancer that has spread to other
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Tipifarnib and
      sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      tipifarnib in combination with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminary assessment of tipifarnib and sorafenib efficacy (objective response).

      II. To determine signaling pathway profiles of patients treated with tipifarnib and sorafenib
      who are amenable to biopsy by reverse phase protein microarray (RPPA) analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days
      1-28 and tipifarnib PO QD or BID on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may be allowed to
      continue the treatment after the 12 courses if there is continued clinical response or
      disease stabilization, and patients do not have significant toxicities.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
