    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy for benign or malignant disease of the esophagus can be performed using a
      transhiatal technique or Ivor Lewis technique (combined laparotomy with thoracotomy). These
      procedures can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Advances in
      minimally invasive technology and surgical techniques have allowed us to explore the
      possibility of performing esophagectomy using minimally invasive surgical techniques.

      Minimally invasive esophagectomy represents a new alternative to conventional open
      esophagectomy. It is a technically demanding operation requiring advanced laparoscopic
      surgical skills, appropriate instrumentation, and thorough knowledge of open esophagectomy.
      Multiple authors have reported the use of video-assisted thoracoscopy or laparoscopy to
      facilitate esophagectomy [2-6]. Most of these reports have utilized a standard laparotomy in
      combination with thoracoscopy to perform esophageal mobilization or laparoscopy with a
      mini-laparotomy to perform esophagectomy. DePaula was the first to report a large series of
      48 patients undergoing laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy for benign (n=24) and malignant
      disease (n=24) [7]. In 2 patients, conversion to open surgery was required and 2 others
      required thoracoscopic assistance. Postoperative complications were low in the benign group
      but higher in the carcinoma group. The 30-day mortality rate was 16% in patients with
      carcinoma undergoing laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. DePaula concluded that the
      patients who benefit most from this procedure are those with benign disease. Swanstrom
      recently reported nine cases of laparoscopic total esophagectomy [8]. There were no
      conversions to laparotomy. One patient required a right thoracoscopy with intrathoracic
      anastomosis due to poor viability of the gastric tube. The mean operative time was 6.5 hours
      with a mean hospital stay of 6.4 days. However, the advantages of minimally invasive
      esophagectomy have not been observed. The aim of this prospective trial is to evaluate the
      physiologic outcome, clinical outcome, and quality of life after combined thoracoscopic and
      laparoscopic esophagectomy vs. transhiatal esophagectomy.

      RATIONALE:

      Open esophagectomy can be associated with significant morbidity. We hypothesize that
      laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with reduced morbidity and a faster recovery.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy can be performed safely.

        2. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with reduced
           postoperative pain, decrease ICU and hospital stay, and reduced postoperative wound
           morbidity.

        3. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with similar long
           term survival as with the open approach for patients with esophageal malignancies.

      OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To compare short-term outcome such as operative time, operative and in-patient costs,
           operative complications, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications
           between combined thoracoscopic/ laparoscopic esophagectomy and transhiatal
           esophagectomy.

        2. To evaluate physiologic outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy vs. transhiatal
           esophagectomy.

        3. To determine the long-term outcome, disease-free survival, survival and quality of life
           after minimally invasive esophagectomy compared to transhiatal esophagectomy
