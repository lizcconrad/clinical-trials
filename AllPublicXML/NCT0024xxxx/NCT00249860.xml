  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to establish interferon-beta-1a as the treatment of
      choice for chronic Hepatitis C with better efficacy and safety profiles in monotherapy or
      combination therapy.

      This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a placebo
      to be crossed-over to a combination of interferon-beta-1a and ribavirin or no treatment
      during an open-label extension phase. The duration of the trial will be 48 weeks, with a
      double-blind period of 12 weeks.

      The study will recruit 257 eligible subjects of either sex. It will be conducted by
      approximately 16 Investigators / investigational centers in 3 countries (China, Hong Kong and
      Singapore).
