  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      risperidone long-acting injection (LAI) versus oral antipsychotics in participants with
      recent onset psychosis (abnormal thinking and/or hallucinations).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know identity of intervention), randomized (the study drug
      is assigned by chance), multicenter (conducted in more than 1 center), and exploratory study
      in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional
      instability, detachment from reality) or schizoaffective disorder (mixed psychiatric disorder
      relating to complex psychotic state that has features of both schizophrenia and mood
      disorder). Duration of this study will be 24 months. Study assessment visits will be
      conducted at Screening, Baseline, Week 2, every 4 weeks till Week 22, at Week 28, every 12
      weeks till Week 88 and at Week 104. All eligible participants will receive either risperidone
      long acting injection 25 milligram (mg) intramuscularly (into the muscle) along with their
      current oral medication (atypical antipsychotic - risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine) or
      only their current oral medication. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by Positive and
      Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS), time to relapse and Social and Occupational Functioning
      Assessment Scale (SOFAS). Participants's safety will be evaluated throughout the study mainly
      by Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and
      Simpson Angus Scale (SAS).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Words Score Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104 or LRV</time_frame>
    <description>Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT) was used to assess verbal fluency. Participants are given 3 different letters of the alphabet and asked to say as many words beginning with each letter within a controlled time. Participants are then asked to identify as many words as possible in 3 different categories (animals, fruits and vegetables) within a specified period of time. The total score is a sum of all three categories scores. The total score ranges from 0-90, the higher the score the higher the verbal fluency.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) Score at Week 104 or LRV</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104 or LRV</time_frame>
    <description>The DAI, a 10-item scale to assess how the attitude of schizophrenia participants toward their medications may affect compliance. Respondents indicate 'true' or 'false' for each item. An overall calculated score ranged from -10 to 10, where a positive score indicated a positive subjective response (compliant), a negative score indicated non-compliance. Change: score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Standardized Mental Component Scale Score in Short Form 36 (SF-36) at Week 104 or LRV</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104 or LRV</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It calculates two standardized scales: the standardized mental component scale and the standardized physical component scale. The standardized scales are calculated as weighted sums of the 8 scores, which are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each item is scored on a 0-100 range; and standardized mental component scale score is calculated as weighted average of individual item scores on a 0-100 range, where 100 signify highest level of functioning. The change from baseline in mental component scale score was reported.</description>

    <measure>Simpson Angus Scale (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104 or LRV</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS is a 10-item scale used to measure the symptoms of parkinsonism (slow movements) or parkinsonian side-effects related to the use of antipsychotic medications. The 10 items are rated on a 5-point scale (0=complete absence, 4=extreme presence) after a brief neurological examination and observation of the participants' gait (slow, shuffling walk). Total score is sum of individual item scores (range 0 to 40); higher score indicates more affected.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 104 or LRV</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS is a 12-item scale to provide a numeric measure to the observed abnormal movements in different parts of the body. Information is collected after a brief neurological examination and is scored on a 5-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). Ten items are scored in a 5-point scale (0 = none/normal, 4 = severe) which evaluates abnormal movements in three main anatomic areas (orofacial area, extremities, and trunk). Two items are yes/no questions regarding dental status. Total scores range from 0 to 42 with higher values indicating more severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Calgary Depression Symptom Scale (CDSS) Score at Week 104 or LRV</title>
        <description>Co-morbid depressive symptoms are evaluated by change in CDSS Score which was developed to assess symptoms of depression in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self). It consists of 9 items, each scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). The total score is a sum of the scores of each item and may range from 0 to 27. Higher score more severe pathology. Data presented here represents the change from baseline to endpoint.</description>

        <description>Controlled Word Association Test (COWAT) was used to assess verbal fluency. Participants are given 3 different letters of the alphabet and asked to say as many words beginning with each letter within a controlled time. Participants are then asked to identify as many words as possible in 3 different categories (animals, fruits and vegetables) within a specified period of time. The total score is a sum of all three categories scores. The total score ranges from 0-90, the higher the score the higher the verbal fluency.</description>

          <description>The DAI, a 10-item scale to assess how the attitude of schizophrenia participants toward their medications may affect compliance. Respondents indicate 'true' or 'false' for each item. An overall calculated score ranged from -10 to 10, where a positive score indicated a positive subjective response (compliant), a negative score indicated non-compliance. Change: score at observation minus score at baseline.</description>
          <population>The ITT analysis population included all the participants who received at least 3 doses of risperidone or 6 weeks of their oral antipsychotic, and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Standardized Mental Component Scale Score in Short Form 36 (SF-36) at Week 104 or LRV</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It calculates two standardized scales: the standardized mental component scale and the standardized physical component scale. The standardized scales are calculated as weighted sums of the 8 scores, which are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each item is scored on a 0-100 range; and standardized mental component scale score is calculated as weighted average of individual item scores on a 0-100 range, where 100 signify highest level of functioning. The change from baseline in mental component scale score was reported.</description>

Information is collected after a brief neurological examination and is scored on a 5-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). Ten items are scored in a 5-point scale (0 = none/normal, 4 = severe) which evaluates abnormal movements in three main anatomic areas (orofacial area, extremities, and trunk). Two items are yes/no questions regarding dental status. Total scores range from 0 to 42 with higher values indicating more severity.</description>

          <title>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)</title>
          <description>The AIMS is a 12-item scale to provide a numeric measure to the observed abnormal movements in different parts of the body. Information is collected after a brief neurological examination and is scored on a 5-point scale (0=none, 4=severe). Ten items are scored in a 5-point scale (0 = none/normal, 4 = severe) which evaluates abnormal movements in three main anatomic areas (orofacial area, extremities, and trunk). Two items are yes/no questions regarding dental status. Total scores range from 0 to 42 with higher values indicating more severity.</description>
          <population>Analysis population included all randomly assigned participants. Here 'n' signifies participants evaluable at each time point for each treatment arm, respectively.</population>
