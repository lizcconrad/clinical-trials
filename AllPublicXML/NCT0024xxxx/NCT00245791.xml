    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the antibiotic
      levofloxacin by administering a higher dose of levofloxacin and using a shorter course of
      therapy.

      This study will be a pilot study of the efficacy of 750 mg of levofloxacin once daily for 5
      days in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection.

      The specific objectives include:

        1. To describe clinical and microbiological outcome at short and long term follow-up with 5
           days levofloxacin in subjects with acute symptomatic complicated urinary infection, both
           with and without indwelling catheters.

        2. To determine the tolerability of levofloxacin 750-mg once daily in patients with
           complicated urinary infection.

        3. To describe some characteristics of the resolution of the inflammatory response with
           treatment of complicated urinary infection as demonstrated by changes in urine proteins.

        4. To identify any emergence of resistant organisms in recurrent urinary infection
           following therapy.
