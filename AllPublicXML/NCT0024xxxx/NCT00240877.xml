      The primary study objective is to assess the safety of a monovalent vaccine of a new 6:2
      reassortant in healthy adults prior to the release of the trivalent vaccine (FluMist). Safety
      will be demonstrated by similar fever rates (oral temperature ≥101°F) in vaccine and placebo
      recipients.
