      The aim of the sudy is to evaluate, through clinical, biological and transthoracic
      echocardiography follow up, the evolution of post operative (cardiac surgery) pericardial
      effusion and mostly to evaluate the efficiency of a non steroidal anti inflammatory (NSAID)
      drug (diclofenac)for this indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following cardiac surgery, the incidence of Pericardial effusion (PE) is high (50-85%) . The
      risk of tamponade is well acknowledged : about 2%. We published in 2004 in CHEST a study
      which allows us to know the natural history of post-operative PE and to validate, for the
      first time the use of an echocardiographic classification for predicting the occurrence of a
      tamponade. NSAID are widely used in this setting, but no study has ever been conducted trying
      to assess their efficiency. The aim of the study is therefore obvious : must we use NSAID in
      order to prevent post operative cardiac tamponades ?.

      In order to answer this question, we are going to conduct a double-blind randomized study
      comparing diclofenac to a placebo.

      Every patient hospitalized in a post operative cardiac rehabilitation center less than 30
      days after cardiac surgery and presenting at the first TTE (Trans Thoracic cardiac
      Echography) a PE of severity &gt; 2 (that is to say about 10 % of the totality of the patients
      having undergone a cardiac operation) will be included.: after randomisation, patients will
      receive a placebo or diclofenac (50 mg ) bid, in a double blind way, during 14 days.

      Trans thoracic cardiac echography, creatininemia, haemoglobinemia, International Normalized
      Ratio (for patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist) will be performed once a week during 2
      weeks.

      Clinical assessment will be done every day (there will be no outpatient

      Primary end point : evolution of the mean echocardiographic score in each group

      -Secondary end-points :

      Number of tamponades Number of patients in whom the individual echographic grade is
      decreasing of at least one point Number of pericardiotomy Creatininemia Haemoglobinemia PE
      evolution in patients having an inflammatory syndrome (C reactive Protein &gt;30) PE evolution
      in patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist

      86 patients per group are necessary; therefore we will include a total of 200 patients
