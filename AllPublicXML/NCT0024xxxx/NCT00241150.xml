        Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria at Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 3.

        Inclusion criteria for Group A (overweight postmenopausal females with high-normal blood
        pressure/ mild Stage I hypertension)

          1. Non-smoking female outpatients diagnosed as postmenopausal based on age (48 - 65
             years) and self-reported absence of menstrual periods for at least one year.

          2. Mean blood pressure between 130 - 149 mm Hg systolic and/or 85 - 94 mm Hg diastolic

             â€¢ When systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure fall into different
             categories (high normal versus mild stage I hypertension), the higher category should
             be selected to classify or group the subject.

          3. Body mass index greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 41 kg/m2

          4. Subjects who agree not to alter their diet or exercise routine during the study and
             comply with study specific restrictions 24 hours prior to the next scheduled study
             visit

          5. Subjects who have read, signed and received a copy of the informed consent form prior
             to the initiation of any study procedures and who agree to participate in all aspects
             of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Non-smoking female outpatients diagnosed as postmenopausal based on age (48 - 65
             years) and self-reported absence of menstrual periods for at least one year.

             2. Mean blood pressure between 90 - 129 mm Hg systolic and/or 50 - 84 mm Hg diastolic.

             3. Body mass index greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 41 kg/m2
