  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if this epothilone leads to a response in patients
      with recurrent ovarian cancer that has progressed during, or in the last six months since a
      treatment of platinum-based chemotherapy. We also aim to look at the safety of the study drug
      and assess the impact of the infusion duration on tolerability.
