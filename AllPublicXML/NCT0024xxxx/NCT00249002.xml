  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to confirm the safety of the proposed dose and schedule of ABI-007 for
      hemodialysis patients with vascular access device failure, and to obtain preliminary data on
      the effectiveness of such treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot, phase II study to assess the feasibility of administering
      ABI-007 intravenously [IV] over 3-5 minutes to patients with hemodialysis graft dysfunction
      (i.e., either a thrombosed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, or a patent but
      dysfunctional PTFE graft). Patients with graft dysfunction who are successfully treated with
      angioplasty will start treatment after angioplasty or during their first dialysis through the
      graft following intervention, and will receive 3 subsequent treatments of ABI-007 at 35
      mg/m^2 on weeks 5, 13 and 21.

          -  Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to be able to complete the study
             through the End of Study (EOS) visit.

          -  Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug.

          -  Documented hypercoagulable state requiring anti-coagulation (protein S, protein C,
