      The purpose of this study is to test how tolerable and effective lorazepam is when used to
      treat alcohol withdrawal in hospital patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal.

      Studies show that symptom-triggered dosing is best for treatment of alcohol withdrawal in
      patients on chemical dependence units without other illness. On general medical hospital
      wards, withdrawal may be affected by comorbid medical illness. A clinical trial was
      undertaken to determine whether there is a difference between symptom-triggered (ST) and
      fixed-schedule (FS) dosing of lorazepam in patients hospitalized on general medical wards at
      a University medical center. Subjects were assessed by their nurses with the Revised Clinical
      Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale. Subjects in the ST arm received
      lorazepam doses based on CIWA-Ar score. Subjects in the FS arm received scheduled lorazepam
      with tapering over 4 days.
