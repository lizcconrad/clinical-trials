      To demonstrate the safety, feasibility, quality of life, primary caregiver satisfaction, and
      cost effectiveness of integrated Home Telehealth care versus standard care in a heart failure
      clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to implement and evaluate a Home Telehealth Care Management System designed to
      enhance clinical care for congestive heart failure patients who have difficulty with access
      to care. Unique in this model is that in addition to use of protocol driven interventions
      (evidence based), the primary care physician is intimately involved in follwo up of patients-
      with consequent reduction in the fracture of care seen in with attendance in multiple
      specialty clinics.

      In this project, we will evaluate the delivery of care to heart failure patients in Nova
      Scotia and New Brunswick, with our intervention and the current standard of care, which is
      the heart failure clinic. Home Telehealth technology will allow patients to be contacted and
      regularly evaluated in a comprehensive way in their own home, and without the need for a
      clinic visit. While the Project Team (experienced in heart failure management) will monitor
      all data, the Family Physician will have first hand access to and right of first treatment
      when alterations in therapy are needed. This process will be facilitated by the use of
      protocol driven medical therapy, and delegated medical functions, as well as set-piece
      education. We hope, with this technology and care plan, to offer the benefits of disease
      management to this vulnerable patient population while at the same time firmly placing the
      Family Physician in their central role within the health care system. This program will
      enable a specific assessment of all aspects of the program, including outcomes, quality of
      life, professional satisfaction and cost.
