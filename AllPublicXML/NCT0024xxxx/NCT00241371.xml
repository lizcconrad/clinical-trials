          4. Age 18 years or older.

          5. ECOG performance status &lt;= 2.

          7. Women of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:
