  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define the effective dose and tolerability of levetiracetam in individuals with Restless
      Legs Syndrome (RLS). It is hypothesized that levetiracetam will be well tolerated, safe and
      effective in treating the symptoms of RLS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with idiopathic RLS according to the four IRLSSG diagnostic criteria

               1. An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and
                  unpleasant sensations in the legs.

               2. The urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest
                  or inactivity such as sitting or lying down.

               3. The urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by
                  movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity
                  continues

               4. The urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than
                  during the day or only occur in the evening or night.

        IRLS Rating Scale score greater than 15 at Baseline visit PLM-Index of 5 or greater during
        the first night of polysomnography Written informed consent obtained prior to any study
        procedures being performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women of childbearing potential, who have a positive urine pregnancy test or are
             lactating as the screening visit, or do not practice a clinically accepted method of
             contraception.

          2. Individuals who are taking medication for Restless Legs Syndrome without a proper
             washout period

          3. Individuals who are taking hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics

          4. History of current diagnosis of other clinically relevant diseases that may confound
             assessments of RLS symptoms (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, dementia, ALS, etc.)

          5. Subjects with serum ferritin below 10µg/L

          6. Subjects with an untreated sleep disorder that may confound assessments (e.g.,
             narcolepsy, sleep apnea syndrome or other breathing-related sleep disorders, or REM
             sleep behaviour disorder)

          7. Subjects with an apnea/hypopnea index of 15 or greater at the initial polysomnography
             visit

          8. Subjects employed in shift work (e.g., employment hours disruptive to the normal
             circadian sleep-wake cycle such as nighttime or variable rotating shifts)

          9. Subjects who have clinically significant or unstable medical conditions which in the
             opinion of the investigator would render the subject unsuitable for the study (e.g.
             severe cardiovascular disease, major depression, psychosis, hepatic or renal failure,
             etc.)

         10. subjects with a positive urine drug test for illicit use of amphetamines,
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, synthetic narcotics, and miscellaneous drugs
             commonly known as recreational drugs (e.g., cannabinoids including THC, heroine,
             cocaine)

         11. Participation in any clinical drug or device trial in the 30 days prior to the
             screening visit.
