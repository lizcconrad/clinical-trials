  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether patients with diabetes have less clinical improvement during inpatient
      rehabilitation than those without diabetes and whether hyperglycaemia during rehabilitation
      is an adverse prognostic indicator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes have a higher mortality rate and more severe disability from stroke
      compared to those without diabetes. Those with hyperglycaemia tend to progress to a larger
      final stroke size. Diabetes and hyperglycaemia may affect the ability of the patient to
      clinically improve, independent of the degree of initial impairment. We will perform a
      retrospective review of medical records of stroke patients admitted to an inpatient
      rehabilitation unit. We will compare outcomes of changes in disability scales (FIM and
      Barthel) from admission to discharge, length of stay and hospital events between those with
      and without diabetes. Amongst those with diabetes, we will also assess whether those with
      higher mean blood glucose levels during their inpatient rehabilitation stay have worse
      outcomes.
