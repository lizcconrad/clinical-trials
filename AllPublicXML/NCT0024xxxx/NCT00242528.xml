        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2.

          -  Confirmed Diagnosis of Durie-Salmon Stage III Multiple Myeloma, with the following
             clinical characteristics:

        A. At least 1 osteolytic bone lesion demonstrable in a conventional X-ray film. B. The
        patient will have to be receiving treatment for primary neoplasia, at the time of the start
        of this trial.

        - Ambulatory patients aged ≥ 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with bisphosphonates in any moment during the last 12 months before visit 1.
             except for those patients that received only one dosis of bisphosphonates for any
             indication and when the administration has been 14 days before or older.

          -  Patients with an absence of a bone lesion clearly related to the primary cancer, and
             that is detectable in a conventional bone X-ray (simple film).

          -  Patients with a Serum Calcium level of ≤ 8 g/dl (2.00 mmol/L) or ≥ 12 mg/dL (3.00
             mmol/L)

          -  Treatment with other investigational drugs within 30 days before inclusion in the
             trial.

          -  Serum Creatinine levels of &gt; 3 mg/dl (265 umol/L).

          -  Total Billirubin levels of &gt; 2.5 mg/dl (43 umol/L)

          -  Patients with a heart condition that has the NYHA criteria for a Grade III and IV
             functional class

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
