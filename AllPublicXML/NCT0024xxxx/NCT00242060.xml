  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam (DRE) are used to screen for prostate
      cancer. Patients with abnormal DRE or elevated PSA undergo transrectal ultrasound guided
      biopsy (TRUS-Bx). There are some men who have a normal TRUS-Bx despite persistent elevated
      PSA and may harbor occult prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI
      using an endorectal coil, and advanced MRI methods called H1 MR Spectroscopy (MRS) and
      Dynamic MR Perfusion Imaging (dMRI) can help identify and localize prostate cancer in these
      patients and direct repeat TRUS-Bx to the most suspicious location in the prostate gland. 100
      men, currently under observation with elevated PSA but negative TRUS-Bx will be enrolled in
      the study.
