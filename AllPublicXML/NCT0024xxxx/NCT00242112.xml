  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of functional MRI techniques [High
      Resolution Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (HR-DCE-MRI), diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) and BOLD
      MRI] to detect, measure and locate intra-prostatic cancer. 70 patients undergoing MRI for
      staging of prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy will be studied. Results of MRI
      obtained prior to surgery will be correlated with pathologic specimens to determine MRI
      accuracy.

      <textblock>
        Patients will be recruited from the University Health Network (UHN). Eligible patients will
        be undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer at UHN. Patients with a
        contraindication to MRI or MRI contrast agents, claustrophobia, renal failure, allergy to
        MRI contrast agents, or prior hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for prostate cancer, a
        biopsy within 3 weeks of the surgical date or active prostatitis will be excluded.
