  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of pathological gambling.
      Pathological gambling (PG) is a debilitating disorder, generally leading to severe personal,
      familial, financial, social, and occupational impairments. In PG, the patient experiences a
      progressive inability to resist impulses to gamble, and gambling significantly disrupt the
      patient's functioning in the personal, familial, and/or vocational spheres. Topiramate has
      shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in some impulse control disorders.

    <textblock>
      This is a 14-week, outpatient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      flexible-dose study of topiramate in subjects with pathological gambling. After giving
      informed consent, subjects who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria may be enrolled.
      The study will consist of three phases:

        -  Washout/Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to randomization or longer for those
           medications requiring a longer washout period;

        -  Double-Blind Phase (Titration: up to 6 weeks; Maintenance: 8 weeks); and

        -  Taper Phase (approximately 1 week).

      The study medication will be titrated to 300 mg/day or the subject's maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). Subjects must reach a minimum dose of 50 mg/day by Week 2. The taper phase will last
      approximately one week where subjects gradually reduce their medication until they are no
      longer taking study medication.

      Patient may also give an optional blood sample for pharmacogenomic testing
