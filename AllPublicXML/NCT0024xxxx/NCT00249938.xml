  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if combination therapy with a &quot;statin&quot; medication and two
      additional agents that work differently than &quot;statin&quot; medications can further lower the
      so-called &quot;bad cholesterol.&quot; One therapy is a prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration to treat high cholesterol (Welchol). The other therapy is Minute Maid Heart
      Wise orange juice. This study juice is available in supermarkets and contains plant sterols
      that have been shown to lower cholesterol.

      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
      States. Lowering LDL cholesterol in both patients with and without CHD reduces coronary
      events and death. Statin medications are the primary mechanism of lowering LDL cholesterol,
      but some patients do not reach their goal LDL with maximum tolerated statin doses and must
      utilize combination therapy to further lower cholesterol. Additionally, some patients prefer
      to utilize &quot;natural&quot; mechanisms to lower cholesterol. This prospective, double-blinded,
      randomized study will compare plant sterol (natural cholesterol treatment) with placebo in
      patients treated with combination statin and colesevelam therapy.
