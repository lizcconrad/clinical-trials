    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the utility of etomidate and midazolam in helping
      patients to relax when there was a need for the placement of a ventilation tube by medics who
      were transporting patients to a hospital in an ambulance.

      Study Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the utility of etomidate and
      midazolam for sedative facilitated intubation (SFI), without paralytics, in pre-hospital
      adult patients.

      Methods: This prospective, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted with two ground
      pre-hospital Advanced Life Support (ALS) units. All patients age 18 or over transported by
      the two participating systems requiring pre-hospital SFI were eligible for participation. The
      ambulances were stocked with blinded numbered syringes, each containing either 7mg of
      midazolam or 20mg of etomidate. Contact with the Medic Command physician was not required and
      no paralytics were used. If sedation was not achieved with the study drug, medics could
      request additional sedation from a Medical command physician; only midazolam or diazepam were
      available outside of the study.
