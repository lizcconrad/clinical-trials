    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if darbepoetin alfa is an effective treatment for anemia
      in prostate cancer patients and, if so, what dose is most effective. Sometimes prostate
      cancer patients have low red blood cell counts (low hemoglobin) from various treatments they
      are receiving, such as chemotherapy. The red blood cells deliver oxygen to the tissue. This
      then helps give the patient more energy.

      This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Darbepoetin alfa, (also referred to as Aranesp
      or NESP), to assess what dose of NESP is required to treat anemia in prostate cancer
      patients, what the side effects of NESP are, and whether NESP will affect the patients'
      quality of life. NESP is approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia in patients with
      chronic kidney failure and for the treatment of anemia in cancer patients who are receiving
      chemotherapy. It is considered experimental for the treatment of anemia in prostate cancer
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have either histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate or
             clinical evidence including a PSA greater than 50, with evidence of bone metastases,
             currently receiving either androgen suppression or chemotherapy.

          -  Patients on concurrent androgen deprivation treatment that consists of either
             orchiectomy or a GnRH agonist (Zoladex or Lupron) with or without and androgen
             receptor antagonist (Casodex, Nilandron, or Eulexin) therapy, as long as therapy was
             initiated within the last 3 months. Finasteride treatment must be discontinued.
             Secondary hormonal therapy with DES or ketoconazole is permitted.

          -  Patients may have a history of radiation therapy, providing that at least 6 weeks have
             elapsed from the last treatment date to study day 1.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 months and a zubrod performance
             status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must not have evidence of hemolysis, and no overt gastrointestinal bleeding
             or bleeding due to recent surgery.

          -  Patients must have serum creatinine level of less than or equal to 2 mg/dL.

          -  Patients must have adequate liver function, as evidenced by aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 2 x ULN within the 3
             months prior to screening.

          -  Before any study-specific procedure, the patients must give written informed consent
             to participate in the study.
