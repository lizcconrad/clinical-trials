      This study hypothesizes that patients receiving efficacy enhancing information about the
      acupressure bands will expect less treatment-related nausea, which will subsequently result
      in less treatment-related nausea compared to patients who do not receive such information.

      This study extends prior research by utilizing a randomized controlled trial in a clinical
      environment to examine the efficacy of an intervention that is specifically designed to
      reduce patients' response expectancies concerning nausea development from cancer treatments,
      and, thereby, reduce nausea.

      The objectives of this study are as follow:

        1. To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
           expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management will result in reduced
           chemotherapy-induced nausea.

        2. To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
           expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management will result in increased
           health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.

      To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
      expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management is more effective than a single-tiered
      strategy in reducing chemotherapy- induced nausea.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Five-day Nausea Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Five days</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea was measured using a five-day patient report diary. Each day was divided into 4 sections: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. Patients reported severity of nausea for each period daily. Severity of nausea was assessed on a 7-point rating scale, anchored at one end by 1 = &quot;Not at all nauseated&quot; and at the other end by 7 = &quot;Extremely nauseated.&quot; The description &quot;Moderately nauseated&quot; was centered on the scale below the 4. Average Nausea was the mean severity for the 20 reporting periods.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Health-Related Quality of Life was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale - General (FACT-G). The FACT-G is a 28-item scale developed specifically for use in cancer clinical trials. Possible scores range from a low of 0 to a high of 112. Along with a total score representing HRQL, there are psychometrically validated subscales of physical, functional, social, and cognitive-emotional status. It has become one of the most commonly used measures in oncology, and we have used this scale in our previous studies.</description>

          <description>Patients received two acupressure bands. Patients received an expectancy-neutral handout that simply thanked them for participating in the study. The wording of the letter was, “Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study regarding the use of acupressure bands to control chemotherapy-related nausea.

It is only with the assistance of individuals, like you, who are willing to give their time that we can learn new ways to better control the side effects of cancer treatment. Wear the acupressure bands for up to five days, if helpful, to prevent or alleviate nausea. We are very appreciative of your contribution to this study.” Patients received an expectancy-neutral relaxation CD that was about 12 minutes in length and utilized guided imagery in which the individual visualized pleasant, soothing images or scenes while relaxed.</description>

Patients received an expectancy-enhancing handout to enhance expected acupressure band efficacy. It was printed on Cancer Center letterhead and signed by a medical oncologist and two of the study investigators. The handout presented a very positive (and truthful) interpretation of the data from two prior acupressure band studies. Patients also received a medical prescription instructing them to use the acupressure bands for relief of nausea. The prescription was signed by a medical oncologist and had the instruction, “Wear Seabands for up to five days as needed to prevent or alleviate nausea.” Patients’ names were not on the prescription.

        <title>Five-day Nausea Diary</title>
        <description>Nausea was measured using a five-day patient report diary. Each day was divided into 4 sections: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. Patients reported severity of nausea for each period daily. Severity of nausea was assessed on a 7-point rating scale, anchored at one end by 1 = “Not at all nauseated&quot; and at the other end by 7 = &quot;Extremely nauseated.&quot; The description “Moderately nauseated” was centered on the scale below the 4. Average Nausea was the mean severity for the 20 reporting periods.</description>

        <population>All patients who did not have protocol violations who provided evaluable data were included in the analyses. No data imputation was used.</population>

The wording of the letter was, “Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study regarding the use of acupressure bands to control chemotherapy-related nausea. The information you will provide is extremely valuable. It is only with the assistance of individuals, like you, who are willing to give their time that we can learn new ways to better control the side effects of cancer treatment. Wear the acupressure bands for up to five days, if helpful, to prevent or alleviate nausea. We are very appreciative of your contribution to this study.” Patients received an expectancy-neutral relaxation CD that was about 12 minutes in length and utilized guided imagery in which the individual visualized pleasant, soothing images or scenes while relaxed.</description>

Patients received an expectancy-enhancing handout to enhance expected acupressure band efficacy. It was printed on Cancer Center letterhead and signed by a medical oncologist and two of the study investigators. The handout presented a very positive (and truthful) interpretation of the data from two prior acupressure band studies. Patients also received a medical prescription instructing them to use the acupressure bands for relief of nausea. The prescription was signed by a medical oncologist and had the instruction, “Wear Seabands for up to five days as needed to prevent or alleviate nausea.” Patients’ names were not on the prescription.

        <description>Health-Related Quality of Life was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale – General (FACT–G). The FACT–G is a 28-item scale developed specifically for use in cancer clinical trials. Possible scores range from a low of 0 to a high of 112. Along with a total score representing HRQL, there are psychometrically validated subscales of physical, functional, social, and cognitive-emotional status. It has become one of the most commonly used measures in oncology, and we have used this scale in our previous studies.</description>
