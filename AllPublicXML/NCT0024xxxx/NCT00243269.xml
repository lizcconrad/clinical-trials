      This study hypothesizes that patients receiving efficacy enhancing information about the
      acupressure bands will expect less treatment-related nausea, which will subsequently result
      in less treatment-related nausea compared to patients who do not receive such information.

      This study extends prior research by utilizing a randomized controlled trial in a clinical
      environment to examine the efficacy of an intervention that is specifically designed to
      reduce patients' response expectancies concerning nausea development from cancer treatments,
      and, thereby, reduce nausea.

      The objectives of this study are as follow:

        1. To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
           expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management will result in reduced
           chemotherapy-induced nausea.

        2. To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
           expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management will result in increased
           health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.

      To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
      expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management is more effective than a single-tiered
      strategy in reducing chemotherapy- induced nausea.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Five-day Nausea Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Five days</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea was measured using a five-day patient report diary. Each day was divided into 4 sections: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. Patients reported severity of nausea for each period daily. Severity of nausea was assessed on a 7-point rating scale, anchored at one end by 1 = &quot;Not at all nauseated&quot; and at the other end by 7 = &quot;Extremely nauseated.&quot; The description &quot;Moderately nauseated&quot; was centered on the scale below the 4. Average Nausea was the mean severity for the 20 reporting periods.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Health-Related Quality of Life was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale - General (FACT-G). The FACT-G is a 28-item scale developed specifically for use in cancer clinical trials. Possible scores range from a low of 0 to a high of 112. Along with a total score representing HRQL, there are psychometrically validated subscales of physical, functional, social, and cognitive-emotional status. It has become one of the most commonly used measures in oncology, and we have used this scale in our previous studies.</description>

        <title>Five-day Nausea Diary</title>
        <description>Nausea was measured using a five-day patient report diary. Each day was divided into 4 sections: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. Patients reported severity of nausea for each period daily. Severity of nausea was assessed on a 7-point rating scale, anchored at one end by 1 = ‚ÄúNot at all nauseated&quot; and at the other end by 7 = &quot;Extremely nauseated.&quot; The description ‚ÄúModerately nauseated‚Äù was centered on the scale below the 4. Average Nausea was the mean severity for the 20 reporting periods.</description>
