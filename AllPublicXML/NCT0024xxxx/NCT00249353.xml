      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CONCERTA®
      (methylphenidate hydrochloride, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant) versus placebo for
      the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adolescents..

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CONCERTA®
      (methylphenidate hydrochloride) in the treatment of adolescents with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study with adolescents ages 13-18 diagnosed with ADHD. The study consists
      of four phases. The Screening Phase establishes the diagnosis of ADHD and provides a one-week
      washout period without any ADHD medication. The Open-Label Titration Phase initiates the
      treatment of patients with one CONCERTA® 18 mg daily. Thereafter, the dose is increased
      approximately every 7 days in 18 mg increments (to a maximum of 72 mg daily), until an
      individualized dose is identified, based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. During
      the Double-Blind Phase, subjects are randomized to receive either their individualized
      CONCERTA® dose or a placebo, for a period of 2 weeks. Subjects who successfully complete the
      Double-Blind Phase are eligible to receive CONCERTA® for an 8-week, Open-Label, Follow-up
      Phase. The primary efficacy measurement is the total score of the ADHD Rating Scale,
      evaluated by the investigator at the end of the Double-Blind Phase. Safety assessments
      include monitoring adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECG), blood pressure, pulse, height
      and weight throughout the course of the study. The study hypothesis is that CONCERTA® is more
      effective than placebo in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in
      adolescents, and is well tolerated.

      Titration Phase: CONCERTA® 18 mg taken orally, once daily, and increased approximately every
      7 days in 18 mg increments up to a maximum daily dose of 72 mg. Double-Blind Phase:
      Individualized dose of CONCERTA® or placebo for 2 weeks. Open-Label Phase: Individualized
      dose of CONCERTA® for 8 weeks.
