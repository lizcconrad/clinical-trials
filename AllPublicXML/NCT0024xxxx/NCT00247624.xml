      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment with both a sleeping pill
      and antidepressant medication in improving sleep and psychological functioning in people with
      depression and insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic insomnia is one of the most common symptoms that individuals experience during a
      major depressive episode. Insomnia may lead to increased risk for recurrence of major
      depression, as well as poor quality of life and increased risk of suicide. Studies have shown
      that treating insomnia during a major depressive episode may not only help reduce symptoms of
      major depression during the day, but also improve an individual's general quality of life.
      Thus, sleeping pills, also known as hypnotics, are commonly prescribed for people with
      psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of combining
      sleeping pills with antidepressant medications. This study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of treatment with both a sleeping pill and antidepressant medication in
      improving sleep and psychological functioning in people with depression and insomnia.

      Participants in this double-blind study will first receive fluoxetine, an antidepressant
      medication, for 1 week. Participants whose symptoms of insomnia subside after this initial
      week will continue on fluoxetine for the duration of the study and will not receive sleeping
      pills. Those who do not experience an improvement in their symptoms of insomnia after 1 week
      will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or eszopiclone, which is a sleeping pill,
      in addition to fluoxetine. All treatments will be given for 8 weeks. Participants will attend
      study visits at various points throughout the treatment phase. Follow up visits will occur
      periodically over the next 4 months. Assessments will include physiological measures during
      sleep, mood, suicidal thinking, quality of life and actigraphy, which measures the amount of
      movement during sleep.

    <description>The BASIS 32 psychometric includes several subscales, including &quot;daily living and role functioning&quot; (DLRF). These subscales are rated from 0-4, with higher scores indicating a greater deal of difficulty in this dimension and lower scores denoting better outcomes. Measured weekly for 9 weeks.

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score, range 0-28. Lower scores represent better outcomes. Total score categories: 0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 = Subthreshold insomnia, 15-21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe).</description>
