  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Ornish Program on cardiovascular
      disease as measured by the IMT of the common carotid artery, and to compare this effect to
      outcomes from patients participating in traditional cardiac rehabilitation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be accepted into the study if they demonstrate one or more of the following
        within the previous 12 months: a myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft
        surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stent placement, or rotoblator
        procedures. Patients will also accepted if they have stable angina as determined by the
        Rose Questionnaire or pacemaker associated with one or more of the previously mentioned
        diagnoses. For the purposes of this study, myocardial infarction is defined as the presence
        of at least two of the following three criteria: continuous chest pain lasting at least 30
        minutes; electrocardiogram changes expressing an evolving myocardial infarction (ST segment
        elevation or depression, evolving Q waves, or symmetric inversion of T waves); or elevated
        cardiac enzyme levels (at least twice the I levels).
