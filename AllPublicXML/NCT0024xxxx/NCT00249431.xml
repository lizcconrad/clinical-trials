  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathological gamblers often are also dependent on alcohol and clinically depressed.
      Sertraline (Zoloft) is currently used to treat depression, panic disorder, and
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. The purpose of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of
      sertraline used in combination with relapse prevention therapy in decreasing gambling
      behavior and alcohol consumption in individuals with a diagnosis of pathological gambling and
      alcohol abuse or dependence.

      Alcohol abuse and depression commonly occur in conjunction with pathological gambling.
      Sertraline (Zoloft) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) currently used to
      treat depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The purpose of this
      trial is to determine the effectiveness of sertraline combined with relapse prevention
      therapy in decreasing gambling behavior and alcohol abuse.

      Participants in this 10-week trial will be randomly assigned to receive either relapse
      prevention (RP) therapy and sertraline or RP therapy and a placebo. Participants will begin
      taking 25 mg of either sertraline or placebo in a single morning dose for one week. If, after
      one week, participants do not show improvement, the dose will increase to 50 mg per day
      during Week 2, and will increase by 50 mg per day every week thereafter to a maximal dose of
      200 mg per day.

      Weekly hour-long study visits will include a medication evaluation, RP therapy, and
      questionnaires. In addition, evaluations at baseline, Week 5, and Week 10 will include
      pathological gambling and depression ratings, urine drug screens, and biochemical measures of
      alcohol consumption and liver function. All other weekly study visits will include evaluation
      of side effects, an interview on alcohol use, measures related to obsessive-compulsive
      drinking, and assessments of vital signs and concomitant medications.
