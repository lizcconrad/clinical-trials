  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing impairment either clinical or subclinical is a characteristic of some renal disease
      patients. The hearing impairment could be result from specific etiologies or chronic renal
      failure itself. The causes of hearing impairment in renal disease patients ranged from drugs
      intoxication in both auditory and renal function, like gentamycin or isoniazid, congenital
      disease like Alport syndrome or other collagen-defective renal disease, or just aging
      related. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are special in many parts to general
      population who have hearing impairment. First, inflammation in ESRD patients is
      well-documented, second, they suffered from various underlying diseases which auditory
      function was potentially impaired, third, they need to undergo renal replacement therapy
      either hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) to maintain their life. Dialysis itself
      was found to be a cause of hearing impairment, too. The biochemical change and constitutive
      inflammation status are thought to be implicated in the pathogenesis of hearing impairment in
      ESRD patients. Aluminum (Al) is a well-documented heavy metal, which predisposes to
      Alzheimerâ€™s disease, dementia or some neurologic diseases. Al intoxication is very rare in
      general health population but elevated serum Al level is easily found in ESRD patients since
      they can not excrete Al by damaged kidneys and dialyzers. Inner ear per se is a neurologic
      tissue, so if serum Al level in ESRD patients has any association in their haring function
      needs to be studied.
