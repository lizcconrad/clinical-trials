  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic artery infusion (HAI) with oxaliplatin (OX), systemic 5 fluorouracil (5FU), and
      leucovorin (HAI/OX/FU) will be implemented using an interventional radiology technique to
      obviate the need for initial major surgery (catheter placement) in patients who have
      unresectable liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. The study goal is to reduce tumor size
      to make possible a complete resection of all lesions. Secondary goals are to reduce or
      eliminate the complexity usually associated with HAI, to accomplish most or all of the
      treatment as an outpatient, to reduce costs, and to avoid the hepatotoxicity associated with
      HAI/floxuridine (FUDR). Oxaliplatin has been selected because of its ease of use, known
      toxicology, and established efficacy in colorectal cancer.

      After entry qualification and registration patients will undergo hepatic artery
      catheterization via interventional radiology. The catheter will remain in place for two hours
      while oxaliplatin is infused and then be removed. This treatment will be followed by a 48
      hour infusion of 5FU and leucovorin, generally following the principle of FOLFOX 6. These
      cycles of therapy will be repeated biweekly for six episodes. Hepatic tumor size will be
      evaluated by CT scan to determine if resectability has been established as the result of
      tumor size reduction. If so, the patient will be offered resection of the residual lesions in
      an effort to achieve long term survival.
