    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the insulin-sensitizing medication
      rosiglitazone on attention and memory skills in older adults with mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). The study also will examine the effects of this medication on brain structures that
      support memory and other thinking abilities, and on biological markers associated with
      inflammation, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease.

      The study will examine the effects of the insulin-sensitizing agent rosiglitazone on learning
      and memory for 120 patients diagnosed with MCI. Participants will be randomized to an
      18-month trial of rosiglitazone or placebo, followed by a 2-month washout period. At
      screening and at treatment month 18, all participants will undergo an oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT) to estimate pre- and post- treatment insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function.
      Cognitive measures and blood samples for biochemical assays will be obtained at baseline,
      treatment months 6, 12, and 18, and washout (two months after completing treatment).

      During treatment, participants will have safety labs drawn and receive physical assessment of
      any adverse events, changes in health status, or changes in medication; initially these
      visits will be done at weeks 2 and 4, and then every three months. For months in which a
      safety visit is not scheduled, telephone monitoring to assess any health concerns will be
      conducted.

      All participants enrolled in the primary study will be approached to participate in an MRI
      substudy; patients will undergo serial brain MRI before treatment and following 18 months of
      rosiglitazone or placebo, using three-dimensional T1-weighted images. Comparison of MCI
      patients receiving rosiglitazone and placebo will be conducted to determine whether the rate
      of medial temporal lobe (MTL) and whole brain atrophy is altered following treatment.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MCI diagnosis: Participants will be diagnosed with MCI by consensus of a team of
             physicians and neuropsychologists experienced in the diagnosis of MCI, using the
             Petersen (Petersen, 1999, 2001) criteria for amnestic MCI or multiple domain MCI with
             amnestic features: a) the presence of subjective memory complaints, evaluated via
             detailed patient history and informant interview, b) objective verification of memory
             impairment as measured by neuropsychological tests, c) normal general cognitive
             function, d) intact or only mildly impaired activities of daily living, and e) absence
             of dementia per NINCDS/ADRDA and/or DSM-IV criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following exclusion criteria will be used, based on initial physical examination,
        medical history, lab work, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results:

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes or other relevant glucoregulatory disorders

          -  Use of any oral anti-diabetic compounds

          -  Clinically significant elevations in liver function

          -  Significant neurological disease that might affect cognition, other than MCI,
             including Alzheimer's disease, large-vessel stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple
             sclerosis, recent severe head injury (loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes
             in the past year), or remote head injury resulting in permanent cognitive or
             neurological sequelae

          -  History or current evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF)

             or CABG

          -  History of cardiac or vascular surgery, or significant arrhythmia within the last
             year; or planned major intervention such as cardiac surgery or stenting. A history of
             cardiac surgery for non-ischemic indications (i.e., valve repair or replacement)
             greater than one year prior to enrollment is not exclusionary if all other criteria
             are met

          -  Significant ECG abnormalities including heart rate less than 50 or greater than 100
             beats per minute (dependent upon the individual's general health); any previously
             unrecognized arrhythmia requiring further intervention

          -  Significant peripheral edema at the time of screening

          -  Significant medical illness or organ failure, including but not limited to renal
             disease, hepatic disease, and unstable cardiac disease

          -  Regular current use of antipsychotic, anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, or sedative
             medications; antidepressant medications are not exclusionary, provided the individual
             does not have current major depression

          -  A current diagnosis of major depression or other significant psychiatric comorbidity

          -  Clinically significant anemia at the time of screening

          -  Fasting triglyceride level greater than 400

          -  Fasting glucose 125 or greater, or two-hour glucose value greater than 199 during the
             OGTT; participants will be notified if their fasting blood sugar (monitored every 3
             months) exceeds 125, and they will be withdrawn from further participation if their
             fasting blood sugar exceeds 125 for two consecutive months

          -  For the MRI substudy, additional exclusion criteria include 1) previous exposure to
             work involving the cutting or grinding of metal, 2) the presence of a pacemaker,
             aneurysm clip, or other implanted metal device that would prohibit MRI procedures, and
             3) significant history of claustrophobia
