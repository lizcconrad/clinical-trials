      This study will gain information on methods of control of a prosthetic arm in stroke patients
      or traumatic brain inury patients through a technique called &quot;brain-computer interface&quot;
      (BCI). BCI allows for direct communication between man and machine. Brain cells communicate
      by producing electrical impulses that help to create such things as thoughts, memory,
      consciousness and emotions. In BCI, brain waves are recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG)
      through electrodes (small wires) attached to the scalp. The electrodes measure the electrical
      signals of the brain. These signals are sent to the computer, which translates them into
      device control commands as messages that reflect a person's intention. This type of brain
      activity comes from the sensorimotor areas of the brain and can be controlled through
      voluntarily training to control the hand prosthesis through the BCI.

      Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury more
      than 12 months ago and have paralysis in the right or left arm, hand or leg and who are
      between 18 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a
      clinical and neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI
      uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The scanner is a metal
      cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the procedure, the subject lies in the
      scanner for about 45 minutes, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur
      with the scanning.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Sessions 1-2: Participants are connected to an EEG machine and familiarized with the
           hand orthosis (training device used in the study) and the tasks required for the study.

        -  Sessions 3-4: Participants receive baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and
           fMRI. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed
           through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject may
           feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and there may be twitching in
           muscles of the face, arm or leg. The subject may be asked to tense certain muscles
           slightly or perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected
           with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms. fMRI is like a standard
           MRI (see above), except it is done while the patient performs tasks to learn about brain
           activity involved in those tasks.

        -  Sessions 5-8: Participants are asked to repetitively move their hand (patients'
           paralyzed hand; healthy volunteers' normal hand), tongue and leg in response to three
           sound tones. After ten trials, they are asked to imagine the same movements 50 to 100
           times while the EEG machine is recording brain activity.

        -  Sessions 9-14: Participants are trained in controlling the hand orthosis. The subject's
           hand is attached to the orthosis and asked to imagine that they are performing finger or
           hand movements. This continues until there is an 80-90 percent success rate in achieving
           hand movement.

        -  Sessions 15-16: Participants repeat TMS and fMRI for comparison before and after
           training with the hand orthosis.

        -  Sessions 17-28: Participants receive additional training with the hand orthosis device
           (as in sessions 5-8), focusing only on the hand and not other parts of the body.

        -  Sessions 29-30: Participants undergo repeat TMS and fMRI to compare with the effect
           following additional training with the hand orthosis.

        -  Sessions 31-32: Optional makeup sessions if needed because of scheduling problems.

      Participants are evaluated in the clinic after 3 months to see if they have benefited from
      the study.

      Objective: Individuals who have suffered a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) may benefit
      from the development of new rehabilitative interventions that can improve motor recovery
      after injury. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that oscillatory brain
      activity that originates in the affected hemisphere in the form of desynchronization of
      Mu-rhythm of patients with chronic stroke or TBI can be used to drive movements of an
      orthosis attached to a paralyzed hand through a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Mu-rhythm is
      a type of brain wave activity that originates in the sensorimotor areas of the brain that can
      be controlled voluntarily; it is present in the affected hemisphere of stroke patients and
      can be used to control the hand prostheses through the BCI interface. Control of Mu-rhythm
      amplitudes by volition requires training since it does not happen spontaneously. A
      proof-of-principle sub-experiment will test the hypothesis that in stroke survivors
      non-invasive cortical stimulation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) will
      facilitate learning to control a hand orthosis through a BCI device. This is the purpose of
      the training: to teach the subject to control Mu-rhythms.

      Study population: The study population will consist of individuals with chronic stroke or TBI
      that have virtually no movement of their paretic hand and age- and gender- matched healthy
      volunteers. Healthy volunteers, which may include the age- and gender- matched volunteers,
      will be recruited to refine instructions given to patients.

      Design: This is primarily an intraindividual comparison study, designed to determine if this
      brain-computer interface (BCI) approach contributes to drive grasping motions through a BCI
      interface and hand-orthosis. To test the effect of non-invasive cortical stimulation 21
      stroke patients will be randomly assigned to three groups (group A, anodal stimulation; group
      B, cathodal stimulation; group C, sham stimulation). Study of normal volunteers will
      contribute to (a) set up of the experiment, (b) identifying differences in the training time
      required to modulate Mu-rhythm in healthy volunteers and patients and (c) to isolate training
      effects as measured by TMS and fMRI on the healthy brain from training effects on brains
      affected with stroke or TBI. This information will be treated descriptively within the
      framework of this protocol but it is also important for designing future studies.

      Outcome measures: Behavioral endpoint measure: ability to drive the paralyzed hand orthosis
      in flexion and extension motions using Mu-rhythm. Physiological endpoint measures: peak fMRI
      activity in the hand knob representation, and corticomotor excitability as tested with TMS
      and MEG in ipsilesional and contralesional hand knob representations. Normal volunteers will
      undergo evaluation of the same physiological endpoint measures as patients.
