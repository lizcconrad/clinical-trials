      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and radiation therapy
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate
      mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine together with total-body
      irradiation works in treating patients who are undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for
      metastatic kidney cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of nonmyeloablative conditioning comprising fludarabine and
           total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
           in terms of 6-month and 12-month response rate, in patients with unresectable metastatic
           renal cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2
           and total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT): After TBI, patients undergo
           AHSCT on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppression: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 56
           followed by a taper until day 81. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice
           daily on days 0-27 (if patient has a related donor) OR three times daily on days 0-29
           and then twice daily on days 30-149 followed by additional tapering until day 180 (if
           patient has an unrelated donor).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
