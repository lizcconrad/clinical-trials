  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of rosuvastatin (up-titrated to a dose of
      40mg/day) compared to placebo on cardiac remodelling, estimated by change in left ventricular
      ejection fraction on radionuclide ventriculography, at 26 weeks post randomisation from
      baseline.
