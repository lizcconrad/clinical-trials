  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore and identify the effects of acetylcysteine, a common
      mucolytic with anti-oxidant property, on alleviating the damage caused by increased oxidative
      stress in hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress in patients with renal failure is higher than in healthy controls. Once
      undergoing hemodialysis (HD) therapy, patients with end-stage renal disease even have more
      oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) denature the vital molecules, such as lipids,
      proteins, and nucleic acids.

      Increased ROS produce oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL), which, in turn, induce
      atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading
      cause of death of HD patients. On the other hand, ROS damage RBC membrane and cause
      hemolysis. Hemolysis exaggerates uremic anemia and results in resistance to erythropoietin
      (EPO) therapy.

      Acetylcysteine, a common mucolytic, is an antioxidant as well. In vivo experiments,
      acetylcysteine has been demonstrated to inhibit the production of ox-LDL by ROS.
      Acetylcysteine has also been shown as an effective drug for prevention of contrast
      media-induced nephropathy in high-risk patients.

      Thus we hypothesize HD patients taking acetylcysteine may have less ox-LDL produced by ROS
      and, consequently, lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, having less damage to RBC
      membrane by ROS, HD patients taking acetylcysteine may have milder anemia and better
      responsiveness to erythropoietin therapy. Therefore, we plan to conduct a prospective trial,
      in which acetylcysteine is administrated to the enrolled HD patients for three months. The
      primary goals of the study are to realize the changes of 1) plasma ox-LDL levels, 2) the
      anemia status, 3) the responsiveness to EPO therapy, and 4) severity of atherosclerosis. The
      secondary goals are to identify the changes of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status
      in the patients.
