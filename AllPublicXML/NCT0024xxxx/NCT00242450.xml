  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the first 7 days of life very small babies will receive the drug metoclopramide or a
      salt solution through an intravenous line. They will also begin to receive a very small
      amount of breast milk or formula within the first 72 hours of life, in addition toother
      nourishment that is provided by an intravenous line, according to standard hospital
      procedure. We think that the babies who receive the medication may reach full oral feeds than
      babies who receive the salt solution.

      Clinically stable, premature babies (birth weight between 500 and 1,250g) will be randomized
      to receive metoclopramide (0.1 mg/kg IV q8h)or an equal volume of placebo for 7 days.A
      transition feeding schedule will begin within the first 72 hours of life. The time to full
      feeds for the 2 groups will be analyzed.
