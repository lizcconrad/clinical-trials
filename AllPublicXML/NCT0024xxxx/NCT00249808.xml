    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIIb/IV, open label, multicentre study of efalizumab (anti cluster of
      differentiation [CD] 11a recombinant human monoclonal antibody) in participants with moderate
      to severe plaque psoriasis who have failed to respond to, have a contraindication to, or are
      intolerant to other systemic therapies including ciclosporin, methotrexate, and psoralen and
      ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Ratings of Good or Better (FT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA assesses the global response of all psoriatic lesions to therapy by comparing the participant's present condition to baseline. PGA response includes: Cleared (100 percent [%] improvement; remission of all clinical signs and symptoms, except for residual manifestations such as mild erythema); Excellent (75% to 99% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms, except for residual manifestations such as mild erythema); Good (50% to 74% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms); Fair (25% to 49% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms); Slight (1% to 24% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms); Unchanged (clinical signs and symptoms unchanged); Worse (clinical signs and symptoms deteriorated). Percentage of participants with PGA ratings of Good or Better (i.e, Good, Excellent or Cleared) are reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Rebound</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks after end of FT (up to Week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>Rebound was defined as worsening of disease as assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score &gt;125% of baseline or new pustular, erythrodermic, or more inflammatory psoriasis occurring within 2 months of stopping therapy. PASI is an instrument used to assess the extent of cutaneous psoriasis and to measure the effects of therapy. The PASI divides the body into four anatomical regions: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. For each region, the evaluator assesses the severity of erythema, induration/thickness and scaling and determines the percentage of the region affected by disease. A numerical PASI score is derived that evaluates the severity of symptoms in terms of the total body surface area affected. Total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Exacerbation</measure>
    <time_frame>During study (40 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Exacerbation was defined as disease worsening either during or after treatment which was more inflammatory in nature compared to baseline and occurred either within pre-existing plaques, at previously uninvolved sites, or as new morphologies of disease.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis participants who have failed to respond to, or who
             have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including
             cyclosporine, methotrexate and PUVA

          -  Age at least 18 years

          -  For women of childbearing potential and for men whose partner can become pregnant, use
             of an acceptable method of contraception to prevent pregnancy and agreement to
             continue to practice an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of their
             participation in the study and up to 3 months after the last dose of efalizumab

          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any study-related procedure not part of
             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the
             participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          -  Discontinuation of any systemic psoriasis treatment prior to commencement of the study
             drug. No washout period is required for these agents prior to starting study and
             receiving first dose of study drug (efalizumab)

             receiving first dose of study drug (efalizumab)

          -  Discontinuation of any investigational drug or treatment 3 months prior to Study Day 0
             or as per washout requirements from previous protocol

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) Ratings of Good or Better (FT)</title>
          <description>The PGA assesses the global response of all psoriatic lesions to therapy by comparing the participant’s present condition to baseline. PGA response includes: Cleared (100 percent [%] improvement; remission of all clinical signs and symptoms, except for residual manifestations such as mild erythema); Excellent (75% to 99% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms, except for residual manifestations such as mild erythema); Good (50% to 74% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms); Fair (25% to 49% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms); Slight (1% to 24% improvement of all clinical signs and symptoms); Unchanged (clinical signs and symptoms unchanged); Worse (clinical signs and symptoms deteriorated). Percentage of participants with PGA ratings of Good or Better (i.e, Good, Excellent or Cleared) are reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Rebound</title>
        <description>Rebound was defined as worsening of disease as assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score &gt;125% of baseline or new pustular, erythrodermic, or more inflammatory psoriasis occurring within 2 months of stopping therapy. PASI is an instrument used to assess the extent of cutaneous psoriasis and to measure the effects of therapy. The PASI divides the body into four anatomical regions: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. For each region, the evaluator assesses the severity of erythema, induration/thickness and scaling and determines the percentage of the region affected by disease. A numerical PASI score is derived that evaluates the severity of symptoms in terms of the total body surface area affected. Total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
