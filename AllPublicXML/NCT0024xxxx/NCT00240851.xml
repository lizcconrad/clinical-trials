    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the effectiveness and
      safety of acetaminophen and placebo in treating muscle aching and pain (soreness) that occurs
      in subjects who complete a marathon. Subjects are randomized to receive acetaminophen
      extended release caplets, 3900 mg/day (two 650 mg caplets taken three times a day, for four
      days) or placebo (two placebo caplets taken three times a day, for four days). The primary
      measurement of efficacy is the average change from baseline in muscle soreness, on Day 1, the
      day of the marathon. Safety assessments consist of monitoring adverse events, and a physical
      examination at the screening visit, including vital signs, weight, a medical history review,
      and a urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. The hypothesis of the study
      is that acetaminophen is more effective than placebo in the relief of post-race muscle aching
      and pain (soreness) score on the evening of the race. Two acetaminophen 650 mg extended
      release caplets, taken by mouth, three times a day over a four day period or two placebo
      caplets, taken by mouth, three times a day over a four day period.
