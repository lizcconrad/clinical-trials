  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see what impact having a Lifeport device has on quality of life
      for children with sickle cell who are getting chronic transfusions, from the child's
      perspective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of research that focuses specifically on quality of life (QoL) among
      patients with sickle cell. This study aims to explore the QoL of children who are receiving
      chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) using a Lifeport device, which allows them to undergo
      erythrocytapheresis, rather than standard transfusion therapy. Erythrocytapheresis is less
      time consuming and is associated with less iron overload than conventional transfusion
      therapy; however, little is known about the implications for the child's QoL. This study will
      explore QoL from the child's perspective.
