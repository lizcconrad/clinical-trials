      A study to evaluate the use of a vaporization system as a smokeless delivery system for
      inhaled marijuana.

      Our primary objective is to evaluate the use of a vaporization system ( the Volcano) as a
      smokeless delivery system for inhaled marijuana. We will compare plasma levels of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol, cannabidiol, and metabolites, including
      11-OH-THC, in healthy volunteers after smoking ~400 mg each of approximately 1.8, 3.5, and 7%
      THC marijuana cigarettes (using the Foltin puff procedure) to those obtained when the same
      individuals inhale the vaporization product of the rest of the marijuana from the identical
      cigarette processed through the Volcano device. In addition to plasma levels, we will also
      compare the THC concentrations over an 8-hour time period, the subjective high experienced by
      the patients, and clinical evidence of cannabis effect by evaluating conjunctival hyperemia
      and heart rate. We will also compare the tolerability of the two methods of ingestion, and we
      will monitor expired carbon monoxide to evaluate whether the vaporizer reduces exposure to
      respiratory toxins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21-45 years Current history use of marijuana. Subjects must have smoked marijuana
             within the past 30 days but an amount totaling less than 10 marijuana cigarettes or
             the equivalent.

        All men and women in this study must agree to use adequate birth control during the study.
        Acceptable barrier birth control methods are a male condom, female condom, diaphragm, or
        intra-uterine (IUD).

        All women of reproductive potential (who have not reached menopause or undergone
        hysterectomy, oophorectomy,or tubal ligation) must have a negative urine B-HCG pregnancy
        test performed 48 hours before initiating the protocol-specified medication.

        Able to understand and follow the instructions of the investigator and research personnel.

        Able and willing to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac ventricular
             conduction abnormalities, or orthostatic mean blood pressure drop greater than
             24mm/Hg, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

        History of renal or hepatic failure. Evidence of hepatic, hematological or renal
        dysfunction based on judgement of physician.

        Active substance abuse. Marijuana dependence as defined in DSM-IV code#304.30. Any
        psychiatric dysfunction that would, in the opinion of the study investigator, interfere
        with a participant's ability to comply with the study protocol.

        Use of tobacco within the past 30 days. Subjects taking medications which may be vulnerable
        to drug-drug interactions such as those metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.

        Blood donation in the past 30 days. Use of smoked marijuana within 48 hours of GCRC
        admission. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding may not take part in this study. Unable
        to read or speak English.
