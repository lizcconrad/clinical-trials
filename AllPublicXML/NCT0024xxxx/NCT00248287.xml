        NOTE: Ascites, pleural effusion, and bone metastases are not considered measurable.

             inclusion to the study.

          -  Any prior radiation therapy has been completed &gt; 2 weeks prior to the start of study
             treatment

        NOTE: Previously irradiated lesions will not be evaluable; however, these patients will
        still be eligible. Patients must have at least 1 measurable lesion at baseline.

          -  Has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration (female
             patients of childbearing potential). A pregnancy test is also required within 7 days
             of Dose 1.

          -  If fertile, patient (male or female) has agreed to use an acceptable method of birth
             control to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a period of 6 months
             thereafter.

          -  Has signed a Patient Authorization Form (HIPAA)

          -  Has paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue (either paraffin blocks or 20 unstained
             slides) available for analysis of EGFR, cytokeratin, and other biological markers.
             These samples will be sent to the Molecular Profiling Institute (MPI; see Appendix
             VII).

        NOTE: Availability of samples should be confirmed prior to randomization (at latest, prior
        to first dose).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Has Stage I-III breast cancer or nonmeasurable metastatic breast cancer, or any

             other investigational agent(s)

          -  Has received prior therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway.
             Prior Herceptin is required for HER2+ patients.

          -  Has had prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody

          -  Has received organ allograft(s) other than corneal, bone, or skin

             treatment of CNS metastases must have been discontinued for greater than 4 weeks prior
             to study enrollment.

          -  Has any other significant comorbidity that, in the opinion of the clinical
