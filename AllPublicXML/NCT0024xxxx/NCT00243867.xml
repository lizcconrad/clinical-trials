      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the survival of patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with weekly Taxoprexin in combination with
      carboplatin to those treated with paclitaxel plus carboplatin in a prospectively randomized
      trial. In addition, the response rate to each regimen, response duration, time to progression
      and time to treatment failure will be measured. Toxicity will be evaluated and compared
      between the two groups.

      This is a randomized, multicenter, Phase III open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® in
      combination with every three (3) week carboplatin compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin
      every three (3) weeks, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
      not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease. Patients may have been previously treated
      with immunological agents. Patients will be randomized to receive Taxoprexin® at a dose of
      400 mg/m2 intravenously by one (1)-hour weekly infusion, 5/6 weeks followed immediately by
      carboplatin AUC = 4 on weeks one (1) and four (4) as a 30 minute intravenous infusion or
      paclitaxel 225mg/m2 as a three (3) hour intravenous infusion followed immediately by
      carboplatin AUC = 6 as a 30 minute intravenous infusion, every three (3) weeks. Patients will
      receive Taxoprexin® and carboplatin infusions or paclitaxel and carboplatin infusions until
      progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, completion of six (6) treatment cycles of
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin or three (3) treatment cycles of Taxoprexin® plus carboplatin,
      refusal of continued treatment by the patient, or Investigator decision.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.
             At the time of study entry, patients must have locally advanced (stage IIIb) or
