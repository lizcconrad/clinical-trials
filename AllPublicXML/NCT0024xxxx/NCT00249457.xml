      The purpose of this study is to determine whether long-term exposure to the Therapeutic
      Workplace intervention could sustain drug abstinence over an extended period of time in
      heroin- and cocaine-dependent, unemployed, treatment-resistant young mothers.

      The current study is a continuation of the research into the development and evaluation of a
      novel treatment designed to address the chronic, persistent nature of drug addiction. This
      treatment, called the Therapeutic Workplace, integrates abstinence reinforcement
      contingencies of proven efficacy into a model supported work program. Participants were paid
      to work or to train in the Therapeutic Workplace but had to provide drug-free urine samples
      to gain daily access. Forty participants were randomly assigned to a Therapeutic Workplace or
      usual care control group. Therapeutic Workplace participants could work for about 5 years.
      This study reports the effects of the intervention over a follow-up period of 8 years after
      treatment initiation.
