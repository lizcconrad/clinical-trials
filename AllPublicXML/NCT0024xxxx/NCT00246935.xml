  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this long-term study is to investigate the effect of roflumilast (APTA-2217) on
      the long-term safety in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who
      completed the 24-week evaluation of study APTA-2217-06. Roflumilast will be administered
      orally once daily. The present study consists of a 28 weeks treatment period, and is an
      extension of the 24-week study APTA-2217-06 (registered study). The study will provide
      further long-term safety and efficacy data of roflumilast.
