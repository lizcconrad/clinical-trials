      This study is being conducted to validate various biomarkers in patients with RA with varying
      levels of disease severity. Subjects with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will be
      included as controls. The sudy will measure the baseline levels and the intra- and
      inter-subject variability of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in patients with inactive/mild and
      moderate/severe RA on stable therapy or during a course glucocorticoids. In addition exhaled
      NO levels will be correlated with intra-articular inflammation (power Doppler
      ultrasonography) as well as markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, ESR).
