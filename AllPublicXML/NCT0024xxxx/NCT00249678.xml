  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is...to assess whether placing a substance abuse intervention for
      HIV+ methamphetamine users within an HIV medical care setting improves rates of follow-up on
      referral to treatment by primary care physicians; reduces drug use and sexual risk behaviors
      more than treatment-as-usual; and increases rates of adherence to HIV medication regimens.
