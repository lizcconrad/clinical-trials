  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the efficacy of providing primary care physicians and their patients
      with computer-tailored information, based on patients' responses to survey questions. The
      health education messages are designed to encourage patients to become physically active and
      to encourage physicians to counsel their patients about exercise.

      The main objective of this study is to determine, via a 6-month randomized controlled study,
      the efficacy of providing tailored physical activity computer reports to patients and
      physicians. The primary outcome is minutes of physical activity measured by the 7-Day
      Physical Activity Recall interview at 6 months. The intervention group completed physical
      activity surveys at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Based on their responses, participants
      received four feedback reports at each time point. The reports aimed to motivate participants
      to increase physical activity, personalized to participants' needs; they also included an
      activity prescription. The control group received identical procedures, except that they
      received general reports on preventive screening based on their responses to preventive
      screening questions.

    <description>Minutes of physical activity measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (7-Day PAR), which is an interviewer-administered self-report physical activity measure of minutes spent in moderate and vigorous intensity leisure and non-leisure activities over the preceding 7 days. It was administered to study participants at baseline and 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavioral Processes of Change Between Baseline and 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral processes were assessed by asking participants to rate their responses to 24 statements on a Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = repeatedly) to statements such as, &quot;I tell myself I am able to be physically active if I want to. To create the overall measure, individual items are averaged. Higher numbers represent greater use of behavioral processes of change, so that the overall scale retains a maximum of 5.0 and minimum value of 1.0. The scale values are not numerical, they represent scores on the scale, where 5=repeatedly and 1=never.</description>

        <title>Change in Behavioral Processes of Change Between Baseline and 6 Months</title>
        <description>Behavioral processes were assessed by asking participants to rate their responses to 24 statements on a Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = repeatedly) to statements such as, &quot;I tell myself I am able to be physically active if I want to. To create the overall measure, individual items are averaged. Higher numbers represent greater use of behavioral processes of change, so that the overall scale retains a maximum of 5.0 and minimum value of 1.0. The scale values are not numerical, they represent scores on the scale, where 5=repeatedly and 1=never.</description>
