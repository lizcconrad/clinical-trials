  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of using rhBMP-2/CPM in OWO as a surgical model for pharmacodynamic
      studies, with assessment of the following parameters:

        -  Injecting the desired volume of rhBMP-2/CPM within the defect

        -  Conducting longitudinal radiographic absorptiometry of the tibial defect in the presence
           of rhBMP-2/CPM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 45 to 70 years of age

          -  Within 96 hours prior to dosing, the subject underwent a successful open wedge tibial
             osteotomy to correct medial compartment OA of the knee.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (hospital acceptable test), upon hospitalization for OWO and agree to use medically
             approved contraception for the duration of the study.

        Other inclusion applies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with pre-existing conditions of the knee or tibia that would confound an
             interpretation of results.

          -  Subjects for whom surgery in the opposite knee is planned during the 6 months of
             follow-up.

          -  Subjects with a history of malignancy or radiotherapy or chemotherapy for malignancy
             within the past 5 years, except subjects with a history of basal skin carcinoma.

        Other exclusion applies.
