  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary observations suggest positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with an F-18
      labeled thymidine analog (FLT) can selectively identify proliferating and non-proliferating
      tissues, including tumors. FLT uptake in the tumor appears to reflect the level of cells
      undergoing DNA synthesis. This is clinically important because cell proliferation markers
      have significant prognostic value, both prior to initiating radiotherapy and as they change
      during the course of therapy. In the proposed study, the researchers assess the
      biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of FLT to obtain the necessary data to file an
      Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
      information collected under Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) approval will not be
      used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical
      management of the subject.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 40,000 new cases of head and neck cancer each year in the United
      States. Worldwide more than 500,000 individuals will develop head and neck cancer each year,
      ranking as the sixth most common cancer. These cancers are predominately squamous cell
      cancers. Approximately two thirds of subjects will present with locally advanced disease with
      either large disease at the primary site and/or spread to regional lymph node levels.

      Despite aggressive treatment, 5-year survival remains poor (overall, approximately 50%). The
      major site of treatment failure is within the head and neck region, with distant metastases
      occurring in approximately 25% of subjects and usually after local and/or regional (nodal)
      failure.

      Current treatment options for locally advanced head and neck cancer include combinations of
      surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It is currently difficult to predict which
      combination will be best suited for any particular individual. Rapid methods of assessing the
      response of subjects to chemo-radiotherapy would be a useful tool, as it would permit the
      oncologist to change therapies, either in type or degree, in cases when the subject does not
      respond to the initial therapy regimen. Current best methods of evaluating tumor response are
      either serial CT examinations, so that changes in tumor size can be estimated or a
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) study in which changes in the
      metabolic status of the tumor are evaluated. Unfortunately, the anatomic information afforded
      by CT examinations often require months after treatment to allow the full effects of therapy
      to take place. Even after this time, the metabolic activity of any remaining tissue is nearly
      impossible to assess by CT scan, making it difficult to distinguish between fibrosis and
      viable tissue. Generally the FDG studies require 3-4 weeks after the end of the therapeutic
      regime before the relevant information is available, with more reliable information obtained
      at 3-4 months after treatment.

      It is predictable that the most immediate signal of an anti-tumor therapeutic regime that has
      been successful is that the tumor cells will stop dividing (proliferating) after the therapy
      is initiated. Therefore, a tracer which is taken up into and retained in cells as a function
      of their proliferative activity should provide rapid information as to the effectiveness of
      the treatment. It is the objective of this study to determine the biodistribution and
      radiation dosimetry of tracer F-18 3`-deoxy-3`-fluorothymidine. This distribution data is
      essential before an Investigational New Drug (IND) application can be filed with the FDA that
      would allow the use of this tracer in clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          2. Subject must have histologically confirmed stage III, or IV squamous cell carcinoma of
             the head and neck whose primary origin was from the oral cavity, oropharynx,
             hypopharynx, or larynx. Carcinoma must be staged using the American Joint Committee on
             Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria version 6. Adequate tumor must be amenable to biopsy
             via outpatient methods, therefore the majority of subjects will be those with
             oropharyngeal lesions.

          3. Subjects must be scheduled to receive combined chemo-radiotherapy treatment for their
             standard cancer care. Treatment decisions will be made by the treating
             otolaryngologist, radiation, and medical oncologists.

          4. Males or females greater than or equal to 21 years of age. Squamous cell cancer of the
             head and neck is exceedingly rare in children and not generally applicable to the
             pediatric population.

          5. Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60% at time of screening.

          6. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          7. Subject must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/microL

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of
                  normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits

               -  BUN within normal institutional limits

               -  PT and PTT &lt; 2.0 X upper normal limits

          8. The effects of FLT on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. A screening urine hCG will be administered to women of childbearing
             potential before each FLT scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Subject may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Subject with a Karnofsky score below 60.

          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. FLT PET has the potential for teratogenic
             effects. Because there are potentially unknown risks for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FLT, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is imaged with FLT and may not resume for 48 hours after
             the FLT imaging.

          5. Subject with an inadequate marrow reserve as determined by history and/or the above
             tests.

          6. Subject with a bleeding or clotting dysfunction as determined by medical history and
             above tests.

          7. Subjects taking nucleoside analog medications such as those used as antiretroviral
             agents.

          8. Inadequate tumor volume to allow for 2 biopsies.
