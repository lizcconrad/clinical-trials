      The objective of this trial is to demonstrate clinical efficacy of four different dosages of
      SPM 962 1.125 mg, 2.25 mg, 4.5 mg and 6.75 mg (corresponding to 2.5 cm2, 5 cm2, 10 cm2 and 15
      cm2 patch size respectively) in RLS subjects. It is anticipated that rotigotine (SPM 936)
      will be more effective than placebo. The tolerability and safety of rotigotine will be
      assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Idiopathic Restless Leg Syndrome

          -  Subject has responded previously, according to medical history information, to L-Dopa
             therapy and/or treatment with a dopamine agonist, if pre-treated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary restless legs syndrome due to, e.g., renal insufficiency (uremia), iron
             deficiency anemia, rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Secondary restless legs syndrome associated with previous or concomitant therapy with
             dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, butyrophenones, metoclopramid, atypical
             antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine), tri- and tetracyclic antide-pressants, mianserine,
             lithium or H2-blockers (e.g., cimetidine), or due to withdrawal from drugs such as
             anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, barbitur-ates, and other hypnotics.

          -  History of sleep disturbances like sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy, myoclonus
             epilepsy observed during polysomnography (PSG) or explored in subject history.

          -  Clinically relevant cardiac dysfunction and/or arrhythmias (e.g., suspected conduction
             system dysregulations, second or third degree AV block, complete left or right bundle
             branch block, sick-sinus-syndrome, congestive heart failure Class III or IV by NYHA,
             myocardial infarction within twelve months prior to enrollment).

          -  Clinically relevant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl)

          -  Clinically relevant hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dl or ALT and/or AST
             greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range).

          -  QTc-interval in resting ECG &gt; 450 msec in males and &gt; 470 msec in females.

          -  History of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension within 28 days prior to screening visit
             (Visit 1), or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 105mmHg at trial entry.
