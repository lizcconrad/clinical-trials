  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male and female patients aged â‰¥ 30 years with advanced stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease,
      not well controlled on existing levodopa will take part in a research study at approximately
      82 sites in Europe, Israel, South Africa, Australia and new Zealand.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the
      rotigotine patch (SPM 962) at an individual patient's optimal dose for a period of 4 months

      Each patient who qualifies and chooses to participate in the study will receive either
      rotigotine, pramipexole, or placebo at gradually increasing doses over a period of up to 7
      weeks, and then maintain their optimal dose for 4 months.

      The study clinic visits will include a medical history and physical exam, ECG, blood and
      urine sample collection, completion of various questionnaires, and completion of a diary to
      record the severity of their Parkinson's symptoms.

      Patients who complete the study may enroll in an extension trial and receive active study
      drug.
