  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis : it is known that the stent must be well opened out in order to avoid restenosis
      into the stent. Intra coronary pressure would allow the stent to be well deployed and so the
      restenose into the stent should diminish.

      Primary purpose : this study intend to test the hypothesis of optimal spreading of coronary
      stent guided with pressure into coronary arteritis comparing 2 strategies with patients
      having a coronary procedure with stent, excluded patients with myocardial infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized study, intending to treat, comparing the optimisation of the opening out
      of a stent into a coronar artery either guided with angiographic images only or with the
      assistance of pressure measurements plus angiographic control.

      Several French centers participate to demonstrate superiority of one strategy. The criterion
      of principal judgement is the whole of cardiac events, criterion made up with the cardiac
      death, myocardial infarction, revascularisation by coronary bridging and/or angioplasty and
      positivity of the effort test.

      Secondary criterions are :

        -  comparing cost to efficacy of the two strategies

        -  evaluating the angiographic restenosis into an under group of 200 patients (100 patients
           into each group)

        -  determining the optimal threshold of measurement of intra coronary pressure in a
           multicentric population

        -  comparing the ability of the different stents used to optimised the intra coronary
           pressure measurements
