  <brief_title>Study Comparing Acne in Patients Taking Oral Minocycline to Patients Taking Minocycline Plus Topical Tretinoin</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized Study to Compare the Acne Relapse Rate After a 3-mo Course of Oral Minocycline, to a 3-mo Course of Oral Minocycline in Combination With a Daily Dose of Topical Tretinoin 0.01% Followed by 3 mo of Topical Tretinoin Alone</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of oral antibiotics alone to treat inflammatory acne provides little to no long term
      therapeutic benefit.

      Acne relapse rates can be reduced by using topical tretinoin 0.01% in conjunction with
      minocycline, thereby increasing the therapeutic effect of the oral antibiotic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although oral antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment of inflammatory acne for 30
      years, studies comparing their efficacy have little scientific value.

      Evidence-based dermatology proves minocycline to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris
      while the patient remains on the medication; however, the relapse rate of acne after a course
      of antibiotics has never been established.

      The relapse rate would appear to be significant, as repeated courses and long-term antibiotic
      use are commonly prescribed in practice. The increasing problem of drug resistance has raised
      issues of the suitability of such long term antibiotic treatment and this overuse is probably
      a contributing factor of multiple drug resistance in our society.
