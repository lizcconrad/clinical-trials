  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to localise brain regions involved in objects recognition, in
      planification and adjustment of grasping, in prehension with and without eye control. The
      study is conducted in normal and autistic adults. We hypothesize different activations in
      these two populations.
