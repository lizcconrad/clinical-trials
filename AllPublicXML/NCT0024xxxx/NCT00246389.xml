  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cyclobenzaprine HCl
      5 mg (muscle spasm medication) taken three times a day, alone or in combination with
      ibuprofen 400 mg or 800 mg (pain relief medication) taken three times a day, for the
      treatment of back or neck muscle pain with muscle spasm.

      The objective of this multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, one-week study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cyclobenzaprine HCl 5 mg three times a day for
      one week, alone or in combination with ibuprofen 400 mg or 800 mg taken three times a day,
      for acute back or neck muscle pain with muscle spasm. The primary measurement of efficacy is
      the subject-rated global impression of change after seven days of treatment, compared to
      baseline. Safety assessments during the study include the monitoring of adverse events, and a
      physical examination, assessment of vital signs and medical history of any present illnesses
      conducted during the baseline visit. The study hypothesis is that there will not be a
      statistically significant difference in patient ratings of global impression of change,
      muscle spasm, muscle pain, medication helpfulness, and functional ability, between the
      cyclobenzaprine HCl monotherapy group versus the cyclobenzaprine HCl/ibuprofen 400 mg and
      cyclobenzaprine HCl/ibuprofen 800 mg groups, for the treatment for acute back or neck muscle
      pain with spasm. Patients receive cyclobenzaprine HCl 5 mg administered orally three times a
      day for one week, or cyclobenzaprine HCl 5 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg administered orally three
      times a day for one week, or cyclobenzaprine HCl 5 mg with ibuprofen 800 mg administered
      orally three times a day for one week.
