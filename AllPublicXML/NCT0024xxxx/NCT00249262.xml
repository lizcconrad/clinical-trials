      To evaluate objective response rate and duration of response to weekly Taxoprexin®.

      To evaluate the safety profile of weekly Taxoprexin® in this patient population.

      To evaluate overall survival in the same patient population. To evaluate time to disease
      progression, and the time to treatment failure in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma

      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with
      metastatic malignant melanoma who have not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease.
      Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents including IL-2 and
      vaccines. Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of 500mg/m2 intravenously by
      1-hour infusion weekly for the first five weeks of a six week cycle. Treatment will continue
      until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, refusal of continued treatment by patient
      or Investigator decision.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have malignant skin/mucosal (non-choroidal) melanoma, and documented
             metastatic disease.

          2. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion.

          3. Patients must not have received prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
             Prior treatment with immunotherapy or vaccine therapy is allowed.

          4. At least 6 weeks (42 days) since any prior immunotherapy, cytokine, biologic, vaccine
             or other therapy.

          5. At least 4 weeks (28 days) since prior radiotherapy to &gt; 20% of the bone marrow and
             prior adjuvant chemotherapy.

          6. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.

          7. Patients must be &gt; 13 years of age. The safety of Taxoprexin has not been adequately
             studied in younger patients.

          8. Patients must have adequate liver and renal function.

          9. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function.

         10. Life expatancy of at least 3 months

         11. Patients must sign an informed consent form indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study and in keeping with the policies of the
             institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received prior therapy with any taxane.

          2. Patients whose primary site was the choroid (eye).

          3. Patients who have a past or current history of neoplasm other than the entry
             diagnosis, except for curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or other cancers treated for cure and with a disease-free survival
             longer than 5 years.

          4. Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis (es).

          5. Patients who are pregnant or nursing and patients who are not practicing an acceptable
