  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the transition of offenders with both mental illness
      and chemical abuse (MICA) disorders from prison to the community, where continued treatment
      is generally considered necessary to sustain gains made by prison treatment, and to achieve
      successful outcomes. The project will determine the effectiveness of a modified therapeutic
      community (Re-Entry MTC) approach as compared to the case management and parole supervision
      currently provided. The study will also assess the relative impact on treatment outcomes of
      the type of treatment received while in prison and of the progress achieved in re-entry
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Offenders having both mental illness and chemical abuse (MICA) disorders are a population of
      interest, in part because their special needs place exceptional demands on criminal justice
      and treatment systems, as well as on individuals and families. This study examines the
      crucial point of transition from prison to the community, where continued treatment for
      offenders is generally considered necessary to sustain gains made by prison treatment
      efforts, and to achieve successful outcomes. The project has two specific aims; Aim 1 is to
      test the effectiveness of Re entry MTC treatment relative to a control condition, and Aim 2
      is to assess the relative impact on treatment outcomes of the type of treatment received
      while in prison and of the progress achieved in re-entry treatment.

      On their release from prison, male offenders with MICA disorders who elect to participate in
      this study (N = 332), will be placed in either the experimental condition, (E) Re-entry
      Modified Therapeutic Community (Re-entry MTC) or the control condition, (C) Parole
      Supervision and Case Management currently provided, using a randomized block assignment
      procedure. The research employs a prospective, longitudinal, repeated measures assessment
      with five data collection points: baseline (Time 1, or T1) corresponding to entry into the
      Community Corrections facility and at 3 (T2), 6 (T3), 12 (T4), and 18 (T5) months
      post-baseline. The major study hypothesis is that the E condition (compared to the C
      condition) will produce significantly greater improvement in the presenting problems of the
      study participants, as measured by substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal
      activities.

      This project will advance scientific knowledge through a controlled study of the
      effectiveness of the MTC model, with demonstrated success in community settings, as a
      re-entry strategy for offenders with MICA disorders, thereby expanding the range of treatment
      models available to such clients in the community. In addition, the study will examine the
      degree to which prior prison treatment moderates the effectiveness of the Re-entry MTC, or
      the extent to which positive outcomes are independent of the type of treatment received
      during the prior incarceration. This distinction will inform program planning by establishing
      the value of MTC treatment in prison plus MTC during re-entry versus MTC re-entry treatment
      alone. Finally, the study tests a specific hypothesis about the degree to which the
      effectiveness of Re-entry MTC treatment is mediated by client progress during reentry, which
      will increase our understanding of the relationship between progress in treatment and
      post-treatment outcomes for offenders with MICA disorders.

Measures of independent living skills and community functioning will be added.</description>

    <time_frame>At 6, 12, and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CDOC-RIS will provide data on: charge on which incarceration is based; previous charges; current sentence; status of violent offenses; urine toxicological information on drug and alcohol use; medical information; dates of prior incarcerations; disciplinary reports; all services received while in prison; offenses committed post-release, reincarcerations, parole information (including entry into substance abuse treatment).

    <description>In general, the MTC program model applies three fundamental adjustments — increased flexibility, decreased intensity, and greater individualization. The central TC feature is retained; the MTC, like all TC programs, seeks to develop a subculture where clients learn through self-help and affiliation with the community to foster change in themselves and others. From this base (as elaborated below), further adaptations for the population of offenders with MICA disorders were incorporated to include an emphasis on modifying criminal thinking and behavior; on recognizing and responding to the interrelationship of substance abuse, mental illness, and criminality (triple recovery); and on using strategies for symptom management.</description>

    <description>Recognizing the complexity of issues facing offenders returning to the community, and the importance of continuity of care, the CDOC established a system of aftercare substance abuse services for offenders on parole or placed in Community Corrections facilities. The statewide treatment options for the offenders consist of a network of community-based clinics and halfway houses throughout Colorado that provide substance abuse services and mental health services. Parole officers and Community Corrections case managers monitor treatment compliance to support participation in prescribed services.</description>

          -  The study has no exclusion criteria other than programmatic criteria that exclude
             offenders who constitute a threat to themselves or to others in the community, as
             determined by the Community Corrections Board at the time the offender is placed in a
             Community Corrections facility.
