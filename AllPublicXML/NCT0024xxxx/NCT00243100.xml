    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and gemcitabine
      in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vorinostat and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may
      also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth
      and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetics of
      vorinostat (SAHA) and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic or unresectable epithelial
      solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. Determine tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) once daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine IV over 1-2
      hours on days 3 and 10. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA and gemcitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
