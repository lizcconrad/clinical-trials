  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The course of the disease in female patients with metastatic mammary carcinoma can vary
      greatly. In this connection, the individual prognosis depends on a complex interaction of
      tumor- and patient-related factors. To take account of such differences, it is necessary to
      employ individual methods of treatment which are suited to the course of each patient's
      disease. Prof. Possinger and Dr. Schmid (Charite Berlin) and Prof. Wischnewsky (University of
      Bremen) have developed an approach that can help to achieve this goal with the aid of
      computerized machine learning techniques (MLT).

      The use of machine learning methods can be beneficial in oncology in two respects. On the one
      hand, an attempt can be made to individually estimate clinically relevant parameters like,
      for example, the recurrence probability or expected survival time as precisely as possible
      based on the established prognostic factors. And on the other hand, it may be possible with
      the aid of MLT to understand structural relationships between the clinical result and
      measured or established tumor-/patient-related variables.

      To analyze the possible benefits of machine learning techniques for patients with metastatic
      breast cancer, the aim of study FEM-D-2 is to investigate whether it is possible to
      characterize those patients who either do or do not respond to a specific treatment with a
      precision of 90%, prospectively estimate the time until worsening of the disease under a
      given treatment, and classify patients in groups with favorable and poor chances of
      medium-term survival.

      The use of inductive learning algorithms with machine learning also makes it possible to very
      accurately estimate the time until progression of the tumor growth. In patients who respond
      to letrozole therapy, the time until tumor progression depends on factors like pain, age,
      body mass index, disease-free interval, main localization of metastatic spread, and response
      to previous estrogen therapy. Only very minimal differences are found when comparing the
      actual time until progression of the disease and that calculated by the system (at least for
      survival times &lt; 1 year). Furthermore, using machine learning techniques it has become
      possible to use initial data assessed before a letrozole treatment to estimate the survival
      time and distinguish patients with a high risk of dying soon from other patients with a more
      favorable prognosis.

        Inclusion criteria for the second-line therapy:

        Patients can only take part in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Histologically established mammary carcinoma

          -  Estrogen receptor (ER+) positive and/or progesterone receptor (PgR+) positive or
             ER/PgR unknown

          -  Postmenopausal women; defined by (at least one criterion applicable):

          -  Amenorrhea ≥ 5 years

          -  Age ≥ 60

          -  Age ≥ 45 with amenorrhea ≥ 12 months

          -  Postmenopausal LH / FSH values (according to the respective institution)

          -  Bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Patients with a primary or recurrent local advanced mammary carcinoma which cannot be
             curatively treated with surgical procedures or radiation therapy, or patients with a
             metastatic mammary carcinoma after antiestrogen pretreatment.

          -  Patients with a recurrence under adjuvant antiestrogen therapy (e.g. tamoxifen; with
             or without adjuvant chemotherapy) which was administered for at least 6 months or a
             recurrence within the last 12 months after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy (e.g.
             tamoxifen, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy) which was administered for at least
             6 months or progression under palliative first-line antiestrogen therapy can be
             included.

          -  At most, a previous palliative cytostatic treatment is possible

          -  Measurable or assessable metastases in at least one organ system with objective proof
             of progression; that is, evidence of newly occurring lesions or an increase in size of
             preexisting lesions by more than 25% with measurable metastases or worsening with
             assessable changes within the last 3 months before inclusion in the study

          -  In the case of bone metastases, imaging methods should verify that at least one
             preexisting osteolysis or the lytic part of an assessable mixed lesion has increased
             in size, or that new measurable or assessable bone metastases have developed. In
             assessable mixed lesions, the measurable part must constitute at least 50% of the size
             of the metastasis.

        If no previous images are available, the increase in bone pain in connection with the
        detectable, measurable osteolyses or assessable mixed metastases in the pretreatment image
        are regarded as progression.

          -  Previous radiotherapy is permitted as long as the irradiated area is not the only
             measurable lesion

          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Performance status of 50 or higher on the Karnofsky scale or WHO grade 0-2.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Written informed consent of the patient

        Exclusion criteria for the second-line therapy:

        Patients are not allowed to take part in the study if they meet at least one of the
        following criteria:

          -  Cerebral metastasis

          -  Lymphangitis carcinomatosa of the lung (&gt; 50% of the lung affected)

          -  Very extensive liver metastasis (in ultrasound or CT &gt; 33% of the liver replaced by
             metastases)

          -  Inflammatory mammary carcinoma

             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  Patients with concomitant serious, unstable cardiac diseases (angina pectoris,
             arrhythmia, myocardial infarction within the last six months) or uncontrolled diabetes
             mellitus

          -  Known hypersensitivity to components of the study medication

          -  Exclusively osteoblastic or mixed bone metastases, with a lytic percentage &lt; 50%, in
             so far as no other measurable or assessable lesions are present

          -  Antihormonal pretreatment with aromatase inhibitors, megestrol acetate,
             medroxyprogesterone, or GnRH analogues

          -  Treatment with a hormone replacement therapy

          -  Taking of non-approved substances within the past 30 days and concomitant treatment
             with non-approved drugs

          -  Previous endocrine treatment of a metastatic mammary carcinoma

          -  Patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant endocrine treatment with or without chemotherapy
             within the past 12 months

          -  Patients with adjuvant or neo-adjuvant endocrine antiestrogen treatment for whom a
             recurrence occurred during or within 12 months after the end of treatment

          -  Patients who received more than one regimen of a systemic chemotherapy against their
             advanced breast cancer

        Other protocol-related inclusion / exclusion criteria may apply
