  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to compare efficacy and safety of TachoComb S and standard surgical
      treatment for the control of local bleeding in patients undergoing surgical resection of
      renal tumours. Specific objectives include the comparison between test treatments of
      intra-operative haemostatic efficacy as well as post-operative blood loss, haematoma
      formation, and surgeon's rating of usefulness of test treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients of or above 18 years of age scheduled for resection of superficial tumour on the
        kidney and scheduled for open surgery. After the tumour resection the wound should be
        suitable for the treatments in the study, and the integrity of the urinary tract should be
        maintained.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients undergoing an emergency operation, or with more than one tumour will be excluded.
        Patients with a clinically abnormal value of prothrombin time or activated partial
        thromboplastin time, anamnetic evidence of coagulation disorders and a history of allergic
        reactions after application of human fibrinogen, human thrombin and/or collagen will be
        excluded. In case the tumour was resected by use of a laser scalpel, infrared coagulator or
        argon beamer and if any fibrin glue haemostatic was used before randomisation the patient
        will be excluded from the trial. Furthermore, patients will be excluded if extensive
        resection/extirpation of the kidney become necessary or in case of serious surgical
        complication occurring during the operation.
