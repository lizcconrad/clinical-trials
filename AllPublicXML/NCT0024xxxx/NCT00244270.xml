    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of venous thrombosis occurring on
      totally implantable vascular access devices in cystic fibrosis patients who need a new device
      (it can be the first one or a subsequent one) and to study the genetic risk factors of
      thrombosis adjusted to the acquired ones.

      It is a nationwide cohort study planned for two years with a six month follow up period. The
      expected number of inclusion is 50 patients each year, that is to say 100 for the whole
      study.

      In cystic fibrosis, pulmonary exacerbations necessitate repeated intravenous antibiotics, but
      the peripheral blood accesses become precarious with time, leading to the indication of a
      central venous device. It is important to take a lot of precautions to protect vascular
      access. This allows the patient to have a dramatic improvement in life expectancy with such
      life-long devices (ONM, French National Observatory France 2003 : median at 36 years). Venous
      thrombosis can cause a superior cava syndrome, a pleural effusion or a pulmonary embolism.
      The risk of thrombosis is significant; retrospectively, it has been evaluated to be between 4
      and 16% in the publications. This rate may be higher due to the fact that venous thrombosis
      may remain asymptomatic, and therefore silent, but they lead to the same risk of vascular
      access loss.

      access loss.

      This prospective study will try to identify venous thrombosis whatever they are - symptomatic
      or silent - and to identify the genetic and acquired risk factors, the circumstances of
      occurrence and the current therapeutic modalities. Furthermore, the setting up of an early
      treatment on still asymptomatic thrombosis allows the researchers to hope for a prompt
      resolution of the thrombosis.
