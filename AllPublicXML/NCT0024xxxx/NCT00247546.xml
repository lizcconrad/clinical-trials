      The aim of this study is to describe and analyse the effects of multifactorial trial on the
      incidence of falls and injurious falls and on different risk factors of falling among the
      home-dwelling aged.

      The aims of the study:

        1. To implement a program for the prevention of falls and injurious falls.

        2. To describe the structure and activities of the fall prevention program implemented
           among the aged who are living in their own home, have at least moderate cognitive
           abilities, have fallen during previous 12 months and are 65 years of age or older. A
           further aim is to describe the frequency of participation according to age, gender,
           residence, health and physical condition.

        3. To describe the effects of prevention on primary risk factors of falling such as muscle
           strength, balance, eye sight, medications, depression and home hazards in relation to
           age, gender, health and physical condition.

        4. To describe and assess the effects of prevention on the incidence of falls and injurious
           falls.

        5. To assess the effects of prevention on physical, cognitive and psychosocial functional
           abilities, quality of life and use of health and social services and deaths.
