  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study of
      tesaglitazar in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not adequately controlled on insulin
      (along or in combination with one or more oral antidiabetic agents in addition to diet and
      lifestyle advice). The study comprises a 3-week enrollment period and a 24-week randomized,
      double blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled treatment period and a 3-week follow-up.
      Patients must receive at least 30 units of insulin per day and will continue their current
      oral antidiabetic treatment regimen throughout the study.
