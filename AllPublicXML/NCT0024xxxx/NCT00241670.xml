    <textblock>
      The aim of the study &quot;Fluorescence-guided resection of malignant gliomas with
      5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) vs. conventional resection&quot; is to determine how accurately
      contrast agent-accumulating tumour can be removed by primary surgery and to assess the
      clinical usefulness of this method.

    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are locally invasive tumors that carry a dismal prognosis despite a
      combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery is generally
      considered beneficial but complete resection of contrast enhancing tumor is achieved in less
      than 20 % of patients, one reason being the difficulty in discerning marginal, enhancing
      tumor intraoperatively.

      Five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) leads to the accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in
      malignant gliomas, a phenomenon under exploration for intraoperative identification and
      resection of these tumors. This study investigated the benefit derived from
      fluorescent-guided resections using 5-ALA on surgical radicality, progression-free survival
      and morbidity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiological suspicion of a unilocular malignant glioma with distinct ring- or
             garland-shaped contrast agent-accumulating tumour structures and a core of reduced
             intensity in the MRI (central necroses) with no significant non-staining tumour tissue
             (exclusion of a secondary malignant glioma).

          -  Indication for surgical tumour resection. If radical resection is planned, the
             location of the contrast agent-accumulating tumour should allow complete resection.

          -  First operation of the tumour, no other tumour-specific pretreatment

          -  Karnofsky at least 70 %

          -  Patient's written informed consent

          -  Age 18-72 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumour location in the midline, basal ganglia, cerebellum or brain stem

          -  More than one contrast agent-accumulating lesion unrelated to the primary tumour or
             extracerebral metastases

          -  Porphyria, hypersensitivity to porphyrins

          -  Renal insufficiency: Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Hepatic insufficiency: Bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl

          -  Quick test &lt; 60 %

          -  gamma-GT &gt; 70 U/I

          -  Malignancies other than basaliomas

          -  Existing or planned pregnancy or lactation, or inadequate contraception

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial or participation in another
             clinical trial in the 30 days preceding randomisation
