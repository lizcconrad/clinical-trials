  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal duration of hormonal therapy is yet to be determined in the treatment of locally
      advanced carcinoma of the prostate. The RTOG performed a trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant and
      concurrent hormones(consisting of Goserelin and Flutamide) compared to radiation alone, and
      found that there was an improvement in local control and progression-free survival, but no
      improvement in overall survival. The EORTC performed a similar trial, but used Goserelin
      alone for a period of 3 years. This trial showed an improvement in local control,
      disease-free survival, and in contrast to the RTOG trial, an improvement in overall survival.

      The rate of erectile dysfunction in men who receive a prolonged period of Gosereline (i.e. 2
      yrs) is not known, but suspected according to expert opinion, to be significantly higher than
      a shorter course of hormonal ablation. Therefore the price of of a survival advantage in
      locally advanced prostate cancer maybe at a cost of increased rates of erectile dysfunction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinical stage T1-T4 carcinoma of the prostate

          -  Must have undergone radical radiation and at least 2 years of Pharmacological androgen
             ablation.Pharmacological androgen ablation may include: LHRH-agonists with or without
             Non-steroidal androgen ablation, Steroidal Anti-androgens, Progestational agents, and
             Cypoterone (Androcur).

          -  Must be currently 6 months or more after their last injection of LHRH-agonists if it
             was being given every 3 months or 4 months or more after their last injection, if it
             was being given monthly. If the patient was on oral androgen ablation agent, they must
             be off this medication for a period of at least 4 months.

          -  currently off hormonal therapy

          -  Able to sign the consent form and fill out questionnaire used in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No patients who have been treated, or are currently being treated with Bicalutamide

          -  no previous orchidectomy.
