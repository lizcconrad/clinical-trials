  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist
      spironolactone combined with an ACE inhibitor (captopril) and a beta-blocker (carvedilol) is
      effective in reverse pulmonary artery remodeling in patients with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH)secondary to congenital heart disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of PAH involves multiple mechanisms. However, three common factors are
      thought to cause the increased pulmonary vascular resistance that characterizes this
      devastating disease: vasoconstriction, pulmonary vascular proliferation and remodeling, and
      thrombosis in situ. Advances in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in PAH
      suggest that endothelial dysfunction with chronic impaired production of vasoactive mediators
      plays a key role. Reduced production of vasoactive mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO) and
      prostacyclin, along with prolonged overexpression of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1
      (ET-1), not only affect vascular tone but also promote vascular remodeling. Thus, these
      substances represent logical pharmacological targets. Animal studies showed ET-1 could
      stimulate aldosterone secretion in different species, both in vivo and in vitro. This
      stimulation involves the ET-B alone and both ET-A and ET-B receptor subtypes in rats and
      humans. Animal studies also showed spironolactone combined with ACE inhibitor could normalize
      blood pressure, prevents upregulation of vascular ET-1, restore nitric oxide (NO)-mediated
      endothelial dysfunction. Beta-blockers have ability to reduce dp/dt in pulmonary artery, as
      well as left ventricle, thus prevent further damage to the dysfunctional endothelium.
      Furthermore, we observed from our practice that the aforementioned therapy could lower
      pulmonary artery pressure in patents with pulmonary hypertension secondary to left
      ventricular dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesize spironolactone combined with ACE inhibitor and
      beta-blocker has the ability to reverse remodeling of pulmonary artery in PAH patients.
