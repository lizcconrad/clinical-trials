  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a progressive therapeutic exercise
      program on specific physical and functional deficits in the neck and shoulder region
      occurring as a result of head and neck cancer treatment.

    <textblock>
      We will be conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of progressive
      resistance exercise training (PRET) on shoulder and neck dysfunction due to spinal accessory
      neurapraxia/ neurectomy in patients with head and neck cancer. Sixty-four head and neck
      cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to PRET or standard care. Participants assigned to
      the PRET group will exercise 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The goal of the exercise program
      will be to enhance scapular stability, and improve mobility and strength of the upper
      extremity. The resistance exercise program will be progressive in terms of the number of sets
      and repetitions performed, as well as amount lifted, depending on baseline strength levels
      and overall performance status. The primary outcomes for the study include pain and
      dysfunction, active and passive range of motion measures, strength and endurance testing, and
      quality of life. Nerve conduction testing and electromyography will be performed to assess/
      monitor the status of the spinal accessory nerve and trapezius muscle function respectively.
