      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if supplementation with vitamin D in doses of
      20.000IU per week and 40.000 IU per week will result in weight loss in obese subjects as
      compared to placebo during 1 year.

    <textblock>
      We will include 450 obese subjects that will be devided in 3 groups: 40.000IU cholecalciferol
      per week, 20.000 IU cholecalciferol per week, and placebo. All subjects will be given 500 mg
      calcium per day. There will be visits every tird month. In addition to weight reduction, we
      will also evaluate the calcium metabolism (blood test and urin samples), insulin sensitivity,
      muscle strenght, blood pressure and depression.
