    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to test the efficacy of brief clinician advice in reducing the
      frequency of high-risk drinking and alcohol-related harm in a population of college students
      seeking care at five university health care clinics. High-risk drinking is defined as 1) 8 or
      more episodes of heavy drinking (5 or more drinks in a row) in the past 28 days for male and
      female students, and/or 2) 50 drinks for male and 40 drinks for female students in the past
      28 days, and/or 3) 15 drinks for male and 12 drinks for female students in the past 7 days,
      and/or 4) One or more episode(s) of heavy drinking which includes 15 or more drinks in a row.
