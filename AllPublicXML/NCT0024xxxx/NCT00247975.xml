  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is very common and afflicts 1 in 9 North American women. The treatment of
      breast cancer often requires the use of chemotherapy including &quot;anthracyclines&quot;.
      Anthracyclines can damage the heart resulting in heart failure and even death. Clinicians and
      researchers are continually seeking methods that will reduce the toxic effects of
      anthracycline treatment.

      L-carnitine is a substance that is produced naturally in the body and is required for normal
      heart function. Animal studies have suggested that L-carnitine protects the heart from the
      effects of anthracyclines, however this has not been verified in humans.

      This study will assess the potential role of L-carnitine in the prevention of anthracycline
      induced heart damage. The investigators will enroll 144 patients into this study. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to L-carnitine therapy or to standard care (no L-carnitine
      therapy). Patients in the L-carnitine group will receive oral and intravenous L-carnitine
      prior to and after their anthracycline therapy. Patients will undergo regular follow up and
      testing to assess heart function. The investigators believe that patients treated with
      L-carnitine will benefit and have fewer complications associated with anthracycline
      treatment.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to L-carnitine therapy or placebo. Patients in the treatment group will receive oral L-carnitine (3 grams daily) for 3 days prior to chemotherapy, 1 gram of intravenous L-carnitine (5 cc over 5 minutes, prior to chemotherapy) on the day of chemotherapy and oral L-carnitine (3 grams daily) for 3 days after chemotherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients must have histologically or cytologically indicated breast cancer
             (stages I, II, III) eligible for adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy [FEC100 or
             AC-Taxol(paclitaxel) every 21 days.

          -  HER2 negative or HER2 positive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry (IHC3+) and/or
             fluorescent in-situ hybridization.
