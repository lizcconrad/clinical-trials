      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerance of the drugs
      Lamotrigine and Levetiracetam in the initial monotherapy of patients with newly diagnosed
      epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is the second most frequent neurologic disease (prevalence 0.5 % - 1 % [Brodie et
      al. 1997]). About 30 % of epilepsy patients (including many children) suffer from intractable
      seizures [Kwan &amp; Brodie 2000]. Therefore new drugs and an expansion of permission for drugs
      with limited approval, respectively, are needed.

      Levetiracetam is a new potent antiepileptic drug with nearly ideal pharmacokinetic properties
      and few side effects [Patsalos 2000], but it is approved in Germany only for add-on therapy
      for patients &gt; 15 years of age with focal epilepsy.

      Due to its few cognitive side effects and its efficacy, Lamotrigine is becoming standard
      therapy for focal and generalized epilepsy for patients from &gt;11 years of age. Its
      disadvantage is the possibility of severe allergic reactions which limits the speed of dose
      increment.

      Comparisons: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy are treated with either Lamotrigine or
      Levetiracetam. Rate of seizure-free patients in the first 6 weeks of the trial (main outcome
      criterion) as well as rate of seizure-free patients during the last 16 weeks and the total 26
      weeks of the observation period, time until the first seizure appears, time patients take the
      study medication, safety and quality of life during treatment are compared.
