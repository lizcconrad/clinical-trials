  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of coronary heart disease which is the major cause of heart attack, direct
      mechanical treatment with catheters such as the coronary angiography,coronary balloon
      intervention and stenting intervention are the mainstay of therapy in recent years. In that
      procedures, we should use the contrast media, and it may cause kidney toxicity especially in
      the patients with underlying kidney disease and decreased kidney function. We intended to
      find out which contrast agent has less kidney toxicity in the catheter based treatment of
      coronary arterial diseases in patients with underlying decreased kidney function

  <detailed_description>

      Iodixanol, a nonionic, dimeric, iso-osmolar contrast medium (IOCM), may be less nephrotoxic
      than nonionic, monomeric, low-osmolar contrast media (LOCMs) in high-risk patients. We
      compared the nephrotoxicity of iodixanol with that of ioxaglate, an ionic, dimeric LOCM, in
      patients with renal impairment.
