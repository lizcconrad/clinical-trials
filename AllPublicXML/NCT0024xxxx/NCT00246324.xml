    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination therapy with intramuscular
      interferon beta-1a and oral doxycycline, a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, in
      patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) having breakthrough disease
      activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible individuals were evaluated monthly for 3 months while taking intramuscular
      interferon beta-1a, 30 micrograms weekly, then monthly for 4 months while receiving
      intramuscular interferon beta-1a, 30 micrograms and oral doxycycline, 100 mg daily.

    <measure>Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+)Lesion Number Change.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Before treatment is the number of lesions per image from months -3, -2, -1, and 0. During treatment is the number of lesions from months 1,2, and 3. The mean number of Gd+ lesions during each treatment period was calculated for each patient as the total number of Gd+ lesions observed across all images divided by the number of images. Hence, the mean number of Gd+ lesions per patient represents the number of lesions per MRI.</description>
