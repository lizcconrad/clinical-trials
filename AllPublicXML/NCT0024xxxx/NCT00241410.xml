      Objective of this trial is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of different dose
      combinations of MPL and grass pollen allergen and to identify the highest combination of MPL
      and grass pollen allergen which is safe.

      Other objectives are to investigate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of MPL and grass pollen
      allergen.

             contraception during the study.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, each subject will be able to understand verbal and
             written instructions and competent to follow these instructions.

          -  Subjects must read, understand, sign, and date the written informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the last 2 years. A clinically significant disease is defined as a disease which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the trial or a disease which may influence the results of the trial
             or the subject's eligibility to participate in the trial.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on pre-study physical examination, vital signs,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or laboratory tests; acute illness within 7 days before the
             screening visit.

          -  History of allergy to all-season allergens and / or history of allergy to other
             seasonal allergens than grass pollen which might interfere with period of trial
             conduct

          -  History of a major psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia, other psychotic
             symptomatology, major depressive disorder, or suicide attempt within the past 5 years;

          -  Vaccinations in the last three months.

          -  Unable to comply with recommended therapy-free interval for specified medications
             prior to skin prick test.

          -  Current diseases with a pathogenesis interfering with the immune response and diseases
             for which medication has been given, which could influence the results of this study.

          -  Acute or chronic infection.

          -  Already undergone hyposensitization therapy with grass pollen allergens within the
             last three years.

             to MPL.

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.
