               2. Male or female subjects, age &gt; 18 years

               3. Primary hypercholesterolaemia with CV risk &gt; 20%/10yrs, type 2 diabetes, a
                  history of CHD or other established atherosclerotic disease (definition given in
                  Appendix L).

               4. Subjects may be lipid-lowering therapy-naïve, but have completed 6-weeks dietary
                  counselling before this visit OR Subjects may be treated with the 'start' dose of
                  other lipid lowering therapy, which is ineffective, ie. The subject has not met
                  LDL-C treatment goals.

               5. Subjects willing to follow all study procedures including attendance at clinics
                  for scheduled study visits, fasting prior to blood draws and compliance with
                  study treatment regimen

                  Visit 2:

               6. Subjects switched from start dose of a lipid lowering therapy (commonly accepted
                  start dose) will have fasting LDL-C levels &gt; 3.1 mmol (120 mg/dl)

               7. Newly treated subjects, after a six-weeks dietary counselling, will have fasting
                  LDL-C levels &gt; 3.5 mmol/L (135 mg/dL)

               8. Fasting triglycerides £ 4.52 mmol/L (400 mg/dL)

               9. Switched patients must stop current lipid lowering treatment at randomisation
                  (Visit 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or known type III
             hyperlipoproteinaemia (familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia)

          2. Documented secondary hypercholesterolaemia of any cause other than named in inclusion
             criteria 3

          3. History of serious adverse effect or hypersensitivity reactions to other HMG-CoA
             reductase inhibitors, in particular any history of myopathy

          4. Unstable angina within three months prior to inclusion in the study

          5. Active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction as defined by elevations of AST or ALT ³
             1.5 times the ULN. In this case, a second determination of hepatic tests will be
             performed after one week. If the dysfunction is confirmed, the subject must not be
             included in the study

          6. Known uncontrolled diabetes

          7. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as either resting diastolic blood pressure of &gt;
             95mmHg or resting systolic blood pressure of &gt; 200 mmHg

          8. Unexplained serum CK &gt; 3 times ULN (eg not due to recent trauma, intramuscular
             injections, heavy exercise etc)
