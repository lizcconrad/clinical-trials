      Introduction Worldwide uncorrected significant refractive errors (RE) are among the commonest
      causes of visual impairment. This combined with the effectiveness and simplicity of
      correcting RE by providing spectacles has made the correction of RE one of the priorities of
      Vision 2020. However, little information is available on effective strategies for identifying
      and delivering optical services to affected individuals in developing countries

      Aim The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two interventions, namely
      providing free spectacles or only a prescription to students with insufficiently corrected or
      uncorrected significant refractive errors

      Objectives

        1. To estimate the prevalence and type of significant refractive errors in secondary school
           children in Tanzania, and to determine the unmet need for spectacles

        2. To compare the effectiveness of providing free spectacles vs. offering only a
           prescription. This was judged as the proportion of students needing spectacles who were
           wearing spectacles at 3 and at 6 months after prescription

        3. To explore attitudes to spectacles and reasons for non-compliance

      Methods The study took place in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between January and September 2004.
      52 schools were randomly selected into 2 intervention groups (Group A and B) using random
      selection stratified by school status (government vs. private). Students were screened for
      significant refractive errors. A socio-economic questionnaire was administered to all the
      students. Students who needed spectacles in Group A schools received free spectacles
      (intervention A), while students in group B schools received only a prescription for
      spectacles (intervention B). Students were followed up 3 and 6 months after spectacles
      provision/prescription to check their compliance and to explore reasons for non-compliance.

      Main analyses of data were the prevalence of visual impairment and its causes, risk factors
      for myopia, and compliance with spectacles at 3 and at 6 months.

      Results

        1. Prevalence of impaired visual acuity and causes 6,904 students were screened by the eye
           team. 2.9% of students had uncorrected poor VA, 2.3% had poor presenting VA and 0.6%
           still had poor VA with best correction. The main cause of visual impairment was
           significant refractive error (84%).

           The prevalence of uncorrected significant RE in secondary school students in Dar es
           Salaam was low at 1.8%. Even assuming that all students with unconfirmed poor presenting
           screening eyesight (0.8%) had uncorrected significant RE which is unlikely the maximum
           prevalence would be estimated at 2.6%.

        2. Compliance with spectacles

           Students who had actually purchased their spectacles were up to twice as likely to wear
           them at 3 and at 6 months as students who had received free spectacles, but only a small
           proportion had purchased them (3 months: 30%; 6 months: 45%). Only 46% of students who
           had received free spectacles wore them or had them at school at 3 months and 53% at 6
           months. Significant independent predictors of students wearing or having their
           spectacles at school 3 to 6 months after prescription or provision of free spectacles
           were:

             -  Having to purchase spectacles (less likely, OR=0.07 to 0.42)

             -  Bilateral good presenting vision, such as mild refractive errors and undercorrected
                significant errors (less likely than unilateral visual impairment) and unilateral
                visual impairment (less likely than bilateral visual impairment; OR=0.47 for each
                step)

             -  Myopia compared to astigmatism and hyperopia, both severe enough to impair distance
                vision (more likely, OR= 68 â€“infinity) The majority of students who were going to
                purchase spectacles seemed to purchase them soon after prescription.

        3. Risk factors for myopia Female sex, non-African ethnicity and a professional mother were
           independent significant risk factors for myopia in this population. These findings are
           similar to risk factors for myopia found in other populations.

      Conclusions/ Recommendation

        1. Significant refractive errors were the most common cause of avoidable visual impairment
           in Tanzanian secondary school students in Dar es Salaam. However, the prevalence of
           uncorrected bilateral and unilateral significant refractive errors in Form 1 students
           was low (less than 3%) which makes the value of screening for RE in this population
           questionable. Screening seems even less justified if one considers that only about 46%
           of students who had been provided with free spectacles wore spectacles or had them at
           school three months later. If students were asked to purchase spectacles, this
           proportion was even lower at 26%.

        2. Similar studies in different cultural settings are needed to explore the compliance with
           and reasons of non-compliance with spectacles in children, as poor compliance makes the
           value of any screening programme questionable.
