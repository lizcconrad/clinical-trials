  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather more information about the safety of ACZONE Gel, 5% in
      treating subjects with acne who have certain blood disorders.

      ACZONE Gel, 5% is a prescription skin use (topical) medicine used to help treat acne in
      people 12 years and older. ACZONE Gel, 5% has been studied in approximately 4000 people and
      was shown to reduce the number of pimples and improve acne.

      The active drug ingredient in ACZONE Gel, 5% is dapsone. People with blood disorders called
      &quot;G6PD deficiency&quot;, &quot;methemoglobin reductase deficiency&quot;, and &quot;hemoglobin M&quot; have a higher
      chance of side effects with dapsone.

      G6PD is short for &quot;glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase&quot;. It is an enzyme found in red blood
      cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of the body. G6PD helps the red blood cells to
      function normally. Some people have less G6PD in their red blood cells than the average
      person. This is called G6PD deficiency.

      Two treatments - ACZONE Gel, 5% and placebo - will be studied for comparison.

      Study Objectives:

        -  To compare the safety profile and risk of hemolysis of ACZONE Gel, 5% to that of the
           vehicle after 12 weeks each of twice daily applications in acne vulgaris subjects with
           glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

        -  To determine the systemic levels of plasma dapsone and N-acetyl dapsone during treatment
           with ACZONE Gel, 5%.

      Study Population:

      Approximately 60 male and female subjects

      Study Treatment:

      All subjects in the study will receive ACZONE Gel, 5% and vehicle in 1 of 2 sequences; each
      for a 12-week period.
