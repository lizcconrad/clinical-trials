  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to directly compare the body composition, body fat distribution,
      and morphological and functional features of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle between South
      Asians and European Caucasians.

    <textblock>
      Excess body fat, the hallmark of obesity is a major risk factor for the development of
      insulin resistance (decreased insulin sensitivity), type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
      disease. Previous studies have shown that South Asians (people who originate from the Indian
      subcontinent) appear particularly prone to develop diabetes and heart disease compared to
      white Caucasians of European origin. In Canada, in the Study of Health Assessment and Risk in
      Ethnic groups (SHARE), it was observed that in a random selection of South Asian and European
      individuals, South Asians had twice as much type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and
      were significantly more insulin resistant than Europeans despite a similar body mass index
      (BMI) and waist circumference. It is possible that the increased propensity of South Asians
      to develop insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is related to
      greater total body fat and/or increased visceral fat in addition to the possible biological
      differences in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle tissues. The primary objective of this
      study is therefore to determine differences among age, sex, and BMI-matched people of South
      Asian and European Caucasian descent in body composition (specifically total body fat, lean
      body mass) and fat distribution (where the fat is stored in the body). This study will
      therefore test the hypothesis that for a similar BMI, South Asians have more total body fat
      and less lean body mass than age and sex-matched European Caucasians. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to look at the differences in the two ethnic groups at a
      biological level, including: differences in visceral fat, adipose tissue morphology,
      imflammation and adipokine production, skeletal muscle fat content, fatty acid oxidation and
      mitochondrial activity.
