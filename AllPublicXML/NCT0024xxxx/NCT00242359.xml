    <textblock>
      Management of animal induced occupational asthma is mainly avoidance, but this is not
      feasible for many occupations. Treatment with avoidance and conventional treatment is also
      not always successful. Omalizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of allergic asthma and
      may be effective at reducing symptoms and disease progression in the animal handlers
      population.
