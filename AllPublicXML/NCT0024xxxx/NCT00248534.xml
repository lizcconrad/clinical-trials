      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as temozolomide and methylprednisolone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Rituximab may help
      chemotherapy kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs.
      Giving rituximab together with temozolomide and methylprednisolone may be an effective
      treatment for primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with temozolomide
      and methylprednisolone works in treating patients with recurrent primary CNS non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent primary CNS non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma treated with rituximab, temozolomide, and methylprednisolone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Induction therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 and oral temozolomide daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. After day 28, patients with
      stable disease or better proceed to consolidation therapy.

      Consolidation therapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses. Patients achieving a complete remission proceed to
      maintenance therapy.

      Maintenance therapy: Patients receive methylprednisolone IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      13.3 months.
