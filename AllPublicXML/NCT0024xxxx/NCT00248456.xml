      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcipotriol plus betamethasone
      dipropionate ointment compared with calcipotriol ointment in the treatment of patients with
      psoriasis vulgaris for a duration of 4 weeks. The study will focus on the percentage change
      of the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) from baseline to the end of week 4.
