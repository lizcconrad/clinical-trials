      We are interested in achieving an empirical test of the two intervention approaches under
      study. Specifically, we seek to determine the potential differential impact of positive
      affect induction and self affirmation following the qualitative study phase.

      We seek to determine the potential differential impact of positive affect induction and self
      affirmation following the qualitative study phase.

        1. Positive affect induction: We will tests two types of positive affect induction. 1)
           sending patients a small gift, and 2) reminding patients of positive thoughts about
           themselves. Gift: Prior to a telephone call, patients in the positive affect condition
           will receive a small gift. The selection of gifts will be guided, in part, by data
           obtained from the qualitative study phase. Positive thoughts about themselves: Patients
           will be asked to describe a time when someone was helpful to them, and they felt good
           about it , and were nice to them in return.

        2. Self affirmation: consists of a series of items reminding people of their core values.

        3. Control: Control patients will have neither self affirmation nor gifts. After
           enrollment, patients will be randomized into four groups: control, the self affirmation,
           the positive affect gift group and the positive affect positive thought group. Thus, for
           the positive affect, we will test two different types of positive affect induction.

      Follow-up: At two weeks after enrollment all patients will be called to ascertain impact of
      the pilot intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients undergoing coronary artery catheterization who are found to have at least
        single vessel stenosis and who have had revascularization with angioplasty or coronary
        artery stenting will be eligible for enrollment. Patients must be able to provide informed
        consent within the one week after the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are unable to walk several blocks regardless of the reason will be
             excluded from all the trials (e.g., arthritis, stroke, claudication).

          2. Enrollment in other trials designed to modify post-procedure behaviors.

          3. Patients who refuse to participate will be excluded.

          4. If at any time prior to enrollment in the study, the patient's cardiologist determines
             that the patient should not participate in this study, the patient will not be
             enrolled in the trial.
