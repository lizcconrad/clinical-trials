  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a well-designed hepatitis C (HCV)video education
      curriculum for high-risk drug users will show measurable benefits in improving HCV testing,
      hepatitis A and B vaccinations, and HCV knowledge, attitudes, and motivations toward
      transmission behavior change. The investigators will use a 4-part modular video series
      designed for at-risk drug users, and in this 12 week study will assess its impact on
      testing/vaccinations as well as knowledge, attitudes, and motivations in methadone-maintained
      drug users as compared to a usual-care intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injection drug users are at high risk for contracting hepatitis C (HCV). Very few
      culturally-specific educational tools have been developed to improve outcomes in this
      population. We hypothesize that measurable improvements in HCV testing, hepatitis A and B
      vaccinations, and testable knowledge, attitudes, and motivations may be elicited by such a
      curriculum.

      In this study, we will investigate the impact of a 4-module short video educational series on
      these measures in in-treatment drug users maintained on methadone. Subjects will be enrolled
      in 3 sequential cohorts of 150 each: usual care, a 4 weekly sequential video cohort, and a
      single-session intervention in which the 4 videos are viewed at once. Subjects will undergo
      written testing for knowledge, attitudes about transmission behaviors, and motivations toward
      behavior change before the intervention, 4 weeks after the intervention, and 12 weeks after
      the intervention. Additionally, we will measure and compare the rates of HCV testing and
      HAV/HBV vaccinations before and at the 12-week time point in all cohorts.
