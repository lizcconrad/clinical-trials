  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy is a recent technique used in the treatment of tumours and involves the use of
      radioactive sources brought into close contact with the target tissues. One of the principal
      benefits of brachytherapy is that high radiation doses can be localised within the tumour
      with the consequence of minimal side effects. 32P is a radionuclide ideal for brachytherapy
      as it has high energy beta emitting properties, typically a maximum tissue range of about 8
      mm and a half life of 14.3 days. 32P BioSiliconTM is an active implantable medical device
      encapsulating 32P within the internal microcrystalline structure of highly pure inert silicon
      and acts as a sealed source for the provision of 32 phosphorous.

      Tumours targeted with 32P BioSiliconTM are hypothesized to show a reduction in volume with a
      low incidence of side effects associated with the treatment. Prolongation of survival and
      improved quality of life would be favourable outcomes of the investigational product.

      The study will enroll between 48 to 50 patients from all sites. Patients will be enrolled
      sequentially into the three groups, starting wth Group 1 which will investigate the lower
      radioactivity level and then progress to a higher radioactivity level in Group 2 and then
      Group 3. The approval to enrol patients into the next group will be assessed and determined
      by a Data Monitoring Board. All patients will be followed up to 52 weeks from the start date
      of primary implantations.

      Patients will receive intratumoural implantations of 32P BioSiliconTM under imaging guidance
      and local anaesthesia by designated interventional radiologists, using the SIMPL needle or
      conventional needles depending on the size and location of the tumour as assessed by the
      designated interventional radiologists. There are only a designated number of sites that will
      perform the implantation procedure although there are multiple sites recruiting and following
      up with patients.

        -  Tumour assessment, tumour calculation and measurement will be performed by an
           independent radiologist. CT scans from all participating sites will be sent in DICOM
           format to the designated radiologist for assessment.

        -  Safety assessment and grading of CTCAE will be performed by the same investigator for
           that same patient throughout the entire study period. There will be an interim analysis
           when all patients complete 24 weeks evaluating the safety profile and target tumour
           response of the patients.

        -  32P BioSiliconTM will be prepared by designated personnel licensed to handle radioactive
           products and all radioactive waste will be handed and managed as per the institution's
           guidelines and in compliance with local regulatory requirements.
