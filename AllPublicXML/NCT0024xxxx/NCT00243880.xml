      The purpose of this dose escalation study is to evaluate the use of lovastatin for the
      treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neuroprotection with Statin Therapy for Acute Recovery Trial (Neu-START) is part of the
      Specialized Program on Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS). The overall goals
      of SPOTRIAS are to enhance delivery of acute stroke patient care with a focus on high-risk,
      disadvantaged populations, train acute stroke translational researchers, and conduct 3
      innovative acute stroke projects.

      Neu-START will enroll 33 patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 24 hours of
      onset. In the trial, investigators will treat the patients within 24 hours of symptom onset
      with short term high-dose lovastatin at escalating dosage. The escalating dosage levels will
      be 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 mg/kg per day for 3 days. Lovastatin is in a class of drugs called
      statins, used for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. Patients will
      be followed for 30 days for clinical and laboratory outcome events.

      The goals of this trial are to determine if lovastatin in increasing doses from 1 mg/kg to 10
      mg/kg daily for 3 days beginning 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke can be administered
      safely, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin administered at high doses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18

          -  Satisfies the criteria for ischemic stroke: acute focal neurological deficit of likely
             ischemic vascular origin.

          -  Patient or legally authorized representative has provided written informed consent
             prior to study entry.

          -  Patient can receive the first treatment dose within 0-24 hours of stroke onset. For
             patients found with stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke occurred
             the last time that the patient was known to be normal.

          -  Patient has pretreatment brain CT scan compatible with ischemic stroke and excludes
             hemorrhagic and non-vascular etiologies of symptoms.

          -  Patients taking statins at time of stroke may be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Brain imaging study shows a lesion other than ischemic stroke that could explain
             patient's symptoms (intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage, arteriovenous
             malformation, aneurysm, multiple sclerosis, tumor, abscess or other). Asymptomatic
             meningiomas are allowed.

          -  Patient had a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) with residual deficit within 1 month
             prior to treatment.

             intra-arterial rt-PA within 6 hours of stroke onset, according to our institutional
             standard of care.
