      RATIONALE: Estrogen may cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      fulvestrant may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fulvestrant works in treating patients with
      advanced prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if the prostate-specific antigen objective response (complete and partial
           response) rate is &gt; 0.2 in patients with androgen-independent advanced prostate cancer
           treated with fulvestrant.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 0, 14, and 28. Courses repeat once a
      month in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
