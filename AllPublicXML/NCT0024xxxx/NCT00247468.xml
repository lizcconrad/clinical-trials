  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to improve morbidity and mortality of high-risk critically ill
      children. Our hypothesis is that a strict ICU glucose control protocol will decrease
      morbidity and mortality associated with hyperglycemia in a population of high-risk critically
      ill pediatric patients.
