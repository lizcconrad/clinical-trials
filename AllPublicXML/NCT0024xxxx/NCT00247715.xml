  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine which treatment strategy, the step-up or the
      step-down treatment strategy, is the most cost-effective treatment for patients with new
      onset dyspepsia in primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspepsia is very common in the population. On an annual basis, 20%-40% of the general
      population suffers from upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The prevalence of dyspepsia
      presenting in primary care is about 3%, on average 24% of these patients are referred for
      secondary care in the same year. In spite of consensus statements and guidelines, the most
      effective treatment strategy for managing dyspepsia in primary care remains to be determined.
      In 2000 the Health Council of the Netherlands published some advice for the Minister of
      Health, Welfare and Sport with special consideration to the most cost-effective strategies
      for the management of dyspepsia. The Health Counsel Committee agrees in general with the
      existing guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners to start with empirical
      treatment. However, the committee concluded that more research is necessary for management of
      dyspepsia in primary care, especially in uninvestigated patients as most research has been
      conducted in patients with persistent dyspeptic symptoms referred for secondary care.

      Comparison: In this study empirical treatment according to the existing guidelines of the
      Dutch College of General Practitioners (the step-up treatment strategy) is compared to a
      step-down treatment strategy. According to this step-down treatment strategy the patient
      begins treatment with a proton pomp inhibitor, which is an expensive acid-suppressor and is
      often prescribed by general practitioners.

      Step-up strategy: Algeldrate-magnesium oxide, in case of persisting/relapsing symptoms
      continued with ranitidine, if necessary continued with pantoprazole.

      Step-down strategy: Pantoprazole, in case of persisting or relapsing symptoms continued with
      ranitidine, if necessary continued with algeldrate-magnesium oxide.
