    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:

      1.1 To determine the efficacy of liposomal 9-Nitro-20 (S)-Camptothecin (L9NC) administered by
      aerosolization to patients with metastatic endometrial cancer.

      1.2 To determine toxicity profile of L9NC administered by aerosolization for 5 consecutive
      days per week X 8 weeks, every 10 weeks.

      1.3 To perform a pharmacology study of L9NC in the plasma and the lungs after aerosolization.
      A specific protocol will be written for this part.

      RATIONALE: Camptothecin (CPT) is a plant alkaloid isolated from Camptotheca acuminata in
      1966. As a topoisomerase I inhibitor, it has powerful anticancer properties and has been used
      clinically in the treatment of a variety of cancers. It possesses significant toxicity,
      especially involving the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract that has limited its use.
      Derivatives of 20-(S)-camptothecin have been made to increase the aqueous solubility of these
      compounds and/or modify the A-ring to increase membrane association. The 9-nitrocamptothecin
      (9-NC) derivative to be used in this study is insoluble in water, but has demonstrated potent
      antitumor effects in mice and antitumor effect in humans. However, the therapeutic index is
      low. In order to increase the therapeutic index, a liposomal formulation has been developed,
      which can be administered as an aerosol. In humans, dose of 0.52 mg/m2/day 5 days per weeks
      for eight 8 weeks of a 10 week course were well tolerated in the Phase I study. Partial
      responses were noted in patients with endometrial cancers. The recommended starting dose of
      L9NC in the Phase II study is 0.52 mg/m2/day to be administered once a day by aerosol
      (mouth-only breathing) for five consecutive days per week x 8 weeks followed by a 2 week
      rest. Courses are 10 weeks. This dose corresponds to approximately 1/6 of the MTD of oral
      9-NC administered to untreated cancer patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  All patients, 18 years of age or older, with metastatic and/or recurrent endometrial
             cancer or with mixed mesenchymal malignant tumors whose epithelial component is
             recurring, who have failed standard chemotherapy or hormonal regimens for their
             disease or who refuse recommended standard chemotherapy are eligible.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent.

          -  Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined by an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count of &gt;1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 and absence of a
             regular red blood cell transfusion requirement.

          -  Patients should have adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and
             SGOT or SGPT &lt; two times the upper limit of normal, and adequate renal function as
             defined by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients must not have a known symptomatic respiratory disease other than cancer, and
             must have a pulmonary function test equal to &gt;50% forced expiratory volume in 1 second
             (FEV1), &gt;50% FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), &gt;50% total lung capacity (TLC), and
             &gt;50% diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of predicted values.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this study.

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial. Patients of child
             bearing potential must use adequate contraception.

          -  Patients may receive no other concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy during this
             trial.

          -  Patients with severe medical problems such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or
             cardiovascular disease or active infections are not eligible for this trial.

          -  Any criteria that is borderline and may lead to ineligibility will be reviewed by the
             principal investigator (PI), who may override the eligibility criteria, after
             receiving sponsor agreement, if entry into the study is deemed to potentially benefit
             the patient.
