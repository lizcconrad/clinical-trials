      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 650 mg and 1300 mg
      acetaminophen extended release given three times a day for the relief of signs and symptoms
      of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee for a period of 12 weeks.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and
      effectiveness of 650 mg and 1300 mg acetaminophen extended release given three times a day as
      compared with placebo, for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or
      knee for a period of 12 weeks. Propoxyphene Hydrochloride capsules 65 mg are used as rescue
      medication if subjects experience inadequate pain relief. The primary efficacy assessments
      are the average change from baseline to the final on-therapy visit for the WOMAN pain
      subscale score and the WOMAC physical function subscale scare, and the subject's average
      global assessment of their response to therapy through the final on-therapy visit. Safety
      assessments at study visits consist of monitoring adverse events, vital signs, study joint
      assessments and clinical laboratory determinations. The hypothesis is that 1950 mg per day
      and/or 3900 mg per day acetaminophen extended release are superior to placebo for the relief
      of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee with respect to all three
      primary efficacy endpoints. Treatment consisted of either one 650 mg acetaminophen extended
      release caplet plus one placebo caplet (acetaminophen 1950 mg group); two 650 mg
      acetaminophen extended release caplets (acetaminophen 3900 mg group); or two placebo caplets
      administered orally every eight hours for 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomats of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee for a minimum of six months

          -  History of hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis requiring the use of NSAIDs,
             acetaminophen, or another analgesic agent on a regular basis (&gt;= three days per week)
             for at least three months before the screening visit

          -  History of positive therapeutic benefit with acetaminophen use for osteoarthritis pain

          -  History of osteoarthritis pain (moderate, moderately severe, or severe) of the hip or
             knee when not taking osteoarthritis analgesic medication

          -  Must have a pain level of moderate or moderately severe for 24 hours over the previous
             24 hours prior to the baseline visit, and at baseline, demonstrate a 20% or greater
             increase in the pain subscale score, relative to the score at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of surgery, including arthroscopy, or major trauma to the study joint in the
             previous six months before the screening visit

          -  Grade 1 or grade 4 severity of the study joint based on the Kellgren and Lawrence
             radiographic criteria

          -  Maximum osteoarthritis pain intensity of none, mild or severe experienced over the
             previous 24 hours of the baseline visit

          -  Signs of clinically important active inflammation of the study knee joint including
             redness, warmth and/or a large, bulging effusion with the loss of normal contour at
             the screening and/or baseline visits
