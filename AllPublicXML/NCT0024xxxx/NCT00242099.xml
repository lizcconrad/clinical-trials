  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and -7 (HHV-7) infections are common after transplantation. Such
      infections may predispose transplant patients to other infections, contribute to a recurrence
      of hepatitis C virus, and affect rejection and function of the transplanted liver. Given the
      significant clinical impact of these viruses, routine laboratory monitoring may be beneficial
      by identifying patients who have persistent or high levels of infection. In these patients,
      immunosuppressive medications could be adjusted, or antiviral medications administered. There
      are currently no randomized trials that address this important question. This prospective,
      randomized trial will analyze whether routine laboratory monitoring for HHV-6 and -7 is
      clinically useful, and whether it would improve overall outcomes in transplant recipients.
