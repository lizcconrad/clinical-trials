  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess equivalence in the rates of functional graft survival at 12 months after
      transplantation in patients receiving induction therapy with cyclosporin (CsA, Neoral) and
      Rapamune® followed by CsA dose reduction and concentration-controlled Rapamune® versus
      induction with CsA and Rapamune® followed by discontinuation of CsA and
      concentration-controlled Rapamune®.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: = to ≥ 18 years.

          -  End-stage renal disease, with patients scheduled to receive a primary or secondary
             renal allograft from a cadaveric donor, from a living-unrelated donor, or from a
             living-related donor.

          -  Patients with second and subsequent transplants must have maintained their primary
             graft for at least 6 months after transplantation (with the exception of graft failure
             due to technical reasons).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active systemic or localised major infection prior to initial Rapamune®
             administration.

          -  Evidence of infiltrate, cavitation, or consolidation on chest x-ray obtained during
             screening.

          -  Use of any investigational drug or treatment up to 4 weeks prior to enrolling in the
             study and during the 12-month treatment phase. Exception: the use of erythropoiesis
             stimulating products. In these cases, erythrocyte-stimulating products must be
             discontinued prior to administration of Rapamune®.
