  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study primarily determined the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of vosaroxin
      (SNS-595) in 2 dose schedules, and assessed the PK profile of vosaroxin and defined a
      recommended dose regimen for Phase 2 studies. Secondarily the study assessed potential
      biomarkers and antileukemic activity.

    <textblock>
      Patients assigned to 1 of 2 schedules (A and B) in cohorts of at least 3 patients received
      vosaroxin (SNS-595) intravenously (IV) for up to 4 cycles: once weekly (Days 1, 8, 15 in
      Schedule A) or twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, 11 in Schedule B). Dose escalation proceeded
      independently for Schedule A (18 mg/m2 initially) and Schedule B (9 mg/m2 initially) in the
      absence of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) based on a modified Fibonacci sequence. The incidence
      of DLT during Cycle 1 determined the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) allowing for treatment
      delays of up to 14 days to resolve clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or
      related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and one dose reduction of 25% in case of
      above. Patients with stable disease, hematologic improvement, or partial remission with
      stable blast counts or experiencing clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator were
      eligible to receive vosaroxin for up to 4 additional cycles.
