  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to test whether or not the commonly used medication frusemide,
      given after heart surgery, and aiming to increase urinary output can have an effect on kidney
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive standard supportive care based on current established management
      practice of cardio-thoracic patients. The only difference in treatment will be the
      randomisation of patients to receive/not receive protocolised administration of frusemide
      targeting a urine output.

      There will be 2 groups of patients. The control group-which will receive frusemide bolus
      doses if required as determined by the surgeon/consultant physician. The frusemide infusion
      group-which will be monitored to achieve a trial specified hourly urine output target range
      of 1-2mls/kg/hour. In order to achieve this target the patient may need to receive a loading
      dose of frusemide and may also then require a frusemide infusion. The aim will be to maintain
      the urine output within the target range for the first 48 hours after cardiac surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients admitted for cardiac surgery will be assessed for eligibility. Participants
        will be approached for inclusion, from the pre-admission clinics and wards of the
        Cardiothoracic surgery unit. Potential participants will be identified by the daily review
        of planned cardiothoracic surgery schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Already in established dialysis dependent chronic renal failure.

          2. Known allergy to frusemide

          3. Age &lt; 18 years

          4. Pregnant
