  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of diseases lead to a so called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This
      excessive response is self-destructive and leads to major complications of the initial
      disease: dysfunction of the microcirculation, systemic vasodilation, and increased capillary
      leakage and oedema. Animal studies have shown that pre-treatment with endotoxin
      (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) suppress the excessive immune response and when rechallenged, the
      animal survive a normally lethal dose of endotoxin.

      Besides a diminished cytokine response, an increased production of leucocytes in the bone
      marrow and an increased phagocytosis after pre-treatment with endotoxin is seen. The
      combination of these factors: diminished systemic inflammatory response and increased
      cellular immunity makes that endotoxin tolerance is a useful tool for preventing the
      complications after an excessive inflammatory response.

      Further, the presence of cross-tolerance has also been shown: Endotoxin tolerant mice survive
      more after induction of a normally lethal fungal infection. Endotoxin tolerance is also
      protective for ischemia/reperfusion injury in kidneys, heart and liver. Little data is known
      about endotoxin tolerance in human.

      The purpose of this study is to induce a state of tolerance through 2 different
      administration schedules and monitor the effect of tolerance on pro- and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines, other inflammatory parameters and different proteins involved in the signalling
      pathway. The effects of tolerance on vascular reactivity will be determined. Finally, the
      effect of tolerance on ischemia-reperfusion injury will be investigated.
