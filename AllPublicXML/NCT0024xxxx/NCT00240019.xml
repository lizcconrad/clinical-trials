  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor drugs are now standard therapy for patients with
      diabetic nephropathy. The hypothesis of this study is that adding a diuretic agent
      (furosemide) will decrease the urine protein, which is a sign of disease, more than an
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor alone.
