      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of an early supervised
      aerobic exercise program for patients following a minor ischemic stroke. Patients after a
      minor ischemic stroke would be randomized within 1-3 weeks of stroke onset to a control group
      (6 weeks of low intensity stretching and coordination exercises followed by a supervised
      aerobic training program) or an experimental group (immediate aerobic training program).
      Patients will be evaluated for measures of ambulation endurance, mobility, gait, functional
      assessment and clinical follow-up after 6 weeks and again 3 months later.
