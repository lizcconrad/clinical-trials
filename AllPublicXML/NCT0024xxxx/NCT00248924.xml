  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective study is to document the impact of social service
      interventions (including meals, telephone reassurance, and friendly visiting)provided by the
      Burden Center, a model community social service agency, on overall quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific outcomes include mental and physical function as measured by the SF-36, and
      depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D depression scale. The hypothesis is that a
      multicomponent social service intervention program that provides social support and reduces
      social isolation can prevent depression and decline in quality of life in this vulnerable
      population.
