      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PI-88 to inhibit or reduce tumor
      recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following hepatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although early diagnosis and treatment improve survival, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
      rarely cured and recurs frequently after regional therapy or transplantation. Hepatic
      resection can improve 5-year recurrence-free survival by up to 25%. Micrometastases of HCC
      have been detected by molecular techniques in 88% of patients at the time of surgery, and
      probably cause postoperative recurrence. Efforts to reduce the risk of recurrence after a
      curative resection have been tried, including various regimens of adjuvant and neoadjuvant
      therapy.

      In this study , an anti-angiogenic agent, PI-88, is being used as an adjuvant therapy for HCC
      patients after curative hepatic resection. The efficacy endpoints, including tumour
      non-recurrence rate, time to first recurrence and 1-year survival rate are being evaluated.
      Several risk factors associated with tumour recurrence are also being analysed.

      There are two stages to this study. In stage 1 there are three arms - untreated control and
      two arms are two different PI-88 dose. In stage 2 the better of the two PI-88 arms will be
      continued against the control arm.
