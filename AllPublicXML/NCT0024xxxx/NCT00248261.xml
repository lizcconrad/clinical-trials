  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, such as sertraline, are the medication of choice in
      post-traumatic stress disorder. However, it takes several weeks before they ameliorate
      symptoms. Therefore, we will add ziprasidone (vs. placebo) medication during the first four
      weeks of sertraline in order to find out if this strategy accelerates symptomatic relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A current problem in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD is that the medication of choice, serotonin
      re-uptake inhibitors, take several weeks before they show considerable effects on PTSD
      symptoms. Addition of typical neuroleptics, such as ziprasidone, offers a potential strategy
      to bring about a faster symptomatic relief, because they display anxiolytic properties
      without the risk of dependence. Therefore, in addition to standard sertraline therapy (at
      least 8 weeks), we will give ziprasidone vs. placebo over the first four weeks in a
      double-blind randomized design.
