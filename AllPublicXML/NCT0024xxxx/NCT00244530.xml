  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare renal function (51Cr-EDTA clearance) 48 hours post open-heart surgery (coronary
      bypass or valve surgery) in patients with impaired renal function after randomization to
      either nifedipine infusion at start of surgery and the following 24 hours or placebo (0.9%
      saline infusion). Study hypothesis is that nifedipine has a prophylactic effect on decline in
      renal function.
