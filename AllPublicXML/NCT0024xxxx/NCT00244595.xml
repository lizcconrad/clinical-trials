  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to describe candesartan cilexetil antihypertensive effects
      in terms of achieved blood pressure and hypertension control rates and the relationship
      between subject characteristics and antihypertensive efficacy, and between antihypertensive
      therapy (candesartan cilexetil dose and add-on treatments) and efficacy over a 1 year
      treatment period in hypertensive children ages 6 to &lt; 17 years; to describe growth in terms
      of height and weight in the study population; to describe change in neurocognition as
      assessed by the Full Scaled IQ score in a subset of study subjects; to determine the
      pharmacokinetics of candesartan in hypertensive paediatric subjects ages 6 to &lt; 17 years; and
      to describe safety including adverse events and adverse events necessitating study drug
      discontinuation including dose level and dose duration relationships and growth over a 1 year
      period in hypertensive children age 6 to &lt; 17 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subjects must have fulfilled the eligibility criteria for and have participated in
             Study 261A or did not participate in Study 261A but meet the following criteria:

          -  Diagnosed and untreated hypertension, or

          -  Diagnosed and treated, but off antihypertensive treatment for at least 2 days with a
             mean sitting systolic blood pressure and/or sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95th
             percentile and ≤ 20 mm Hg (systolic) and/or 10 (diastolic) mm Hg above the 95th
             percentile based on height-adjusted charts for age and gender.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (post-menarche), must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test and adhere to a pregnancy prevention method (abstinence, a barrier
             method plus a spermicidal foam or an oral or implanted contraceptive).

          -  A signed informed consent by a parent or a legal guardian and an assent form signed by
             the subject (if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any situation, clinical condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of
             the investigator or sponsor, may interfere with the subject's participation in the
             study or would pose a significant risk to the subject or interfere with the assessment
             of safety and efficacy endpoints.

          -  Hypertension secondary to coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism,
             Cushing's syndrome, or medications (eg: corticosteroids).

          -  Known history of bilateral renal artery stenosis, unilateral renal artery stenosis or
             a renal transplant.

          -  Glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50 mL/min based on an estimated value using the Schwartz
             Formula.

          -  Nephrotic syndrome not in remission.

          -  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

          -  Known bleeding, coagulation, or platelet disorder that could interfere with blood
             sampling.

          -  Clinically significant valvular heart disease.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of heart failure.

          -  Clinically significant arrhythmia (eg, any arrhythmia requiring medical therapy or
             that causes symptoms).

          -  Second or third degree AV block.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding an infant.

          -  Impaired liver function defined as either acute liver disease or chronic liver disease

             reference range for AST or ALT.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to ARBs.

          -  Unable to be off antihypertensive medication (diuretics, beta blockers, ACE
             Inhibitors, etc) for 6-weeks.

             e.g. systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Currently using, or used within 14 days prior to receiving double-blind medication,
             any concomitant medications which in the opinion of the investigator could negatively

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements including blood sampling and
             swallowing study drug tablets.
