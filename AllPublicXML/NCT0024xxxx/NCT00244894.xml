      RATIONALE: Acupuncture may help relieve hot flashes in patients with prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well acupuncture works in treating hot flashes
      in patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing androgen deprivation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the impact of acupuncture therapy on the frequency and intensity of hot
           flashes and the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen
           deprivation.

        -  Determine if blood serotonin and urinary 5-HIAA are increased in patients treated with
           acupuncture.

        -  Determine if plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and MHPG are reduced in patients
           with hot flashes due to androgen deprivation treated with acupuncture.

        -  Determine the ability of tongue diagnosis, a traditional Chinese clinical assessment
           method, to predict clinical and biological changes in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of acupuncture on insomnia and loss of vitality caused by hot
           flashes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo acupuncture for 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks and then once
      weekly for an additional 6 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10, and then at 6 weeks after
      completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Acupuncture treatments will be administered by a qualified practitioner twice a week for the first four weeks and once per week for an additional 6 weeks. Sterile, disposable Seirin needles will be placed bilaterally at the point Gallbladder 34, and along the spine at Bladder 15, Bladder 23, and Bladder 32. Low intensity electrostimulation at 2 Hz will be used for both Bladder 23 and Bladder 32. Points will also be placed unilaterally at Governing vessel 20, Heart 7, Pericardium 6, Liver 2, and Spleen 6</description>
