          2. Extra-laryngeal tumour or laryngeal tumour that is inoperable (not resectable)
             considered by Head and Neck Cancer Committee

          3. Stage III-IV (IVa and IVb) disease

          4. Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria

          5. Aged 18 years or older

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1

          7. Normal renal, haematological (neutrophils &gt;1´5 x 109/ L and platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L)
             and liver function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Previous treatment for initial disease (neck dissection in N3 is allowed) 2. Other
             co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with the
             exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ 3. Incomplete healing
             from previous oncologic or other surgery 4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than
             1.5 x 109/ L, or platelets less than 100x 109/L 5. Serum bilirubin greater than 1.25
             times the upper limit of reference range (ULRR) 6. In the opinion of the investigator,
             any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g. unstable or
             uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal disease) 7. Serum creatinine
             greater than 1.25 times the ULRR 8. ALT or AST greater than 2.5 times the ULRR 9.
             Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial 10. Active dermatoses (e.g.
             psoriasis, eczema) 11. Corneal abnormalities (other than scars, congenital abnormality
             or corneal tear film), history of dry eye syndrome or ocular surface diseases and
             neurological disorders 12. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates,
             rifampicin or drugs with known corneal toxicity 13. Pregnancy or breastfeeding (women
