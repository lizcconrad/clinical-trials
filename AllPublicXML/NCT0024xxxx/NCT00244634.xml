      Study 261A is a dose-ranging and safety study of candesartan cilexetil. It is a
      multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study with a 4 week treatment period in hypertensive pediatric subjects.

      Subjects undergo a screening evaluation, then a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in after
      which eligible subjects are allocated to receive 1 of 3 dose levels of candesartan cilexetil
      or placebo. The study includes 2 panels based on subject weight.

      The primary efficacy analysis is based on the intent-to-treat population and tests for slope
      = 0 in a linear regression model with change in sitting systolic blood pressure as the
      dependent and non-zero dose pooled across weight panels as the independent variable. For
      subjects without a Double-Blind Week 4 blood pressure determination, carrying the last value
      forward assigns the value.

      Additional analyses will include data pooled from a similar dose ranging study conducted in
      children 1 to &lt; 6 years of age.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ages 6 to &lt; 17 years-of-age after parent or guardian's signing of
             informed consent.

        Subjects with hypertension that is either:

          -  Diagnosed and untreated with a mean sitting systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥
             95th percentile and ≤ 20 mm Hg (systolic) and/or 10 mm Hg (diastolic) above the 95th
             percentile at randomisation based on height-adjusted charts for age and gender; or

          -  Previously diagnosed and currently treated with mean sitting systolic blood pressure
             and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95th percentile and ≤ 20 mm Hg (systolic) and/or 10
             mm Hg (diastolic) above the 95th percentile at randomisation (off treatment) based on
             height-adjusted charts for age and gender.

        Females of childbearing potential (post-menarche) must have a negative urine pregnancy test
        prior to randomization and adhere to a pregnancy prevention method (abstinence, barrier
        method plus spermicidal foam, oral, or implanted contraceptive).

        A signed informed consent by a parent or a legal guardian and an assent form signed by the
        subject (if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any situation, clinical condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of
             the investigator or sponsor, may interfere with the subject's participation in the
             study or would pose a significant risk to the subject or interfere with the assessment
             of safety and efficacy endpoints.

          -  Hypertension secondary to coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism,
             Cushing's syndrome, or medications (eg: corticosteroids).

             a renal transplant.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to ARBs.

          -  Unable to be off antihypertensive medication (diuretics, beta blockers, ACE
             Inhibitors, etc) for 6-weeks.

          -  Inability to discontinue medications which may contribute to elevated blood pressure
             e.g. systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Currently using, or used within 14 days prior to receiving double-blind medication,
             any concomitant medications which in the opinion of the investigator could negatively

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements including blood sampling and
