      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ACZONE™ gel compared
      to placebo (inactive substance), MetroGel® and a combination of ACZONE™ gel and MetroGel® for
      the treatment of rosacea.

      ACZONE™ gel, 5% is a topical (applied to the skin) medication that is approved by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acne vulgaris in people 12
      years and older. The use of ACZONE™ for the treatment of rosacea is investigational. An
      investigational use is one that is not approved by the FDA.

      Subjects will apply the study treatment for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments will be performed
      at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Laboratory assessments will be conducted at baseline
      and Week, 2, 4 and 12.
