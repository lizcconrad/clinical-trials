  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a novel distance-based (telephone) intervention to help
      transplant candidates with current or recent substance abuse to stay &quot;clean and sober&quot; both
      prior and following transplant surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who need a liver or renal transplant and who are ineligible due to current or
      recent (past 6 months) alcohol and/or other drug abuse are being recruited from the
      transplant programs at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (renal), Columbia Presbyterian
      Hospital (renal/liver) and Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (liver). Baseline
      and follow-up computer-assisted assessments and structured clinical interviews along with
      collection of biological samples (urine, hair) will occur in the transplant clinics; however,
      phone counseling sessions originate at St. Luke's. Participants are randomly assigned to one
      of two treatments: (1) usual care (no phone counseling) or (2) usual care + counseling. The
      telephone counseling sessions are designed to help participants become motivated to remain
      abstinent and improve other health behaviors such as sleep or stress management.
