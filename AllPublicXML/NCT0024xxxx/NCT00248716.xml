      Healthy toddlers (age 9-18 month) following a routine blood count will be placed in three
      groups:

        1. Iron deficiency with no anemia

        2. anemia

        3. no anemia and no iron deficiency Following a nutritional questionnaire, parents of all
           toddlers will receive instruction regarding appropriate nutrition in the 2nd year of
           life. Groups 1 and 2 will randomly receive one of two preparations currently in use for
           treatment of iron deficiency in Israel (Aktiron 35 - Ferrous gluconate and Ferripel-3 -
           iron polysaccharide complex). Followup blood count will be taken 3 month after
           recruitment. The study aims to compare the effectiveness of the Iron preparations
           regarding compliance and efficacy.

      The hypothesis is that a significant difference will be detected between the two
      preparations.
