      The purpose of this study is to measure the speed of microbial eradication due to
      azithromycin or telithromycin in acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS).

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the impact of therapy with telithromycin vs. azithromycin on the oral
           microflora in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis at day 42 and to compare the
           duration of colonization with resistant oropharyngeal flora in patients treated with
           azithromycin vs. telithromycin.

        -  To also compare the two treatment groups for rate of reinfection within 6 weeks and the
           susceptibility pattern of the organisms appearing during the reinfection and differences
           in development of resistance and the associated changes in symptom responses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients, either males or non-pregnant females, aged 18 to 75 years of age with
             clinical findings of acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS), who are amenable to serial
             sampling of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.

          -  Patients are required to have specimens of nasal and nasopharyngeal drainage collected
             for microbiological documentation within 24 hours prior to enrollment. All patients
             must produce sinus fluid drainage.

          -  All patients will produce nasal or nasopharyngeal discharge sufficient for baseline
             culture.

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must agree to use an accepted method of
             contraception (i.e., oral or implanted contraceptive with a barrier method, spermicide
             and barrier methods, or intrauterine device [IUD]). The patient must agree to continue
             with the same method throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of recurrent sinusitis defined as more than three episodes of
             sinusitis which required antibiotic therapy in the preceding 12 months

          -  Patients with a history of chronic sinusitis defined as symptoms lasting greater than
             28 days

          -  Patients with nosocomial acquired sinusitis (e.g., hospitalization or non-ambulatory
             institutional confinement including nursing homes within 2 weeks)

          -  Patients with a need for immediate surgery for maxillary sinusitis or previous sinus
             surgery within the past 6 months or sinus lavage within the past 7 days

          -  Patients who are long-term (&gt; 4 weeks) users of nasal decongestants (e.g.
             oxymetazoline 0.05%)

          -  Patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to, or a known or suspected
             serious adverse reaction to, any macrolide antibiotic

          -  Impaired hepatic or renal function (creatinine clearance [CCL] &lt;20 ml/min)

          -  Severe respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization and parenteral
             antibiotic therapy.

          -  Requirement for a concomitant antimicrobial agent other than topical, antiviral or
             antifungal agents.

          -  Treatment with any macrolide, azalide, or ketolide antimicrobial within the 30 days
             prior to entry into the study.
