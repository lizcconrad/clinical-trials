    <textblock>
      It is the long term objective of this study to preserve or improve the quality of life and to
      prevent deterioration in physical and mental function following myocardial revascularization
      among bypass surgery patients.

      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of two strategies of intra-operative
      hemodynamic management in preventing peri-operative cardiac, cognitive and neurologic
      morbidity and mortality and postoperative deterioration in the patient's quality of life.

    <description>Patients were randomized to one of two groups. In the first group (Low) the goal was to maintain MAP between 50-60 mm Hg during CPB. In the second group (High), the goal was to maintain MAP between 80-100 mm Hg. In both groups, CPB flow was held constant at 1.6 L/min/M2 (cool) and 2.4 L/min/M2 (warm) and vasoactive drugs (nitroglycerin or phenylephrine) were used to maintain MAP in the desired range. MAP was controlled in this fashion from the onset of CPB through separation from CPB began.</description>
