  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if a multi-faceted intervention to implement
      diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for management of suspected urinary infection in
      nursing home residents could reduce antibiotic prescribing for urinary indications in this
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic use is intense in nursing homes and frequently inappropriate when prescribed for
      urinary indications. Evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that treatment of
      asymptomatic bacteriuria, the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary
      symptoms, is not beneficial. Despite this, one in three prescriptions for urinary indications
      are for asymptomatic bacteriuria. To improve antibiotic prescribing in this setting we
      conducted a cluster randomized trial of a strategy to implement diagnostic and treatment
      algorithms for urinary infection. 24 nursing homes were randomized to either the intervention
      (implemented at the nursing home level using a multi-faceted approach: small group
      interactive sessions for nurses, one-on-one interviews for physicians, videotapes, written
      material, and outreach visits) or to usual care.
