        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have partial onset epilepsy and have been taking carbamazepine or
             phenytoin at a stable dose for a period of 4 weeks prior to the selection visit

          -  Subjects must have controlled partial onset seizures which can potentially benefit
             from adjunctive treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects dosing with LEV two weeks prior to the selection visit

          -  Subjects using more than one AED

          -  Subjects with specific and non-specific sleep disorders
