      1. We hypothesize that children in the experimental group will show a significant improvement
      over the control group as all food allergens groups and some other relevant allergenic
      substances are desensitized in a systematic way using the NAET® methodology within the
      specified period of study.

      An autism Pilot Study Using NAET (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques)

      Aim/Question:

      The principle goal of this proposed study (pilot study) is to test the efficacy of NAET®
      (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique) protocols for the treatment of Autism Spectrum
      Disorder in children between the ages of 3-10 years old, especially in the areas of improving
      language and communication skills.

      To elaborate further, the NAET® protocols uses chiropractic/acupuncture manipulation of
      spinal nerve roots to alert the nervous system about the presence of the allergen in the hand
      and thus to wake up the dormant sensory nerve fibers (the sympathetic and parasympathetic
      nerve fibers) that carry messages from the periphery to the association cortex of the brain,
      through spinal nerves of the body, as well as from the brain to the periphery and target
      organs (also known as afferent and efferent nerves). This is followed by acupressure massage
      on specific acupuncture points to balance the energy of the entire nervous system. Avoidance
      of the treated allergen/substance for 24 hours after treatment completes the NAET® treatment
      protocol.

      When we enroll them into NAET program, most of them are nonverbal and non-communicable. But
      by the time they complete 10 to 15 NAET basic treatments for an allergy to essential
      nutrients, most of them start verbal and nonverbal communications, social interactions,
      playing with other children, improve sleep, reduce restlessness, reduce irritability, reduce
      abnormal body movements like flapping hands, pulling hair, etc., and start behaving like
      normal children. When they finish the complete NAET program most of them become normal again.

      The complete NAET program usually takes about 75-100 office visits over a span of couple of
      years.

      Method:

      The NAET® method has been highlighted in literature (Nambudripad DS: Say Goodbye to Illness,
      Third Edition, Delta Pub 1999, 136-137; Nambudripad DS: Say Good-bye to Allergy-related
      Autism. Delta Pub 2001; The Journal of NAET Energetics and complementary medicine 1 (1)
      76-79, 2005, The Journal of NAET Energetics and complementary medicine 1 (1) 85-86, 2005,
      Tsering: Natural Health 29 (6) 80-85, 1999, and and Teuber and Porch-Curren: Curr Opin
      Allergy Clin Immunol 3:217-221, 2003).

      NARF IRB Approval:

      After the design and conceptualization of this clinical project, a summary of the project was
      submitted to the Nambudripad's Allergy Research Foundation Institutional Review Board. The
      NARF IRB will study the project and would meet to discuss the pros and cons of this project.
      There will be external physicians whose specialization would include pediatrics and child
      welfare to evaluate the project and the ethical treatment to children. (The board after
      asking several questions approved this study unanimously in October 2004. The Board also
      requested for periodic (every six months) updates on the progress of this project).
