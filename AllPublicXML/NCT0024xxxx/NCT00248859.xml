    <textblock>
      This is an observational study among Latino patients who have coronary artery disease. The
      goal of the study is to determine the association between having depressive symptoms and the
      ability to modify one's health behavior. Specifically, participate in physical activity.

      Specific aims: Among 213 Latino adult patients who have had coronary artery angioplasty
      within the past month, the specific aims of the proposed study are:

        1. To determine whether patients who have more depressive symptoms at the time of
           angioplasty are less likely to be active in physical activity at two years. Physical
           activity will be measured by a survey that asks patients to describe their activities
           including leisure activities or housework.

        2. To determine whether lower perceived social support, lower self-efficacy for engaging in
           physical activity, and greater perceived stress mediate the effects of depressive
           symptoms on participation in physical activity.

      Long-term objectives: The long-term objective of this study is to use these data to develop a
      culturally tailored intervention to increase participation in physical activity and
      ultimately improve the overall health and well being of Latino adults with coronary artery
      disease.

      Outcome: The outcome is being in the action or maintenance stage of physical activity two
      years after angioplasty The stage of physical activity participation will be based on the
      Stages of Change model. This model describes behavior change as a continuum from
      pre-contemplation to contemplation.
