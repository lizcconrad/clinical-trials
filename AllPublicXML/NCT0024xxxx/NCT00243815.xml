  <brief_summary>

      This research will determine whether prophylactic use of ibuprofen can prevent common side
      effects of the copper intrauterine device (IUD) and prevent early removal of the device.

    <textblock>
      Increased menstrual bleeding and pain are the primary side effects that lead to early removal
      of the copper intrauterine device (IUD). Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs are a proven treatment for such IUD-induced problems. This study will determine if
      prophylactic use of ibuprofen can improve continuation rates of the IUD.

      A total of 2,019 first-time IUD users were recruited in Chile for this double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Half of the participants were given ibuprofen and
      instructions to take 1200 mg daily during menses (for up to 5 days each cycle) for the first
      six months of IUD use. The other half were asked to take an identical-appearing placebo in
      the same manner. The primary study endpoint was IUD removal within 12 months of insertion.
