  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa is increasingly difficult. Resistance to
      cheap efficient antimalarial drugs poses an increasing threat. The rapid emergence of
      resistance to sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine, already seen in East Africa is growing and is
      likely to have an striking impact on mortality in many other African regions where no obvious
      alternatives are available. WHO recommends the use of drug combinations containing
      artemisinin compounds, i.e., artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). Previous clinical
      trials have shown that the combination of artesunate with mefloquine is highly effective and
      well tolerated in the treatment of multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria, retaining the
      benefit of rapidity of action while augmenting cure rates, and apparently slowing the
      development of mefloquine resistance. Compliance with sequential combination regimen of
      antimalarial drugs is notoriously poor. Therefore, in order to limit the development of
      resistance to both drugs and ameliorate patients' compliance to antimalarial treatments, an
      optimal simultaneous combination regimen of artesunate and mefloquine in a practical single
      blister pack has been developed by Mepha Ltd. and successfully tested. The currently
      available

      Artequin dosages could only be tested in children able to swallow tablets and with a body
      weight of more than 20 kg. However, there is a great need for an Artequin formulation for
      smaller children unable to swallow tablets. The new Artequin Paediatric oral formulation is a
      flavoured, taste-masked preparation of granules of 50 mg artesunate and 125 mg mefloquine as
      a fixed-dose combination (once daily in one single Stickpack, i.e. 3 Stickpacks for a 3-day
      treatment). It is suitable for children with up to 20 kg body weight (with a range of 10-20
      kg).
