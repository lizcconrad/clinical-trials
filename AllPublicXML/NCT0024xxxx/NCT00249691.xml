    <textblock>
      Although a great amount of research has been conducted to resolve cocaine dependence, an
      effective treatment has yet to be discovered. Topiramate is a drug that was found to be
      useful in treating alcohol dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of topiramate in treating cocaine dependent individuals.

    <textblock>
      Despite considerable scientific effort in the last two decades to develop treatment for
      cocaine dependent individuals, no medication has proven to be effective for treating cocaine
      dependence. Cocaine's rewarding effects are primarily a result of altering nerve pathways
      involving dopamine, a naturally-occurring chemical in the brain. Past research has focused on
      developing medications that either block dopamine or inhibit its release. However, these
      medications have not proven effective in treating cocaine dependence. This study will
      evaluate a new strategy of treating cocaine dependence by altering dopamine's functional
      expression. Dopamine-associated expression may be mediated through inhibition of
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), another brain chemical. Topiramate is a GABA inhibitor that
      has proven effective in treating alcohol dependent individuals. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the efficacy of topiramate in treating cocaine dependent individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 300 mg per day of topiramate or
      placebo. In addition, participants will receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy for 12
      weeks. Follow-up visits will occur at 2 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 months following completion of
      treatment, and will include evaluations of cocaine use and psychosocial functioning.
