  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of OM5/LOV111859 was to evaluate efficacy and safety of Omacor (omega-3-acid
      ethyl esters) as add-on therapy to Antara (fenofibrate) and diet for the treatment of
      patients with very high triglycerides.

      The purpose of both OM5X/LOV111860 was to assess the continued efficacy and safety of
      adjunctive Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) therapy in hypertriglyceridemic subjects
      treated with fenofibrate in lowering serum triglyceride (TG) levels.
