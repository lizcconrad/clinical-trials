    <textblock>
      Multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group study, rater-blinded. Total duration of the study
      per subject is 12 weeks plus a one- to two-week screening period. There are 6 pre-planned
      visits per subject: screening visit followed by 5 visits. Approximately 300 patients
      altogether in up to 25 active German study centres and up to 3 active Lithuanian study
      centres will be randomised.
