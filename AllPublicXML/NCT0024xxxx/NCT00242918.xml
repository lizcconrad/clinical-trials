  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of
      docetaxel and ZD1839 on destroying prostate cancer before removal of the prostate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that there is a subset of patients who are at high risk for progression
      despite aggressive treatment of localized disease at the time of detection. The critical
      issue is in addressing micrometastatic disease that has already developed prior to diagnosis.
      This study utilizes daily doses of ZD1839 and weekly docetaxel for two cycles prior to
      radical prostatectomy.

      ZD1839 has demonstrated antiproliferative activity against human tumor xenografts and in
      coadministration with cytotoxic agents against prostate cell lines (PC-3 and TSU-PRI). The
      combination of ZD1839 and docetaxel has been reported to be feasible with an acceptable
      toxicity profile.

      This phase II, single center trial is specifically targeting those patients with high-risk
      adenosarcoma of the prostate.
