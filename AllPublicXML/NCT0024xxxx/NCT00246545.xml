  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of early onset of exercise training (ET) after
      myocardial infarction (MI) in a randomized controlled trial. Usual care is to wait 4-6 weeks
      after onset of MI, and our hypotheses are that early ET will prevent a fall in VO2peak and
      contribute to better quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Exercise training is well documented as effective treatment for myocardial infarction(MI)
      patients. However, the long time effect of early onset is more unclear, and it is needed to
      provide knowledge about to which extend early onset of ET contribute to reduce risk factors,
      increase oxygen consumption and influence on quality of life.

      A RCT is conducted, 60 persons with recently MI is invited to participate. The subjects
      participating is hospitalised in St. Olavs Hospital. The participants are randomised to
      either a training group or a control group. The training group will be offered hospital
      out-patient group exercise training of moderate intensity twice a week for four weeks. The
      training is leaded by a physiotherapist. The control group will wait four weeks before both
      groups continue ET twice a week for 12 weeks (high intensity training).
