  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate lapaquistat acetate, once daily (QD), taken alone or
      with additional statin therapy on cholesterol levels in treating patients with elevated
      cholesterol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated plasma cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and various other plasma lipid imbalances
      (dyslipidemias) are major risk factors for coronary heart disease. Patients with
      hypercholesterolemia have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which leads to
      atherosclerotic deposition of cholesterol in the arterial walls. As identified by the
      National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, lowering the low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduces cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality and is essential for the prevention and management of coronary heart disease.

      Currently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the
      first-line monotherapies prescribed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, after diet
      and therapeutic lifestyle change. However, low doses of statins often fail to produce the ATP
      III-recommended levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction, making it necessary
      to increase the dose or add an additional treatment. Dose increases of statins in turn may
      result in decreased tolerability and potential safety concerns which contribute to the high
      discontinuation rates of statins and their prescription at low, and often ineffective, doses.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration of lapaquistat acetate
      co-administered with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin (stable statin therapy) will
      be more efficacious in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared to lapaquistat
      or stable statin therapy alone. Total participation time in this study is anticipated to be
      24 weeks.
