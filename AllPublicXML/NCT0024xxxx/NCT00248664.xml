  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EPIC is a case/control study that seeks to identify the risk factors for interstitial
      cystitis by comparing the experiences and medical histories of 400 women who recently
      developed IC with 400 similar people who do not have the disease.

      This project is a systematic, national study of incident IC cases and controls matched by age
      and gender. By telephone interview and medical record review, we compare exposures of cases
      and controls seeking significant differences which may be risk factors for IC. This cohort of
      incident IC cases will initiate a natural history study of the disease.

      Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that certain features that precede onset of IC
      symptoms, e.g., bacterial cystitis, distinguish IC cases from controls matched for age and
      gender, and may be risk factors for the disease.

      Specific Aim 2. To test the hypotheses that patients with IC have higher prevalences of
      certain non bladder syndromes, e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, than do controls matched for
      age and gender.

      Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that urine APF, HB EGF, and/or EGF are sensitive and
      specific diagnostic markers for IC in patients with symptoms of Ã¿12 months.

      Specific Aim 4. To test the hypotheses that, in an incident cohort, patients with IC have
      remissions and that certain clinical features, e.g., bacterial cystitis at disease onset, are
      prognostic factors for remissions.
