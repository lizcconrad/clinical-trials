  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a decision aid to assist women aged 70
      years and over to make an informed choice about whether to continue screening mammography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of the study are to assess the impact of the decision aid on (1) the
      proportion of women who make an informed choice about whether to continue screening
      mammography, and (2) the participation rates of screening among women aged 70 years and
      older.

      There are two secondary aims of the study. First, to measure the effect of the decision
      support tool on women's decisional conflict, anxiety, and knowledge about the issues involved
      in screening mammography. Second, to compare relationships between a woman's objective and
      perceived risk of breast cancer with her decision to continue or stop screening mammography.

      Screening mammography is recommended for women aged 50-69 years but there is no
      recommendation for women aged 70 years and older. Therefore the decision to continue or stop
      having screening mammograms are largely dependent on the importance women place on the
      perceived benefits and harms of screening.

      The decision aid is a paper workbook and worksheet containing information on the outcomes of
      screening mammography for women aged 70 years and older (based on a published model- Barratt
      et al. 2005), steps to decision making and values clarification exercise. Currently it is not
      known if a decision aid with information about the benefits and risks of screening
      mammography can help women aged 70 years and older to make an informed choice. In addition to
      delivering benefits to individual women in assisting them to to make an informed choice the
      decision aid may lead to benefits for service providers such as improved efficiency and
      cost-effectiveness of screening women in this age group. Thus the impact of a decision aid in
      the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of screening mammography is an important but untested
      hypothesis.
