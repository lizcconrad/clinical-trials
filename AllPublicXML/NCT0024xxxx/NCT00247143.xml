  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of higher
      doses of lopinavir/ritonavir, in combination with other anti-HIV medications when
      administered as either the capsule or liquid formulations, among patients who have not had
      full viral suppression despite treatment with 3 classes of HIV medications, and at least 2
      prior courses of treatment with HIV protease inhibitors. In addition, pharmacokinetics of the
      active agents, lopinavir and ritonavir will be measured following administration of both the
      liquid and capsule formulations and compared.

      This study is a safety, efficacy, and tolerability study of high dose kaletra in patients who
      have failed multiple antiretroviral regimens, including prior treatment with 3 classes of
      antiretroviral drugs (nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, non-nucleoside analogues, and at least
      one protease inhibitor based ARV regimen), in conjunction with optimized background therapy.
      Patients will initially be treated with high dose kaletra capsules and optimized background
      therapy for 4 weeks and then switched to equivalent doses of high dose kaletra liquid
      formulation for a total duration of therapy of 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study
      will be the average HIV RNA change from baseline through 24 weeks (HIV RNA AACUMB). Secondary
      endpoints will include the proportion achieving HIV RNA &lt; 50 and HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at
      24 weeks. Changes in CD4 from baseline, change in LPV fold change in phenotypic resistance
      testing, changes in fasting metabolic parameters, assessment of safety at week 24 based upon
      hematology, chemistry, liver function, lipid levels, proportion of patients reporting adverse
      events and proportion of patients with SAEs, and demonstration of bioequivalence by 12 hour
      pharmacokinetic measurements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent prior to trial participation.

          2. HIV-1 infected males or females at least 18 years of age.

          3. Weight &gt; 60 kg and &lt; 100 kg

          4. Acceptable laboratory screening values as defined in the exclusion criteria.

          5. Three class ARV experienced, including current PI regimen for at least 12 weeks, at
             least one other PI based regimen for at least 12 weeks, treatment with at least one
             NNRTI and with at least 2 nucleoside agents.

          6. Screening Virologic Phenotype demonstrating lopinavir phenotypic fold resistance
             between 10 and 80 (if patients have had Virologic Phenotype within 8 weeks of study
             screening this may be used as the qualifying lopinavir phenotypic fold resistance).

          7. HIV-1 viral load 1000 copies/mL at screening.

          8. Acceptable screening laboratory values that indicate adequate baseline organ function.
             Laboratory values are considered to be acceptable if the following apply:

               -  Total Cholesterol ≤ DAIDS Grade 3

               -  Total Triglycerides ≤ DAIDS Grade 3

               -  ALT and AST ≤DAIDS Grade 3).

               -  Any Grade GGT is acceptable.

               -  Any Grade CK is acceptable as long as there is no concurrent myopathy.
