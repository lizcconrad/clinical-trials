        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is at least 18 years old

          2. Patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention and emergent
             coronary artery bypass graft surgery

          3. Patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a positive functional study

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before the trial procedure

          5. Patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial
             and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by
             Human Research Ethics Committee of the respective investigational site

          6. Patient agrees to comply with specified follow-up evaluations and to return to the
             same investigational site where the procedure was performed. Patients participating in
             the PK sub-study must agree to the additional follow-up procedures as required by the
             sub-study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin or bivalirudin,
             clopidogrel or ticlopidine, cobalt, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, polymer coating
             components or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated

          2. History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs such as ABT-578,
             rapamycin, tacrolimus, everolimus, or any other analogue or derivative

          3. Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³, or a white blood cell (WBC)
             count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³

          4. Serum creatinine level &gt; 170 micromol/L within 7 days prior to index procedure

          5. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended trial
             procedure (defined as: Q wave myocardial infarction or non-Q wave myocardial
             infarction having CK enzymes &gt; 2X the laboratory upper limit of normal with the
             presence of an elevated CK-MB (any amount above the laboratory upper limit of normal))

          6. Previous stenting anywhere in the target vessel

          7. PCI of the target vessel within 30 days prior to the procedure

          8. Implantation of a drug eluting stent in any non-target vessel within 30 days prior to
             the procedure. Implantation of a Cypher stent in any non-target vessel within 90 days
             prior to the procedure

          9. PCI of a non-target vessel with a bare metal stent within 30 days prior to the
             procedure that results in any MACE event. If the bare metal stent is implanted within
             72 hours prior to the procedure, a post procedural serial CK or CK-MB measurement
             above the investigational site's upper limit of normal (two below upper normal
             required for enrollment)

         10. PCI of a non-target vessel within 24 hours prior to the procedure

         11. Planned PCI of any vessel within 30 days post-procedure. Planned stenting of any
             vessel with a Cypher or Endeavor stent within 60 days post-procedure

         12. Planned PCI of the target vessel within 9 months post-procedure

         13. During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other
             than PTCA prior to stent placement

         14. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months

         15. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal bleeding within the prior 6 months

         16. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions

         17. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months

         18. Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with anti-restenotic therapies
             including, but not limited to brachytherapy

         19. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device trial that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             trial endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, IVUS or other coronary artery
             imaging procedures

         20. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% at the most recent evaluation
