  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MEMA kwa Vijana Project is a community randomised trial which aims to assess the impact
      of a targeted intervention on adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Mwanza Region,
      Tanzania. The intervention aims to reduce HIV, STD and unwanted pregnancy amongst adolescents
      by improving reproductive health knowledge and by teaching skills to promote sexual behaviour
      change, and comprises community mobilisation, skills-based education in primary schools, and
      youth friendly health services. The evaluation includes a detailed process evaluation, and
      evaluation of the impact in a cohort of approx. 10,000 adolescents who will be followed for 3
      years.

      Background: Adolescents are at high risk of adverse reproductive health outcomes, including
      HIV, other STIs and unwanted pregnancies. However, there is little empirical evidence to
      guide the choice and implementation of effective interventions. We assessed the impact of an
      intervention programme on the sexual health of adolescents in rural Tanzania.

      Methods: Using data from a prior population-based survey of 9,445 15-19 year olds, 20
      communities were stratified and randomly allocated to either receive the new interventions
      (Intervention Group) or standard interventions (Comparison Group) during Phase 1 (January
      1999-December 2001) of the MEMA kwa Vijana Project. The new intervention programme had four
      major components: community activities; teacher-led, peer-assisted sex education in the last
      three years of primary school (Years 5-7); training and supervision of health workers to
      provide “youth-friendly” STD and family planning services; and peer condom social marketing
      for youth (from January 2000). The pre-defined primary outcomes were HIV incidence and Herpes
      simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) in a cohort of 9,645 adolescents, mean age 15.5 years, [95% range
      14.1-18.3 years], who were recruited in late 1998 before entering Year 5, 6 or 7 of primary
      school. Secondary outcomes included six further biomedical, five behavioural, one
      attitudinal, and three knowledge outcomes.

      Findings: At the follow-up survey in late 2001-early 2002, the intervention had had a
      statistically significant impact on all knowledge and attitudinal outcomes and also on
      reported condom use and reported STI symptoms in both males and females. Significantly fewer
      males in the intervention communities reported sexual debut during follow-up, or having
      multiple sexual partners during the past 12 months, but no difference was seen for these two
      outcomes among females. There were only five HIV seroconversions in males. Among females, the
      adjusted rate ratio for HIV incidence (intervention vs comparison communities) was 0.76
      (95%CI: 0.35,1.65). Overall prevalences of HSV2 were 11.9% in males and 21.1% in females,
      with adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of 0.92 (95%CI:0.69,1.22) and 1.05 (95%CI:0.83,1.32)
      respectively. There was no consistent impact on the other biological outcomes, with adjusted
      PRs varying from 0.78 (95%CI:0.46,1.30) for syphilis in males to 1.94 (95%CI:1.01,3.72) for
      gonorrhoea in females. A non-significant trend towards greater beneficial impact among
      students enrolled in Year 4, who potentially received all three years of the in-school
      programme, was seen for most outcomes. The beneficial impact on knowledge and reported
      attitudes was confirmed in a cross-sectional survey in a different group of students who were
      in Year 7 of primary school in mid-2002.

      Conclusions: The intervention substantially improved knowledge, reported attitudes and
      reported condom use in both sexes, and reported sexual behaviour in males, but had no
      consistent impact on biological outcomes within the three-year trial period. The data suggest
      a dose-related effect for several outcomes, with greater impact among those receiving two or
      three years of the in-school programme.
