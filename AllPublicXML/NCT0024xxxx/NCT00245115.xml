      RATIONALE: Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and certain chemotherapy drugs,
      helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected. Treating
      stem cells collected from the patient's blood or bone marrow with chemotherapy in the
      laboratory removes any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given to
      the patient to prepare the bone marrow for stem cell transplant. The treated stem cells are
      then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the
      chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well an autologous peripheral stem cell or bone
      marrow transplant using laboratory-treated cells works in treating patients with acute
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of ex vivo expanded mafosfamide-purged CD34-positive cells for
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in patients with
           acute leukemia.

        -  Determine the duration of aplasia associated with the use of ex vivo cytokine expanded
           mafosfamide-purged cells in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Mobilization and stem cell collection: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and
           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or IV once daily for 7-14 days followed by
           leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Some patients may also
           undergo bone marrow (BM) harvest if sufficient PBSCs are not collected. Patients with a
           sufficient number of stem cells or BM (5 x 10^6 PBSC/kg or 3 x 10^8 BM cells/kg) proceed
           to autologous PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) or BM transplantation (BMT).

        -  CD34-positive cell selection and mafosfamide purging: Collected PBSCs and/or BM are
           treated in the laboratory to isolate CD34-positive cells. A minimum of 1 x 10^6
           nucleated CD34-positive BM cells/kg or 2 x 10^6 nucleated CD34-positive PBSCs/kg must be
           available after selection to proceed to mafosfamide-purging. The selected cells are then
           treated in vitro with mafosfamide to purge remaining leukemic cells. One third of the
           mafosfamide-purged cells are then cryopreserved for future use and 2/3 of the
           mafosfamide-purged cells proceed to ex vivo expansion.

        -  Ex vivo expansion: The remaining CD34-positive mafosfamide-purged cells are treated in
           vitro with stem cell factor, G-CSF, and recombinant human thrombopoietin and incubated
           for 12-14 days.

        -  Myeloablative therapy: Patients receive busulfan on days -9 to -6 and cyclophosphamide
           on days -5 to -2.

        -  PBSCT or BMT: Patients undergo autologous PBSCT or BMT using CD34-positive
           mafosfamide-purged cryopreserved cells and ex vivo expanded CD34-positive
           mafosfamide-purged cells on day 0 followed by G-CSF SC or IV once daily until blood
           counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
