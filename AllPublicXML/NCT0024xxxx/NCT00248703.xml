    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify patients with persisting tumor cells after standard
      epirubicin-containing treatment to test a non-cross resistant chemotherapy regimen
      (docetaxel) for these patients, and to explore the analysis of disseminated tumor cells in
      bone marrow as a surrogate marker for clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of disseminating (or isolated) tumor cells (DTC/ITC) in bone marrow (BM) after
      completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with poor prognosis.
      Methods for detection of DTC have potential as a tool for monitoring occult residual disease
      during follow up. Also, there exists potent chemotherapy proven to be effective when
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy fails (f.ex. docetaxel). Consequently, a study has been
      started to test DTC detection as a surrogate marker for clinical outcome in localized breast
      cancer patients, selected by the presence of DTC in BM after standard adjuvant chemotherapy,
      receiving secondary treatment with docetaxel. In brief, patients having received
      anthracycline-containing chemotherapy for localized breast cancer are candidates. After
      informed consent and no radiologic signs of distant metastasis, the first BM aspiration is
      performed at the end of radiotherapy or 8-12 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle. The
      next BM aspiration is performed 6 months later. At that time point the BMs are analyzed for
      the presence of DTC. If DTC are present in the 6 months BM test (the first BM sample is for
      exploratory research purposes), 6 cycles of docetaxel are administered (3qw), followed by a
      third and forth BM analysis 1 month and 13 months after the end of chemotherapy. The patients
      receiving docetaxel with eradication of the DTC will be clinically compared to those with
      persistence of DTC after docetaxel treatment.
