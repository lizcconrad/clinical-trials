  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the activity of the combination ZD1839,
      docetaxel and cisplatin in subjects with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer by
      estimating the objective response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) at
      study closure.
