      RATIONALE: Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lapatinib works in treating patients with
      prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer who
           experience &gt; 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment with
           lapatinib ditosylate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to PSA progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the molecular correlates and predictive biomarkers of response in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Serum samples are collected for biomarker analysis at baseline and every 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          -  On androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (either bilateral orchiectomy or
             medical castration with the testosterone level of &lt;50 ng/dl)

          -  Biochemical progression on androgen deprivation therapy with minimum PSA of 5 ng/ml.
             Progression is defined as two successive rises in PSA, measured at least one week
             apart. See section 4.1 for additional criteria.

          -  Minimum of 4-6 weeks off anti-androgen therapy (4 weeks for flutamide, 6 weeks for
             bicalutamide and nilutamide).

          -  Minimum of 4 weeks off other hormonal therapy (i.e. ketoconazole, megestrol acetate,
             aminoglutethimide)

          -  Minimum of 4 weeks from any prior radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy or other
             investigational agent.

          -  Patients must discontinue use of any herbal supplements prior to study initiation.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  A history of a positive HIV test in the past.

          -  Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication,
             malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative
             colitis).

          -  Concomitant requirement for medication classified as CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors
             (please refer to section 3.2.2 for a list of medications).

          <title>PSA</title>
          <description>Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in an individual's blood.The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per (ng/mL) of blood. In this study PSA response is defined as &gt;50% decrease in PSA from baseline for 2 successive measurements at lease 4 weeks apart.</description>

          <title>Disease Status</title>
          <description>Metastasis is the development of secondary malignant growths at a distance from a primary site of cancer. Measurable disease is the presence of at least one measurable lesion. This is based on RECIST criteria. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) is a set of published rules that defines the status of cancer in a patient. Looking at when tumors improve, stay the same, or worsen.</description>
