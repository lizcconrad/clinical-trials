  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Abilify will reduce tics (repetitive,
      uncontrollable movements or vocalizations) in children and adolescents ages 7-18 with
      Tourette's Disorder (TD) or a chronic motor tic disorder (either repetitive, uncontrollable
      movements or vocalizations).

      The aims of this study are to obtain systematic data regarding dosing and safety of
      aripiprazole (Abilify) in the treatment of youth with Tourette's Disorder (TD). Tourette's
      Disorder is characterized by multiple motor (more than one uncontrollable movement) and vocal
      tics (vocal outbursts) which have been present for more than 1 year, with onset before the
      age of 18. The disorder causes marked distress in social, occupational or other important
      areas of functioning. Abilify has been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat adults with schizophrenia but has not been approved to treat
      Tourette's Disorder (TD) so it is considered experimental or investigational in this study.

    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) is a clinical rating instrument that was designed for use in studies of Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders. The YGTSS provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic symptoms. The maximum YGTSS Global score is 100, while the maximum motor score is 25, the maximum vocal score is 25, and the maximum impairment score is 50. Higher scores indicate more severe tics.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) is a classic instrument for making global assessments. This scale yields three different measures: 1. Severity of illness (7-point scale, with 7 being the most impaired; assessment of patient's current symptom severity, referred to here as CGIs), 2. Global improvement (7-point scale, with 7 being the most impaired; comparison of patient's baseline condition with his/her current condition, referred to here as CGIi), 3. Efficacy index (4 point x 4 point rating scale, comparison of patient's baseline condition with a ratio of current therapeutic benefit to severity of side effects)</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression Severity Scores</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) is a classic instrument for making global assessments. This scale yields three different measures: 1. Severity of illness (7-point scale, with 7 being the most impaired; assessment of patient's current symptom severity, referred to here as CGIs), 2. Global improvement (7-point scale, with 7 being the most impaired; comparison of patient's baseline condition with his/her current condition, referred to here as CGIi), 3. Efficacy index (4 point x 4 point rating scale, comparison of patient's baseline condition with a ratio of current therapeutic benefit to severity of side effects)</description>
