  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral warfarin anticogulation for the prevention and treatment of patients with venous
      thromboembolism is one of the most used therapies in clinical practice. Patients require
      different dosage to achieve the target therapeutic anticoagulation. Optimal dosage and
      bleeding complication are two most clinical concerns. Besides of multiple individual factors
      (e.g. age, dietary intake, vitamin supplement, drug compliance etc.), some genetic factors
      may determine the drug requirement and safety.

      The cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 is a liver enzyme required for the oxidative metabolism of
      warfarin. The vitamin K epoxide redutase (VKOR) is a liver enzyme associated with the reuse
      of the oxidative hydroquinone form of vitamin K. The VKOR enzyme is the target of warfarin.
      Recent studies revealed both genes may determine the pharmacodynamic of warfarin
      anticogualation. To date, there are more than thirteen identified polymorphism at CYP2C9
      gene. Majority of those variant polymorphisms may decrease the warfarin requirement. The VKOR
      complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) is a newly identified gene. Some polymorphisms also were reported.

      As we know, the Chinese patients need a lower dosage of warfarin in comparison with the
      Caucasian patients. We are interested in finding the genetic causes of Taiwneses Chinese
      patients. In our study we will first identify the polymorphism patterns of these two genes in
      normal population. Then, we will try to find the association between these polymorphism and
      patient warfarin requirement. Our pharmacogenetics study will be valuable for prevention of
      bleeding complication of warfarin treatment in Chinese population.
