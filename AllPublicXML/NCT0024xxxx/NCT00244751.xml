  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of GI262570 compared to
      placebo (a pill that looks exactly like GI262570 but contains no active medicine) in
      improving specific tests that indicate the degree of liver fibrosis (scarring). Subjects who
      are enrolled in the study must have had prior treatment with interferon (either pegylated or
      standard interferon) plus ribavirin for at least 12 weeks to treat their hepatitis C, but
      either failed to clear the virus or didn't tolerate the treatment.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Liver Biopsy Immunohistochemical Marker of Hepatic Stellate Cell (HSC) Activation and Collagen Synthesis at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained at the screening visit and at Week 52. A new liver biopsy at the screening visit was not taken in the event that a previous liver biopsy taken within 120 days of the Baseline /Day 1 visit (day of first dose), and the tissue block was available. The immunohistochemical marker assessed was smooth muscle alpha-actin (aSMA). Sections of the liver biopsies were stained by standard immunocytochemical techniques using a monoclonal antibody to smooth muscle actin with 'very intense purple' as the detection chromogen. This gives a reddish-purple color to the activated stellate cells, which strongly contrasts with the rest of the tissue. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to missing. The values are presented as proportion of positive area over total area.</description>

                    -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected
                       failure rate for that method is less than 1% per year; or,

                    -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable
                       methods.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Liver Biopsy Immunohistochemical Marker of Hepatic Stellate Cell (HSC) Activation and Collagen Synthesis at Week 52</title>
        <description>A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained at the screening visit and at Week 52. A new liver biopsy at the screening visit was not taken in the event that a previous liver biopsy taken within 120 days of the Baseline /Day 1 visit (day of first dose), and the tissue block was available. The immunohistochemical marker assessed was smooth muscle alpha-actin (aSMA). Sections of the liver biopsies were stained by standard immunocytochemical techniques using a monoclonal antibody to smooth muscle actin with ‘very intense purple’ as the detection chromogen. This gives a reddish-purple color to the activated stellate cells, which strongly contrasts with the rest of the tissue. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to missing. The values are presented as proportion of positive area over total area.</description>

A new liver biopsy at the screening visit was not taken in the event that a previous liver biopsy taken within 120 days of the Baseline /Day 1 visit (day of first dose), and the tissue block was available. Morphometric analysis was performed using specimens stained with Sirius red and computerized image analysis. Sirius red was used to stain extracellular collagen in liver sections. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to missing.

        <title>Number of Participants With Change in Toxicities Grades 3 and 4 of Laboratory Parameters Over Time</title>
        <description>Clinical laboratory parameters: Alkaline phosphatase, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Total bilirubin, Cholesterol, Carbon dioxide content/Bicarbonate (CO2/HCO3), Creatinine, Glucose, Hemoglobin, Potassium, Low density lipid (LDL) cholesterol, Lymphocytes, Sodium, Segmented neutrophils, Platelet count, White blood cell (WBC) count were assessed for change in grade toxicities. Toxicities were graded as grade 1 to grade 4 in increasing order of severity of toxicity. Thus grade 4 indicating severe toxicity. Only those parameters with grade 3 and 4 toxicities are presented.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DSP)</title>
        <description>SBP and DBP readings were taken at pre-screening, pre-dose after 10 minutes of rest, at Baseline/Day 1, weeks 2, 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 52 or WD and at the 4 week follow-up visit. Day 1 (before dosing) value was considered to be as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to missing.</description>

        <description>Heart rate assessment were done at pre-screening, pre-dose after 10 minutes of rest, at Baseline/Day 1, weeks 2, 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 52 or WD and at the 4 week follow-up visit. Day 1 (before dosing) value was considered to be as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to be missing.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Serum FibroSure (FibroTest/ActiTest) Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>FibroTest was for the assessment of fibrosis. Fibro test was calculated using an original combination of five highly concentrated serum biochemical markers; alpha-2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, total bilirubin and gammaglutamyltransferase. FibroTest scores range from 0.00 to 1.00 where 0.0-0.21 is no fibrosis and &gt;= 0.59 is cirrhosis. Acti-test was calculated using 6 serum biochemical markers; alpha2macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, total bilirubin, GGT and alanine aminotransferase. ActiTest was used for the assessment of necroinflammatory activity. Test score ranges from 0.00 to 1.00, where 0.00-0.17 indicates no necrosis and &gt;= 0.61 indicates severe necrosis. Day 1 value was considered to be as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to missing.</description>

          <description>Insulin resistance was measured using Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Belfiore Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI) and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI). HOMA-IR = fasting plasma insulin*fasting plasma glucose / 22.5 and ISI = 2 / [(fasting plasma glucose from the participant / fasting plasma glucose normal reference range)*( fasting plasma insulin from the participant / fasting plasma insulin normal reference range) + 1] and QUICKI = 1/(log[fasting plasma Insulin] + log[fasting plasma glucose]). Day 1 (before dosing) value was considered to be as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post Baseline assessment minus the Baseline assessment for a given parameter. If either the Baseline or on-treatment value was missing, the change from Baseline value was also set to missing.</description>
