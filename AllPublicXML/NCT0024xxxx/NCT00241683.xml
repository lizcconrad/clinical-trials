      To determine whether or not women with a history of having a baby with intrauterine growth
      retardation (IUGR) was more likely to have risk factors for cardiovascular disease versus
      women with a pregnancy not complicated by IUGR.

      BACKGROUND:

      Intrauterine growth restriction leads to major neonatal morbidity and mortality. Moreover,
      recent birth registry studies have suggested that women bearing IUGR babies may have an
      elevated risk of cardiovascular disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This cohort study tested whether exposed women, with a previous intrauterine growth
      restriction (IUGR) baby, versus unexposed women, with a pregnancy not complicated by IUGR,
      had elevations in markers of cardiovascular risk. Exposure was defined among a geographically
      defined cohort as having had a singleton baby in the &lt; 5 %tile of weight for gestational age,
      in the absence of pre-pregnancy diabetes., hypertension, renal disease, or hypertension in
      pregnancy; controls had a singleton in the &gt; 20%tile. Four to twelve years postpartum, women
      were assessed for multiple markers of cardiovascular risk, including blood pressure, lipids,
      adiposity, glucose and insulin, homocysteine and folate, markers of inflammation, markers of
      endothelial function, markers of angiogenesis, and markers of vascular function. Data
      analysis consisted of ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses comparing the outcomes of cardiovascular
      markers among exposed and unexposed women.
