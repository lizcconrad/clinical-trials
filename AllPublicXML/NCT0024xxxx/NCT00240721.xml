  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topiramate
      compared with placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with
      Bipolar I Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of
      two dose levels of topiramate (400 and 600 milligrams/day) compared with placebo in the
      treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with Bipolar I Disorder. The trial
      consists of 3 phases: a screening period; double-blind treatment for 12 weeks; and an
      optional open-label period of at least 6 months. Assessment of effectiveness include change
      from baseline to Day 21 for the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. Also included
      during the 12 week study are the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions
      (CGI), and health-related quality of life measures at specified time intervals. Safety
      assessments include evaluation of adverse events, rate of withdrawal from the study due to
      adverse events, and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) throughout the study, as well as
      changes in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis),
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations at specified times. The study hypothesis
      is that the change from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMSR) total score at Day 21
      will be significantly better for the topiramate groups than for the placebo group. Topiramate
      tablets (50 or 100 milligrams) or placebo, beginning at 50mg daily and increasing over the
      first week to a maximum of 400mg/day or 600mg/day, depending on study group. Maximum dosage
      continues up to 12 weeks. Dosage can be decreased or increased at investigator's discretion.
