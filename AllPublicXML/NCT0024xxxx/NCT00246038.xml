      A prospective, actively controlled, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center
      clinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft
      when used in the treatment of patients with AAA (Treatment Group) as compared to patients
      treated with conventional open surgery (Control Group).

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether the Boston Scientific ENOVUS
      AAA Endograft is a safe and effective method of treating AAA's in those patients considered
      to be suitable candidates for open surgical repair. The safety of the Boston Scientific
      ENOVUS AAA Endograft will be determined by comparing the rate of major morbidity in the
      Treatment Group against the rate of major morbidity in the Control Group within 30 days of
      the initial procedure. The efficacy of the Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft will be
      determined by evaluating the proportion of patients in the Treatment Group that are free from
      AAA rupture and conversion to open surgical repair within 1 year of the initial procedure.

      The secondary safety endpoints will be compared between the Treatment and Control
      Groups:Mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year, AAA related mortality at 30 days and 1 year.
      The secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in the Treatment Group only and include:
      Technical success, enlargement of AAA, migration, significant endoleak, and loss of device
      integrity. Secondary Clinical Utility endpoints will be compared between the Treatment and
      Control groups and will include: blood loss, duration of procedure, ICU stay, length of
      hospital stay, and duration of anesthesia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
             enrollment into this study:

               1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age

               2. Females of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at the time of
                  treatment

               3. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent
                  Form

               4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate (i.e.,
                  categories I, II, or III) for elective open surgical repair of the AAA per
                  American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) refer to Appendix II. ASA grade IV
                  patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is greater than 1 year.

               5. Patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that meets at least one of
                  the following:â€¢Abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt;4.5 cm in diameter

                    -  Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months.

                    -  Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds one and one-half times the transverse
                       dimension of an adjacent normal aortic segment

               6. Patient must be willing to comply with all required follow-up exams (open
                  surgical control patients are followed through one year, Treatment Group patients
                  are followed through five years in the study with lifelong follow up by physician
                  thereafter).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that meet ANY of the following are not eligible for enrollment into the
             study:

               1. Aneurysm dissection

               2. Acutely ruptured aneurysm

               3. Acute vascular injury

               4. Need for emergent surgery

               5. Patient has a known thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.

               6. Patient has unstable angina (defined as angina characterized by progressive
                  increase in anginal symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina, or onset of
                  prolonged angina)

               7. Patient has history of connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's or
                  Ehler's-Danlos syndrome).

               8. Patient has history of bleeding disorders or refuses blood transfusions.

              10. Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulation that
                  is not amenable to pre-treatment.

              11. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or has an active systemic infection

              12. Patient is morbidly obese or has other clinical conditions that severely inhibit
                  X-ray visualization of the aorta

              14. Patient is currently participating in another investigational device or drug
                  clinical trial

              15. Patient has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the
                  opinion of the investigator, preclude them from receiving this treatment,
