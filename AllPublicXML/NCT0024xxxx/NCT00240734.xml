  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proportion of subjects receiving either Epoetin
      alfa (PROCRITÂ®) or placebo who are able to achieve a hemoglobin response, defined by at
      least a 1 gram/deciliter increase from baseline by Week 17.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study in
      diabetic subjects with the anemia of chronic kidney disease. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) or matching placebo for
      sixteen weeks. Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated
      with chronic renal failure (pre-dialysis), non-myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy,
      in HIV-infected subjects receiving zidovudine therapy, and in anemic subjects undergoing
      elective non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion
      during high-volume blood loss procedures. This study is being undertaken to assess, under
      well-controlled conditions, the effect of weekly Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) treatment on
      hemoglobin response in diabetic subjects with the anemia of chronic kidney disease. The study
      hypothesis is that weekly PROCRIT treatment will be effective in achieving a hemoglobin
      response than placebo, where hemoglobin response is defined by at least a 1 gram/deciliter
      increase from baseline by Week 17. The subjects are administered study drug (PROCRIT® or
      matching placebo) once weekly by subcutaneous injection by a health care professional for 16
      weeks. The initial dose of study drug is either PROCRIT® 10,000 U (1.0 mL) or matching
      placebo. The maximum dose administered is 20,000 U (2.0 mL).
