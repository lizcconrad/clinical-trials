  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term tolerability and
      safety for patients completing study CSMS995 0802. During this extension study, all patients
      will receive open-label treatment of octreotide acetate in microspheres every 4 weeks for 2
      years for the treatment of moderately severe to severe NPDR and low risk PDR.
