    <textblock>
      This clinical trial involves a radiation treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy in
      non-small cell lung cancer patients who have been determined to be ineligible for surgery.
      This treatment differs from conventional radiotherapy in the number of treatments, the
      radiation dose given per treatment, and the way the radiation beams are directed toward the
      cancer.

      The most common treatment for early stage lung cancers is to remove the cancer with surgery.
      Patients with serious underlying health problems like emphysema, diabetes, or heart disease
      who develop an early stage lung cancer may not be eligible for the standard surgical
      treatment. The most common alternative to surgery is conventional radiation treatment called
      fractionated radiotherapy. &quot;Fractionated radiotherapy&quot; means several weeks of treatment with
      daily radiation sessions. While this treatment is sometimes successful at killing the cancer,
      it is not as effective as surgery and may significantly damage the surrounding lung tissue.

      Newer treatments using radiotherapy have been developed and used for patients with metastases
      (spreading cancer) to the lungs. Stereotactic radiotherapy uses a frame to guide highly
      focused beams of radiation at the cancer while avoiding the normal surrounding tissue.
      Stereotactic radiotherapy also uses a higher daily dose of radiation. The higher daily dose
      may be more effective than conventional radiotherapy at killing cancer cells and may also
      decrease side effects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Consistent with most therapeutic oncology trials, patients are not actively &quot;recruited,&quot;
        but are screened by their physician for appropriate clinical trial(s) at the time of their
        routine clinic visit.

        All patients must be willing and capable to provide informed consent to participate in the
        protocol.

        Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as AJCC stage I
        (T1 or T2, N0, M0) primary lung carcinoma. The patient should not have direct evidence of
        regional or distant metastases after appropriate staging studies. Histologic confirmation
        will be required by either biopsy or cytology. The following primary cancer types are
        eligible: Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar
        cell carcinoma or non-small cell; not otherwise specified.

        The primary tumor must be deemed technically resectable by an experienced thoracic cancer
        clinician, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a gross total resection with negative
        margins (defined as a potentially curative resection, PCR); however, the patient should
        have underlying physiological medical problems that would prohibit a PCR due to a low
        probability of tolerating general anesthesia, the operation, the post-operative recovery
        period, or the removal of adjacent functioning lung. Standard &quot;cut-off &quot; guidelines
        regarding surgical resection of NSCLC include the following: Baseline FEV1 &lt;40%,
        post-operative predicted FEV1 &lt;30%, severely reduced diffusion capacity, baseline hypoxemia
        and/or hypercapnia and exercise oxygen consumption &lt;50% predicted.

        Patients who refuse a PCR due to preference, ideology, emotional or psychological issues,
        mental illness, or inability to give consent for the PCR and who have no specific accepted
        medical contraindications for the PCR are not eligible.

        Eligible patients should not have had previous lung or mediastinal radiotherapy.

        There must be no plans for the patient to receive other concomitant antineoplastic therapy
        while on this protocol. Patients who have received chemotherapy within 8 weeks of the start
        date of study are ineligible.

        Patients must be able to fit inside the stereotactic body frame and able to undergo a CT or
        MRI scan in the frame.

        The patient's primary tumor must not be larger than 7.0 cm in greatest dimension.

        Patients with active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection are ineligible.

        Pregnant or lactating women are ineligible. Women/men of reproductive potential may not
        participate unless they agreed to use an effective contraceptive method such as
        condom/diaphragm and spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), or prescription birth
        control pills.

        Patients must be past their 18th birthday at time of registration. Karnofsky performance
        status &gt; 60.
