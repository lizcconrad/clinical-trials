      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of APC 111 MP Tablet, 775 mg
      tablet, given orally (PO)once daily (QD) for 10 days compared to that of Penicillin VK, 250
      mg PO four times daily (QID) for 10 days in terms of bacteriological outcome at the
      Test-of-Cure (TOC) Visit (Day 14-18) in the eligible Per-Protocol bacteriological (PPb)
      population.
