      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of decreased functioning of the testes
      or ovaries on mental performance in males and females using illicit drugs excluding
      marijuana.

    <textblock>
      This research is being done to understand the effects of endocrine abnormalities,
      specifically hypogonadism (decreased functioning of the testes or ovaries) on cognitive
      (mental) performance in males and females using illicit drugs (excluding marijuana).

    <description>Performance on visuospatial, fine motor and verbal tasks can be poor in hypogonadal populations of men and women. HIV+ and IDU+ populations often experience endocrine abnormalities such as hypogonadism. The goal of Study 1 is to determine if patterns of cognitive performance associated with hypogonadism generalize to IDU+, HIV+/HIV- populations. Furthermore, an attempt will be made to associate patterns of cognitive performance with specific endocrine measures, IDU status, HIV status and QOL measures. All published testing materials have been shown to provide good reliability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gonadal hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum sex hormone measurements are reliable blood tests commonly used to evaluate gonadal function. Total testosterone, the most frequently used screening test for hypogonadism in men, is relatively inexpensive and reliable; free testosterone is loosely bound to albumin. Levels of LH and FSH will assist in discriminating between a central vs. primary hypogonadism. Estradiol is expected to correlate with testosterone levels in men, since testosterone is aromatized to estradiol in the adipocyte. Based on the literature, it is expected that men and women IDU+ will have centrally mediated (secondary hypogonadism) with decreases in serum FSH, LH, estradiol and androgens.</description>
