  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week intervention to determine the efficacy of an isoflavone-rich soy based meal
      supplement to improve bone health and prevent weight and fat gain in 18-19 year old college
      females. The primary hypothesis is that participants who receive soy will have favorable
      changes in blood markers of bone and less weight and fat gain. The soy is provided by
      Physicians Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Revival Doctor-formulated soy protein).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      designed to test whether a daily isoflavone-rich, soy-based meal replacement Revival Soy
      shake promotes favorables changes in bone biomarkers and attenuates weight gain in female
      college students. First-year college females were selected because of the potential for
      significant weight gain during their freshman year. The study will have a parallel design
      with two groups: the soy treatment group (SOY; n = 60) and a casein-based control (CON; n =
      60). Exclusion criteria include significant weight loss or gain in the past 3 months,
      vegetarians and heavy soy food consumers, National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I
      athletes, women with eating disorders, present illnesses, chronic disease, and those taking
      medications or herbal supplements known to affect body weight, body fat or bone. Participants
      will be stratified based on BMI (18.0-24.9; 25-29.9; â‰¥30.0) and randomized to either SOY or
      CON groups.

      Female college freshmen enrolled at the University of Georgia will be recruited in the fall
      of 2005. The soy-based meal replacements will contain 20 g soy protein and 161.2 mg
      isoflavones, 220-240 kcal, 31-36 g total carbohydrates, 0-2 g dietary fiber, 500 mg calcium,
      and 2.0-2.5 g total fat per serving. The control shake will have 20 g casein substituted for
      soy protein, and will be otherwise identical to the soy shakes. The shakes will be available
      in two flavors: chocolate and vanilla.
