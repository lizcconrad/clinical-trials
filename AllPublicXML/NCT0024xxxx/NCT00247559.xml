  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the wealth of information in the literature regarding the cosmetic applications of
      botulinum type A toxin (BoNT-A), and the widespread use of the BoNT-A for cosmetic
      applications, the number of randomised, controlled clinical trials is small. Much of the
      published information is based on open-label studies or anecdotal data. Of the robust trial
      data that is available, the vast majority relates to the treatment of glabellar lines, and
      there is little data available regarding the use of BoNT-A in lateral canthal lines. This
      study aims to determine the optimum dose for the use of BoNT-A in this area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients, 18 to 65 years of age.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator moderate to severe lateral canthal lines (crow’s
             feet) during maximum smile on both sides of the face.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator mild to severe lateral canthal lines (crow’s feet)
             at rest on both sides of the face.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior surgery affecting the orbicularis oculi muscle, prior blepharoplasty or brow
             lift, or any prior cosmetic procedures or scars that may interfere with the evaluation
             of the study results.

          -  Previous insertion of any non-absorbable material in the periorbital region or facial
             treatment with augmentation material within 12 months prior to screening.

          -  Any prior treatment with botulinum toxin (of any serotype).

          -  Previous treatment with lasers for skin resurfacing or treatment with deep chemical
             peels within 12 months prior to screening.

          -  Inability to substantially lessen the lateral canthal lines by physically spreading
             them apart.

          -  Facial conditions that could affect safety or efficacy results such as: active
             infection or other skin problem in the periorbital area (e.g. acute acne lesions or
             ulcers); history of facial nerve palsy; marked facial asymmetry; ptosis; excessive
             dermatochalasis; deep dermal scarring; thick sebaceous skin; photodamage etc.
