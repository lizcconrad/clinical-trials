  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant disease worldwide with an
      increasing incidence in industrialized countries. For patients with advanced HCC no efficient
      treatment is currently available. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of octreotide in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
