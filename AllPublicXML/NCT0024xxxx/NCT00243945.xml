      The objective of this trial is to assess the effect of rotigotine (SPM 962) on the control of
      early morning motor impairment and sleep disorders in subjects with idiopathic PD.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will begin treatment with rotigotine transdermal
      patches. Trial medication will be titrated to an optimal daily dose, or to the maximal dose.
      Following a Titration period of up to 8 weeks, subjects will be maintained on the optimal or
      maximal dose for 4 weeks. After the Maintenance period, subjects will have the option to
      enter into an open-label extension study.

      The first subject was enrolled in December 2004. The last subject was enrolled in April 2005
      and the last subject visit was conducted in July 2005. This study is now closed

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Idiopathic Parkinson's disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has previously participated in a trial with rotigotine.

          -  Subject has participated in another trial of an investigational drug within the last
             28 days or is currently participating in another trial of an investigational drug.

          -  Subject discontinued from previous therapy with a dopamine agonist after an adequate
             length of treatment at an adequate dose due to lack of efficacy as assessed by the
             investigator.

          -  Subject has had prior therapy with a dopamine agonist within 28 days prior to
             Baseline.

          -  Subject is receiving therapy with controlled-release levodopa within 28 days prior to
             baseline or is receiving therapy with tolcapone.

          -  Subject is receiving therapy with one of the following drugs either concurrently or
             within 28 days prior to Visit 2: alpha-methyl dopa, metoclopramide, reserpine,
             neuroleptics (including atypical), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors,
             methylphenidate, or amphetamine.

          -  Subject has a history of symptomatic (not asymptomatic) orthostatic hypotension in the
             6 months prior to baseline.

          -  Subject has atypical Parkinsonian syndromes (including drug-induced Parkinsonian
             syndromes).

          -  Subject has a history of atopic eczema and/or active skin disease, such as atopic
             eczema.

          -  Presence of dementia, active psychosis, or hallucinations (not due to antiparkinsonian
             medication).

          -  Subject is receiving CNS therapy (eg, sedatives, hypnotics, selective serotonin
             reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], anxiolytics, other sleep-modifying medication) unless
             dose has been stable daily for at least 28 days prior to baseline and is likely to
             remain stable for the duration of the trial.

          -  Subject has a history of seizures or stroke within 1 year, or a history of myocardial
             infarction within the last 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject has neoplastic disease requiring therapy within 12 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Presence of clinically relevant hepatic dysfunction.

          -  Presence of clinically relevant renal dysfunction.

          -  Evidence of clinically relevant cardiovascular disorders.

          -  Subject has a QTcB interval of Â³500msec at Screening or Baseline (Visit 1 or 2;
             repeated measurements within 1 hour).

          -  Subject has a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within the last 6 months.

          -  Subject has clinically significant laboratory results that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for entry into the trial.

          -  Subject is pregnant or nursing, or is of child bearing potential but (i) not

          -  Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, can jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to participate
             in this trial.

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to any components of the trial medication stated
             in this protocol.

          -  Subject has a previous diagnosis of narcolepsy, sleep apnea syndrome, rapid eye
