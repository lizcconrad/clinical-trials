      This is a study of the genetic basis of brain dysfunction in people with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a disabling disorder that is associated with specific inheritable
      neurobiologic deficits. These deficits can cause problems with memory, visual attention,
      information processing, and other aspects of daily living. Understanding the genetic
      components of these deficits in people with schizophrenia and their unaffected family members
      may help uncover the neurobiological basis, risk factors, and heritability of the disease. In
      addition, the information may serve to create more effective treatments and possibly a cure
      for the disease. This study will serve to provide information about the genetic basis of
      known inherited neurobiological deficits in people with schizophrenia. In turn, this may
      guide further studies on the genetics of schizophrenia.

      Participants will attend 2 study visits, each of which will last approximately 4 hours. The
      first will include blood tests and diagnostic interviews of participating families to
      evaluate the presence of schizophrenic symptoms. The second study visit will entail four
      neurocognitive and neurophysiological tests. Participants will first have a pre-pulse
      inhibition test, which uses electrodes to measure eye blinking. Electrodes will also be
      placed on participants' head, ears, and around their eyes to measure brain waves. Next,
      participants will undergo an oculomotor test, during which they will wear glasses fitted with
      sensors that record eye movement. Participants will then be asked to repeat a list of words,
      letters, and numbers read by a researcher. Last, participants will undergo a computerized
      performance test requiring them to watch the computer screen and click a mouse whenever they
      see a number between 0 and 9. Each study visit will take approximately 4 hours.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for each endophenotype is as follows: for prepulse inhibition (PPI) the primary measure is the percent inhibition to the 60 msec prepulse; for P50 suppression it is the difference in amplitude between the test and conditioning stimuli; for antisaccade it is the proportion of correct saccades; for the DS-CPT it is (d') which is based on correct target detections and incorrect responses to nontargets; for LNS it is the number correct in the reorder condition; for CVLT it is the total recall score summed across 5 trials.</description>

        The subject population will include schizophrenia probands (12 per site per year), first
        degree relatives (36 per site per year) and normal comparison subjects (15 per site per
        year). The proband must meet the diagnosis of schizophrenia by DSM-IV criteria. There must
        be at least one parent and one unaffected sibling in the pedigree. Therefore a total of 315
        subjects will be enrolled at each site each year with a total of 2205 enrolled across all 7
        sites. Schizophrenia probands and normal subjects will be between 18 and 65 years of age.
        Exclusion criteria include visual or hearing impairments, history of head trauma, organic
        brain dysfunction, neurological disease, and significant drug or alcohol use and for
        controls, significant psychiatric history and/or current use of psychotropic medications.
        We will include equal numbers of men and women and all appropriate subjects willing to
        participate regardless of ethnic background.
