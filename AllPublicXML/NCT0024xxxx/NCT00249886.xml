  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether it is advantageous for adolescents who have
      recovered from depression after a 6 to 12 week course of antidepressant treatment to stay on
      the treatment a further 6 months or is it just as helpful to stop the medication after
      recovery.

      The hypothesis is that adolescents with major depression who recover from the 6 to 12 week
      trial of citalopram will be less likely to have a recurrence of depression over a 6 month
      period if continued on the citalopram as compared to those who discontinue the medication.
