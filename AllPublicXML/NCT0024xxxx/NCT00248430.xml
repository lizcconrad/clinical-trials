      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. An
      autologous stem cell transplant using the patient's stem cells may be able to replace
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Giving white blood cells from a
      donor may help the patient's body destroy any remaining cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may
      stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of donor white blood cell
      infusions and interleukin-2 and to see how well they work in treating patients who are
      undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant for relapsed advanced lymphoid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of haploidentical related donor lymphocyte
           infusions (DLI) and interleukin-2, in terms of acute graft-versus-host-disease, graft
           failure, and transplant-related mortality, in patients with relapsed advanced lymphoid
           malignancies undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the extent, degree, and duration of donor chimerism in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, activity of haploidentical DLI, as measured by complete
           response rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 15-60 minutes on day -2 and undergo autologous
      stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive haploidentical related donor lymphocyte
      infusions (DLI) IV on days 1, 5*, and 10* and interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously on days
      1-12.

      NOTE: *DLI are not administered on days 5 or 10 if grade 3 or 4 graft-versus-host disease is
      present

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then
      every 3-12 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
