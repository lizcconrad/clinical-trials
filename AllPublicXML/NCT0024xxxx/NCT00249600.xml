      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prize contingency management (CM) in
      enhancing attendance, reducing drug use, and improving health among clients attending two HIV
      drop-in centers. Specifically, 172 clients are randomly assigned to one of two 6-month
      treatment conditions: standard 12-step oriented group treatment, or CM group treatment. In
      the CM group, clients earn the chance to win prizes for submitting clean urine specimens and
      for complying with steps toward their treatment goals. Activities related to improving health
      will be emphasized, such as attending medical appointments, recording daily medication
      consumption, getting prescriptions filled, and attending medication adherence support groups.
      Group attendance, drug use, medical problems, services received, and risky drug use and
      sexual behaviors will be measured pre-treatment and at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12.
