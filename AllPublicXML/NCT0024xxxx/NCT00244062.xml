      The study proposes to test the efficacy of a primary care-based brief intervention with women
      who resumed heavy drinking during the post-partum period and who used alcohol during a
      previous pregnancy. The trial will also examine the effects of tobacco use, illicit drug use,
      depression and domestic violence on alcohol use.
