  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opiates such as morphine are the cornerstone medications for the treatment of moderate to
      severe pain. Recent evidence suggests that pain patients on chronic opioid therapy become
      more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia) over time. There is also a long-standing notion that
      analgesic tolerance to opioids (habituation) develops during chronic use even though this
      phenomenon has never been prospectively studied. Our specific aims propose to prospectively
      test the hypotheses that; 1) Pain patients on chronic opioid therapy develop dose-dependent
      tolerance and/or hyperalgesia to these medications over time, 2) Opioid-induced tolerance and
      hyperalgesia develop differently with respect to various types of pain, 3) Opioid-induced
      hyperalgesia occurs independently of withdrawal phenomena, and 4) Opioid-induced tolerance
      and hyperalgesia develop differently based on gender and/or ethnicity. This proposed study
      will be the first quantitative and prospective study of tolerance and hyperalgesia in pain
      patients and will have important implications for the rational use of opioids in the
      treatment of chronic pain.
