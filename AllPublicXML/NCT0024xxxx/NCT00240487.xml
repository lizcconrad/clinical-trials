    <textblock>
      This research project is an open-label, randomized study for the use of Nitric Oxide in
      pediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study examines
      whether nitric oxide (NO) treatment impacts the the P:F ratio (arterial partial pressure of
      oxygen (PaO2) divided by fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in patients with ARDS. The goal
      of the study is to evaluate whether the order of NO therapy will have any effect on response,
      and evaluate the characteristics of patients who respond to NO compared to those who do not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At low concentrations, nitric oxide(NO) functions as a cellular messenger and regulator of
      microcirculation. NO may have an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS as well as its
      treatment. NO may be primarily useful in improving matching of ventilation and perfusion in
      the lung. The aims of the study are to attempt to show that NO will improve oxygenation as
      evidenced by improvement in PaO2/FiO2. Secondary aims are to see if the improvement in
      oxygenation allows there to be decreased time on FiO2&gt;0.60, evaluate whether the order of NO
      therapy will have any effect on response, and evaluate the characteristics of patients who
      respond to NO compared to those who do not.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either nitric oxide first (nitric oxide for the first
      4 hours, then no intervention/no nitric oxide for the next 4 hours) or delayed treatment with
      nitric oxide (no intervention/no nitric oxide for the first 4 hours, then nitric oxide for
      the next 4 hours)..

      Blood gases were monitored once an hour during study participation (total of 8 hours). Final
      PaO2/FiO2 levels will be compared after 8 hours of study treatment in each group.

            <description>Subjects who were randomized to receive delayed treatment with Nitric Oxide (NO) began the first 4 hours of study participation receiving no intervention (no nitric oxide). During this time, all subjects received standard clinical care. Blood gases were monitored once an hour for 4 hours. After the first four hours of study participation, the nitric oxide (NO) was turned on and subjects received 10 ppm of nitric oxide for the next 4 hours of study participation. Blood gases were monitored once an hour for 4 hours.</description>
