  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The twilight phase between being asleep and awake during recovery from anesthesia is a
      precarious time fraught with risks to the post-operative patient. Hyperventilation
      accelerates the elimination of inhaled anesthetics but reduces their CO2 blood concentrations
      which delays their resumption of spontaneous breathing. We previously showed that our method
      of hyperventilation without affecting the CO2 concentration--which we call IH--accelerates
      the rate of emergence from anesthesia with isoflurane. In this study we will study the effect
      of IH on the rate of emergence from Sevoflurane anesthesia.
