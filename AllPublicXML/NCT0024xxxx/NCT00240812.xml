      The purpose of the study is to determine if ibuprofen in combination with pseudoephedrine HCl
      in the treatment of nightime bedwetting in children is more effective than each drug alone
      and if the individual drugs are more effective than placebo.

      The objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study is
      to determine whether the effectiveness of ibuprofen in combination with pseudoephedrine HCl
      is greater than the individual drugs alone and greater than placebo for the treatment of
      nighttime bedwetting in children. After a screening visit, parents of eligible patients are
      to record in a diary, the number of urinations and wet and dry nights. Patients then return
      and those who continue to be eligible are randomized to study medication, which they will
      take for two weeks. Patients are randomized into four treatment groups, and the dose of
      treatment medication is determined based on body weight. The four treatment groups are: 12.5
      mg of ibuprofen suspension/kg of body weight (200-450 mg of ibuprofen) plus 15 mg or 30 mg of
      pseudoephedrine HCl, 12.5 mg of ibuprofen suspension / kg of body weight (200 - 450 mg of
      ibuprofen) plus placebo suspension, or two doses of placebo suspension. The primary efficacy
      measurement is the mean reduction in wet nights, for the 14-day baseline period to the 14-day
      treatment period. Safety assessments consist of monitoring adverse events, physical
      examination and assessment of vital signs. The study hypothesis is that ibuprofen in
      combination with pseudoephedrine HCl has a greater effect in the treatment of nighttime
      bedwetting than either ibuprofen or pseudoephedrine HCl alone, and the combination is well
      tolerated. Treatment medication are an oral suspension, expressed as mg/kg body weight.
      Patients will receive 1 of 4 treatments for 2 weeks: ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg of body weight)
      plus 15 or 30 mg of pseudoephedrine, ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg of body weight) + placebo, 15 or
      30 mg of pseudoephedrine, or placebo
