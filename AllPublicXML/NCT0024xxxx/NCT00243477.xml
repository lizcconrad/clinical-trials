    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of an antidepressive medication
      (Escitalopram), started preoperatively and given during 6 months, on 6-month and 1 year
      post-operative morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting

    <textblock>
      Depression is known to have an adverse effect on post-operative mortality and morbidity after
      coronary artery bypass grafting. Cardiac surgery is known to cause transient depression in
      patients. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized study is to determine the effect of an
      antidepressive medication (Escitalopram), started preoperatively and given during 6 months,
      on 6-month and 1 year post-operative morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass
      grafting. Treatment is given from 21 to 15 days pre-operatively until the 6th post-operative
      month. Morbidity as defined by the STS database as well as mortality is checked during 1
      year.
