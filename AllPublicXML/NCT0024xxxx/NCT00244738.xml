    <textblock>
      Castor oil is traditionally given by midwives in order to induce labor. Its efficacy as an
      initiator of labor was previously tested only in one clinical trial. Unfortunately this study
      (by Garry et al.) was not sufficiently controlled.

      We intent to recruit 84 healthy pregnant women with no contraindication to vaginal delivery
      that had past their due date. Women will be randomly and blindly divided into equal sized
      intervention group and control group. Intervention group will be given 60 mL of castor oil in
      140 mL of orange juice, while control group will be given a placebo with similar texture.
      Primary outcome to be tested is the percentage of women entering active labor within 24 hours
      of administration.
