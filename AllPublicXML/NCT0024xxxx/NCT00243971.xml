  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare the effect of rotigotine (SPM 962) and ropinirole
      on the control of early morning motor impairment and sleep disorders in subjects with
      early-stage PD.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned either to rotigotine
      transdermal patch or ropinirole tablets. Trial medication will be titrated for rotigotine and
      ropinirole until an individual optimal dose is achieved. Following a Titration period of up
      to 4 weeks in the rotigotine arm and 6 weeks in the ropinirole arm, subjects will be
      maintained on the optimal or maximal dose for 4 weeks. At the end of the Maintenance period,
      subjects will be given the opportunity to enter a 2-year rotigotine patch extension trial.

      The first subject was enrolled in December 2004. The last subject was enrolled in June 2005.
      Last subject out is expected for October 2005. The trial is still ongoing.
