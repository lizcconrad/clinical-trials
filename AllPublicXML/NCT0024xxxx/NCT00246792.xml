  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research and intervention programs for students with learning disabilities (LD) typically
      address child and family characteristics without examining the school context and conditions
      that affect adjustment. Focusing on the student with LD can highlight the child and family’s
      deficits. An ecological theoretical framework guides this research project, a collaboration
      of the University of Toronto, Faculty of Social Work and Ontario Institute for Studies in
      Education of the University of Toronto (OISE/UT), Integra and the Toronto Catholic District
      School Board. This framework is based on the assumption that people are very much part of and
      affected by social and environmental settings. Accordingly, it is important not to see the
      adjustment problems of children with LD as being caused only by their LD. Instead, their
      academic and social problems are seen as unfolding in larger circumstances that include other
      children, the classroom, the school, the family and the community. These many factors act
      together to influence the child with LD and must be taken into account along with individual
      characteristics of the child.

      Objectives

        1. Deliver an ecologically informed school-based intervention that addresses individual,
           social and environmental factors, to improve the adjustment of students with LD

        2. Examine the efficacy of the intervention

        3. Contribute to knowledge of the factors that influence the adjustment of students with LD

        4. Circulate this information to those who live and work with students with LD in order to
           offer understanding and direction for programs and interventions and to facilitate
           cross-sector collaboration

      The research will utilize both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. 6 schools will be
      selected. 3 will receive the intervention in year 1 (2004-2005 school year), comprising 1)
      group treatment, 2) workshops, and 3) consultation. The other 3 schools will be controls in
      year 1 and receive the intervention in year 2 (2005-2006 school year).

      Students in grades 6-8, identified as having LD will be offered the opportunity to
      participate in the project (with parental consent). This project comprises 3 components:

        1. School-based group treatment for students in grades 6-8 with LD and psychosocial
           problems. Group treatment will focus on assisting participants to understand the impact
           of their LD as well as on development of self-advocacy skills.

        2. Workshops on understanding LD for teachers, parents, and students without LD (grades
           6-8).
