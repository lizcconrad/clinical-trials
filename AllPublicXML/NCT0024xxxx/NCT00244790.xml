      The purpose of this study is to determine if being overweight and eating lots of protein
      causes separate changes in the kidney that lead to kidney disease over time. These questions
      are important because the number of people who have kidney disease is quickly growing. If
      being overweight and eating lots of protein is found to cause kidney disease, then doctors
      may be able to limit the number of people with kidney disease by recommending weight loss and
      eating less protein

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that being obese leads to changes in
      kidney function that are independent of, and enhanced by, high dietary protein intake. Kidney
      function will be measured by the kidney's ability to filter blood and by the amount of
      protein in the urine. The hypothesis will be tested in the following manner: The first part
      of the study will involve a crossover design comparing kidney function in obese people with
      stable weights on a low and high protein diet (&quot;Low/High Protein Study&quot;). The second part of
      the study will compare kidney function in obese people before and after weight reduction
      surgery (&quot;Before/After Surgery Study&quot;). Since certain changes in kidney function may lead to
      kidney disease over time, it is important to confirm the effects of obesity and dietary
      protein intake on the kidney, especially with the current rise in obese people and the
      popularity of high protein diets.
