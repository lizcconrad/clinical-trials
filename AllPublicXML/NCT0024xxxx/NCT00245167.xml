  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first objective of this study is to determine if increased expression of one or more
      members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family of receptors that are found on inflammatory
      cells (present in the airway) precede development of chronic lung disease (CLD) of
      prematurity. The study will also determine if there is a significant correlation between TLRs
      and the severity of CLD. The second objective of this study is to determine the impact of
      c-administration of inhaled nitric oxide (INO) on TLR expression in infants at risk of
      developing CLD or with early CLD.

      BACKGROUND:

      This study will examine the role of two members in the family of transmembrane receptors,
      TLRs, found on leukocytes and other cells that are upregulated in response to endotoxin and
      other stimuli. These substances transfer the signals that propagate inflammation and
      production of inflammatory cytokines. CLD of prematurity is characterized by early (first
      week of life) evidence of lung airway inflammation. It is unknown if TLR family members
      propagate this pathway.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study will involve saving weekly tracheal aspirate fluid samples obtained with routine
      airway toilet in infants less than or equal to 1250 gm birth weight, who are admitted to a
      Neonatal Intensive Care unit requiring assisted ventilation via an endotracheal tube. The
      waste sample will be collected with the cellular contents separated by centrifugation and
      placed on Trizol reagent after obtaining a cell count. Later extraction and batch analysis of
      TLR, mRNA, and proteins as well as mRNA and protein for housekeeping genes will be performed.
      Immunohistochemistry will also be used to semi-quantitate the samples. Samples will be
      obtained in the first one to two days, and again at the end of the first week of life. In
      infants who were also participating in the related &quot;Low Dose INO in CLD of Prematurity&quot;
      study, in which tracheal aspirate samples were collected, when the code is broken to
      determine who received nitric oxide versus placebo, the second aim of the study will be
      carried out: to determine the impact, if any, of INO.
