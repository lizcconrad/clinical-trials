  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of OM6 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters)
      [formerly known as Omacor] combined with simvastatin for lowering non-high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in subjects with persistent high triglycerides despite
      statin therapy.

      Additionally, a two-year extension trial (LOV111818/OM6X) is posted on NCT00903409.
