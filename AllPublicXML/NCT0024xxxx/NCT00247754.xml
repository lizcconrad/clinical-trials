      Objective:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of a school-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program in
           reducing anxiety disorder symptoms in at-risk public school children.

        2. To determine whether parent education and involvement improves outcome in anxious
           children treated with CBT.

        3. To determine the ability of school personnel in a) recognizing classroom behaviors as
           anxiety disordered after targeting training of observable child behaviors e.g.,
           avoidance, over-worry, etc.), and b) delivering a cognitive behavior intervention and

        4. To evaluate a new measure of teacher-rated anxiety disorder symptoms in children.

      Hypothesis:

        1. A CBT oriented intervention as delivered by school personnel will be superior to an
           attention control procedure in reducing anxiety symptoms in at-risk children.

        2. Children who have parental involvement will post stronger and more enduring treatment
           gains.
