      The purpose of this study is to determine whether infliximab is effective on fat-free mass in
      the treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD suffering from cachexia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a multicomponent disease characterized by abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs
      to noxious particles that accompanied by systemic effects like weight loss, muscle wasting,
      reduced functional capacity and health status. A persistent systemic inflammatory response
      reflected by enhanced levels of acute phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP) or
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - α, is present in COPD. There
      are several studies that indicate that an increased systemic inflammator response is
      associated with weight loss, cachexia (loss of fat-free muscle mass), physical functioning
      and health status.

      Cachexia associated with systemivc inflammation can not always readily be overcome by
      nutritional intervention alone.

      The hypothesis of this study is that infliximab therapy (3 infusions with 5 mg/kg infliximab
      or placebo 1:1 on week 0, 2 and 6) will increase fat-free mass relatively to placebo by
      decreasing inflammation. Secondary endpoints are: lung function, muscle function, exercise
      capacity and health status. On week 8, 12 and 26 follow-up measurements will be done.
