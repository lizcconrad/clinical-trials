      Cranberries have been proved to reduce the rate of urinary tract infections in a population
      of women with recurrent urinary tract infections in previous studies. The purpose of the
      study is to examine the efficacy of cranberries in pregnant women with preterm premature
      rupture of membranes in a)prolonging the latent period (=the time period between the time the
      water broke and delivery of the fetus) and b)reduction of infectious morbidity of both the
      mother and infant.

    <textblock>
      Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates 2-3.5% of pregnancies and
      precipitates labor in 30-40% of preterm deliveries. The common practice in early PPROM with
      no evidence of chorioamnionitis is admission for close surveillance, antibiotic treatment and
      steroids for fetal lung maturation (until 32 weeks gestation. Intraamniotic infection is
      evident in up to 75% of women who develop labor during admission. The infection is for the
      most an ascending infection.

      Cranberries have been recognized by the American Indians as a natural means for preventing
      urinary tract infection. The mechanism of action includes acidification of urine and
      inhibition of adhesion of pili-harboring bacteria to the transitional epithelium of the
      urinary tract.

      We assume that cranberries will lower the rate of maternal urinary tract infection. Moreover,
      the active ingredients will pass transplacentally to the fetus, will be secreted in its urine
      hence, in the amniotic fluid. The active substances would coat the vagina and bring about
      their effect also in that environment. Having in mind that most if not all chorioamnionitis
      infections are caused by ascending infection, the cranberries might lengthen the latent
      period and reduce infectious maternal and neonatal morbidity.
