  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the drug oxandrolone (a type of
      androgen steroid) in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), and to determine if this drug can
      help in the treatment of bone marrow failure in these patients. Androgen steroids are male
      hormones that can stimulate the production of red blood cells (the cells which carry oxygen
      in the blood) and platelets (cells that help blood clot).

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the drug oxandrolone in
      patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), and secondarily to determine if this drug can help in the
      treatment of bone marrow failure in these patients. It is hoped that oxandrolone will have
      less side effects than oxymetholone, the androgen used most frequently in the short-term
      treatment of bone marrow failure in FA patients. Subjects will be enrolled for approximately
      18 to 30 months (12 - 24 months of treatment and 6 months additional monitoring). The
      oxandrolone starting dose is 0.04mg/kg/day. Study monitoring includes weekly complete blood
      counts, monthly serum chemistry labs, quarterly physical examinations including virilization
      exams and liver ultrasounds. Semi-annually, hand radiographs are obtained for bone maturation
      and behavioral assessments are conducted to detect any aggressive behavior or mood changes.
      If no improvement n the subject's blood counts are noted after 4 months of therapy, the dose
      will be increased to 0.08mg/kg/day for a period of 4 more months. If no improvement is noted
      after a total of eight months, oxandrolone will be discontinued. If the blood counts show
      improvement, then the drug will continue for a minimum of twelve months. Subjects may remain
      on study and receive a total of 24 months of therapy if they have a response in their blood
      counts without unacceptable side effects. Post-treatment monitoring includes blood work and
      ultrasound every three months, and hand radiograph at six months.

    <description>Subjects will be started on a dose of oxandrolone 0.04 mg/kg/day orally, once/day. After 16 weeks, patients will be assessed for hematologic improvement. If this criteria is not met after 16 weeks, the dose will be escalated to 0.08 mg/kg/day. If no improvement is noted after 16 weeks on the escalated dose, oxandrolone therapy will be discontinued.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be diagnosed with Fanconi anemia that is documented by a positive test
             for increased chromosomal breakage with mitomycin C or diepoxybutane.

          2. At least the following peripheral blood cytopenias: (without transfusion) Absolute
             neutrophil count &lt; 500/mm3 or Platelet count &lt; 30,000/mm3 or Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 gm/dl

          3. Negative pregnancy test by hCG testing, if of child-bearing potential.

          4. Agreement to use a medically approved form of birth control, if of child-bearing
             potential.

          5. Signed informed consent by the patient or legally authorized representative.

          6. Patients must be 14 kg.

          7. Male patients will be included until the time of puberty. With the onset of puberty,
             they will be included until the testosterone levels reach 100 ng/dl at which time they
             will be excluded from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Malignancy

          2. Concurrent enrollment in any other study using an investigational drug.

          3. Concurrent use of anticoagulants.

          4. Use of androgen therapy within last three months.

          5. Patients with severe liver disease as defined by SGOT or SGPT greater than or equal to
             2.5x the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5x the
             upper limit of normal.

          6. Patients with renal disease as defined by serum creatinine greater than or equal to
             1.5 x the upper limit of normal for age.

          7. Patients less than 14 kg.

          8. Patients who have failed previous therapy with oxymetholone.
