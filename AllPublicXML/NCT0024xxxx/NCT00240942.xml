  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a condition in which abnormal growth of tissue histologically resembling the
      lining of the uterus (endometrium) is present outside of the uterus. This study will
      investigate the effect of a daily dose of letrozole compared to GnRH is safe and in addition
      effective in reducing measurable endometriosis lesions and in reducing pain in patients with
      active endometriosis which were pretreated with GnRH analogs for 2 months.
