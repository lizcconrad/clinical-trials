      To evaluate the overall response to desmopressin treatment among previously untreated
      enuretic children aged 5-15 years after 3 and 6 months of treatment.

      To investigate the influence of possible predictive factors on response after 3 and 6 months
      of treatment.

      To evaluate the proportion of patients achieving dryness. To evaluate the long-term safety
