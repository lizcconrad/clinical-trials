      To evaluate objective response rate and duration of response to weekly Taxoprexin®.

      To evaluate the safety profile of weekly Taxoprexin® in this patient population.

      To evaluate overall survival in the same patient population. To evaluate time to disease

      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with
      metastatic choroidal melanoma who may be previously untreated or have received one prior
      systemic cytotoxic regimen for advanced disease. Patients may not have been treated
      previously with taxanes. Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents
      including IL-2 and vaccines. Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of
      500mg/m2 intravenously by 1-hour infusion weekly for the first five weeks of a six week
      cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, refusal of
      continued treatment by patient or Investigator decision.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             documented metastatic disease.

          2. Patients must have at least one unidimensionally measurable lesion.

          3. Patients may be previously untreated or may have received one prior systemic
             chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients may not have been treated
             previously with taxanes. Prior treatment with immunotherapy or vaccine therapy is
             allowed.

          4. At least 6 weeks (42 days) since any prior immunotherapy, cytokine, biologic, vaccine
             or other therapy.

          5. At least 4 weeks (28 days) since prior radiotherapy to &gt; 20% of the bone marrow and
             prior adjuvant chemotherapy.

          6. Lesions being used to assess disease status may not have been radiated or if so, must
             have progressed during or after radiation therapy.

          7. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.

          8. Patients must be at least 13 years of age.

          1. Patients who have received prior therapy with any taxane.

          2. Patients whose site of primary melanoma is not in the choroid(eye).

          3. Patients who have a past or current history of neoplasm other than the entry
             diagnosis, except for curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or other cancers treated for cure and with a disease-free survival
             longer than 5 years.
