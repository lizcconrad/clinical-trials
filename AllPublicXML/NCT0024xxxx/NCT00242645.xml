      To test whether or not giving patients information before their doctor visits changes the
      care they receive and what type of information is best to give before the doctor visit.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized into one of three groups. Before a single visit with diabetes care
      provider, the patient is called to answer interview questions about their health, diabetic
      care and behavior habits. After a patient visits with their doctor, they are called again to
      answer question about the visit they just had. If a patient is place into group A or B, based
      on their answers to the questions they are mailed a printed report before their doctor visit.
      The report will indicate how things are going the patient's diabetic care and recommended
      questions to ask his/her health care provided about diabetes. Group A feedback report will
      emphasize the risks from diabetes and the feedback reports for Group B will emphasize things
      to do to protect oneself from problems from having diabetes. Participants randomized to Group
      C will only receive printed reports after a doctors visit. No extra visit will be scheduled
      with the participants doctor, no travel is required, no blood tests are required and ther
      doctor will not be involved in the study unless the study participant chooses to discuss it
      with his/her doctor.
