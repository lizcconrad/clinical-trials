  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of re-narrowing of a coronary artery following a revascularization procedure such
      as angioplasty, begins at the time of the procedure. Restenosis has long been considered a
      major problem for effective long-term interventional success. This often results in repeated
      procedures to deal with recurrent stenosis (or restenosis) of the original targeted vessel.

      There is a substantial body of literature suggesting that local MYC protein production in the
      injured coronary artery is a major stimulus and potential cause of restenosis that appears
      after stent placement. This study is based upon the hypothesis that stopping MYC protein
      production in the vessel has will help reduce restenosis (vessel re-narrowing).

      AVI BioPharma Inc., has utilized its proprietary antisense chemistry to design a drug that
      interferes with MYC production.

      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and potential effectiveness of a single
      intravenous slow-push dose of RESTEN-MP at the time of stent placement to reduce in-stent
      restenosis following balloon angioplasty and stent placement. The post-dose follow-up period
      is up to six-months.

      The process of restenosis following a revascularization procedure, begins at the time of
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Restenosis has long been seen a major impediment of
      effective long-term interventional cardiology, necessitating repeated procedures to deal with
      in situ recurrent stenosis of the original targeted vessel. The restenosis rates are between
      30 to 50% of patients treated with balloon angioplasty and between 15 to 30% of patients
      treated with bare metal stents. There is currently high enthusiasm for drug-eluting stents
      already approved for the market and which have an overall restenosis rate of &lt;3% as reported
      in published reports for most clinical trial patient populations. However, there are subsets
      of patients (e.g., diabetic patients and patients with diffuse small vessel disease) that
      have restenosis rates around 10% despite the use of drug-eluting stents. It is probably too
      early to conclude that the currently approved drug-eluting stents are a panacea to relieve
      coronary arterial obstruction due to atherosclerotic heart disease. In fact, with the
      increased usage of the current drug-eluting stents on the market, there are reports of
      problems such as late stent malposition, subacute and late thromboses, and aneurysm
      formations due to the vessel toxicity associated with this method of treatment. There remains
      a definite need for a simple, safe and durable solution to restenosis.

      The development of devices such as intravascular ultrasound has led to a greater
      understanding of restenosis mechanisms, especially after coronary artery stenting. It is
      presumed that the pathogenesis of coronary artery restenosis after a revascularization
      procedure entails two major processes. The first component (viz., recoil and remodeling)
      involves the mechanical collapse and constriction of the treated vessel; however, coronary
      stents provide luminal scaffolding that eliminates recoil and remodeling. The second
      component of coronary artery restenosis after a revascularization procedure is the
      endothelial response to injury. Whereas, the former focus in modulating the
      pathophysiological mechanisms involved in restenosis centered mainly on inhibition of
      platelet aggregation and function, current targets of pharmaceutical agents for this
      condition have shifted to inhibitors of the cell cycle, smooth muscle cell proliferation and
      migration, synthesis of extra-cellular matrix, and inflammatory mediators. Many different
      agents are currently being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

      AVI-4126, the active ingredient of RESTEN-MP, is a proprietary antisense drug designed to
      interfere with the ability of human &lt;c-myc&gt; gene to translate mRNA into MYC protein.
      Slow-push intravenous administration of RESTEN-MP in pharmacological doses in the restenosis
      porcine model prevented subsequent in-stent stenosis.

      In addition to the standard safety assessments, assessments of the potential therapeutic
      value of RESTEN-MP as a neointimal hyperplasia inhibitor include late loss between the time
      of stent placement and 6 months thereafter.
