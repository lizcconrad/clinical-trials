  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have previously examined the use of botulinum toxin serotype A for myofascial
      pain of the neck and shoulders (cervicobrachial syndrome). These studies have suffered from:

        1. inclusion of confounding conditions in the proband group, and

        2. inability to identify predictors of response.

      This study attempts to define the characteristics of responders to botulinum serotype A for
      myofascial pain of the neck and shoulders (cervicobrachial syndrome).

      Design: Single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, enriched trial.

      Subjects will wash-out of their existing pain medications at least 2 weeks prior to baseline
      visit. At baseline, patients with a Numerical Pain Rating of 4 or greater will be injected
      with Botulinum Toxin Serotype A. At 14 weeks postinjection, those who at the 6 weeks
      post-injection visit had at least a 50% decrease in their pain outcome measures will be
      randomized into one of two treatment groups. Group 1 will receive a second BTX injection
      while group 2 will receive an injection of saline and both groups will be followed for an
      additional 6 weeks.
