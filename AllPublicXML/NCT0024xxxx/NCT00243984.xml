  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate compared to placebo in
      the treatment of obesity in metabolic syndrome. Secondary objectives include topiramate and
      weight loss effects on lipid levels, HbA1C, insulin resistance, and blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is an anti-convulsant which has been approved for use as adjunctive treatment for
      partial-onset seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or primary generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures. Topiramate is currently under investigation for other disorders including
      binge-eating disorder.

      Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of findings which includes dyslipidemia, abdominal
      obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Insulin resistance is believed to be the cause
      whereby obesity increases resistance to insulin. Weight loss in type 2 diabetics is known to
      reduce insulin resistance and allow for greater glycemic control. Weight loss in
      pre-diabetics can often forstall the development of diabetes. Additionally, aggressive blood
      pressure control in diabetics reduces the risk of coronary artery disease. Weight loss
      reduces blood pressure and is used as first line treatment for hypertension.

      Comparison: Patients who meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome and prescribed topiramate
      will be compared with those patients who meet the same criteria and are prescribed placebo.
