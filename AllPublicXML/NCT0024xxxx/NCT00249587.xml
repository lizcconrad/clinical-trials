      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a combined behavioral and
      pharmacological intervention designed to decrease pain, functional interference, and drug
      abuse while increasing medication adherence.

      Project Pain is a Stage I behavioral therapies development project aimed at developing and
      pilot testing a novel intervention for patients with chronic non-malignant pain who have
      experienced difficulty managing prescribed opioids. The goals of the study are to: (1)
      develop the intervention and training materials; (2) develop therapist adherence and
      competence scales; (3) train therapists to deliver the intervention per the treatment
      protocol; and (4) pilot the intervention to assess its feasibility, acceptability and
      promise. The goals of the intervention are to: (1) improve adherence to prescribed opioids;
      (2) decrease the severity of patients' pain; and (3) improve patients' functioning and
      quality of life .
