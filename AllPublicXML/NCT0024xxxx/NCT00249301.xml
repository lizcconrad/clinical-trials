  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine (1) The side effects or toxicities of MLN8054;(2)
      The highest dose where side effects or toxicities are not too severe; (3) How MLN8054 is
      absorbed into the general blood circulation and eliminated from the body; and (4) The levels
      of MLN8054 in the blood that are needed to inhibit Aurora A kinase.

    <description>MLN8054 will be administered orally in multiple divided daily doses for 7 days to 21 consecutive days. A 14-day recovery period will follow each dosing period, regardless of its duration. MLN8054 will be supplied in capsules of 5 mg or 25 mg with dose strength expressed as the milligrams of active drug (free acid). MLN8054 will be given on an empty stomach. Patients will be instructed to take nothing by mouth except for water and prescribed medications for 2 hours before and 1 hour after each dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or advanced solid
             tumors(including lymphomas) for which standard treatment does not offer or no longer
             offers curative or life-prolonging potential

          -  Aged 18 years or more

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Expected survival longer than 3 months from enrollment in the study

          -  Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor; however, measurable disease is not
             required for participation in this study

          -  Suitable venous access for the conduct of blood sampling for MLN8054 PK

          -  Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic therapy with at least 4
             weeks elapsed since the last exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or to radiotherapy and
             at least 6 weeks elapsed since exposure to nitrosoureas or mitomycin C. Patients
             treated with fully human monoclonal antibodies must not have received treatment with
             such antibodies for at least 6 weeks, and those treated with chimeric monoclonal
             antibodies must not have received treatment with such antibodies for at least 4 weeks.
             Patients treated with noncytotoxic small molecule drugs (eg, tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors, such as Tarceva, and hormonal agents, such as Femara) must not have
             received treatment with these drugs for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of
             MLN8054 is given.

          -  Male patients must use an appropriate method of barrier contraception (eg, condoms)and
             inform any sexual partners that they must also use a reliable method of contraception
             (eg, birth control pills) during the study and for 21 days after the last dose of
             study treatment.

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use
             reliable methods of birth control (eg, a hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, or abstinence) during the study and for 21 days
             after the last dose of study treatment.

          -  Received more than 4 previous cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens, including regimens
             used as adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapies. There is no limit on the number of
             noncytotoxic therapies (eg, hormonal and immunologic) that patients may have received.
             Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, Tarceva and Iressa) are considered noncytotoxic
             compounds.

          -  Prior treatment with high-dose chemotherapy, defined as chemotherapy requiring the use
             of peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cell support for hematopoietic reconstitution

          -  Prior treatment with radiation therapy involving &gt; 25% of the hematopoietically active
             bone marrow (see Table 15-1 for the distribution of active bone marrow in adults)

          -  Clinical and/or radiographic evidence of cerebral metastases. However, patients who
             have a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis but who have no radiographic
             or clinical evidence of residual tumor (eg, following complete surgical resection) are
             not excluded from participation in this study.
