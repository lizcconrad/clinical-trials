  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of R-COMP in elderly patients with advanced aggressive
      NHL. Myocet (non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) replaces conventional doxorubicin in the
      R-CHOP regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the duration of remission, disease free survival and 2-year survival of R-COMP in
      first line therapy of elderly patients with advanced aggressive NHL.

      To evaluate the tolerability of R-COMP in first line therapy of elderly patients with
      advanced aggressive NHL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), and their morphologic variants and subtypes,
             i.e. Centroblastic lymphoma, Immunoblastic lymphoma, T-cell rich/B-cell lymphoma,
             anaplastic large B-cell lymphoma, mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma;

          -  Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of MALT (incorrectly defined as high-grade MALT
             lymphoma);

          -  Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma with coexisting areas of DLBCL;

          -  Age of ≥60 years;

          -  Clinical stage at diagnosis: I A bulky – IV B;

          -  CD20 positivity;

          -  Serum negativity for HbsAg and HCV except for those with no sign of active viral
             replication, assessed by HCV-RNA copies;

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5x109/L, and platelet count ≥100x109/L (unless both
             are attributed directly to bone marrow involvement by lymphoma or auto-immune disease
             secondary to lymphoma);

          -  Serum creatinine ≤130μM/L, serum bilirubin ≤2.5xULN aspartate amino-transferase
             (AST/GOT), ≤2.5xULN alanine amino-transferase (ALT/GPT) ≤2.5xULN, and alkaline
             phosphatase ≤4 times the upper limit of normal (unless the increase is attributed
             directly to the presence of tumour by the Investigator)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50%;

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2;

          -  At least one measurable lesion is mandatory;

          -  Written informed consent given at time of registration;

          -  Males and females (both males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception for the duration, and for 3 months after the completion, of the
             treatment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical stage I non-bulky, or CS IIA with less than three sites of disease involved
             (patients with stage IIB are eligible, regardless of the number of sites involved);

          -  Tumour involvement of CNS;

          -  Indolent lymphoma transformed in more aggressive histological type, even if never
             previously treated;

          -  Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Peripheral T cell Lymphoma and their variants;

          -  Aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in transplanted patient;

          -  Clinically significant secondary cardiovascular disease, e.g. uncontrolled
             hypertension, (resting diastolic blood pressure &gt;115 mmHg), uncontrolled multifocal
             cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic angina pectoris or congestive cardiac failure NYHA
             class III-IV;

          -  Evidence of any severe active acute or chronic infection;

          -  Concurrent malignancy or history of other malignancy, except basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin (BCC) and in-situ cervical carcinoma (CIN) / Myelodysplastic syndrome;

          -  HbsAg, HIV-positive, or HCV-RNA-positive patients;

          -  Inability to comply with study procedures;

          -  Prior CNS lymphoma;

          -  Prior radiation to non-CNS lymphoma mass(es) as a treatment for lymphomas;

          -  History of allergic reaction to anthracyclines, eggs, and egg products or known
             sensitivities, or history of unusual reaction, to other components of, or treatments
             similar to, the investigational treatment regimen;

          -  Presence of other medication that may interfere with study treatment or the action of
             the investigational product or confuse the assessment of study results

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers;

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within 4 weeks prior to study entry.
