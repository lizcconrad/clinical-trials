  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the prevalence of pain in the anterior part of the
      knee, amongst youngsters between 16 and 18 years of age.

      Furthermore, this trial intends to study the connection between the pain, hyperpronation of
      the foot and tight Achilles tendon.

      We want to find out if there is a need of an early effort in terms of information, training
      and/or support for the shoes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All students (around 300) between 16 and 18 years of age from one Gymnasium, receives a
      questionnaire. They are asked to answer whether they have had pain in the anterior part of
      their knee within the last month. If so they are invited to participate in a scientific
      study. An equivalent group with no pain are invited to participate as a control group.

      In both groups navicular drop and drift will be measured together with the dorsal flexion.
      The investigations are made single-blinded as the investigators do not know if the &quot;patient&quot;
      has pain or not.
