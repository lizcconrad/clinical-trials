    <measure>Number of Oocytes Retrieved</measure>
    <time_frame>Ovum pick up day (34 to 38 hours post r-hCG administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean number of oocytes retrieved on the day of ovum pick up (OPU) was calculated. Oocyte retrieval was a technique used in in-vitro fertilization in order to remove oocytes from the ovary of the female, enabling fertilization outside the body. As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>

    <measure>Total Dose of Recombinant Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone (r-hFSH)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to end of stimulation cycle (approximately 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Ovarian Stimulation Days</measure>
    <time_frame>up to end of stimulation cycle (approximately 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of stimulation days were determined based on the treatment administration information collected in the case report form. Ovarian stimulation included time from first r-hFSH injection (stimulation Day) until day on which r-hCG was administered (r-hCG day). As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>

    <time_frame>up to end of stimulation cycle (approximately 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Needing Dose Adjustment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days post r-hFSH treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects needing increase in dose, decrease in dose or increase and decrease both in dose were reported. As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>

    <time_frame>up to end of stimulation cycle (approximately 31 days)</time_frame>
    <description>As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Embryo Implantation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>35-42 days post r-hCG administration</time_frame>
    <description>Embryo implantation rate was measured as the number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred multiplied by 100. As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>

    <measure>Overall Pregnancy Rate, Clinical Rate and Multiple Pregnancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>35-42 days post r-hCG administration</time_frame>
    <description>Overall pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with serum beta-hCG levels greater than 10 IU/L. Clinical pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with at least 1 ultrasound confirmed gestational sac, with or without foetal heart activity. Multiple pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with more than 1 ultrasound confirmed gestational sac in the uterus with fetal heart activity. As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>

        <description>Mean number of oocytes retrieved on the day of ovum pick up (OPU) was calculated. Oocyte retrieval was a technique used in in-vitro fertilization in order to remove oocytes from the ovary of the female, enabling fertilization outside the body. As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>

            <description>GONAL-f (follitropin alfa) administered subcutaneously, at a dose of 187.5 IU/day based on ART treatment guidelines, which determined the optimal dose of r-hFSH based on subject baseline characteristics/predictors of ovarian response throughout stimulation cycle. When at least 1 follicle &gt;=18 mm and 2 follicles &gt;=16 mm in diameter were developed, a single injection of 250 mcg of r-hCG was administered.</description>

          <title>Overall Pregnancy Rate, Clinical Rate and Multiple Pregnancy Rate</title>
          <description>Overall pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with serum beta-hCG levels greater than 10 IU/L. Clinical pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with at least 1 ultrasound confirmed gestational sac, with or without foetal heart activity. Multiple pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with more than 1 ultrasound confirmed gestational sac in the uterus with fetal heart activity. As per statistical analysis plan, efficacy analysis were performed for only those dose groups (Gonal-f 75 IU, Gonal-f 112.5 IU, Gonal-f 150 IU, Gonal-f 187.5 IU and Gonal-f 225 IU) which included more than 5 subjects.</description>
