  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) is an essential indicator of ventilation and
      respiratory function. It is routinely tested invasively by arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA)
      but recently developed miniaturized carbon dioxide tension sensors promise non-invasive and
      continuous transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) monitoring. We, the researchers at University
      Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, determined the accuracy of two PtcCO2 monitors (TOSCA 500 with
      Sensor 92, Linde Medical Sensors AG, Basel; and Sentec Digital Monitor with V-Sign Sensor,
      Sentec AG, Therwil) for measurement of single values and trends in PaCO2 in critically ill
      patients, using ABGA as a reference.

    <textblock>
      Measurement of SO2 is used in nearly every patient receiving anesthesia or sedation, whereas
      monitoring of pCO2 is important in patients during and shortly after major surgery and in
      critically ill patients. But measurement of pCO2 requires arterial blood sampling and
      laboratory testing. Non-invasive monitors for continuous assessment of arterial pCO2 have
      been developed but their accuracy and feasibility were insufficient to make them useful in
      the clinical setting. Recently, a new digital system for continuous and non-invasive
      monitoring of arterial pCO2 and SO2 has been introduced (SenTec Digital Monitor System,
      SenTec AG, Therwil, Switzerland). This present study has been designed to evaluate the
      accuracy of the SenTec V-SignTM monitoring system for measuring pCO2 in comparison with
      repeated arterial blood gas testing in the operation room and in the intensive care unit.
