  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose ranging study of candesartan cilexetil in hypertensive pediatric subjects ages
      1 to less than 6 years of age. It employs a double blind, randomized, dose ranging design
      intended for conduct as a multicenter trial. There are 3 study 'periods': a 1-week placebo
      run-in, a 4-week double blind treatment, and a 52-week open-label, long-term treatment
      period. Subjects undergo a screening evaluation, then a 1-week single-blind, placebo run-in,
      after which eligible subjects are allocated to receive 1 of 3 dose levels of candesartan
      cilexetil (0.05 mg/kg, or 0.20 mg /kg or 0.40 mg /kg), liquid formulation, in a 1:1:1 ratio
      for 4-weeks. At the end of randomized dose allocation (Day 28), blood pressure assessment
      will be performed and subjects may begin the 52-week, open-label treatment period of the
      study.

             of safety and efficacy endpoints.

          -  Weight &lt; 10 kg and &gt; 40 kg.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study population included male and female participants 1 to &lt;6 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension. The participants were recruited during the time period from 04 November 2004 to 07 August 2008 at pediatric clinics in the USA, Puerto Rico and Europe.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One to 2 weeks following a screening evaluation, participants underwent a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period to reduce the variability in the baseline blood pressure measurements and to stabilize any concurrent antihypertensive medications.</pre_assignment_details>
