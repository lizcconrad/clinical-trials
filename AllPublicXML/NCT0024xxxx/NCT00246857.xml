  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the biochemical and genetic causes of inherited immune diseases
      affecting lymphocyte homeostasis. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights
      infections. Normally, the body keeps a precise balance in which lymphocyte growth is matched
      by lymphocyte death. People with constantly enlarged lymph nodes or spleen, along with
      autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, lymphoma, or other immune problems affecting
      lymphocytes may have an abnormality of the immune system in the cell growth and cell death
      processes that regulate lymphocyte homeostasis.

      Patients who have, or are suspected of having, an inherited lymphocyte homeostasis or
      programmed cell death susceptibility syndrome may be eligible for this study. Relatives of
      patients are also included.

      Participants' (patients and relatives) medical records are reviewed and blood samples are
      drawn for studies to identify genes involved in immune disorders. Tissues that have been
      removed from patients for medical reasons, such as biopsied tissues, may be examined for
      tissue and DNA studies. Relatives are studied to determine if some of them may have a very
      mild form of lymphocyte homeostasis disorder.

      Patients who have an immune problem that the researchers wish to study further will be
      invited to donate additional blood samples at irregular intervals (at least once a year) and
      to provide an update of their medical records at the same time.

      This protocol is designed to screen patients with suspected or identified genetic diseases of
      immune cell homeostasis, reflecting abnormalities in programmed cell death, survival,
      development activation, and/or proliferation. Patients determined by clinical history and
      initial outside evaluation by their referring physician to be of interest will be consented
      and enrolled into this study. Blood specimens from such patients or their family members will
      be obtained for research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical bases
      of these diseases. Outside medical records will be obtained for chart review to correlate
      clinical history to research laboratory testing results. Results will be relayed to the
      referring physicians and where applicable patients will be referred to other appropriate NIH
      protocols for additional clinical evaluation and treatment. The study will enroll up to 5000
      patients and family members over the next 10 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients known to have or suspected of having an inherited immune cell homeostasis,
        programmed cell death susceptibility syndrome, lymphocyte developmental block, or defective
        immune cell effector functions will be eligible for enrollment. In the latter case, because
        of the intensive time and labor required for research laboratory testing, patients will be
        enrolled only if in the opinion of the investigator there is a high index of suspicion.
        Blood relatives of enrolled patients will be eligible for enrollment. There will be no
        limit as to age, sex, race or disability.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The presence of an acquired abnormality, such as HIV, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or malignancy
        may be grounds for possible exclusion if, in the opinion of the investigator, the presence
        of such a disease process interfered with evaluation.

        Severely debilitated health status or poor venous access may also preclude obtaining
        adequate specimens for analysis.

        Within the limits of maximal acceptable blood draw volumes and minimum requirement for core
        laboratory tests (9 ml of blood for V.A.2a and b), the cutoff weight for infants permitted
        in this protocol is 3 kg and above.
