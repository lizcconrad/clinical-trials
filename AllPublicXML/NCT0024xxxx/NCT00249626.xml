      The purpose of this study is to train therapists to administer contingency management (CM).
      This project will train up to 42 community-based treatment providers about the rationale for
      and the specifics of administering CM. Initial training will occur in 2-day workshops,
      followed by weekly supervision in delivery of CM with test cases. We expect that the majority
      of therapists will achieve high levels of competence and adherence in administering CM
      treatment within 3-5 test cases, as measured by ratings of audiotapes. To examine the
      efficacy of CM, each therapist who achieves adherence and competence in delivering CM will
      administer standard treatment alone or standard treatment plus CM to substance-abusing
      outpatients. In the CM condition, patients will have the opportunity to win prizes for
      submission of negative samples, and the treatment will be in effect for 12 weeks. In total,
      up to 200 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. A research
      evaluator will conduct follow-up assessments, scheduled for 3, 6 and 9 months after treatment
      initiation.
