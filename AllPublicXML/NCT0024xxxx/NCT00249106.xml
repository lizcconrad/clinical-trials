      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immune response to a investigational
      DNA Plasmid HIV vaccine, ADVAX e/g + ADVAX p/n-t (ADVAX), at three different dosage levels,
      in adults who are not infected with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation trial. Study site staff and volunteers will be blinded, blinding
      will not apply to the assignment of dose levels (low, middle or high).

      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before vaccination and will be followed for 18
      months after the first vaccination.

      15 volunteers will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio of active vaccine to placebo. Safety and
      tolerability of the ADVAX e/g + ADVAX p/n-t investigational product will be evaluated at
      least 14 days after the tenth volunteer in the lower dosage group receives the second
      injection before proceeding to the nextdosage group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, adult males and females;

             of the first vaccination;

          -  Available for follow up for the planned duration of the study (screening plus 18
             months);

          -  In the opinion of the principal investigator or designee, has understood the
             information provided. Written informed consent needs to be given before any
             study-related procedures are performed;

          -  Willing to undergo HIV testing and counseling, and receive HIV test results;

          -  If sexually active female, using an effective method of contraception from screening
             until at least 4 months after last vaccination, and willing to undergo urine pregnancy
             test.

          -  If sexually active male, willing to use an effective method of contraception from
             screening until 4 months after the last vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormality on history or examination including history of
             immunodeficiency or use of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive, antiviral,
             anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the designated trial
             physician in last 6 months;

          -  Any acute or chronic medical condition requiring care of a physician (e.g.,, diabetes,
             coronary artery disease, rheumatologic illness, malignancy, substance abuse) that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation;

          -  Any of the following abnormal laboratory parameters that are moderate, severe, or very
             severe: haematology (hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count,
             absolute CD4/CD8 count, platelets); urinalysis, biochemistries (total bilirubin,
             creatinine, AST, ALT). Volunteers with mild laboratory abnormalities that are judged
             by the principal investigator or designee to be not clinically significant may be
             enrolled.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational product currently or
             within past 12 weeks or expected participation during this study;

          -  Receipt of another experimental HIV vaccine at any time;

          -  Infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2 as indicated by ELISA and/or RT-PCR;

          -  History of severe local or systemic reaction to vaccination or history of severe
             allergic reactions;

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis B (surface antigen, HbsAg); hepatitis C (HCV
             antibodies) or active syphillis;
