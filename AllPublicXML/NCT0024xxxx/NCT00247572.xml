  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate if NRP 104 is a safe drug. The other purpose is to
      learn if NRP104, when injected into a vein, produces a high and any other effects like
      amphetamine and other stimulant drugs that are abused. This information will give some
      indication if NRP104 can be abused. Healthy people, between the ages of 18 and 55 with
      histories of substance abuse that include stimulant drugs, may join. Amphetamines are drugs
      that are used most often to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in
      children, to treat narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness) and for weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for a non-scheduled stimulant medication that can provide symptom control for
      children with ADHD as the conventional stimulant products do.

      Currently, the top line amphetamine product Adderall XR (R) for the treatment of children
      with ADHD involves a once-a-day morning dosing of up to 30 mg per day per Adderall XR (R)
      Package Insert. New River Pharmaceuticals has developed three NRP104 dose strengths of 30 mg,
      50 mg, and 70 mg to provide amphetamine base equivalent to Adderall XR (R) 10 mg, 20 mg, and
      30 mg, respectively. Adderall XR (R) and other amphetamine and methylphenidate containing
      preparations are liable to intravenous abuse.

      As part of the development of NRP104 for treatment of children with ADHD, it is important to
      evaluate the abuse potential of NRP104 given intravenously in comparison to immediate release
      d-amphetamine. This study will conduct relevant information to address appropriately the
      objectives of determining abuse potential of intravenously administered NRP104.
