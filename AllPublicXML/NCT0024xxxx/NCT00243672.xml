  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rupture of unstable atherosclerotic plaques is the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of
      acute coronary syndromes and thus also of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Lipid lowering
      drugs such as statins and fibrates have been shown to improve the outcomes of patients with
      atherosclerosis. This is not only mediated through their therapeutic actions on lipid
      metabolism, but relies on a multitude of pleiotropic effects of these substances. One of the
      most interesting of these effects is the stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques.

      To investigate these effects in a perioperative setting, patients scheduled for
      thromboendarterectomy of the carotid artery will be recruited. They will be randomised to
      receive either atorvastatin 10mg/d, gemfibrozil 1200mg/d or placebo for two weeks
      preoperatively. Specimens of carotid plaques will be obtained intraoperatively. After
      microscopic characterisation of plaques, DNA-microarray analyses will be done to gain
      insights into the transcriptional regulation and expression profiles of various types of
      atherosclerotic plaques under different pharmacological circumstances (stable or unstable
      with statin/fibrate/placebo).
