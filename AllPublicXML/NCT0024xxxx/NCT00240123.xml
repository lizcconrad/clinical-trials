  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if adding Benadryl improves sedation for patients
      scheduled to undergo ERCP or EUS procedures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usual sedatives used for endoscopy are meperidine (Demerol) and midazolam (Versed).
      Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) is often used in addition to these medications in an effort to
      improve sedation. There is little published information regarding the use of diphenhydramine
      in conscious sedation. It is recognized that certain patients have features that predict
      difficult sedation such as prescription sedative use or heavy alcohol use. In addition,
      prolonged procedures like ERCP and EUS require higher doses of sedatives. Diphenhydramine may
      improve the quality of sedation in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde
      cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedures. You are being
      asked to participate because you are already scheduled to undergo one of these procedures.
