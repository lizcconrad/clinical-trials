  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze microbiological data from MRSA samples obtained through the emergency department
      from 2001-2005. There is a strong clinical suspicion that we are now seeing an outbreak of a
      new strain of MRSA and we plan to better characterize the Vancouver population and complete a
      chart review to assess specific associated factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulse field gel electrophoresis, SCC mec typing, antibiotic susceptibilities, presence of the
      Panton-Valentine Leukocidin gene will be carried out. Clinical manifestations and associated
      factors will be assessed via chart review. These include: recent antibiotic use, recent
      hospitalization, IV drug use, HIV status, number of co-morbidities identified, presence of
      soft tissue abscess, post operative status, presence of bacteremia, residence in Vancouver's
      downtown eastside (an area of particularly low socioeconomic status).
