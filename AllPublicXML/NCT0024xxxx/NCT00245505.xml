          2. Patients with performed complete VCE &lt; 7 days prior to inclusion and diagnosed
             clinically active mild to moderate small bowel CD and no stricture on previous
             examinations, as previously proven by barium small bowel follow through, enteroclysis
             and / or patency test capsule.

          3. Patients between 18 - 70 years of age.

        4.3 Exclusion Criteria

             instance barium small bowel follow through, enteroclysis and / or patency capsule
             test.

          3. Patients with pacemaker due to lack of VCE interaction data.

          4. Patients who cannot undergo study procedures due to swallowing disorders.

          5. Planned or actual pregnancy or lactation.
