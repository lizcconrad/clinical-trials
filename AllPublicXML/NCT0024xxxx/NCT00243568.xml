  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international study of vicriviroc in 500 adult HIV-infected subjects who are
      failing standard antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV must be of a certain type known as
      R5/X4-mixed tropic. Subjects allowed into the trial will be randomly assigned to treatment
      with vicriviroc 10 mg QD, vicriviroc 15 mg QD, or placebo in addition to other
      antiretrovirals (selected by the investigator to be optimal for the specific subject)
      containing at least 3 drugs, including a protease inhibitor (PI) boosted with at least 100 mg
      ritonavir QD. Subjects will be continued for up to 48 weeks of dosing.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, parallel-group, double-blind study of
      vicriviroc (SCH 417690) in 500 adult HIV-infected subjects with R5/X4 mixed viral tropism who
      have at least 5000 copies/mL HIV RNA despite standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) that the
      subject has been receiving continuously for at least 3 months. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized to treatment with vicriviroc 10 mg QD, vicriviroc 15 mg QD, or placebo in addition
      to an individually optimized PI-containing ART regimen containing at least 3 drugs, including
      a PI, boosted by at least 100 mg ritonavir QD prescribed by the investigator. The vicriviroc
      dose and placebo will be double-blind, and the optimized background therapy will be
      open-label. Treatment visits after Day 1 are scheduled for Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,
      32, 40, and 48. A planned interim analysis will be conducted when 100 subjects have completed
      12 weeks of dosing. After completion of the primary analysis (24-week virologic response of
      all subjects), subjects will be given the optimal dose of vicriviroc and follow-up will be
      continued to at least 48 weeks. Safety will be monitored by standard laboratory tests,
      assessment of adverse events, and emergence of complicating medical conditions. Cardiac
      safety will be monitored periodically by ECG, and plasma samples will be collected from all
      subjects through the study for population pharmacokinetic analyses.
