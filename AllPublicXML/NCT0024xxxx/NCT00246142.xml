      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electrical stimulation enhances the effect
      of botulinum toxin type A (Dysport®) on myofascial pain syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic neck and shoulder pain for at least 6 months, refractory with other
             conservative treatments

          -  Presents at baseline with pain score greater than 50mm on 100mm length VAS. Pain score
             will be measured as overall pain over the 7 days preceding the visit during activities

          -  Active trigger point (TrP) defined as a tender spot localised in a taut band of muscle
             fibres associated with tenderness AND referred pain recognised by the patient into
             well-defined areas that are remote from the TrP area at palpation AND preferably local
             twitch response at palpation AND/OR jump sign at palpation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disc/bone disease

          -  History of surgery on neck

          -  Neurological deficits, neuromuscular junction disorder, Motor Neuron disease

          -  Patient has received anesthetic injections to the target trigger point within 4 weeks
             of study enrolment, or corticosteroid injections within 3 months

          -  Systemic inflammatory disease

          -  Hypersensitivity to Dysport®

          -  Diffuse tender points, or diagnosed with fibromyalgia

          -  Previous electrical stimulation

          -  Previous injection of Dysport® within 6 months of study enrolment
