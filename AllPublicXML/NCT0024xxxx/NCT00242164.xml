  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to better understand dialysis techniques which keep heart
      functions stable during dialysis. People on dialysis have a high risk for heart disease and
      strokes. More information about dialysis techniques that keep hearts stable may help prevent
      the high risk of cardiovascular disease and death and help to reduce discomfort during
      dialysis. This study will look at the way that the magnesium in dialysate affects heart
      function during dialysis. High or low levels of magnesium may change the way hearts beat. The
      question asked is if lowering the amount of magnesium in dialysate will affect the amount of
      magnesium in blood or change the heart beat.

    <textblock>
      Heart disease is a major cause of illness and death among patients on dialysis. Changes in
      the heart's rhythm and sudden cardiac death are also important problems in this group.
      Abnormal rhythm can occur during hemodialysis.

      During dialysis, the blood comes in contact with a solution called dialysate. This solution
      contains minerals like calcium, potassium and magnesium. Some studies have indirectly
      suggested that lower magnesium in dialysis patients protects them from having rhythm
      problems.

      Factors that increase the chance for the development of abnormal rhythms can be indirectly
      assessed by evaluating the electrocardiogram (EKG). This is done by measuring the distance
      between the wave forms on the EKG. One of these is called the QT interval. QT dispersion is a
      value derived from the QT interval. A long QT interval is thought to make an individual more
      prone to having abnormal heart rhythms.

      Therefore it is planned to study the effect of low levels of magnesium in the dialysate on QT
      interval and dispersion and the tendency for rhythm change. QT interval changes will be
      compared during dialysis with low magnesium with QT interval changes during dialysis with
      normal magnesium.

      This will be a cross over trial including 24 adult male and female patients on chronic
      hemodialysis. Subjects will be studied during two of their regular dialysis sessions, the
      only difference being the amount of magnesium in the dialysate. QT interval and QT dispersion
      will be calculated from the EKG recordings before and after each dialysis session.

      The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of cardiovascular risks in
      patients undergoing chronic dialysis and may offer a potentially novel strategy to reduce the
      risk of abnormal heart rhythms risk during dialysis.
