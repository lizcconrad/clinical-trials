  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study is to determine whether a positive affect and
      self-affirmation condition added to an empirically demonstrated approach for motivating
      behavior change is more effective than a standard approach in reducing risk factor behavior
      among a high-risk group of patients with coronary artery disease. Thus, the goal of the
      project is to refine and improve strategies for long-term maintenance of physical activity
      among patients post-angioplasty or stent.

    <textblock>
      Among coronary artery disease patients who have just had either angioplasty or stents, the
      objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate whether a novel behavioral intervention
      that employs induced positive affect and self-affirmation is more effective than an
      intervention without positive affect in increasing the maintenance of newly initiated
      physical activity post-procedure.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine whether more patients who receive the positive affect and self-affirmation
           intervention initiate more multiple behavior changes (e.g., changes in more health
           behaviors directed to their risk-factor profile) than those in the control group at one
           year.

        -  To determine whether the positive affect and self-affirmation intervention increases
           physical activity among patients who have depressive symptoms.

        -  To determine whether patients who are successful in increasing physical activity are
           more successful at changing other health behaviors.

    <description>This group received follow-up every 2-months for one year. Follow-up included questions about their heart disease progression and how well they had been able to engage in their doctor approved physical activity goal, which was the same as the control arm. Additionally, subjects in this arm were encouraged to use positive affect and self-affirmation techniques to motivate an increased level of participation in their physical activity goal. These subjects also received small token gifts to remind them of their study participation.</description>

    <description>During the physical activity goal setting process, subjects were randomly assigned to either the control or the intervention group. The intervention included receiving an additional educational workbook about using positive affect and self affirmation, as well as participating in using positive affect and self-affirmation to motivate behavior change, which in this case was to increase their physical activity level. Patient also received small token gifts to remind them of their participation in the study and to induce positive affect. The control group also set a physical activity goal and received the same follow-up, but did not participate in the positive affect and self-affirmation portion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing coronary artery catheterization who are found to have at least
             single vessel stenosis and who have had revascularization with angioplasty or coronary
             artery stenting will be eligible for enrollment.

          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent within the one week after the
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to walk several blocks regardless of the reason will be
             excluded from all the trials (e.g., arthritis, stroke, claudication).

          -  Enrollment in other trials designed to modify post-procedure behaviors.

          -  Patients who refuse to participate will be excluded.

          -  If at any time prior to enrollment in the study, the patient's cardiologist determines
             that the patient should not participate in this study, the patient will not be
             enrolled in the trial.
