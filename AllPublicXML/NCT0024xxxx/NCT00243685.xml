      DiaTech is a private company performing patient specific cancer chemosensitivity testing for
      patients and physicians. DiaTech Oncology is doing this clinical study to see if an
      experimental new technology called the microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay will predict
      treatment outcome and can help to direct the chemotherapy of cancer subjects. This study is
      focused on subjects diagnosed with breast, ovarian, lung, and colon malignancies and
      low-grade lymphomas.

      Study Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to predict the outcome of chemotherapy of
           cancer patients.

        -  To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide chemotherapy of cancer patients.

      Application of the Microculture Kinetic (MiCK) Assay for Apoptosis to Testing Drug
      Sensitivity of Solid Tumors DiaTech Oncology, LLC

      ----------------------------------------------------------- 1.0 Background and Rationale:
      Despite the use of aggressive treatment protocols, less than 10% of cancer patients with an
      advanced disease respond to the therapy. There is a variety of different cancer drug
      regimens, all of which have approximately the same probability of clinical effectiveness.
      Identification of those patients who will or will not respond to a specific chemotherapy is
      important for making decisions regarding chemotherapy regimens as well as alternative
      management approaches. A laboratory test that could help to determine the sensitivity of an
      individual patient's tumor cells to specific chemotherapeutic agents would be valuable in
      choosing the optimal chemotherapy regimen for that patient with an expectation of increasing
      the response rate to the therapy. Several types of in vitro assays that measure tumor cell
      survival following exposure to cytotoxic agents have been evaluated for their ability to
      predict chemotherapy outcomes. As a group, these assays are referred to as drug resistance
      assays. In a resistance assay, the surviving tumor cells can be detected directly by their
      exclusion or metabolism of specific dyes. Alternatively, since some of tumor cells are
      proliferating, their survival can be detected by measurement of DNA synthesis by radiolabeled
      precursor incorporation or demonstration of clonogenic potential by growth into colonies in
      semi-solid culture medium. In several clinical studies, these assays were useful in detecting
      drug resistance and in predicting a poor prognosis for cancer patients. However, these
      resistance assays cannot detect sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to a
      specific drug. Therefore, new methods determining drug-sensitivity of the tumor cells of an
      individual patient and, thus, capable of both predicting a positive treatment outcome and
      guiding chemotherapy, would be of significant value.

      Recently, Dr. Kravtsov has developed an automated microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay for
      measuring drug induced apoptosis in tumor cells1-4. Apoptosis is a distinct mode of cell
      death which occurs under physiological conditions and yet can be induced in malignant cells
      by chemical and physical factors including antitumor drugs5-7. During the last decade, it has
      been recognized that chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumor activity by triggering
      apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells8-17. This implies that the MiCK assay for apoptosis
      provides a mechanism-based approach to studying effects of cytotoxic agents on tumor cells.
      Unlike &quot;resistance&quot; assays that measure a fraction of cells surviving drug exposure, the MiCK
      assay measures a fraction of tumor cells killed by a chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism of
      apoptosis. Therefore the MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity, rather than resistance.
      Recently the MiCK assay has been shown to predict complete remission rate and survival in
      acute myeloid leukemia patients better than clinical criteria did18-20. In a limited study,
      the MiCK assay has been used to direct chemotherapy of the leukemia patients 21.

      The MiCK assay has also been used to study drug-induced apoptosis in solid tumors, including
      neuroblastoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines22-23. More recent data accumulated by
      DiaTech has demonstrated that the MiCK assay can detect drug induced apoptosis in primary
      cultures of tumor cells isolated from patients with ovarian carcinoma, gastric carcinoma,
      metastatic breast cancer and high grade soft tissue sarcoma. Based on these data, we suggest
      that the MiCK assay may be used to detect drug sensitivity profiles of individual patients
      with various types of solid tumors. This, in turn, may provide a way to tailor chemotherapy
      to an individual patient's drug sensitivity profile, and, thus, improve treatment outcomes,
      decrease adverse effects of the chemotherapy, increase the quality of patient's life, and
      reduce the treatment cost.

      2.0 Study Objectives: 2.1 To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to predict the outcome of
      chemotherapy of cancer patients.

      2.2 To evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide chemotherapy of cancer patients.

      3.0 Patient Population:

      3.1 Inclusion criteria: 3.1.1 Patients with pathological diagnoses of breast, lung, and
      ovarian adenocarcinomas and soft tissue sarcoma.

      3.1.2 Patients with de novo malignancies and no previous chemotherapy 3.1.3 Patients with
      advanced refractory malignancies who received no more than 2 standard chemotherapy treatment
      protocols.

      3.1.4 Patients of any age group. 3.1.5 Patients must have tumor which is accessible and agree
      to undergo biopsies, or drainage of effusions.

      3.1.6 Patients for whom chemotherapy is a treatment option. 3.2 Explanations: We anticipate
      that newly diagnosed patients will be mostly used to evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay
      to predict the outcome of the chemotherapy (Objective #2.1) and to establish criteria
      correlating numerical response in the MiCK assay with probability of the clinically
      established complete remission. The patients with refractory malignancies will be mostly used
      to evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide cancer chemotherapy (Objective #2.2).
      Patients will be seen and managed as outpatients or inpatients, depending on a clinical
      standard of the institution.

      3.3 Exclusion criteria: 3.3.1 Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchymal brain
      metastasis and not accessible tumors.

      3.3.2 Patients with meningeal metastasis. 3.3.3 Patients for whom chemotherapy clinically is
      not indicated. 3.3.4 Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all patients of childbearing
      potential should be instructed to contact the treating physician if they suspect they might
      have conceived a child; for females, a missing or late menstrual period should be reported to
      the treating physician. If pregnancy is confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient must not
      receive study medication and must not be enrolled into the study or, if already enrolled,
      must be withdrawn from the study. If a male patient is suspected of having fathered a child
      while on the study drugs, the pregnant female partner must be notified and counseled
      regarding the risk to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of this study will be reported
      to the Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event. Women of child bearing potential
      are defined to include any female who has experienced menarche and has not undergone
      successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
      oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea for more than 12 consecutive
      months); these includes also females using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive
      hormones, mechanical devices, or barrier methods to prevent pregnancy.

      4.0 Treatment Plan: 4.1 For the patients involved under the Study Objective (2.1), treatment
      protocol for an individual will not be influenced by the results of the MiCK assay for that
      patient. Oncologists will be blinded of the results of the MiCK assay and the patients will
      be treated according to a standard treatment protocol. When available, actual clinical
      response to the treatment will be compared with that predicted by the MiCK assay.

      4.2 For the patients involved under the Study Objective (2.2), treatment protocol for an
      individual patient will be designed based on the results of the MiCK assay for that patient.
      The drug with the best activity in the assay will be used to treat the individual patients.
      If more than one drug is equally active, the patient will receive the active drug in a class
      he/she has not received before. If no drug is found to have activity (insensitivity in the
      assay), the patients will be treated on an empiric basis with a class of drug he/she never
      received in the past.

      5.0 Definition of Clinical Response 5.1 All patients will be evaluated for clinical response
      to chemotherapy as per standard protocol established for a specific malignancy.

      5.1.1 Complete Remission is defined as total disappearance of clinically and radio logically
      detectable disease for at least four weeks.

      5.1.2 Partial Response is defined as at least 50% reduction of all measurable tumor lesions
      as measured by the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions
      of measurable lesions, with no new lesions appearing for at least four weeks.

      5.1.3 Stable Disease is defined as a reduction by less than 50% or increase by less than 25%
      in the size of the tumor lesions, with no new lesions appearing.

      5.1.4 Progressive Disease is defined as appearance of any new tumor lesions or increase of
      25% or more in the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions
      of measurable existing lesions.

      6.0 Definition of the drug response in the MiCK assay. 6.1 In the MiCK assay, the extent of
      drug-induced apoptosis is measured in Kinetic Units (KU) on a scale from 0 to 16 (Blood,
      1998). Apoptotic responses in KU will be calculated for each dose of a tested drug or drug
      combination. The maximal numerical response induced by a drug will be considered the &quot;best
      apoptotic response&quot; to the drug.

      6.1.1 Under the Study Objective (2.1), the &quot;best apoptotic response&quot; to the drug will be
      compared to the clinical response to the drug to establish a numerical value of the in vitro
      response discriminating drug-sensitive and drug-insensitive tumors (establishing a numerical
      cut-off of sensitivity). From our experience with establishing cut-off values of drug
      sensitivity for acute leukemia, 25-30 patients should provide a sufficient statistical power
      for getting a significant discriminator. These 25-30 patients will be fed from both patients
      participating under Study Objective (2.1) and Study Objective (2.2). After the numerical
      cut-off for sensitivity is established, it will be applied to a cohort of patients who
      received treatment with the drug to compare responses predicted in the MiCK assay to the
      actual clinical responses. This second part of the study will have two legs: (a)
      &quot;prospective&quot; (using 30-35 patients entering the study after establishing the discriminator,
      and (b) &quot;retrospective&quot; (using an available database of the patients who received treatment
      in the past and who's clinical response to the chemotherapy is known).

      6.1.2 For the patients participating under the Study Objective (2.2), a drug inducing the
      highest &quot;best apoptotic response&quot; will be considered the best active drug and will be
      recommended for including in the treatment protocol. Only drugs with the numerical value of
      the &quot;best apoptotic response&quot; exceeding a certain threshold should be expected to induce a
      complete remission. In the beginning of the study, such a threshold will be judged based on
      the results of the previous leukemia study19-22. As first 25-30 patients enter the study, the
      thresholds will be established for solid tumor patients as described in (6.1.1) and used
      thereafter. Considering that these 25-30 patients will be fed from both patients
      participating under Study Objective (2.1) and Study Objective (2.2), we expect to have first
      statistical correlations available no later than 3-4 months after the study begins.

      6.1.3 Drug selection for testing against tumor cells will be based on the previous
      chemotherapy history of an individual patient with consideration of the future treatment
      plans. The drugs will be selected from a compendium of agents recommended for the treatment
      of the patient's malignancy.

      7.0 Statistics 7.1 We estimate that sufficient statistical power will be obtained with
      approximately 50-60 patients with successful MiCK assays. A successful MiCK assay is defined
      as an assay for which a sufficient number of viable tumor cells could be isolated from the
      submitted pathologic material. For correlations between the patient's sensitivity profiling
      in the MiCK assay and clinical responses, the patients will be evaluated as the whole group
      as well as stratified based on the type of malignancy. The latter will depend on the number
      of patients with specific tumor types available for the study.

      7.2 In order to discriminate between the drug-sensitive and drug insensitive tumor cell
      populations, the best responses to each agent will be compared in a receiver operator
      characteristic (ROC) analysis as well as logistic regression analysis with attainment of CR
      (CR vs No CR). Based on the best combination of statistical sensitivity, specificity, and p
      value, thresholds demarcating drug sensitivity and insensitivity will be established. The
      Fisher's exact test, chi-square test and analysis of variance method will be employed to test
      the correlation between the clinical response results and other clinical variables. For
      lifetime data analyses, Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival will be used. Other statistical
      techniques may also be implied if found useful.

      8.0 Specimen collection, purification of tumor cells and sensitivity testing 8.1 Specimen
      collection must be performed as per related DiaTech Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

      8.1.1 Collection of a Solid Tumor Biopsy Specimen is performed under sterile conditions,
      using excision biopsy technique, to obtain at least 2 cm3 of viable tumor tissue. The more
      viable tumor tissue is submitted for the study, the more chemotherapeutic agents can be
      tested against the tumor cells. Effusion specimen (peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid and
      effusions from other anatomical sites) should be collected in a commercial sterile
      container/bag with added Sodium Heparin (10 U/ml) to prevent clotting. The sample size should
      not be less than 500 ml. The specimen should not be fixed, or frozen.

      8.1.2 Transportation: seal the transport tube/container/bag tightly. Label specimen with
      institution, patient name, date and time of collection, and anatomical site of collection.
      Place the transport tube/container/bag on ice pack (blue ice). Ice pack must be frozen before
      placing it to the container. Fill out the Study Requisition form and include with the
      transportation container.

      8.1.3 Place the 50 mL tubes or a container inside the zip-lock bag and seal. Place specimen
      and Cold Pak (blue ice) in a transport box. Place completed patient information forms and
      specimen transport box into FedEx plastic &quot;Diagnostic Specimen Envelope&quot; and seal. Complete
      and affix the FedEx Airbill to the outside of the Diagnostic Specimen Envelope. Be sure that
      the airbill is marked &quot;FedEx Priority Overnight&quot; delivery. Put $5 value on the FedEx Airbill.
      Indicate &quot;Human tissue for diagnostic studies&quot; in the appropriate section of the FedEx
      Airbill. Call DiaTech Oncology at (514)-398-5174 (Steve Moisan, lab manager) or
      (514)-398-5154 (general lab) with the Fed Ex Tracking Number. DiaTech must receive the
      specimen within 24 hours of collection. Specimens sent on Friday must be marked for Saturday
      delivery.

      8.2 Tumor cell purification and their chemosensitivity testing will be performed as per
      related DiaTech SOPs.

      8.2.1 Tissue biopsy and effusion specimens will be treated to obtain a suspension containing
      single tumor cells and/or small cell aggregates composed of 2-20 tumor cells. Using gradient
      centrifugation, red blood cell lysing, cell strainers, magnetic beads and other appropriate
      techniques, the tumor cell suspension will be enriched to at least 80% purity and no less
      than 90% viability. Immunocytochemical stains or, when applicable, flow cytometry will be
      used to confirm the presence of specific tumor markers on purified cells After purification,
      selected chemotherapeutic agents will be tested against purified tumor cells in the MiCK
      assay.

      8.2.2 The purified tumor cells will be suspended in culture medium and plated in 96-well
      microtiter plates. Multiple concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents will be achieved by
      adding each respective agent to wells in 5 μL aliquots The ranges of final drug
      concentrations will be based on reports of pharmacokinetic studies of the drugs and their
      active metabolites in patients. Data processing and quantification of drug-induced apoptosis
      will be performed by a proprietary ProApoTestTM software. The extent of apoptosis will be
      determined and expressed as kinetic units (KU) of apoptosis.

      9.0 Efficacy measurement 9.1 For patients participating under Study Objective (2.1), the goal
      of the study is to establish a statistically significant discriminator of sensitivity which
      would correlate with the rate of CR. Such discriminator should be applicable to patient's
      populations participating under Study Objectives (2.1) and (2.2).

      9.2 For patients participating under Study Objective (2.2), we would expect no greater than a
      10% response rate in refractory solid tumor patients to any standard chemotherapy. A response
      rate to the MiCK assay-guided therapy of less than 10% would be of no further interest. A
      response rate of 10-30% will suggest the MICK assay needs further study. A response rate
      greater than 30% would justify usefulness of the MiCK assay in guiding chemotherapy of
      patients with refractory solid tumors.

      10.0 Specimen's left over 10.1 If a specimen contains more tumor cells than needed for
      testing their sensitivity to the drugs specified by the patient's oncologist, an excess of
      the tumor cells may be considered for use for other research studies conducted by DiaTech
      Oncology. Patients will be asked for their permission to use specimen's left over for
      research purposes by signing the following release included in the requisition form: &quot;You are
      participating in the Research Program which may result in improvements of the treatment
      outcome for cancer patients. There is no direct benefit for you at present time. Your
      physician is submitting to DiaTech a specimen containing your tumor cells. At DiaTech, we
      purify the tumor cells, count them, check their viability, and store them in the DiaTech
      Tissue Bank. All these procedures are performed at no cost to you or your family. Your cells
      may be used for the chemosensitivity testing for research purposes or in other studies.
      Results of the research may be published, or used commercially in the area of new anti-cancer
      drug or treatment protocol development. To assure your privacy, should the results of the
      studies be published, you will be referred to only by number. Your signature below indicates
      that you agree to these terms&quot;.

      If a patient refuses to sign the above release, the specimen's left over will be
      decontaminated using 10% formaldehyde for 24h and discarded as per related SOP. If a patient
      grants his/her permission for use on the specimen's left over in a future research, an excess
      of the tumor cells will be frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen indefinitely.

      10.2 Specimen's left over may be used to study anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs
      or drug combinations, to study mechanisms of drug resistance, to correlate phenotypic
      features of the tumor cells with their drug sensitivity profile.

      11.0 Plan of communication between Principal Investigator and co-Principal Investigator.

      To insure proper communication between Vladimir Kravtsov, MD, the Study Principal
      Investigator, and participating co-Principal Investigator the following communication means

      Video-conferencing

      11.1 At the time of submission of the patient's specimen for the study, relevant clinical
      information will be submitted to DiaTech in the form of a study requisition form prepared by
      the participating co-PI (or designated staff nurse) using FedEx courier service.

      11.2 Upon receiving the specimen and requisition form and after purification of tumor cells
      from the specimen, Dr. Kravtsov will place a telephone call to the referring oncologist
      (co-PI) to discuss the case.

      11.3 Upon completion of the patient's tumor drug sensitivity testing, results will be scored

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with pathological diagnoses of breast, lung, and ovarian adenocarcinomas and
             soft tissue sarcoma.

          -  Patients with de novo malignancies and no previous chemotherapy

          -  Patients with advanced refractory malignancies who received no more than 2 standard
             chemotherapy treatment protocols.

          -  Patients of any age group.

          -  Patients must have tumor which is accessible and agree to undergo biopsies, or
             drainage of effusions.

          -  Patients for whom chemotherapy is a treatment option.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchymal brain metastasis and non-accessible
             tumors.

          -  Patients with meningeal metastasis.

          -  Patients for whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.

          -  Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all patients of childbearing potential
             should be instructed to contact the treating physician if they suspect they might have
             conceived a child; for females, a missing or late menstrual period should be reported
             to the treating physician. If pregnancy is confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient
             must not receive study medication and must not be enrolled into the study or, if
             already enrolled, must be withdrawn from the study. If a male patient is suspected of
             having fathered a child while on the study drugs, the pregnant female partner must be
             notified and counseled regarding the risk to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of
             this study will be reported to the Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event.
             Women of childbearing potential are defined to include any female who has experienced
             menarche and has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal
             (defined as amenorrhea for more than 12 consecutive months); this also includes
             females using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones, mechanical
             devices, or barrier methods to prevent pregnancy.
