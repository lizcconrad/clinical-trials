      The primary objective of the Phase I part of the study is to determine the recommended dose
      of capecitabine to be administered in combination with ZD1839 250 mg orally once daily in
      subjects with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer by assessing DLTs.

      The primary objective of the Phase II part of the study is to estimate the objective response
      rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) at study closure for ZD1839
      administered in combination with capecitabine in subjects with advanced or metastatic
      colorectal cancer using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).
