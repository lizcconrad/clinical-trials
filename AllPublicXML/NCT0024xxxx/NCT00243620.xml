    <textblock>
      Current treatment modalities for chronic leg ulcers are time consuming, expensive, and only
      moderately successful. Recent data suggest that creating a sub-atmospheric pressure by Vacuum
      Assisted Closure (V.A.C.®) therapy supports the wound healing process. Here, we studied the
      efficacy of V.A.C.® in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers prospectively.

      PROTOCOL

      I. INTRODUCTION:

      In the last 25 years we have entered an area where patients are living longer with more
      complex systemic pathology. The number of patients with chronic non-healing wounds continues
      to increase, despite many recent advances in the basic science of wound healing.

      Although, the chronic leg ulcers approximately affect 1 % of the adult population of
      developed countries and chronic wound care consumes 1-2% of the health care budgets of
      European countries. It is still probably true to say that leg ulcer disease is not
      sufficiently recognised as a problem either by the population at large or by the medical
      community. Recent socio-economic and quality of life data showed the importance of this
      long-neglected health care problem.

      In recent years, many new wound care products were developed. We have learned that a moist
      wound bed, without maceration of wound borders, gives faster wound healing. So, wound care
      products need a high absorption capacity and at the same time, they need to create a moist
      wound climate. However, many of these new wound care products resulted in divergent results.
      Complications are described like enlargement of the wounds, maceration, infections, sepsis
      and loss of grafts. These results in delayed hospitalisation and increased costs.

      In 1989 Prof. Argenta and Dr. Morykwas developed a sub-atmospheric pressure technique: &quot;
      Vacuum Assisted Closure&quot;. This technique was introduced to our hospital by the department of
      surgery in the treatment of large complicated surgical wounds.

      We are employing this new technique at our department of dermatology in treating lower leg
      ulcers since 1997, by placing a foam dressing into the wound, seal it with tape and applying
      a sub-atmospheric pressure to the wound.

      The meaning of Vacuum Assisted Closure is, first to clean the ulcer in a quick and
      non-invasive way until a vital red wound is produced (first stage). When a wound is too big
      to close primarily, secondary surgery is needed. By using the V.A.C.-technique in combination
      with transplantation, the skin grafts will be supported in adhering to the wound surface
      (second stage).

      Before the PVA (Polyvinylalcohol) or PU (Polyurethane ether) foam is placed into the wound,
      the border has to be protected by hydrocolloïd foam, which will be trimmed to the appropriate
      size and geometry for each individual wound. After that, The PVA or PU foam can be placed
      into the wound defect. We employed especially a reticulated polyvinyl alcohol dressing with a
      pore size of 400-600 h-meters depending of the appearance of the wound bed. The Polyurethane
      ether foams were often used in the past. The PVA or PU foams are embedded with a
      non-collapsible evacuation tube, having side ports that allow communication of the lumen to
      the space of the reticulated foam. In large wounds, multiple foams may be placed in close
      contact to one another. The surface of the foam dressing is covered by an adhesive drape,
      extending 5 cm, beyond the hydrocolloid dressings. The proximal end of the evacuation tube
      leads to a collection canister localised on the V.A.C. pump into which the wound fluid will
      be drawn when a permanent sub-atmospheric pressure is applied. So an open wound is now
      converted to a controlled closed wound.

      First a permanent subatmospheric pressure was applied to the chronic ulcus cruris until a
      vital red wound was produced (first stage). Subsequently, these ulcers were treated by a
      combination of transplantation and vacuum sealing to support the skin grafts (the second
      stage). The therapy was monitored weekly.

      The V.A.C. is the first active, non-invasive wound care product, used by a secure local
      regulated sub-atmospheric pressure technique.

      The exact mechanisms to explain this treatment are not known yet. Researches by Prof. Argenta
      et al. postulated that interrelated factors are the basis for the success of the technique.
      These factors can be devised in 3 subgroups: (1) Removing, (2) Improving, (2) Reducing

        1. Tissues surrounding the chronic wounds are characterised by localised collection of
           interstitial or third-space fluid. This collection of third-space fluid contains factors
           which inhibits or suppresses mitosis, protein synthesis and fibroblasts collagen
           synthesis. An active withdrawal of this fluid removes the excess of third space wound
           fluid and its inhibitory factors. The active withdrawal also results in the removing of
           wound debris.

        2. The collection of third space fluid mechanically comprises the micro-vascularisation and
           lymphatic system. By removing the third space fluid and its inhibitory factors, this
           result in increased vascularisation, reduced venous afterload and an increased delivery
           of oxygen and nutrients as well. These changes improve the rate of granulation formation
           and the concentration of growth factors. An additional mechanism of the V.A.C. is the
           mechanical stimulation of cells migration by tensile forces placed on the surrounding
           tissues.

        3. Besides reducing of third space fluid, we know that successful wound healing correlates
           with bacterial counts of less than 100 000 organism per gram of tissue.

      Bacterial counts of human wounds treated by V.A.C. have demonstrated a significant decrease
      after 3-4 days usually until less than 1000 per gram of tissue. Last but not least, the
      V.A.C. technique also reduces the infection chances, because the creation of a controlled
      closed wound.

      Recently socio-economic and quality of life evaluation showed the impact of this
      long-neglected health care problem. Phillips et al shows a strong correlation between time
      spent on ulcer care and feelings of anger and the quality of life. Besides that, there is no
      doubt that ulcer care consumes a substantial proportion of the health care budgets. The
      retrospective results of V.A.C. therapy compared to the conventional therapy showed a
      reduction up tot 39% in hospitalisation time. These outcomes may be result in a better
      quality of life and a reduction of the health care costs.

      Summarised V.A.C. treatment has a positive effect to wound cleaning and increases the
      survival chance of transplanted skin, which will minimise hospitalisation time and costs,
      compared to the conventional wound care techniques. It must be emphasised that the
      Vacuum-assisted Closure technique was developed as an adjunct to wound care. It is not meant
      to, and will never, replace surgical procedures. Despite the positive effects, this method
      needs more and further investigation.

      A randomised, prospective, comparative cost/ effect balance and quality of life investigation
      will be starting soon in co-operation with Prof. H.A.M. Neumann (University Hospital
      Maastricht), comparing the V.A.C. treatment versus conventional therapy.

      II. AIMS OF THIS MULTI-CENTRE STUDY:

      To demonstrate V.A.C. therapy is a more quick and cheap option in the treatment of chronic
      arteriolosclerotic, chronic venous en combined venous /arterial leg ulcers.

      III. PATIENTS AND METHODS:

      3.1 Patients: The study is conducted in the departments of Dermatology at the University
      Hospital Maastricht and the Atrium Medical Centre Heerlen. All patients in which extensive
      ambulatory treatment in an out-patient-clinic according to the Scottish Intercollegiate
      Guideline Network (SIGN) had failed and who are hospitalized due to chronic venous (venous
      insufficiency of the deep or superficial system without an arterial incompetence), combined
      venous/arterial (venous insufficiency of the deep or superficial system with an
      ankle/brachial index of 0·60 - 0·85) or arteriolosclerotic (Martorell's ulcer) leg ulcers,
      are evaluated for eligibility in this study.

      3.2 Methods: Patients are randomly assigned to the VAC® therapy group or to the control group
      (conventional wound care) by a computer program using random permuted blocks of 8.
      Randomisation was carried out within 3 strata, one for each ulcer type: venous, combined
      venous/arterial, and arteriolosclerotic ulcers, respectively. Treatment allocation occurred
      through telephone calls to the coordinating centre.

      In both study groups and both study centres an initial necrotectomy was performed by sharp
      debridement of slough and nonviable tissue.

      I.Vacuum Assisted Closure-techniques:

      Before the PVA (Polyvinylalcohol) or PU (Polyurethane ether) foam is placed into the wound,
      the border has to be protected by a hydrocolloïd foam, which will be trimmed to the
      appropriate size and geometry for each individual wound. After that, The PVA or PU foam can
      be placed into the wound defect. We employed especially a reticulated polyvinyl alcohol
      dressing with a pore size of 400-600 h-meters depending of the appearance of the wound bed.
      The Polyurethane ether foams were often used in the past. The PVA or PU foams are embedded
      with a non-collapsible evacuation tube, having side ports that allow communication of the
      lumen to the space of the reticulated foam. In large wounds, multiple foams may be placed in
      close contact to one another. The surface of the foam dressing is covered by an adhesive
      drape, extending 5 cm, beyond the hydrocolloid dressings. The proximal end of the evacuation
      tube leads to a collection canister localised on the V.A.C. pump into which the wound fluid
      will be drawn when a permanent sub-atmospheric pressure is applied. So an open wound is now
      converted to a controlled closed wound.

      The meaning of Vacuum Assisted Closure is, first to clean the ulcer in a quick and
      non-invasive way until a vital red wound is produced (first stage). When a wound is too big
      to close primarily, secondary surgery is needed. By using the V.A.C.-technique in combination
      with transplantation, the skin grafts (punch grafts) will be supported in adhering to the
      wound surface (second stage). Once all skin grafts are well adhered, the V.A.C. therapy can
      be stopped. Until 100% wound-closing patients will be hospitalised by compression and local
      therapy.

      Thereafter ambulant therapy (compression and local therapy) will be continued until complete
      wound healing. Also therapy will be controlled once a week.

      II.The conventional wound care techniques (control group):

      Patients assigned to standard wound care receive daily local wound care according to the SIGN
      guideline and a multiple-layer compression bandage (Smith and Nephew, Hoofddorp, the
      Netherlands) until complete healing. Four basic types of commercially available wound
      dressings will be used in this study including hydrogels (Johnson&amp;Johnson, Amersfoort, the
      Netherlands), alginates (Hartmann, Nijmegen, the Netherlands), hydrocolloids (Smith and
      Nephew, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands), and films (Hartmann, Nijmegen, the Netherlands). The
      choice of dressing most depended on the ulcer type, the amount of exsudate and the
      physician's preference. Once 100% granulation was achieved, these patients also received
      punch skin-graft transplantation in combination with topical therapy.

      In both treatment groups, only toilet and basic hygiene mobility was permitted during the
      wound bed preparation and transplantation stage. After complete wound healing,
      community-grade elastic support stockings class 2 (Medi, Breda or Varodem, Horn; the
      Netherlands) or 3 (Varodem, Horn; the Netherlands) were prescribed depending on the
      underlying pathology.

      3.3 Punch transplantation procedure The transplants will be taken of the upper-leg by placing
      first a 'field-block' local anaesthetic (lidocaine 2% in NaCl). Epidermal grafts will be
      created using a biopsy corer of 4 mm). The size of the field-block depends of the ulcer size.

      3.4 Evaluation criteria Because masking the interventions is not possible, patients will be
      reviewed clinically by the same independent research physician and consultant dermatologist
      twice a week until the ulcer is healed: description of the wound defect, surrounding tissue,
      tracing the ulcer and taking a picture (Enclosure III), time investment forms (nurse and MD)
      (Enclosure IV), evaluation of the used materials (Enclosure IV), evaluation of the V.A.C.
      therapy and noting complications (Enclosure IV) and the quality of life evaluation of the
      patient (Enclosure II). Using codes will anonymise all the patient information.

      3.5 Selection criteria:

        1. Patient groups (V.A.C.; n=30 / Conventional techniques; n=30):

           I.chronic venous leg ulcer II. chronic combined venous /arterial leg ulcer III. chronic
           arteriolosclerotic leg ulcer

        2. Sex : either sex

        3. Inclusion criteria:

           a)patient with a chronic leg ulcer (&gt; 6 months) without healing signs and satisfies to
           one or more criteria:

             -  Venous (venous insufficiency of the deep or superficial system without an arterial
                incompetence)

             -  Combined venous/arterial (venous insufficiency of the deep or superficial system
                with an ankle/brachial index of 0·60 - 0·85)

             -  Arteriolosclerotic (Martorell's ulcer) leg ulcers (diagnose made by anamnesis,
                clinical signs, exclusions of differential diagnosis's, venous/ arterial duplex
                shows no signs of obstruction or major venous insufficiency, histology)

        4. Exclusion criteria:

      1) ulcer duration shorter than 6 months 2) age &gt; 85 years 3) use of immune suppressive
      medication 4) known type IV allergies against ingredients of the wound care products 5)
      insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type I 6) severe peripheral arterial disease
      (ankle/brachial index &lt;0·60) 7) vasculitic ulcers 8) neoplastic ulcers. In patients
      presenting with multiple ulcerations, the clinically most severe ulcer was included in the
      study whereas the other ulcers were treated conventionally.

      3.6 Informed Consent :

      Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients (volunteers). The investigator
      will explain the nature of this study and its purpose, risks and duration.

      Patients (volunteers) will advised that they are free to participate in, or to withdraw from,
      the study at any time without prejudice to the doctor-patient relationship. The medical care
      provided will not be affected or refusal to participate in this study.

      This protocol will be submitted to the appropriate institutional Ethical Committee and their
      approval obtained in writing will be awaited before starting the study.

      3.7 Randomisation:

      All volunteers first will underwent a complete intake. When the volunteer satisfy the
      inclusion- and exclusion criteria, this multi-centre trial the randomisation procedure will
      be carried out by the clinician being in contact with a central registration office, by
      telephone. An independent person will use a computer program, which determine the therapy
      (V.A.C. or Conventional therapy) by serial numbers. This centralisation helps the correct
      implementation of each step and ensures that someone has an overview of how the trial is
      going. Before randomisation, stratification into the ulcer type (3 strata: venous, combined
      venous/ arterial and arteriolosclerotic ulcers) is needed. Using codes will anonymise all
      patient information.

      Data from a retrospective study showed that the mean duration of the preparation period was
      24 days in conventional wound care (SD 11) versus 12 days in VAC® therapy (SD 5). In order to
      detect a minimal difference of 10 days in preparation time with a power of 80% (α=5%) the
      number of patients required in each treatment-group was 30, as derived from sample-size
      calculations.

      3.8 Masking: Because masking the interventions is not possible, patients were reviewed
      clinically by the same independent research physician and consultant dermatologist twice a
      week until the ulcer had healed. Thereafter, patients were prospectively followed up by one
      and the same research physician at three months, six months and one year after discharge. All
      participating clinicians completed standardised case record forms and checklists during their
      control visits, treatments and follow-ups.

      Decisions made during the treatment (V.A.C. and conventional therapy) are based on simple and
      objective standards:

        -  Yellow debris and a necrotic tissue is bad climate for skin grafts.

        -  Only a red, vital granulated wound bed causes a successful transplantation

        -  Once all skin grafts are well adhered, the V.A.C. therapy can be stopped.

        -  100% epithelialisation (wound closure) This approach seems to be authorised, because
           scientific investigations showed these kinds of judgements are apparent equally
           objective compared to other judgement methods (thesis of Dr. Mekkes; Amsterdam). To have
           an external control, every intervention will be photograph.

      3.9 outcome results:

      Primary endpoints:

      Time-to-complete-healing: i.e. the period between initial preparation of the wound and 100%
      epithelialisation with the primary endpoint being time-to-complete-healing.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. duration of the wound-bed preparation stage

        2. percentage of leg ulcer recurrences within one year (i.e. an epithelial breakdown
           anywhere along or within the index ulcer region)

        3. skin-graft survival, where applicable (i.e. percentage of successfully adhered skin
           grafts after 4 days of complete bed rest and compression or VAC® treatment) Furthermore,
           we compared between both experimental groups i) the quality of life, ii) pain scores,
           iii) the total time needed for wound care until complete wound closure, and iv) the
           costs per ulcer.

      3.10 Follow-up: Patients are followed up by one and the same research physician at three
      months, six months and one year after discharge.

      3.11 Statistical analysis: All data will be analysed using the SPSS 11.0 software package and
      the results are analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Time-to-complete-healing, duration
      of wound-bed preparation, and recurrence rates are compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis. The log rank test is used to test for statistically significant differences between
      both groups. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis is used to adjust for imbalances in the
      baseline distribution of relevant prognostic factors. The regression coefficient, expresses
      the independent contribution of potential determinants to duration of cleaning and
      wound-healing. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are presented. A
      p-value of less than 0·05 was considered to be statistically significant.

      Percentages are compared by the chi-square test and continuous variables are compared using
      the independent samples t-test (for normally distributed variables) and the two-independent
      sample test (for non-normally distributed variables).
