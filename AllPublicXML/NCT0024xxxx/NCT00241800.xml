      To investigate a potential relationship between four different classes of non-cardiovascular
      drugs and the risk of sudden cardiac death.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:

      There are more than 400,000 sudden cardiac deaths annually in the U.S, of which 85% or more
      are caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Medications are an important modifiable risk
      factor because many have effects that can provoke lethal arrhythmias. There is increasing
      suspicion that several drugs in four widely used classes of non-cardiovascular
      medications-fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants-
      are pro-arrhythmic and thus increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Published
      epidemiologic studies have quantified the risk conferred by older antipsychotics and
      antidepressants as well as oral erythromycin. The current project will extend these studies
      to newer medications that are used by an estimated 20% of adults in the U.S. Studies of
      surrogate markers suggest that the pro-arrhythmic effects of these drugs vary markedly.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This retrospective cohort study has three specific aims in testing the relationship between
      certain non-cardiovascular medications-fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics,
      antipsychotics, and antidepressants- and sudden cardiac death.. Specific aim 1 tests the
      hypothesis that there is corresponding variation in risk of sudden cardiac death. In vivo
      data suggest that concurrent use of study drugs with other common medications that inhibit
      their metabolism could markedly increase drug concentrations, and thus risk of arrhythmias.
      Specific aim 2 tests the hypothesis that these pharmacokinetic interactions, defined a
      priori, increase risk of sudden cardiac death. The hypokalemia caused by the commonly used
      potassium-wasting diuretics may amplify the pro-arrhythmic effects of medications. Specific
      aim 3 tests the hypothesis that concurrent use of study drugs and these diuretics increases
      risk of sudden cardiac death. The investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort study in
      TennCare, Tennessee's expanded Medicaid program. Computerized TennCare files, linked with
      death certificates, provide the information necessary to define the cohort, classify followup
      according to medication exposure and potential confounders, and identify cases of sudden
      cardiac death using a validated computer case definition we have developed. The cohort will
      include an estimated 800,000 persons with 15,000 sudden cardiac deaths during 5,000,000
      person years of followup and thus will have excellent power for risk estimates. The study
      will provide data that clinicians need to prescribe these widely used medications in a way
      that minimizes the risk of sudden cardiac death.

        : We will conduct a retrospective cohort study of Tennessee Medicaid enrollees 30 years of
        age or older who meet the study inclusion-exclusion criteria. From the Medicaid pharmacy
        files, we will identify users of study drugs and controls. During followup, we will
        identify out-of-hospital deaths, most likely to be sudden deaths, based in part on linkage
        with Tennessee death certificate files. From these deaths, we will identify those meeting
        the criteria for sudden cardiac death, based upon a previously validated computer
        algorithm. Important potential confounders will be identified from past medical care
        encounters, as identified from Medicaid inpatient (augmented with the Tennessee Hospital
        Discharge dataset), outpatient, and nursing home files. Adjusted estimates of the relative
        risk will be calculated from multivariate regression analyses.

        Study selection criteria are not based on gender, ethnicity or race. Nevertheless, we
        estimated that 61% of subjects would be females, 73% would be white, and 99% would be
        non-hispanic/latino.

          -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to assure the availability of data necessary
             for the study and to identify a cohort of patients who, absent adverse medication
             effects, are at low risk for sudden death. Thus, inclusion criteria require enrollment
             in TennCare, including access to medications. To assure complete identification of all
             healthcare encounters and medication use, the study will be restricted to TennCare
             enrollees with active enrollment and full pharmacy benefits. We require age 30 years
             or older at the beginning of the study. This is the population for which
             arrhythmia-related deaths are of greatest concern. Finally, cohort members must have
             use of study or control medications, as defined by filling at least one prescription
             recorded in the Medicaid pharmacy files.

          -  Patients with life-threatening illnesses will be excluded because for such persons it
             is not possible to distinguish from deaths related to arrhythmias versus those that
             are a consequence of the underlying serious illness.
