  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for the long-term follow-up of patients who completed at least two years of
      follow-up after treatment with Tositumomab and/or Iodine I 131 Tositumomab (BEXXAR)on Study
      RIT-I-000, RIT-II-001, RIT-II-002, RIT-II-004 or CP-97-012. All patients will be assessed for
      survival and disease status, including subsequent therapy for NHL, and for long term safety.
      Laboratory evaluations consisting of a TSH level (for all patients) and a complete blood cell
      (CBC) count with a differential and platelet count (for patients in continuing response only)
      will be obtained annually through Year 10 post treatment with Tositumomab and/or Iodine I 131
      Tositumomab.

      Patients that remain in response to their previous treatment with BEXXAR, will additionally
      be followed radiographically for response and progression.

    <measure>None - Administrative non interventional study to obtain long term safety and efficacy data.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects enrolled in Study BEX104526 were followed for continued response (as applicable) and safety every 6 months for Years 3 through 5 post-treatment with TST/I‑131 TST. Beginning at Year 6, subjects were assessed annually through Year 10 inclusive.</time_frame>
    <description>Study BEX104526 (formerly Corixa Study CCBX001-051) was designed to obtain long-term safety and efficacy data from the surviving subjects who completed at least 2 years of follow-up following administration of TST/I‑131 TST while on Study BEX104728 (RIT-I-000), BEX104731 (RIT-II-001), BEX104504 (RIT-II-004), BEX104515 (RIT-II-002), or BEX104507 (CP-97-012). Analyses will be performed according to one of the five primary interventional protocols.</description>
