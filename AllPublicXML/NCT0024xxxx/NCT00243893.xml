      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the use of minocycline and doxycycline as
      medical therapy for inoperable or partially treated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and
      giant aneurysms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a treatable cause of stroke in young adults. The
      processes by which AVMs and giant aneurysms grow in size and spontaneously bleed are unknown.
      The primary reason to treat AVMs and aneurysms is to guard against intracranial bleeding.

      This pilot study will examine the use of two common antibiotics—minocycline and
      doxycycline—as medical therapy for inoperable or partially treated AVMs and giant aneurysms.
      These drugs, which are tetracycline derivatives, can reduce the levels of a family of
      enzymes, called matrix metalloproteases, that degrade tissue and thereby cause a reduction in
      the risk of spontaneous bleeding from AVMs or aneurysm—which is the main cause of stroke
      associated with these disorders. The enzymes can contribute to weaknesses in the wall of
      blood vessels and may increase the risk of the vessel wall rupturing and causing spontaneous
      bleeding.

      This trial also will show that taking minocycline and doxycycline over an extended period in
      this patient population is safe and well tolerated. Results from this study could help plan
      future studies to benefit patients with abnormal blood vessels prone to bleeding in their
      brains.

    <description>This trial is to investigate the use of minocycline or doxycycline as medical therapy, can minocycline or doxycycline induce biologically significant changes in the enzyme system thought to be related to spontaneous growth/rupture of these malformations. Finally, can patients safely tolerate these medications over an extended period of time.</description>
