      RATIONALE: Stop-smoking information on the smokefree.gov website may help people quit smoking

      electronic bulletin board in helping United States federal employees quit smoking.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the perception of utility of the current, publicly accessible version of the
           smokefree.gov website and the addition of an electronic bulletin board and its features,
           including open-ended comments, in promoting smoking cessation among United States
           federal employees who are currently smokers.

        -  Determine the use of this tool, in terms of average length of time spent on the website,
           number of page clicks, most popular page clicks, and key interest areas, among these
           participants.

        -  Determine the changes in smoking habits, in terms of smoking reduction and short- and
           long-term abstinence, among these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Participants are encouraged to use the smokefree.gov website as frequently as needed for
      support and resources while trying to quit smoking and become, and remain, nonsmokers.
      Participants are invited to provide feedback on the usefulness of self-help guidelines and
      several other tools. Participants complete questionnaires evaluating the website at study
      entry and at 1, 3, and 6 months after study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4,200 participants will be accrued for this study.
