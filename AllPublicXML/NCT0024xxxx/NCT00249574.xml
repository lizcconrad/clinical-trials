      This is a prospective pilot safety study based on the hypothesis that active,
      street-recruited heroin users can be successfully treated for hepatitis C after stabilization
      on buprenorphine. Eligible subjects will be actively using heroin and have hepatitis C
      viremia; screening will occur at street-based sites like syringe exchange programs. Those who
      are eligible will sign informed consent, and then be asked to attend 3 weekly educational
      sessions about hepatitis C and addiction as well as undergo an intake interview. After this,
      subjects will be inducted onto buprenorphine/naloxone combination therapy (Suboxone) and
      receive this medication for 12-24 weeks. Once reaching the 12-24 week study time point,
      subjects will have the option of a 12-week Suboxone taper, or instead of undergoing 6-12
      months of hepatitis C treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin while being
      maintained on Suboxone. Once completing hepatitis C treatment, subjects will undergo a
      24-week Suboxone taper, or be transitioned to outpatient Suboxone therapy by a medical
      provider.
