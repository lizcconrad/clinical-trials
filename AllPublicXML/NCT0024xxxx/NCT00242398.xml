      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and operative efficacy of intermittent
      hemodialysis without anticoagulation with saline flushes or Nephral 400ST in patients at high
      risk of bleeding

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis in patients who are at high risk of bleeding complications represents a
      challenge of balancing the needs for establishment of an adequately functioning
      extracorporeal circuit for dialytic therapy with the requirement of not exacerbating existing
      bleeding or precipitating bleeding in predisposed subjects.

      Several methods of nonheparin dialysis have been used. The method most commonly used to
      effect such treatment is &quot;saline flushing&quot;: saline boluses are delivred at frequent
      intervals. This method is far from optimal for several reasons, including failure to maintain
      a patent circuit in significant proportion of patients, an added logistic burden on dialysis
      nurses. An alternative method of avoiding systemic heparinization is priming the dialysis
      membrane with heparin before hemodialysis. The method is based on fact that AN69ST (Nephral
      400ST , Hospal, France) dialysis membrane have a high affinity for binding heparin, and that
      the bound heparin exerts a localized antithrombotic effect without systemic spillover.

      Comparison: heparin free hemodialysis with saline flushes compared heparin free hemodialysis
      with Nephral 400ST.
