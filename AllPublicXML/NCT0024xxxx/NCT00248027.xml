      Main Research questions:

        1. Who are the patients referred for treatment at the Psychotic Disorders Clinic?

        2. What are the outcomes from treatment for first episode psychosis in multiple outcome
           domains?

        3. What hospital resources are used over the early course of the illness?

        4. How satisfied are patients and family with the treatment and services they received?
           This is an important study that will help us evaluate the service and treatment offered
           by the Psychotic Disorders Clinic's specialized early intervention program,which helps
           young people experiencing early stages of psychotic illness.A growing body of evidence
           suggests that intervening earlier in the course of the illness with specialized and
           complimentary pharmacological and psychosocial treatment may be associated with improved
           outcomes.

      The project is primarily a descriptive study of individuals experiencing their first episode
      of psychosis presenting at the Psychotic Disorders Clinic/Early Intervention Program.

      The objectives of the study are:

        1. Track multi-dimensional outcomes within the program

        2. Track service use

        3. Compare outcomes for this early intervention program with outcomes noted in published
           follow up studies

        4. Evaluate effectiveness of the Psychotic Disorders Clinic in improving outcomes for
           persons experiencing their first episode of psychosis
