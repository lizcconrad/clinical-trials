      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prize-based contingency management
      (CM) when administered exclusively in groups. Substance dependent patients (N=360) at
      community-based treatment programs are randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a)
      standard, non-CM treatment or (b) standard treatment plus prize CM delivered in groups. In
      the CM condition, patients earn the opportunity to win prizes for attending groups and
      submitting drug-free biological specimens. Substance use and psychosocial problems are
      measured at intake, month 1, month 3 (post treatment), and at 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up
      evaluations. We also assess patient characteristics that may be associated with improved
      outcomes within and across conditions.
