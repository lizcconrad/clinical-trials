    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of an approved medication being studied in support of a new approach
      in the prevention of exercise-induced asthma (a worsening of asthma caused by exercise, also
      known as exercise-induced bronchospasm), in patients who have a history of worsening asthma
      after exercise.
