  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Males and females aged 18-80 years who present with ACS (unstable angina and non ST-elevation
      MI) defined as one or more episodes of angina lasting at least 5 minutes in the last 24 hours
      before admission and greater than 0.05 mV of presumed new ST-segment depression in at least 2
      contiguous ECG leads OR, angina and per confirmatory angiogram, has been scheduled for
      percutaneous coronary angioplasty. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
      safety of Serp-1 injection when administered in 3 daily doses to patients undergoing
      conventional therapy for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) requiring early intervention.

      A total of 72 subjects will be enrolled, separated into 3 dose groups and centrally
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio of Serp-1 injection to placebo control.Subjects will receive Serp-1
      by intravenous (IV) bolus injection daily for 3 days, at dose levels of 5.0, 15, and 50
      ug/kg/dose or placebo (0.9% normal saline) added to any prescribed therapy for ACS. Serp-1
      will be administered as a single IV bolus injection. The initial IV bolus dose is
      administered immediately preceding the PCI procedure with subsequent doses administered 24
      and 48 hours later.Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events, serum inflammatory markers
      and restenosis rates at 6 months post-dose.
