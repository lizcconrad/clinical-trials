  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine a proposed research treatment which evaluates the addition of
      oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy agent, to gemcitabine, another chemotherapy agent, and radiation
      therapy for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. The researchers have already
      done studies using gemcitabine and radiation therapy together. They want to build on the
      information they have from this previous research. The researchers believe that the
      combination chemotherapy with radiation is worth investigating to treat pancreatic cancer.
      They will use this study to determine what type of side effects occur with this treatment and
      to assess how effective the treatment is at controlling the cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have cytologic or histologic confirmation of carcinoma arising in the
             pancreas.

          -  Patients may have any stage of pancreatic cancer but if metastatic, systemic disease
             burden should be asymptomatic and small in volume.

          -  Determination of resectability must be made prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and a Zubrod
             performance status of &lt; = 2.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function defined as follows: absolute neutrophil
             count of &gt; = 1500/mm3, platelets &gt; = 100,000/mm3, serum Cr &lt; = 1.5 mg/dl, bilirubin &lt;
             3.0 mg/dl, with relief of biliary obstruction if present (PTC tube or endobiliary
             stent).

          -  Patients must be free of other active systemic malignancy, ongoing infection,
             including HIV infection, or any other serious uncontrolled, concomitant systemic
             disorders or psychiatric condition that would interfere with the safe delivery of
             protocol therapy.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
             method during participation in this trial and for 6 months after trial.

          -  Patient must be aware of the investigational nature of the therapy and provide written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neuroendocrine tumors are excluded.

          -  Patients must have no history of previous chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer or any
             abdominal radiation therapy.

          -  Patient must not have used any investigational agent in the month before enrollment
             into the study.
