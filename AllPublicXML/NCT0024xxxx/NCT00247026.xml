  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the clinical effects of coenzyme Q10 and Curcumin in improving the cytopenias of
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. we propose to explore the efficacy of the natural
      compounds curcumin and CoQ10 in MDS because these two agents possess many of the effects that
      are desirable in MDS.
