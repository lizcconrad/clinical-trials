  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nondystrophic myotonias (NDM) are muscle disorders caused by genetic abnormalities in certain
      muscle cell membrane proteins. Individuals with NDM experience limited muscle relaxation,
      which causes pain, weakness, and impaired physical activity. The purpose of this study is to
      better characterize the clinical features and symptoms of NDM.

    <textblock>
      Nondystrophic myotonias are muscle disorders caused by abnormal muscle cell membrane proteins
      that affect the control of muscle fiber contraction. These disorders are extremely rare, and
      little is known about how to best treat the various subtypes of NDM. The purpose of this
      study is to characterize the clinical features and symptoms of NDM as well as to pair this
      data with specific NDM subtypes. In turn, this may lead to the development of improved
      treatments. The study will also establish clinical endpoints for use in future studies.

      This multi-center observational study will involve both a cross-sectional data analysis and a
      prospective longitudinal analysis. Participants will initially attend a one-day outpatient
      study visit. Various baseline measurements will be collected, including demographics, medical
      history, and quality of life measures. Blood samples will be taken to evaluate laboratory
      values and genetic factors. Participants will undergo manual muscle testing (MMT), clinical
      myotonia assessments, and functional movement assessments. Routine nerve conduction studies
      and electromyography (EMG) will also be performed in order to test for the presence of
      myotonia in specific muscles. Annual follow-up evaluations will occur 1 and 2 years following
      the first study visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of myotonia

          -  Presence of myotonic potentials on electromyography (EMG)

          -  Persistence of symptoms and signs after discontinuation of medications that produce
             myotonia; such medications include fibric acid derivatives, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA
             reductase inhibitors, chloroquine, and colchicine

          -  Absence of features suggestive of myotonic dystrophy, including ptosis, temporal
             wasting, mandibular weakness, cataracts occurring before age 50, and evidence of
             multisystem defects (cardiac conduction defects, hypogonadism)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other neurologic condition that might affect the assessment of the study
