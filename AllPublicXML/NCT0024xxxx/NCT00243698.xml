  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is a well-established imaging modality for the evaluation of breast disease.

      The investigators' objective is to characterise the properties of an intravascular
      ultrasonographic contrast agent SonoVue (sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) to improve the
      diagnostic value of the ultrasound examination in patients with different breast lesions.

      The final purpose of this ultrasonography is to allow the early detection of tumors and to
      improve the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions.

      SonoVue® (sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles) is a microbubbles preparation that is stable,
      resistant to pressure, and specifically designed to be used as a contrast agent for
      ultrasound imaging.

      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound could provide a non-invasive technique to evaluate the
      morphology of breast tumour vascularity.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of SonoVue® to detect breast
      lesions and define specific microcirculation patterns in patients with four different type of
      breast lesions (enlarging fibroadenoma, suspect malignant nodules, microcalcification and
      large malignant nodules) in comparison with pathological specimens in terms of histology
      diagnosis and microvessel density evaluation.
