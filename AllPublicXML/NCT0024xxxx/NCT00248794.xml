  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the viability of two cognitive rehabilitation strategies to
      improve functional outcomes for people with schizophrenia. Many people with schizophrenia
      experience impairments in cognitive function which limit their abilities. These impairments
      have been shown to precede the onset of illness and represent a vulnerability factor which is
      exacerbated by emerging psychotic symptoms. These impairments affect a range of functional
      domains including symptom severity, work function, symptom management, treatment, and overall
      quality of life. Recognizing the link between cognitive impairment and function, a few
      clinicals and researchers have attempted to remediate cognitive impairments by providing
      cognitive retraining programs similar to those used in traumatic brain injured patients or
      adaptive skills training. Cognitive retraining involves repetitive exercises to increase
      elemental cognitive functions including memory, attention, psychomotor speed, planning, and
      cognitive flexibility. Adaptive skill training involves didactic group exercises in social
      skills, activities of daily living, and symptom management. Each approach has demonstrated
      some rehabilitation benefits. This study will investigate the effectiveness of a combination
      of these two approaches on outcomes in schizophrenia.

      Objective: Many people with schizophrenia experience impairments in cognitive function which
      limit their abilities. These impairments affect a range of functional domains including
      symptom severity, work function, symptom management, treatment, and overall quality of life.
      Recognizing the link between cognitive impairment and function, a few clinicians and
      researchers have attempted to remediate cognitive impairments by providing cognitive
      retraining programs similar to those used in traumatic brain injured patients or adaptive
      skills training. Cognitive retraining involves repetitive exercises to increase elemental
      cognitive functions including memory, attention, psychomotor speed, planning, and cognitive
      flexibility. Adaptive skill training involves didactic group exercises in social skills,
      activities of daily living, and symptom management. This study investigates the effectiveness
      of a combination of these two approaches on outcomes in schizophrenia. This will be a three
      group randomized clinical trial investigating the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on
      outcomes ranging from proximal (training tasks performance and neuropsychological test
      performance), to more distal outcomes (treatment group performance and quality of life
      ratings). We believe that the cognitive augmentation will have significant impact on training
      task and neuro-psychological test performance and attenuated, but significant effect on
      performance in the treatment groups. Finally, we hypothesize that the combination of adaptive
      training and cognitive rehabilitation will have measurable impact on the most distal outcomes
      such as daily living skills and quality of life. Method: One hundred (100) individuals will
      be invited to participate in a 30-week program. After informed consent is obtained and
      diagnosis established, participants will receive an extensive assessment of
      neuropsychological, psychological and psychosocial functioning. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of three conditions using a stratified procedure based on cognitive test
      performance (this will ensure that there are similar numbers of severely and less severely
      impaired participants in each condition). The three conditions will be: (1) a usual care
      control group which is the Life Skills Development Group (LSDG), (2) Individualized computer
      based cognitive rehabilitation (ICBCR) augmenting the LSDG; and (3) Cognitive Remediation
      Therapy (CRT) with LSDG. Participants will be compared on: (1) LSDG performance, (2)
      neuropsychological test performance and (3) psychosocial functioning. Attendance in groups
      and remediation sessions will be compensated at a rate of $5 per session. The key questions t
      be answered are which Cognitive Rehabilitation strategy is more effective at improving
      cognitive function? Does Cognitive Rehabilitation produce better performance in the Life
      Skills Development Group (LSDG)? Does Life Skills Development Group augmented by Cognitive
      Rehabilitation produce better psychosocial outcomes than the standard care control group?

    <measure>Wisconsin Card Sort Percent Perseverative Errors (Standard Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks after intake</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of cognitive flexibility and the ability to shift set in the face of a changing reinforcement. The measure reflects &quot;density&quot; of perseverative errors in relation to the overall test performance. It is computed by calculating the ration of perseverative errors to trials administered and multiplied by 100. Then the percentage score is translate using the available Standard Score Tables provided in the manual and converted to a standard score with a mean of 100, a maximum of 145 and a minimum of 55, with higher Standard Scores indicating better performance.</description>

    <description>The intervention is call Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) with a skill development group. Participants receive 15 weeks of cognitive training (with intake, 15 and 30 week assessment). This intervention is reliant upon didactic exchanges between trainer and participant, minimizing error, and behavioral modeling with the goal of developing better meta-cognitive skills. Procedures include paper and pencil activities (memory, planning and cognitive flexibility training) which are organized by difficulty. Sessions are organized to have a discussion between the trainer and the participant about the task and strategies, trainer modeling with articulation of strategy a participant attempts the task, talking aloud the steps, and finally the participant practices the task covertly. The trainer has the role of &quot;error catcher and model.&quot; All subjects randomized to this condition also are receiving the weekly skills group (SDG)offered to participants in all experimental conditions.</description>

    <description>This intervention is Individualized Computer Based Cognitive Remediation (ICBCR) and skills development group (SDG). Participants receive 15 weeks of computerized training (with intake, 15 and 30 week assessments). This intervention relies upon intense, frequent, repetition of tasks being made incrementally more challenging. Computer tasks are organized so that the initial trials are easily completed and more challenging levels are then attempted. Parameters such as duration of task, task speed, and intra-task variables all be are manipulated. A trainer will be present at each session to help set up the computer tasks and answer questions. Besides the first two sessions that will be orientation sessions, the trainer has little involvement during the training sessions. The role of the trainer is to help organize, support, and provide feedback to each participant. All subjects randomized to this condition also are receiving the weekly skills group (SDG).</description>

    <description>The control intervention is call the skills development group (SDG) and is augmented with up to five individual contacts with research staff. The Skills Group (SDG) control is standard care group which will receive 15 weeks of the skills development group (SDG) similar to that offered as a clinical service at the VA Medical Center. During the 15 weeks participants will attend 1.5 hours of skills group per week. The 15 sessions will include skills training related to: a) cooking and food preparation, b) negotiating the local transportation system, c) shopping, and d) planning leisure activities. The training activities are a blend of didactic learning, modeling and finally in vivo practice. Participants in this group will also be offered up to five weekly contacts with staff to balance out factors related to meeting with staff in the other conditions.</description>

        <title>Wisconsin Card Sort Percent Perseverative Errors (Standard Score)</title>
        <description>This is a measure of cognitive flexibility and the ability to shift set in the face of a changing reinforcement. The measure reflects &quot;density&quot; of perseverative errors in relation to the overall test performance. It is computed by calculating the ration of perseverative errors to trials administered and multiplied by 100. Then the percentage score is translate using the available Standard Score Tables provided in the manual and converted to a standard score with a mean of 100, a maximum of 145 and a minimum of 55, with higher Standard Scores indicating better performance.</description>
