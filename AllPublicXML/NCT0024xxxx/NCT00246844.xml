      This study will examine whether insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (beta cells) can
      recover in patients with type 1 diabetes who have had a pancreas transplant. In type 1
      diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the beta cells. Patients are treated with insulin
      shots or a pancreas transplant to control their blood sugar. Some experiments suggest that
      the pancreas may have the capacity to recover some of its insulin-producing capacity, but
      that ability is negated by factors such as the continuing immune attack and erratic blood
      sugar levels in patients.

      Patients who have had a pancreas transplant may be in a unique situation to allow their own
      pancreas to regrow beta cells for two reasons: 1) the medicines they take to prevent
      rejection of the transplanted pancreas weaken their immune system; and 2) they have
      near-normal blood sugar levels because of their functioning transplanted pancreas. This study
      will test this hypothesis by sampling blood from patients' hepatic vein, which drains the
      liver and native pancreas and from their iliac vein, which drains the transplanted pancreas.
      This will determine whether insulin is coming from the transplanted pancreas (iliac vein) or
      the liver and native pancreas (hepatic vein).

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had stable pancreatic transplant function for
      more than 5 years may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical
      history and physical examination.

      Participants are admitted to the hospital for 2 days for a full medical examination, blood
      tests and procedures to determine insulin production. The procedures will include the
      placement of catheters in the neck and groin for blood sampling. Participants will be closely
      monitored after the procedures and discharged home if there are no complications.

      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is thought to result from an autoimmune destruction of
      insulin producing beta-cells found within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. In addition to
      the autoimmune process however, many studies have shown that hyperglycemia is also toxic to
      islets. Interventional studies have shown, for instance, that either tight glycemia control
      or immunosuppression can preserve C-peptide production. We hypothesize that patients who are
      immunosuppressed and euglycemic will display evidence that their native pancreas has
      recovered beta-cell function. We have asked whether pancreas transplant recipients, due to
      the immunosuppression required to prevent allograft loss, and the improved glycemia control
      resulting from the transplanted pancreas, might display some recovery of their native
      pancreatic islet function. Our preliminary data suggest that patients without C-peptide
      production prior to receiving an islet transplant appear to recover some endogenous
      pancreatic insulin secretion after islet transplantation. We will study whole pancreas
      transplant recipients, specifically those with grafts functioning for at least 5 years. We
      will test for native pancreas insulin production by infusing arginine into a peripheral vein,
      then selectively/simultaneously sampling blood for C-peptide levels from the hepatic veins
      and the vein draining the pancreatic allograft . Unlike our previous study of islet
      transplant recipients, a study that required portal vein cannulation, this study will require
      only hepatic and iliac vein cannulations, both much easier to accomplish, and associated with
      much less risk to the patient. Samples obtained from these sites will be tested for C-peptide
      levels. In addition, if we find evidence of native pancreas insulin production, we will look
      at a variety of clinical variables to see if any correlate with recovery of function.
