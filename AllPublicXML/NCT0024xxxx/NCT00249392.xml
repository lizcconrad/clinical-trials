  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental and genetic factors may play a role in the progression of ocular diseases
      (cataract, retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment,
      ocular tumor, etc.). The goal of this project is to establish a series of case-control
      studies to evaluate risk factors of ocular diseases in China.

      This study is designed to investigate the epidemiologic, genetic, laboratory and clinical
      characterization of individuals with ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related
      macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.). We will accrue
      approximately 800 patients as experimental group. The control group consists of age/sex
      frequency-matched subjects who will be confirmed without ocular diseases. We will explore the
      environmental (including family history, life style, diet, physical activity,
      neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma levels of oxidative stress and angiogenic factors,
      etc.) and genetic (including oxidative stress and angiogenic factors, etc.) risk factors. We
      will study the association between various environmental risk factors with the clinical
      characterization and correlation between the genetic polymorphisms and the presence of
      various ocular diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This is a study only of Chinese.

          -  Subjects will be allowed to participate if they self-identify as Chinese.

          -  Individuals with ocular diseases (cataract, retinopathy, age-related macular
             degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular tumor, etc.) will be allowed to
