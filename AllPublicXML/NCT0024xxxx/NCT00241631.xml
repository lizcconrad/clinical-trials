  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of COPD − a common and debilitating chronic inflammatory disease that is
      characterised by the progressive development of airflow limitation (shortness of breath −
      SOB) and is poorly reversible with currently available drugs −is increasing. Cigarette
      smoking is strongly linked with the ongoing inflammation; inflammation that can continue even
      when the patient has stopped smoking. The severity of airflow limitation (SOB) is correlated
      with the degree of pulmonary (lung) inflammation.

      Histone deacetylases (HDACs)are important molecules in suppressing this pulmonary
      inflammation. We have recently shown that patients with COPD have a reduction in total HDAC
      which correlates with the severity of their lung disease.

      Corticosteroids (anti−inflammatory treatment) act, at least in part, by recruitment of these
      HDACs to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription (which reduces the production of
      inflammatory molecules) and are widely used in COPD in patients with severe disease.
      Unfortunately, in COPD, inhaled corticosteroids seem to have little effect on the underlying
      inflammation (though in a selective group of patients with COPD they do reduce the number of
      infections a patient may have by a small amount). Theophylline has been used in the treatment
      of asthma and COPD for over 70 years, but its use has recently declined. Data so far obtained
      in primary cells (cells from patients used in the laboratory) from COPD patients suggests
      that low dose theophylline (~5mg/l) should be effective in restoring steroid sensitivity in
      patients with COPD (and hence reduce inflammation thus improving SOB). We wish therefore to
      continue these studies on theophylline principally by conducting a small clinical pilot study
      on 20−30 COPD patients in a randomised, double−blind, placebo−controlled, parallel−group
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:Participants with COPD with an FEV1 of 80−30% predicted. This will
        incorporate the majority of participants with COPD seen within the chest clinic. Patients
        with an FEV1 &gt; 80% predicted are not generally severe enough to warrant hospital follow up.
        These patients are also unlikely to have severe enough disease (and therefore airway
        inflammation) which may be modified by the therapeutic agents we are studying.

        Patients with an FEV1 &lt; 30% tend to have more severe symptom limitation and generally
        (though not always) find participation in a clinical trial involving 4 visits to the clinic
        difficult. Their airway disease is also generally less responsive to therapeutic
        intervention and as a consequence finding measurements which show changes to these
        therapeutic interventions is more difficult.

        COPD patients

          -  All participants will be classified to Stage 2−3 of the GOLD (Global initiative for
             Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines

          -  Male or female, aged 45-80 years (according to GOLD guidelines)

          -  30% &lt; FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted

          -  FEV1/FVC &lt; 70%

          -  Cigarette exposure of &gt;10 pack−years#

          -  With or without chronic symptoms (cough, sputum production, dyspnea).

          -  Steroid therapy will be stopped before run−in, but long acting bronchodilators are
             acceptable.

          -  The participants are able to give informed consent # The smoking history should
             include both the number smoked, for how long, and an estimate of total pack−years of
             smoking. One pack of 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year = one pack year. Total
             pack years = No. cigarettes smoked per day/20 x no. years of smoking

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any history or evidence of asthma

          -  Pregnancy, breast−feeding or planned pregnancy during the study. Fertile women not
             using acceptable contraceptive measures, as judged by the investigator

          -  Hospital admission with respiratory infection within the last 6 months

          -  Upper respiratory infection within the last 4 weeks

          -  Participants who have received research medication within the previous one month

          -  Participants unable to give informed consent

          -  Any mental condition rendering the participant unable to understand the nature, scope
             and possible consequences of the study

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to study therapy or excipients

          -  Participants with significant or unstable ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia,
             cardiomyopathy, heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension as defined by the
             investigator, or any other relevant cardiovascular disorder as judged by the
             investigator

          -  Any current respiratory tract disorders other than COPD, which is considered by the
             investigator to be clinically significant

          -  Any significant disease or disorder (e.g. gastrointestinal, liver, renal,
             neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, major
             physical impairment) or abnormality laboratory tests which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of inclusion in the
             study, or may influence the results of the study, or the participants ability to take
             part in the study
