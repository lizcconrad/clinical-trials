      Multicentric, open-label, randomized, pilot comparative study in parallel groups comparing 1
      group of subjects receiving 0.057 milligram/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) or 0.40 mg/kg/week of
      Saizen® during 1 year to 1 group receiving 0.035 mg/kg/day (0.24 mg/kg/week) of Saizen®
      during 1 year after an initial 3-year treatment of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH)
      therapy with 0.057 mg/kg/day in both groups.

    <description>Height Velocity (HV) is the change in height since the previous year´s measurement and more precisely: HV = {(h-hp)/(d-dp)} * 365.25 [centimeter (cm)/year] where h is current height in cm, hp is previous height in cm, closest to 1 year previous, d is the current date and dp is the date of measurement of previous height, closest to 1 year previous. Additionally, d and dp have to be within 0.6 years and 1.5 years. HV is the mean height velocity over the interval between d and dp but is displayed as HV at d.</description>
