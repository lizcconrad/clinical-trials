  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine: 1) the short-term clinical efficacy and safety of
      bupropion for helping adolescent tobacco smokers quit, and 2) The role of withdrawal symptoms
      in the maintenance of smoking in adolescents.

      This 10-week study consists of an unassisted (pretrial) acute tobacco withdrawal (AW) phase
      and a 7-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of bupropion (300 mg/day) for
      tobacco dependence. Neuropsychological examinations will be conducted at baseline, during
      acute withdrawal, and during treatment (incl. early withdrawal) with bupropion. We expect
      smoking cessation in approximately 25% of the active medication group and significant overall
      smoking reduction. We postulate that bupropion will also reduce the irritability, depressed
      mood and anxiety symptoms that typically occur during tobacco withdrawal. We expect to
      observe optimal cognitive performance, (i.e., attention, memory), and affective state during
      satiety, impairment during pre-treatment abstinence, and intermediate level cognitive
      performance in the abstinent active-treatment group. Because limited data are available on
      cognitive tasks in adolescent smokers, a non-smoking group will be included in order to
      establish the validity and appropriateness of our paradigm with a normative sample.
