      This project is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of Veterans Affairs
      Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The genetic tissue bank has four components: a central
      repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory Committee of
      individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with special
      importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, psychological and
      other disorders); an Ethics Oversight Committee of individuals with expertise in bioethics
      and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic tissue, and a Coordinating
      Center that administers the tissue bank, coordinates the scientific and ethics oversight
      committees, maintains central access to clinical study data linked to the tissue bank, and
      provides statistical analysis.

      Intervention: No intervention.

      Primary Hypothesis: It is feasible and cost-effective to create a CSP-wide facility for
      banking genetic tissue in CSP studies.

      Study Abstract: This is a program-wide genetic tissue databank for the Department of Veterans
      Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP). The study has five components: a central
      repository for DNA and other genetic tissue specimens; a Scientific Advisory Committee of
      individuals with expertise in the genetics and epidemiology of diseases with special
      importance to the VA (including cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, psychological and
      other disorders); an Ethical Oversight Committee of individuals with expertise in bioethics
      and the law, as they apply to the collection and use of genetic tissue, A Veteran's Advisory
      Group, and a Coordinating Center administers the tissue bank, coordinates the three oversight
      committees, maintains central access to clinical study data linked to the tissue bank, and
      provides statistical analysis.
