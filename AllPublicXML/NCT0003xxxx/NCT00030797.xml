      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in
      treating patients who have advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of different schedules of irinotecan in combination with
           capecitabine as first-line therapy, in terms of objective response rate, in patients
           with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival of
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety profile, in terms of toxicity, of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1); disease symptoms, including pain, weight loss, loss of appetite,
      malaise, and fever of unknown origin (yes vs no); weight loss during the past 6 months (more
      than 5% vs 5% or less); and disease-free interval (more than 6 months vs 6 months or less).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and 22-35.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22 and oral
           capecitabine as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and at the first visit
      after treatment failure.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
