      The reason for doing this study is to determine whether a new method of blood stem cell
      transplant (also known as bone marrow transplant) is able to treat acute lymphocytic
      leukemia. Blood stem cells are the &quot;seed cells&quot; necessary to make all blood cells. This new
      method of transplant uses a combination of low dose radiation and chemotherapy that may be
      less toxic and cause less harm than a conventional transplant. This lower dose transplant is
      called a &quot;nonmyeloablative transplant&quot;. Researchers want to see if using less radiation and
      less chemotherapy combined with new immune suppressing drugs after the transplant will help a
      stem cell transplant to work. Researchers hope that this treatment will cure acute
      lymphocytic leukemia with fewer side effects. Researchers are hoping to see a mixture of
      recipient and donor blood cells after transplant. This mixture of donor and recipient blood
      cells is called &quot;mixed chimerism&quot;. Researchers hope that donor cells will attack and
      eliminate the leukemia. This is called the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; effect. In addition, after
      the transplant, white blood cells from the donor may be given to enhance or &quot;boost&quot; the
      graft-versus-leukemia effect, and hopefully remove all remaining cancer cells. This study is
      being done because at the present time blood stem cell transplantation (or bone marrow
      transplantation) is the only known curative therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Because
      of age or underlying health status acute lymphocytic leukemia patients have a higher
      likelihood of experiencing severe harm from a conventional blood stem cell transplant.
      Researchers are doing this study to see if this new nonmyeloablative method of low dose
      radiation and low dose chemotherapy given before transplant and immune suppressive drugs
      after transplant will help make the transplant safer and also cure acute lymphocytic leukemia

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a one-year disease-free survival (DFS) of &gt; 25% can be achieved among
      adult patients with high risk acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in complete remission (CR) who
      undergo nonmyeloablative allografting.

      II. To determine if a one-year DFS of &gt;= 40% can be achieved among pediatric patients with
      high risk ALL in CR who undergo nonmyeloablative allografting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a day +200 transplant-related mortality (TRM) of &lt; 25% can be achieved
      among patients with high risk ALL in CR who undergo nonmyeloablative allografting.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in the treatment
      of minimal residue disease (MRD) after nonmyeloablative allografting for patients with high
      risk ALL in CR.

      OUTLINE:

      NONMYELOALATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously
      (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo total body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      (PBSCT) on day 0. Patients with minimal residual disease may receive donor lymphocyte
      infusion IV.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) every 12 hours on days -3 to 100
      with taper to day 177 and mycophenolate mofetil PO very 8 hours on days 0 to 40 with taper to
      day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 28, 56, 84, 120, 180,
      and 360; at 18 months; and annually for up to 5 years.

             following:

               -  Cytogenetic abnormalities including:

               -  Persistent peripheral blasts after one week of induction chemotherapy

          -  DONOR: FHCRC matching Grade 2.1: Unrelated donors who are prospectively:

               -  Matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles (must be defined
                  by high resolution typing) and

               -  Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by
                  high resolution typing

          -  DONOR: A positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion;
             donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
             jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the
             standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for
             patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients
             before hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then
             flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor
             should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those
             patients with an HLA class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell
             cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless of the PRA results

          -  DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele are considered a
             two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this
             type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  DONOR: Donor must consent to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with
             filgrastim (G-CSF) arranged through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) or other
             donor centers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) disease

          -  Presence of circulating leukemic blasts (in the peripheral blood) detected by standard
             pathology

          -  Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12
             months following treatment

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity

          -  ORGAN DYSFUNCTION, ADULT CRITERIA:

          -  Requiring supplementary continuous oxygen OR diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
             monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 40%

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 35%

          -  Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for
             the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, and the
             degree of portal hypertension; patients will be excluded if they are found to have
             fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension,
             alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices,
             hepatic encephalopathy, uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evinced by
             prolongation of the prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bridging
             fibrosis, bacterial or fungal liver abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral
             hepatitis with total serum bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL, and symptomatic biliary disease

          -  Karnofsky performance score &lt; 50

          -  ORGAN DYSFUNCTION, PEDIATRIC CRITERIA:

          -  Lansky play-performance score &lt; 40

          -  Patients with active non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers)

          -  Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
             cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time of
             complete remission, and have a &gt; 20% risk of disease recurrence
