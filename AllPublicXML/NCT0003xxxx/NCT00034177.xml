      Phase IIA, multicenter, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of weekly

      The goals of this study are to determine the objective response rate, to determine time to
      disease progression, duration of response, and survival, and to identify the maximum
      tolerated weekly dose and principal toxicities of S-8184 in this patient population.
