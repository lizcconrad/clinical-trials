  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in patients with
      non-myeloid cancers who are receiving chemotherapy. Darbepoetin alfa is a recombinant protein
      that stimulates the production of red blood cells. In this study, darbepoetin alfa will be
      administered as either an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) or directly into a vein
      (intravenously).
