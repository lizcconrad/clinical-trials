    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by stopping blood flow
      to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with irinotecan may kill any tumor cells
      remaining after radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining thalidomide with irinotecan
      in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme that has been treated with radiation
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with
           thalidomide and irinotecan after radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive irinotecan IV
      over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral thalidomide daily. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 week after the first course, prior to all
      subsequent courses, and then after course 6.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
