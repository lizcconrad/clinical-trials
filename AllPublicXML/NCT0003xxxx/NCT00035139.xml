  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired long term disability among
      children and young adults. Deficits in attention and memory are common and persist for years
      after moderate or severe TBI. The similarity between these symptoms and those of children
      with AD/HD, the efficacy of methylphenidate in the treatment of AD/HD, and the efficacy of
      methylphenidate in improving recovery of animals with brain injuries, support the need to
      study methylphenidate effects in children with TBI. This investigation of methylphenidate in
      children with moderate to severe TBI aims to: (1) Assess the acute effects of 2 different
      dosages of methylphenidate on attention and reaction time when the medication is administered
      to children early in recovery; (2) Assess the ability of 8 weeks of methylphenidate to
      improve the rate of recovery of cognitive, memory, and attentional skills in children with
      TBI; (3) Identify the frequency of common methylphenidate side effects in children with TBI.

      During the first phase of the study which is of 8-days duration subjects will receive placebo
      on some days and methylphenidate on others. During this phase of the study the effects of the
      medication on children's performance on a computerized test of attention will be assessed.
      Individuals who do not have significant methylphenidate side effects during the first phase
      of the study will then participate in the second phase of the study. During the second phase
      subjects will receive either methylphenidate or placebo for 8 weeks. Neuropsychological
      measures of attention, memory, behavioral inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and motor
      performance will be obtained at baseline and after the 8 week medication trial in order to
      assess methylphenidate effects on the rate of recovery. Recovery will also be assessed using
      an interview measure of adaptive behavior and cognitive functioning. A stimulant medication
      side effect rating scale will be used to monitor for common methylphenidate adverse effects
      throughout both phases of the study
