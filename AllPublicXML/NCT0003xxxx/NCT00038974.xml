  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that African-Americans respond less well to
      combination pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy than Caucasian-Americans who have
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and who were not previously treated with either interferon or
      ribavirin. Reasons for differences in response, regardless of race, will be studied.
