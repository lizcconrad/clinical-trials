      This is a non-randomized study in patients who have received prior 5-FU therapy for
      colorectal cancer. The objective of this trial is to establish a maximum tolerated dose of
      ALIMTA and irinotecan given in combination as well as to assess the safety and efficacy of
      this combination for patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. ALIMTA
      and irinotecan will be given every 21 days.
