      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ixabepilone in treating patients who
      have relapsed and/or refractory stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of ixabepilone, in terms of clinical response and
           progression-free survival, in patients with relapsed and/or refractory stage III or IV
           ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate pre-ixabepilone survivin mRNA and protein levels in patient-derived ovarian
           cancer cells with quality of response (i.e., at least partial response vs no response).

        -  Correlate CYP3A4 (3A4*1B), 3A5 (3A5*1), and 3A7 (ER6 p variation) allelic polymorphisms
           with parent drug kinetic parameters, toxicity, and efficacy of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour once weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every
      4 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
