        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria during screening:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Both males and females are eligible. All patients should be advised that there are no
             data on the possible reproductive (teratological) effects of ISIS 14803.

        Therefore:

          -  a) Females may participate if they are surgically sterile or post-menopausal.
             Pre-menopausal women may participate if they are abstinent or are compliant with a
             contraceptive regimen. Abstinence or contraceptive regimen must be maintained during
             the treatment period and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. A negative
             serum pregnancy test (i.e., human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) within 2 weeks prior to
             dosing with ISIS 14803 is required for pre-menopausal women. Subjects must not be
             breast feeding.

          -  b) Male patients must be surgically sterile, abstinent, or utilizing a barrier
             contraceptive method. Abstinence or contraceptive regimen must be maintained during
             the treatment period and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

          -  Anti-HCV antibody positive.

          -  Plasma HCV RNA greater than 10,000 copies/mL.

          -  Prior liver biopsy indicating chronic hepatitis.

          -  WBC count less than or equal to upper limit of normal.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count in normal range for the laboratory.

          -  Platelet count greater than 130,000 cells/mmÂ³.

          -  Hemoglobin concentration greater than or equal to 11 g/dL.

          -  PT in the normal range for the laboratory.

          -  Normal aPTT.

          -  Bilirubin in the normal range unless due to documented Gilbert's disease.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range.

          -  Urinalysis showing no evidence of infection or active renal disease (e.g.,
             proteinuria).

          -  Subjects must be able to adhere to the visit schedule set forth in this protocol.

          -  Written informed consent prior to the performance of any study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following criteria during screening will not be eligible:

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Western immunoblot confirmed presence of
             anti-HIV antibodies or detection of HIV RNA in blood).

          -  Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBV surface antigen or DNA in blood).

          -  Antiviral therapy for HCV within 3 months.

          -  Immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., systemic corticosteriods or interferon) within 3
             months.

          -  Advanced or decompensated liver disease (e.g., history of bleeding varices,
             spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy, ascites) of any etiology such as alcohol, drug,
             obesity, or hemochromatosis.

          -  ALT greater than 5x ULN.

          -  Histologic evidence of cirrhosis.

          -  Presence of an underlying disease state associated with active bleeding.

          -  Undergoing therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin.

          -  Presence of any other active infection requiring therapy.

          -  Presence of malignancy.

          -  Presence or history of any significant medical illness that might interfere with this
             study.

          -  Receipt of an investigational new drug, biological or therapeutic device within 30
             days of study entry.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse requiring medical intervention within 2 years.

          -  History of non-compliance with prescribed medical care.

          -  Limited mental capacity or language skills to the extent simple instructions cannot be
             followed or information regarding adverse events cannot be provided
