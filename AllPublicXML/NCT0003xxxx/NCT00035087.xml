      This study will examine whether the new investigational drug EPO906, given by intravenous
      infusion (IV directly into the vein), is effective in shrinking tumors and preventing the
      growth of cells that cause colorectal cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented evidence of colorectal cancer with at least
             one measurable lesion (if previous radiation treatment, the target lesion must have
             demonstrated progression since the radiation)

          -  The patient should have failed or progressed on no more than two prior chemotherapies
             for metastatic disease (the prior chemotherapy must have included a fluoropyrimidine
             and either Irinotecan or oxaliplatin, or any combination of these agents, with the
             last chemotherapy having contained Irinotecan or oxaliplatin)

          -  Patients who have received only adjuvant therapy for their disease are eligible, as
             long as they have relapsed within six months of completing such therapy and that
             therapy contained 5-FU and Irinotecan or oxaliplatin administered in combination as
             part of an investigational protocol

          -  Must have a life expectancy of greater than three (3) months.

        Exclusion Criteria

        The following patients are not eligible for the study:

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement

          -  Patients with unresolved bowel obstruction

          -  Patients with any peripheral neuropathy or unresolved diarrhea greater than Grade 1

          -  Patients with severe cardiac insufficiency

          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery for any cause less than 4 weeks prior to
             study entry

          -  Patients with radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last four weeks

          -  Patients taking Coumadin or other warfarin-containing agents with the exception of low
             dose Coumadin (1 mg or less) for the maintenance of in-dwelling lines or ports

          -  History of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry except curatively
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Patients with active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection including
             abcesses or fistulae

          -  HIV+ patients

          -  Pregnant or lactating females
