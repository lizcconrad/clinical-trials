      RATIONALE: It is not yet known whether zinc sulfate is effective in preventing the loss of
      ability to taste food in cancer patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for head and
      neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of zinc sulfate in
      preventing loss of sense of taste in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for head
      and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether zinc sulfate prolongs the time to onset of altered taste in patients
           with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy.

        -  Determine whether this drug decreases the overall incidence of altered taste in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug results in fewer radiotherapy treatment interruptions in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to planned radiotherapy dose (less than 6,000 cGy vs at least 6,000
      cGy), estimated amount of oral mucosa in the radiation field (60% or less vs more than 60%),
      age (under 50 vs 50 and over), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), and smoking (yes vs no).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral zinc sulfate 3 times daily beginning the first week of
           radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times daily beginning the first week of
           radiotherapy.

      Treatment in both arms continues daily during and for 1 month after radiotherapy in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment, and then at 1, 2, 3, and 6
      months after the completion of treatment.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after the completion of treatment and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
