  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine a safe and effective dose of pentostatin in steroid-refractory aGvHD and to
      identify the minimal effective dose of pentostatin defined as the lowest dose that produces a
      response in 20% or more of patients while producing treatment failure (defines as death,
      grade 3/4 toxicity, or progressive disease) in 40% or less of patients.
