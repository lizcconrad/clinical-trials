      This study has two phases. Phase 1 will examine the role of inflammatory mediators called
      cytokines on growth hormone levels in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Phase 2 will
      evaluate the effect of etanercept on these growth hormone levels. Etanercept is approved for
      the treatment of RA. It lowers the levels of a key inflammatory mediator called tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha and is very effective in reducing arthritis symptoms.

      Growth hormone promotes bone and muscle growth. With aging, people lose muscle mass and bone
      strength, possibly because of decreased levels of growth hormone. People with RA have bone
      and muscle changes similar to those in older people, perhaps also due to decreased levels of
      growth hormone. The first part of this study will see if the inflammatory mediators
      responsible for joint inflammation (warmth, redness, pain, and swelling) in RA are related to
      the lowered growth hormone levels in this disease. The second part will evaluate the effect
      of etanercept treatment on muscle mass and bone density, in addition to growth hormone
      levels.

      Premenopausal women between 18 and 55 years of age with a recent diagnosis of rheumatoid
      arthritis (less than 3 years) are eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers will also be
      enrolled in the first phase of the study as control subjects. This study is conducted at two
      sites, the NIH and the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.

      Healthy volunteers enrolled in this study will be interviewed about their health status and
      will fill out questionnaires on diet and general physical function, including fatigue, energy
      and well being. In addition, they will be hospitalized once at the NIH Clinical Center for
      24-hour blood sampling and will visit to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore for a
      brachial artery reactivity study, as follows:

        -  24-hour blood sampling for growth hormone levels. Blood samples (1/2 teaspoon each) will
           be collected every 20 minutes from 8 AM one day until 8 AM the following day through a
           plastic tube in an arm vein.

        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan on a small area of the spine, hip and wrist
           to assess bone density and a total body DEXA scan to assess the amount and distribution
           of muscle and body fat.

        -  Blood vessel (brachial artery reactivity) study to measure the ability of the brachial
           artery to dilate and increase its blood flow. For this procedure, the subject lies on a
           table with electrocardiogram leads attached to the chest. A blood pressure cuff is
           inflated for several minutes and a drop of nasal spray of nitroglycerin is given that
           may cause a headache. Blood pressure and headache are monitored and treated as needed.

      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be seen at the NIH clinic on six separate visits
      (weeks 0, 1, 6, 12, 18, and 26) over 26 weeks. Week 0 is a screening visit. At weeks 1 and
      26, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 24-hour blood sampling, DEXA scans, and
      brachial artery reactivity tests, as described above, plus X-rays of the hand and feet. After
      the first visit, they will start taking etanercept, given by self-injection under the skin
      (like insulin shots) twice a week. Follow-up visits at weeks 6, 12, and 18 will involve
      evaluations of disease activity and drug side effects through joint examination, blood tests,
      and questionnaires.

      This is a study in pre-menopausal and perimenopausal women with onset of rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) of less than 10 years duration, to be conducted at the Clinical Center of National
      Institutes of Health and The General Clinical Research Center of the Johns Hopkins Bayview
      Medical Center, Baltimore, MD. This investigation will explore the possible impact of
      systemically released inflammatory cytokines on suppression of the GH/IGF-1 axis, and the
      relationships of altered endocrine-immune function with body composition, endocrine,
      metabolic and vascular functions thought to be associated with RA-related sarcopenia,
      osteopenia and increased cardiovascular risk. In phase I of the study, we shall admit RA
      patients and control subjects to the Clinical Center for a 26-36 hour period for assessments
      of the GH/IGF-I axis, cytokines, body composition, endocrine-metabolic and cardiovascular
      functions, and quality of life. We plan to initiate Phase I of the study to compare baseline
      endocrine and inflammatory parameters in RA patients to matched normal controls. Phase II of
      the study, we shall enroll a new group of RA patients to evaluate the above outcome measures
      at baseline and after six months of treatment with standard therapy, using the soluble p75
      TNF receptor molecule etanercept, that has recently been approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of patients with early RA. Phase 2 of this study will be initiated upon access to
      etanercept and completion of Phase I of the study.
