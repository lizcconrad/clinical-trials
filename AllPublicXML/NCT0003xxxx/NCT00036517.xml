  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The triple combination chemotherapy of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin
      (CPT-11/5-FU/LV or Saltz regimen) is the treatment of choice for patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer. Severe diarrhea, unfortunately, is a side effect of such treatment.
      Preclinical studies have indicated that the botanical drug PHY906 can reduce such diarrhea
      without compromising the effectiveness of the chemotherapy. The primary purpose of this
      clinical study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and minimum effective dose of PHY906
      when administered in conjunction with the Saltz regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CPT-11/5-FU/LV is an active combination agent in the treatment of colorectal cancer, but one
      of its dose-limiting toxicities is diarrhea. PHY906 has been shown to reduce the severity of
      CPT-11–induced toxicity without compromising antitumor efficacy in in vivo animal models.
      Additionally, there has been a long historical experience in the Far East demonstrating
      safety of PHY906 in humans. Thus, we are conducting this double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PHY906. This dose escalation study will also
      examine the effect of PHY906 (1.2, 2.4, and 3.6 g/day) on the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 and
      5-FU after concomitant administration with CPT-11, 5-FU, and LV, and on the severity of
      CPT-11–induced toxicities such as diarrhea.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must:

          -  be between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time of enrollment.

          -  have advanced colorectal carcinoma, which may be either measurable or non-measurable.

          -  not have received either CPT-11, FU, or other cytotoxic chemotherapy agents in any
             setting (including adjuvant) within 1 year prior to screening.

          -  have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.

          -  use an effective contraceptive method if the patients are of reproductive potential
             while enrolled in the study, since the potential effects of the herbs on a developing
             fetus are unknown.

          -  have an estimated life expectancy of at least 20 weeks.

          -  provide written informed consent.

          -  have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values; these
             laboratory values must be obtained within 14 days prior to study enrollment:

          -  Bone marrow reserve: absolute granulocyte count (AGC) more than or equal to 1.5 X
             10(to the power of 9)/L, platelet count more than or equal to 100 X 10 (to the power
             of 9)/L, and hemoglobin level more than or equal to 9 g/dL.

          -  Hepatic function: serum total bilirubin concentration no greater than 1.5 mg/dL,
             aspartate transaminase (AST or serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]), and
             alanine transaminase (ALT or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) levels no
             greater than grade 2 toxicity as determined from the NCI-CTC version 2.0.

          -  Renal function: serum creatinine level no greater than grade 2 toxicity as determined
             from the CTC version 2.0.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients who have or are:

          -  Gilbert syndrome (familial, non-hemolytic, acholuric jaundice).

          -  patients with enterostomies.

          -  untreated brain metastases or deteriorating neurological function after the completion
             of cranial irradiation.

          -  a woman who is currently pregnant and/or breast-feeding.

          -  active infections or any serious systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the
             principal investigator, are incompatible with the study product and/or procedures.

          -  used an investigational agent within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  a known hypersensitivity to the study medication, its excipients, its analogs, or any
             of the component herbs.
