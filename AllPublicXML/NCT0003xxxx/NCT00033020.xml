      The purpose of this study is to test the utilization of incentive values (considerably lower
      than those typically used in research clinics) to motivate clients to attend treatment and
      initiate and sustain abstinence.

      The purpose of the proposed research is to implement and systematically evaluate, in
      community treatment settings, motivational incentive procedures that have been well
      researched and have proven efficacious in a variety of treatment research clinics. The study
      will determine if motivational incentives along with standard care therapy is more effective
      than standard therapy alone for the treatment of patients using cocaine or methamphetamine
      and entering a substance abuse treatment program.
