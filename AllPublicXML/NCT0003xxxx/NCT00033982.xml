    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of posaconazole for treating invasive
      fungal infections. New therapies for these infections are needed for patients who do not
      respond, to or cannot tolerate, standard treatment. These patients include those with immune
      defects who have significant side effects from treatment with amphotericin or other
      antifungals.

      Patients 13 years of age or older who are on other primary NIH protocols with an invasive
      fungal infection 1) that does not respond to standard antifungal therapies; 2) for which
      there is no effective therapy; 3) who develop serious side effects from their current
      treatment; or 4) who have organ dysfunction that does not permit use of standard antifungal
      treatments may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history, including a review of current and previous antifungal treatments, pregnancy test for
      women of childbearing potential, electrocardiogram (EKG), and detailed neurologic
      examination.

      Participants will take either 200 mg (1 teaspoonful) of liquid posaconazole by mouth four
      times a day or 400 mg (two teaspoonfuls) twice a day for a period of 28 days to 24 months.
      (The physician will determine the duration of treatment.) Patients will have monthly
      follow-up visits during the treatment period and 1 month after treatment is completed for the
      following procedures:

        -  Detailed neurologic exam every 3 months

        -  Blood tests every month

        -  EKG every month

        -  Imaging studies, including chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) radionuclide scanning or ultrasound, every month until the infection has
           been stable for three determinations. Thereafter, imaging studies will be done every 3
           months as long as the infection remains stable or improves.

      On the last day of the study treatment period, participants will have a detailed neurologic
      exam and review of medications and medical complaints since their last visit.

      We seek to use the experimental triazole antifungal, Posaconazole, in the treatment of
      patients with invasive fungal infections that are resistant or refractory to the best
      available treatment, or who are unable to tolerate the best available treatment. We have
      observed significant short and long term toxicities from amphotericin and its various
      preparations in our patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and Hyper IgE recurrent
      infection syndrome (HIE or Job's). We now have now had 5 CGD patients on dialysis, and
      several more have progressive renal failure, all thought due to high dose, prolonged
      amphotericin. In addition, many of our more severely affected CGD patients have had multiple
      thoracic surgeries, leading to reduced lung capacity. Several of our HIE patients have
      persistent fungal lung infections that have not cleared with extensive therapy with
      amphotericin and/or other new triazole antifungals. Therefore, agents of high tolerability
      and high potency are still desperately needed. Posaconazole has a broad spectrum of action
      against a large number of molds and fungi at easily achievable concentrations in plasma. It
      has a favorable toxicity profile and has performed well in clinical trials to date. This drug
      will be administered orally twice daily. Close monitoring of tolerance, toxicity, and
      efficacy will be performed. We anticipate enrollment of up to 50 patients over the next 2
      years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        As set out in the company protocol.

        All subjects must have a proven or probable fungal infection that is resistant to standard
        therapy, or to which therapy the patient is significantly intolerant. (Intolerance must
        include signs of intolerance such as fever, rigors, laboratory, abnormalities, as well as
        subjective symptoms).

        Only subjects age 2 years and older will be eligible at this time.

        Pediatric Inclusion:

        Children age 2 and over are eligible. Children under 2 years are not currently eligible
        because of lack of any data on dose and tolerance.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        As set out in the company protocol.
