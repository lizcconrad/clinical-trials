      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to determine the effectiveness of combining capecitabine and
      paclitaxel in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine when combined with paclitaxel
           in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast.

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of the dose immediately preceding the MTD identified in
           phase I, in terms of response rate, time to treatment failure, time to disease
           progression, and overall survival, in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine a well-tolerated drug combination for these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of capecitabine.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 or more of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are
      treated at the dose level immediately preceding the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for phase I and 15-46 patients
      will be accrued for phase II of this study.
