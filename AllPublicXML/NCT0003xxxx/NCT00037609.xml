      The primary objective of the phase I study is to determine a safe dose for combination
      therapy with capecitabine and exisulind. A secondary objective is to assess pharmacokinetic
      interactions between the two drugs and assess the biological activity of exisulind.

      The primary objective of the Phase II part of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity
      of this combination therapy measured by objective tumor response. Secondary end points also
      assessed will be toxicity of therapy, duration of response and time to progression.

      Rationale for this study:

      Capecitabine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 2nd or 3rd line
      chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer who previously have failed both
      anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Capecitabine produces objective tumor response of
      around 20% with a median duration of response of 32 weeks in these patients (1). These
      results indicate that improvements in the treatment of anthracycline and taxane resistant
      breast cancer are needed. Exisulind (sulindac sulfone, FGN-1, APTOSYNTM) is a sulfone
      metabolite of sulindac, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug. Sulindac
      sulfone lacks inhibitory activity on the two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX 1 and COX 2, and
      is devoid of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity that is associated with NSAIDs. Exisulind
      selectively stimulates programmed cell death in a variety of neoplastic cells including
      colon, prostate, and mammary epithelial cells without affecting normal cells (2,3). Exisulind
      inhibits the growth of breast cancer cell lines in vitro and also inhibits chemically-induced
      mammary carcinogenesis in rats (4,5). The drug is also synergistic with a diverse group of
      cytotoxic compounds including cisplatin, taxanes and retinoids (6). Exisulind exerts its
      effects by inhibiting a novel phosphodiesterase that belongs to the PDE5 family which
      specifically degrades cGMP (7). Inhibition of this enzyme results in a rise in intracellular
      cGMP levels and leads to apoptosis through yet unknown mechanism. Exisulind also inhibits
      transcription factor NF-kB (8). The NF-kB pathway is activated by cellular stress including
      exposure to inflammatory cytokines, cytotoxic agents and oxidative stress (9). It is believed
      that activation of NF-kB protects from cell death, therefore, inhibition of this
      transcription factor may contribute to the proapoptotic, chemotherapy potentiating effect of
      exisulind.

      Exisulind selectively promotes apoptosis in neoplastic cells whereas chemotherapeutic drugs
      induce programmed cell death in a non-selective manner. We hypothesize that combination of
      the 2 drugs will increase response rates by selectively augmenting the cytotoxic activity of
      chemotherapy. Furthermore, continuous maintenance treatment, between chemotherapy doses, with
      a minimally toxic drug that selectively induces apoptosis of cancer cells may improve
      response duration and ultimately may translate into improved survival and better quality of
      life. Each drug alone has an established maximum tolerated dose in humans. However, the
      combination of exisulind and capecitabine has not been tested. This phase I-II study is
      proposed to test safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Each patient must meet all these criteria in order to be considered for enrollment in the
        Phase I study:

          -  Histologically confirmed breast cancer and either clinical, radiological or laboratory
             evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Patients must have received both anthracycline-containing and taxane chemotherapy
             either as adjuvant treatment or therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

          -  There is no limit on prior chemotherapy regimens or hormonal therapies received.

          -  Concomitant bisphosphonate treatment is allowed for patients with bone metastases.

          -  Patients must have recovered from acute toxic effects of any prior therapy including
             surgery and radiation.

          -  Zubrod performance status &lt; 2. (See Appendix A)

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, ANC &gt; 1500 cells/mm3,
             hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dl.

          -  Normal renal function: creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Adequate liver function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL. Transaminases (SGOT) or LDH, and
             alkaline phosphatase must be &lt;1.5 x of the upper limit of normal in the absence of
             bone or liver metastasis, or &lt;2.5 x of the upper limit of normal in the presence of
             radiologically apparent liver metastasis or bone metastasis, respectively.

          -  Female patients must be of non-childbearing potential or non-lactating and using
             adequate contraception. Beta-HCG will be checked in premenopausal patients if
             clinically indicated.

          -  Patients with brain metastases whose disease remained stable for more than 6 months
             after completing therapy to the brain are eligible.

        In addition to the above, patients participating in the Phase II portion of this study:

        Must have bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease. Lytic lesions seen on plain
        radiographs will be considered evaluable in conjunction with bone scan abnormalities. Bone
        scan abnormalities alone, pure blastic bone metastases or irradiated lesions are not
        considered measurable or evaluable and will not be accepted. Also, pleural or peritoneal
        effusions will not be considered evaluable disease.

          -  Clinical or laboratory evidence of significant liver disease.

          -  Concomitant treatment with cytotoxic agents other than capecitabine or participation
             in any other investigational study.

          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric, or social (addictive) disorders that would preclude
             obtaining informed consent or patient participation in the study.
