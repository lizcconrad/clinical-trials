      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of two consecutive days of metyrapone
      (MRP) in subjects who may use cocaine concurrently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of metyrapone (MRP) for using in an outpatient study in which
      participants would be given 2 750 mg doses of MRP per week. Secondary study goals are to
      evaluate the possible efficacy of MRP as a treatment for cocaine dependence and to compare 3
      factors hypothesized to induce cocaine craving: cocaine cues, stress, and cocaine itself.
      This study will utilize a Double Blind, placebo-controlled crossover design with 3 factors:
      1) medication 2) relapse trigger and 3) infusion for an 11 day in-patient treatment.
