      In this study, patients will be randomized to one of three dose regimen groups. Each dose of
      OvaRex MAb-B43.13 is 2 mg by slow intravenous administration.

      Group 1 will receive two doses, one month apart.

      Group 2 will receive three consecutive monthly doses, then at 12-week intervals through 2
      years or until disease relapse up to a total of 9 doses.

      Group 3 will receive six consecutive monthly doses, then at 12-week intervals through 2 years
      or until disease relapse up to a total of 11 doses.

      The study will compare the time to disease relapse of patients who demonstrate an immune
      response to OvaRex MAb-B43.13 with time to disease relapse of those who do not demonstrate an
      immune response to OvaRex MAb-B43.13. Differences in the percentage of patients demonstrating
      an immune response in each dose regimen group will also be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histological diagnosis of epithelial adenocarcinoma of ovarian, tubal or peritoneal
             origin and disease is classified as FIGO Stage III or IV.

          -  Functional Performance Status &lt; or = 2 by ECOG scale or &gt; or = 60% on Karnofsky scale.

          -  Medical assessment consistent with prognosis for an expected survival of at least 6
             months.

          -  Serum CA125 level &gt;35 U/mL prior to or at initial surgery. Alternatively, serum CA125
             level &gt; or = 100 U/mL and immunohistochemical evidence of tumor tissue expressing
             CA125.

          -  Presence of residual disease that is either (a) visible to or palpable by the surgeon
             at the completion of the staging laparotomy procedure, or (b) microscopic disease
             remaining following the staging laparotomy procedure.

          -  Received chemotherapy that included cisplatin or carboplatin following appropriate
             staging procedure.

          -  Complete clinical response to primary treatment protocol, which included laparotomy
             followed by platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  First dose of study medication must be within 10 weeks of completing last dose of
             primary chemotherapy.

          -  Not more than one prior regimen of chemotherapy. A change of chemotherapy agents is
             permitted during the patient's primary therapy provided that the change is considered
             to be part of the initial chemotherapy treatment regimen.

          -  No whole abdomen, abdominopelvic or pelvic radiotherapy, surgery or chemotherapy
             within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  No immunotherapy (interferons, tumor necrosis factor, other cytokines or biological
             response modifiers, or BCG vaccines) within the previous 6 weeks of first study dose.
             Patients who have received hemopoietic factors are acceptable.

          -  No previous treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic
             purposes.

          -  No compromised hematopoietic function defined as a hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL or lymphocyte
             count &lt;300 mm3 or neutrophil count &lt;1000 mm3 or platelet count &lt;100,000 mm3.

          -  No hepatic dysfunction defined as a bilirubin &gt;1.5 times the upper normal limits.

          -  No severe renal dysfunction defined as serum creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dL.

          -  While pregnancy is unlikely in view of the disease and previous surgery, patients who
             the investigator considers may be at risk of pregnancy will have a pregnancy
             [beta-HCG] test and will be using a medically approved contraceptive method. Patients
             who are breast-feeding are also excluded.

          -  No active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, ulcerative colitis,
             Chrohn?s Disease, MS, ankylosing spondylitis).

          -  No significant cardiovascular abnormalities (uncontrolled hypertension, CHF (NYHA
             Classes II-IV), uncontrolled angina, or uncontrolled arrhythmias).

          -  No concurrent illness or chronically taking medication that could confound the results
             of the study, preclude the patient from completing the study or mask an adverse
             reaction.

          -  No concurrent malignancy (except non-melanoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of
             cervix), unless curative treatment was received and patient has been disease-free for
