  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the upper and lower
      gastrointestinal tract and characterized by abdominal pain, weight loss, gastrointestinal
      bleeding and formation of fistulas between loops of bowel and from the bowel to the skin or
      other organs. Current therapy for active Crohn's disease consists of symptomatic treatment,
      nutritional therapy, salicylates and immunosuppressants or surgical management.

      Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) plays a central role in the initiation and amplification of
      the granulomatous inflammatory reaction seen in CD (van Deventer, 1997). Increased TNF-a is
      present in gut mucosa as well as in stool of patients with active CD (Braegger et al, 1992).
      CNI-1493 is a synthetic guanylhydrazone compound that is an inhibitor of TNF-a synthesis. A
      monoclonal antibody to TNF, infliximab, is now approved for treatment of CD, but not all
      patients respond and many who do respond eventually become refractory to this treatment as
      well.

      CNI-1493 is a synthetic compound which blocks the production of several inflammatory
      cytokines, including TNF. Because it blocks production of multiple inflammatory mediators, it
      may be more active than products targeted to a specific cytokine. In addition, as it is not a
      biologic, it should not cause hypersensitivity reactions or induce formation of antibodies.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine if CNI-1493 is safe and effective in treating
      patients with moderate to severe Crohn's Disease in a placebo controlled setting.
