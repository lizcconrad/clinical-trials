  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the new investigational drug EPO906, given by intravenous
      infusion (IV directly into the vein), is effective in shrinking tumors and preventing the
      growth of cells that cause ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancers. Recruitment in the
      United States is complete but the study is still enrolling in other countries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following patients may be eligible for the study:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented evidence of ovarian, primary Fallopian or
             primary peritoneal cancer with at least one measurable lesion (if previous radiation
             treatment, the target lesion must have demonstrated progression since the radiation)

          -  Must have a life expectancy of greater than three (3) months

          -  Prior failure to respond following front-line treatment with a taxane and platinum (or
             a combination therapy) may be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following patients are not eligible for the study:

          -  Patients with radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last four weeks

          -  Patients who have had any chemotherapy not containing a taxane and platinum for their
             disease

          -  Patients with borderline ovarian and macropapillary tumors

          -  Patients with unresolved bowel obstruction

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement

          -  Patients with any peripheral neuropathy or unresolved diarrhea greater than Grade 1

          -  Patients with severe cardiac insufficiency

          -  Patients taking Coumadin or other warfarin-containing agents with the exception of low
             dose Coumadin (1 mg or less) for the maintenance of in-dwelling lines or ports

          -  History of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry except curatively
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Patients with active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection including
             abcesses or fistulae

          -  HIV+ patients
