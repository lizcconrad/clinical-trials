  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a modified stem cell transplant
      procedure for treating leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). LAD is an inherited blood
      disorder of leukocytes (infection-fighting white blood cells) that leaves patients vulnerable
      to life-threatening infections. Transplantation of donated stem cells (cells produced by the
      bone marrow that mature into blood cells) can improve the immune system of patients with LAD.
      However, this procedure carries a significant risk of death, particularly in patients with
      active infection because it requires completely suppressing the immune system with high-dose
      chemotherapy and radiation. In addition, T-cells (a type of white blood cell) from the donor
      may cause what is called graft vs. host disease (GvHD), in which the donor cells recognize
      the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response to destroy them. To try to reduce
      these risks, the donor's T-cells will be removed from the rest of the stem cells to be
      transplanted.

      Patients with LAD who weigh at least 12 kg (26.4 LB), who do not have an active infection,
      and who have a family member that is a well-matched donor may be eligible for this study.
      Pregnant or breast feeding women may not participate. Candidates will have a medical history,
      physical examination and blood tests, lung and heart function tests, X-rays or computed
      tomography (CT) scans of the body, and dental and eye examinations. They will fill out
      questionnaires that measure emotional well being, quality of life and intelligence (the
      ability to learn and understand).

      Stem cells will be collected from both the patient and donor. To do this, the hormone G-CSF
      will be injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells from the bone marrow to
      the bloodstream. The stem cells will be collected by apheresis, where blood is drawn through
      a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine separating and removing the required
      cells. The rest of the blood is then returned through a needle in the other arm.

      Before the transplant, a central venous line (large plastic tube) is placed into a major
      vein. This tube can stay in the body and be used during the entire treatment period to
      deliver the donated stem cells, give medications, transfuse blood, if needed, and withdraw
      blood samples. Several days before the transplant procedure, patients will begin a
      conditioning regimen of low-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and Campath
      1H. When the conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells will be infused. To help
      prevent rejection of donor cells, cyclosporine will be given by mouth or by vein starting 1
      month after the transplant procedure.

      The average hospital stay for stem cell transplantation is 21 days. After discharge, patients
      will return for follow-up clinic visits weekly or twice weekly for 2 to 3 months. These
      visits will include a symptom check, physical examination, and blood tests. Subsequent visits
      will be scheduled at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplant, or more often if required,
      and then yearly

      Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) is an inherited disorder of leukocyte function. Patients
      are profoundly immunocompromised and plagued early in life with recurrent and often life
      threatening infections. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly improves immune
      function in patients LAD however severe toxicities are associated with conventional
      approaches to treatment. The primary objective of this phase II study is to investigate
      efficacy of a novel approach to allogeneic stem cell transplantation that is designed to
      promote partial or complete donor stem cell engraftment (hematopoietic chimerism) with
      reduced transplant morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to reduce toxicity from
      pre-transplant bone marrow conditioning, a highly immunosuppressive, low intensity bone
      marrow conditioning regimen will be used. Patients will be transplanted with peripheral blood
      stem cells from an HLA identical family member. T-lymphocytes will be removed from the stem
      cell graft in an attempt to decrease the risk of graft vs host disease. Donor T-cells will be
      infused at various time points following the transplant to augment donor hematopoietic
      chimerism and aid in immune reconstitution. The primary end points of this study are the
      establishment of donor hematopoietic chimerism, acute and chronic graft versus host disease,
      and transplant related mortality.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Minimum weight of 12 kg.

        Disease criteria: LAD: less than 20% expression of CD18 (as measured by fluorescence
        intensity compared to controls) on peripheral leukocytes by flow cytometry and either: a)
        clinical history of 2 severe infections requiring intravenous anti-bacterial or anti-fungal
        treatment OR b) history of life-threatening non-healing skin lesions.

        Free of active infection. Patients with non-healing skin lesions may be enrolled after
        superinfection has been contained.

        Patients with consenting HLA-matched related donors that meet donor selection criteria.

        Patients with adequate organ function as measured by:

        DONOR SELECTION:

        Donors must be fit to receive G-CSF and give peripheral blood stem cells (normal blood
        count, normotensive, no history of stroke, no history of severe heart disease, greater than
        12 kg).

        DRB1 alleles. Matching assessed minimally by serology for Class I and DNA typing for Class
        II antigens.

        Peripheral blood cells expressing normal levels of CD18.

        If donor is a sibling who is a minor, he/she is the oldest eligible sibling and no adults
        are eligible donors.

        Written informed consent from donor. Donors who are minors will be evaluated by a social
        worker, psychologist or psychiatrist prior to the assent process to determine willingness
        to participate. If willingness to participate has been confirmed, informed consent will be
        obtained from adult parent or legal guardian. Informed assent will be obtained from minor
        donor in the presence of a third party who will assess comprehension and voluntary
        participation.
