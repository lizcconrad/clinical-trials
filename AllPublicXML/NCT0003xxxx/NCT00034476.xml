      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of the study drug is
      effective in increasing the chance of survival in patients with severe sepsis. Patients
      entered into this study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Patients in
      each treatment group will be given either the study drug or placebo as a continuous infusion
      directly into the bloodstream through a catheter placed in one of the patient's veins.

      The study drug is an investigational drug that is still in development. It has been studied
      in approximately 30 healthy subjects, approximately 30 patients with either kidney failure or
      arthritis, and approximately 600 patients with severe sepsis. Patient participation in this
      study will last for about one month.
