      The purpose of this clinical research study is to answer the following questions using
      18F-fluoromisonidazole as an imaging agent:

        1. Do cells exist in human tumors that are at very low oxygen levels (hypoxic cells)?

        2. If hypoxic cells exist in human tumors, do they effect the ability of radiotherapy to
           control human tumors?

        3. Can Positron Emission Tomography (PET scanning) detect hypoxic cells in human tumors?

      Hypoxic (low oxygen) cells have long been known to exist in animal tumors. It is also known
      that hypoxic cells are more difficult to eliminate with radiotherapy than tumor cells at
      normal levels of oxygen (normoxic cells). However, the extent to which hypoxic cells limit
      the curability of human tumors is uncertain. To determine if hypoxic cells exist in human
      tumors and how hypoxic cells might influence the efficacy of radiotherapy, this study
      involves direct measurements of oxygen levels in human tumors compared to the tumor uptake of
      the experimental drug, 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO), visualized with PET scanning.
      18F-fluoromisonidazole has been used with PET imaging to tell the difference between growing
      tumors which have high and low oxygen content.

      Before beginning radiotherapy, a PET scan (series of pictures, 20 min. scan) will be
      performed at 2 hours after an intravenous injection of a small amount of radioactive traces
      drug, 18F-fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO) to observe the active hypoxia tumors areas. Upon
      completion of the 18F-FMISO PET scan, direct oxygen measurements will be obtained by placing
      a small needle into the tumor under computer tomographic (CT) guidance. The PET scan and
      needle measurements will be repeated every 4 weeks into the course of radiotherapy and again
      after the completion of radiotherapy. The measurement obtained by 18F-FMISO PET scanning
      (non-invasive technique) and by direct needle measurements (invasive technique) will be
      correlated with the eventual treatment outcome for future use.
