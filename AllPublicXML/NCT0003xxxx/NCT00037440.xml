      BACKGROUND:

      While the onset of symptomatic cardiovascular disease (CVD) typically occurs in middle age or
      later, the development of the underlying pathology is clearly a long-term process, and
      early-state lesions having been identified at autopsy even in children. Understanding the
      course of CVD risk development from childhood into middle age will clearly be valuable both
      in understanding the pathology of CVD and in targeting preventive measures most effectively.
      Furthermore, while genetic factors are agreed to play a significant role in the development
      of CVD, most genes contributing to interindividual variation in CVD risk will have relatively
      small effects on risk for any given individual, even though their aggregate effects
      contribute significantly to CVD risk in the overall population. Relatively little is known
      about the effects of genetic variants on the course of CVD risk factor development in
      individuals over time. The Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS), which began in 1973 as a study of CVD
      risk factors in children but evolved to cover the development of CVD risk factors from
      childhood into early middle age, offers an unparalleled resource for investigating the
      genetic factors influencing within-individual changes over time in quantitative factors, such
      as serum lipids and blood pressure, related to CVD risk.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Approximately 1500 individuals who were examined in the BHS on at least three separate
      occasions over a period of up to 20 years, and who consented to participate in studies of
      genetic factors influencing CVD risk, will have genotypes measured at selected loci either
      known or strongly suspected to affect interindividual variation in CVD risk. Longitudinal
      multilevel regression will be used to measure the effects of variation at these loci on
      quantitative CVD risk factor profiles within individuals and to determine whether some gene
      effects on CVD risk variation are age-dependent.
