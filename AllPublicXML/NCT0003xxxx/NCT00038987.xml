      To define the safety of vaccination with APSV as determined by the reactogenicity of the
      vaccine and the development of expected and un-expected adverse events associated with
      vaccination.

      To assess the proportion of individuals who respond to vaccination with a &quot;take&quot; (those who
      form a visible lesion at the injection site) 6 to 8 days after the vaccination.

      The study will be a four-center, randomized, dose finding trial to evaluate safety,
      preliminary efficacy, and immunogenicity of Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) in
      healthy, vaccinia-naive adults. Four concentrations of APSV, derived from 2 lots of vaccine,
      will be tested; ranging from 10 (exponent 6 pfu per ml) to 10 (exponent 7.5 pfu per ml). Four
      concentrations of Dryvax (ranging from 10 exp 6 per ml to 10 exp 8 per ml) will be evaluated
      as a positive control. This study is designed to assess the feasibility of the use of APSV
      and dilutions of APSV in an emergency vaccination scenario. The study will be conducted in
      two phases. The initial phase will consist of a single-center, randomized, open-label study
      in 45 subjects to evaluate the safety and approximate the take rate of undiluted APSV (two
      lots APSV plus a Dryvax control arm: n=15 per arm). A 14 day post vaccination safety
      follow-up will be completed for all subjects vaccinated in the initial phase prior to
      initiation of the second phase of the study with an additional 285 subjects. All subjects
      will be followed for 56 days post vaccination with a clinic visit at day 180 for stage 1
      subjects and a follow-up phone call at day 180 for stage 2 subjects. The expansion phase of
      the study will be conducted at three additional sites.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age: 18-32 (Volunteers over 32 years of age are not included since they usually are
             not vaccinia-naive.) Children are excluded due to concerns of safety, including
             autoinoculation.

          -  Acceptable medical history by screening evaluation form and brief assessment.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for women.

          -  Negative history of smallpox vaccination.

          -  Negative ELISA for HIV or negative Western blot for volunteers who have a positive
             ELISA and have participated in an HIV vaccine trial.

          -  Availability for follow-up for planned duration of the study (6 months). Note: Stage 1
             - clinic visit at Day 180+/-15 days, Stage 2 - phone call at Day 180 +/- 15 days.

          -  If the volunteer is female, she agrees to use acceptable contraception and not become
             pregnant for the duration of the study.

          -  Willing to sign informed consent.

          -  Adequate renal functions as defined as a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, urine protein
             &lt; 100 mg/dL or negative proteinuria, and a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 55 mL/min
             based on the following formulas: For males ((140 minus age in years) x weight in
             kg)/72 x serum creatinine). For females: 0.85 x ((140 minus age in years) x weight in
             kg)/72 x serum creatinine). Note: Renal function is measured to ensure subjects could
             meet criteria for use of cidofovir if needed.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  History of immunodeficiency.

          -  Serology positive for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C at the screening visit.

             clinically significant liver disease.

          -  Diabetes mellitus.

          -  Moderate to severe kidney impairment.
