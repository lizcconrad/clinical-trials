    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the
      tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib with gemcitabine in
      treating patients who have newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer
      or other solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine in
           patients with recently diagnosed, gemcitabine-naive, locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic carcinoma or other potentially responsive solid tumor.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective antitumor response rate and response duration in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and duration of overall survival in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-7 and oral erlotinib once
      daily beginning on day 3 of week 1 and continuing for 8 weeks (course 1). Patients receive
      subsequent courses of therapy comprising gemcitabine once weekly for 3 weeks and erlotinib
      once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional
      patients are accrued and treated at the MTD as above.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.
