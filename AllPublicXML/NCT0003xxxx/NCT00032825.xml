  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the maximum dose of docetaxel that can be given safely in
      combination with ketoconazole for treating advanced prostate cancer. Docetaxel is approved
      for the treatment of several other types of cancers; ketoconazole is an approved antifungal
      medication that is also commonly used in high doses to treat prostate cancer.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced prostate cancer that does not respond to
      hormone therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests
      to evaluate liver, kidney and other organ function and with x-rays, scans, or other imaging
      tests to determine the extent of disease.

      Participants will take the following medications:

        -  Docetaxel daily, infused through a vein over 30 minutes, in 4-week cycles-3 consecutive
           weeks of drug followed by one week of rest

        -  Dexamethasone, 12 hours and 1 hour before and 12 hours after docetaxel infusions to help
           prevent fluid retention caused by the docetaxel

        -  Ketoconazole, 3 times a day

        -  Hydrocortisone, twice a day to replace a loss of natural steroids caused by the
           ketoconazole

      Patients will be hospitalized 1 to 2 days each for the first and second doses of docetaxel to
      allow for frequent blood draws to measure blood levels of the drug. Ketoconazole will be
      started about 2 weeks after the first dose of docetaxel and the second dose of docetaxel will
      be given 2 days after that. In order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel,
      the first few patients in the study will be given a low dose of the drug, and subsequent
      patients will get increasingly higher doses until unacceptable side effects occur. Because
      prostate cancer cells may grow if exposed to testosterone, patients may have to have their
      testosterone production suppressed either surgically (removal of the testicles) or medically
      with an injection of leuprolide or goserelin, which are luteinizing hormone-release hormone
      agonists that reduce the amount of testosterone.

      Imaging studies, such as x-rays, bone scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, will be done
      about every 3 months to examine how the tumor is responding to therapy. After six treatment
      cycles, patients will have monthly chest x-rays to check for fluid around the lining of the
      lungs, which may occur as a result of docetaxel therapy.

      Treatment is expected to continue for at least 3 to 6 months, although this time could be
      shortened or extended depending on the tumor response to therapy or side effects of the
      drugs. Patients who do not experience bad side effects and whose tumor does not grow during
      the first 3 treatment cycles will continue treatment; those who experience unacceptable side
      effects will be taken off the study.

    <textblock>
      High dose ketoconazole and weekly docetaxel have both been shown to have activity against
      androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC). We have demonstrated synergy in prostate cancer
      in an in vitro model. This is an open label phase I study of high-dose ketoconazole plus
      weekly docetaxel in patients with metastatic AIPC. The primary objective of this study will
      be to determine the side effect profile of ketoconazole when combined with weekly docetaxel
      therapy and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended phase II dose
      (RPIID) of docetaxel when combined with high dose ketoconazole. Since ketoconazole may alter
      the metabolism of docetaxel, this study will evaluate potential drug interactions and adverse
      events between these two agents. Ketoconazole dose will be 600mg per day (given 200 mg, three
      times a day), plus 30mg of hydrocortisone (20mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening), plus
      docetaxel 10-43 mg/m(2) in a dose escalation, repeated in 28-day cycles, comprising weekly
      treatments for three consecutive weeks followed by one week off. Each patient will be
      evaluated every four weeks for the duration of the study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must have histopathological documentation of prostate cancer confirmed in the
        Pathology Department of the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health or the
        National Naval Medical Center prior to starting this study. Patients whose pathology
        specimens are no longer available may be enrolled in the trial, if the patient has a
        clinical course consistent with prostate cancer and pathologic documentation of the
        diagnosis.

        Patients must have metastatic progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer (progressive
        prostate cancer while continuing to receive hormonal ablation, such as that of an LHRH
        agonist) documented prior to entry. Progression must be documented by at least one of the
        following parameters:

          1. Two consecutively rising PSA levels, separated by at least one week, with at least one
             measurement that is 50% above the nadir reached after the last therapeutic maneuver
             (as long as the measurement is 5 ng/ml or greater); and/or,

          2. At least one new metastatic deposit on Tc-99 bone scintigraphy; and/or,

        Progression of soft tissue metastases as measured by appropriate modalities (i.e., imaging,
        palpation):

          1. Development of new area of malignant disease (measurable or non-measurable);

          2. Measurable disease progression by RECIST criteria;

          3. At least 4 weeks off of flutamide and 6 weeks off of bicultamide and nilutamide.

        Patients who have not undergone surgical castration must continue treatment with an LHRH
        agonist. If for some reason the LHRH agonist has been discontinued prior to entry on the
        study, then it should be reinstituted and disease progression must be documented.

        Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 3 months.

        Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria.

        Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including
        surgery.

        Hematological eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks before starting therapy):

          1. Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3)

          2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3)

        Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks before starting therapy):

          1. If the creatinine is greater than 1.5 mg/dl, a 24 hour urine collection must be
             obtained, and measured creatinine clearance must be at least 40 mL/min.

          2. Hepatic function: Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than 2.5
             times upper limit of normal. If the alkaline phosphatase is greater than 2.5 times the
             upper limit of normal, it must be fractionated and the hepatic alkaline phosphatase
             should be less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

        Hormonal profile for patients with prostate cancer

        1. All patients who have not undergone surgical castration must have a serum testosterone
        under 50 ng/ml and continue on their GnRh agonist.

        Patients must not have other active malignancies (within the past two years with the
        exception of non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the bladder).

        Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent myocardial
        infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), New York Heart Assoc. class II-IV congestive
        heart failure are not eligible.

        Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent form.

        Patients must be willing to travel from their home to the NIH for follow-up visits.

        Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

        Must be able to ingest oral medications to be eligible.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with brain metastases will not be eligible.

        Patients who have received strontium or samarium will not be eligible.

        HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy will be excluded
        because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole, docetaxel or other
        agents administered during the study. In fact, ketoconazole has been found to increase the
        toxic effects of several protease inhibitors by affecting CYP3A4 activity.

        Patients on theophylline will be excluded.

        Patients who are receiving cisapride will be excluded.

        Patients who are receiving HMG-CoA inhibitors (lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin,
        pravastatin and cerivastatin)

        Patients currently taking known inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4; patients taking known
        substrates of CYP3A4 will be evaluated by the primary investigator.

        Patients who are receiving terfenadine, midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam, astemizole,
        loratadine, rifampin, isoniazid, dofetilide, pimozide, sirolimus or erythromycin will be
        excluded.

        Because gastric acidity is necessary for the dissolution and absorption of ketoconazole,
        concomitant administration of drugs which decrease gastric acid output or increase gastric
        pH (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, ranitidine, antimuscarinics, omeprazole, and lansoprazole)
        may decrease absorption and thus will be prohibited.

        Patients requiring warfarin will be excluded.
