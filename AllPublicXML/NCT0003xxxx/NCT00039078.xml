      RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near
      a tumor to kill tumor cells. Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be
      effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of hepatic arterial infusion using
      yttrium-90 microspheres (TheraSphere®) to see how well it works in treating patients with
      liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide supervised access to yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) for patients
           with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the response in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated
           with hepatic arterial infusion of yttrium-90 glass microspheres.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and adverse experiences associated with this therapy in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the survival time of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the time to progression of disease in the liver, duration of response, and
           progression-free interval of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Evaluate the influence of pretreatment characteristics on efficacy parameters in
           patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Radioactive material yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) is infused
      directly into a liver tumor in order to kill tumor cells and cause less damage to the normal
      tissue. Patients receive TheraSphere® via hepatic arterial infusion on day 1. This artery is
      accessed through the femoral artery in the groin. This procedure is generally completed on an
      outpatient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or sequential
      treatments to each side of the liver approximately 30 to 90 days apart. Patients may be
      re-treated at a later time.

      Patients are followed every 2 to 4 months for the rest of their lives to access tumor
      progression, symptom management and quality of life.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

               -  Histopathology confirmation may be waived in patients with a radiographically
                  identifiable liver mass in addition to known laboratory or clinical risk factors
                  for HCC, and/or an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level

          -  No significant extrahepatic disease that may represent an imminent life-threatening
             outcome

          -  No evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of
             radiotherapy to the lungs on either the first yttrium-90 glass microspheres
             (TheraSphere®) administration or with cumulative delivery of radiation to the lungs
             over multiple treatments due to any angiographically uncorrectable flow to the
             gastrointestinal tract

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  No hepatic dysfunction

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  No vascular abnormalities or severe peripheral vascular disease that would preclude
             angiography or selective visceral catheterization

          -  No pulmonary insufficiency

          -  No evidence of detectable technetium Tc 99m macroaggregates of albumin flow to the
             stomach or duodenum after application of established angiographic techniques to stop
             such flow

          -  No contraindications to angiography

          -  No contraindications to selective visceral catheterization

          -  No other condition or cormorbidity that would preclude study treatment

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  Negative pregnancy test

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days
             after study

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  At least 1 month since prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery

          -  No other concurrent investigational agents or anticancer therapy for HCC
