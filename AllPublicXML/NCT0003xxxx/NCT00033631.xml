      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet
      known which dose of radiation therapy is more effective in treating stage II prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different doses of
      specialized radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage II adenocarcinoma of the prostate
           treated with high- vs standard-dose three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the freedom from prostate-specific antigen failure, disease-specific survival,
           local progression, and distant metastases in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the probability of tumor control and normal tissue complications in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of grade 2 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal acute and
           late toxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life, including sexual function, of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Correlate histopathologic or tumor-specific cytogenetic or chromosomal markers with
           cancer control outcomes in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (Gleason score 2-6, PSA ≥10 mg/mL but
      &lt; 20 ng/mL vs Gleason score 7, PSA &lt; 15 ng/mL) and radiation modality (three-dimensional
      conformal radiotherapy [3D-CRT] vs intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard-dose 3D-CRT or IMRT once daily, 5 days a week, for 7.8
           weeks (39 treatment days).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo high-dose 3D-CRT or IMRT once daily, 5 days a week, for 8.8
           weeks (44 treatment days).

      Quality of life (QOL) is assessed initially at baseline. After completion of radiotherapy,
      QOL is assessed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,520 patients (760 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.

    <description>Failure is defined as having 3 consecutive elevations of post-treatment PSA or starting hormones after one or more elevations in post-treatment PSA but before three consecutive elevations were documented.

    <description>Survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death due to prostate cancer and is estimated by the cumulative incidence method. Patients last know to be alive are censored at date of last contact. Death due to prostate cancer was defined as primary cause of death certified as due to prostate cancer, or death in association with any of the following conditions: Further clinical tumor progression occurring after initiation of salvage anti-tumor therapy, a rise (that exceeds 1.0 ng/ml) in the serum PSA level on at least two consecutive occasions that occurred during or after salvage androgen suppression therapy, or disease progression in the absence of any anti-tumor therapy.</description>
