      This study will examine the development of stem cells (very immature cells produced by the
      bone marrow) and their potential to change into cells of other organ types. These cells will
      be studied for their potential use in creating replacement tissue for diseases ranging from
      diabetes to Parkinson s.

      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will
      be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.

      Participants will undergo a process called 'stem cell mobilization and apheresis' to collect
      bone marrow stem cells. For five days before the collection they will receive injections of a
      hormone called G-CSF, which stimulates release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the
      bloodstream. On the fifth day of the injections, stem cells will be collected through
      apheresis. For this procedure, blood is collected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in
      an arm vein and directed into a cell separator machine. There, the white cells and stem cells
      are separated from the other blood components through a spinning process and collected in a
      bag inside the machine. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a catheter in
      the other arm.

      The renewal of various tissues and organs at steady state or following damage relies upon a
      small population of locally residing tissue specific &quot;stem cells&quot; Stem cells from adult bone
      marrow represent an ideal stem cell source based on their ease of collection. In order to
      begin to explore the potential of adult bone marrow for the correction of genetic diseases
      that affect the blood such as sickle cell disease, we propose in vitro and in vivo mouse
      studies to examine the regulation of normal differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells
      collected from adult volunteers. In order to obtain adult hematopoietic stem cells in large
      numbers for in vitro and in vivo studies, volunteers will undergo mobilization with G-CSF for
      5 consecutive days followed by large volume apheresis on the 5th day of G-CSF injection. The
      harvested product will be immunomagnetically purified for the primitive progenitor population
      and viably cryopreserved in multiple aliquots.
