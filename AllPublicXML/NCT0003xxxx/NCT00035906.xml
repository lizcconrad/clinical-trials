  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an
      investigational medication to treat macular edema that persists despite current treatment
      methods. Participants will be evaluated for improvement in vision and side effects.

      Macular edema is a condition that affects the back of the eye (retina). It frequently occurs
      in people who have a history of diabetes, and is also associated with high blood pressure,
      uveitis, and previous eye surgery. The main symptom of macular edema is decreased vision,
      generally a blurring of central vision.

      There are no direct costs to participants for assessments and treatment as defined in the
      study protocol. All candidates must be available for required scheduled visits during the
      trial's 6-month follow-up period. Although the disease called age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) affects the same region of the eye as macular edema, they are not the same
      condition and AMD is not studied in this research trial.
