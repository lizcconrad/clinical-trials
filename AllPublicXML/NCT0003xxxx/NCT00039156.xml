      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 59-8862 in treating patients who
      have refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall tumor response rate, including complete response (CR) and partial
           response (PR) rate, in patients with aggressive refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
           treated with BAY 59-8862.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the duration of response (CR and PR) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity profile of this drug in this patient
           population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in selected patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months
      thereafter for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-140 patients will be accrued for this study.
