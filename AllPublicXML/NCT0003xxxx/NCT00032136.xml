  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      exemestane may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. It is not yet
      known if exemestane is more effective than tamoxifen in preventing the recurrence of breast
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of exemestane with that of
      tamoxifen in treating postmenopausal women who have undergone surgery to remove early-stage
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of adjuvant exemestane versus adjuvant tamoxifen
           in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.

        -  Compare the relapse-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with these
           drugs.

        -  Compare the incidence of contralateral breast cancer in patients treated with these
           drugs.

        -  Compare the safety and long-term tolerability of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) status (ER positive vs ER
      negative/PgR positive vs ER positive/PgR unknown), prior chemotherapy (none vs taxane-based
      vs anthracycline-based vs other), and nodal status (negative vs 1-3 nodes positive vs 4 or
      more nodes positive). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen once daily

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily. Treatment in both arms continues
           for a minimum of 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 3 and 12 during study.

      Patients are followed at least annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 4,400 patients (2,200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
