        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants in previous Phase 1 or 2 trials of ACH-126,443 who met entry criteria for
             previous studies.

          -  Adults ? 18 years of age

          -  Chronic HBV infection, known to be HbsAg positive ? 6 months

          -  Plasma HBV DNA level ? 100,000 copies/mL prior to initiation of ACH-126,443 in an
             earlier study

          -  Plasma HBV DNA level that in the medical judgment of the investigator, warrant's
             antiviral treatment

          -  HIV negative

          -  Basic hematologic and chemistry parameters within acceptable limits (defined in
             protocol)

          -  No need for excluded medications

          -  Subjects of reproductive capability must either practice abstinence or utilize two
             approved forms of birth control, one of which must be barrier protection (condom with
             spermicidal, diaphragm with spermicidal)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  HIV infection

          -  Active Hepatitis C co-infection

          -  Concurrent systemic antiviral treatment

          -  Treatment for HBV infection with lamivudine (3TC) for longer than three (3) months
             since participation in previous trial of ACH-126,443

          -  Previous therapy with agents with significant systemic myelosuppressive or cytotoxic
             potential within 3 months of study start or the expected need for such therapy at
             study start

          -  Alcohol abuse

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Inability to tolerate oral medication

          -  AST&gt;10.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  ALT&gt;10.0 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Any clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the Investigators opinion, would make
             the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements

          -  Use of investigational drug not approved by Medical Monitor
