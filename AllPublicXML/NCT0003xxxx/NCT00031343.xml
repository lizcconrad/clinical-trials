      This study will evaluate how controlling HIV infection with HAART (highly active
      antiretroviral therapy) affects the response to hepatitis C treatment with peginterferon
      alpha-2b and ribavirin in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C. HIV worsens liver
      disease caused by hepatitis C. Since treatment of HIV infection with HAART improves immune
      function, it may be beneficial to start HAART before treating HCV.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C infection may be
      eligible for this study. Patients must have an HCV viral load greater than 2000 copies/mL and
      a CD4 count that is either more than 500 cells/mm3, or more than 350 cells/mm3 with an HIV
      viral load no greater than 40,000 particles/mL. Candidates will be screened for current or
      previous diseases, conditions or treatments that may exclude them from this study. Screening
      includes a medical history and physical examination, eye examination, blood and urine tests,
      chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), liver ultrasound, and, possibly, a liver biopsy, if a
      recent one is not available. The liver biopsy is optional and is done to determine the
      severity of liver disease. Patients will be sedated for this test. The skin in the area over
      the biopsy site is numbed with a local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted rapidly into and
      out of the liver to obtain a small tissue sample. Patients remain in the hospital overnight
      for monitoring. Women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test.

      Patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment
      groups: 1) pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks (control group); or 2) HAART for 6
      months, followed by 48 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

      HAART group - Patients taking HAART will be followed in the clinic every 2 weeks for the
      first month and then monthly for the next 5 months. After 6 months of HAART they will begin
      taking pegylated interferon and ribavirin and will follow the dosing and follow-up schedule
      outlined below for patients in the control group.

      Control group - Patients will have weekly injections under the skin of peginterferon alpha-2b
      and ribavirin pills daily by mouth. Clinic visits will be scheduled as follows:

        -  Days 1, 3, 7, and 21 - Blood will be drawn for safety tests and to measure blood levels
           of HIV and HCV. HCV medications will be injected on days 7 and 21.

        -  Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 52, 56, and 64 - Blood and urine
           tests will be done to determine the side effects of pegylated interferon and ribavirin
           treatment and its effect on the HCV infection. Eye examinations will be done every 3
           months.

        -  Week 48 or end of treatment - Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin will
           stop after 48 weeks. At this time (or earlier for those who do not complete the 48 weeks
           of treatment), patients will return to the clinic for a routine visit, blood tests
           (including a test for hepatitis B) and abdominal ultrasound. Patients may also be
           hospitalized for 2 days for a repeat optional liver biopsy.

        -  Week 72 and extended follow-up visits - At week 72, patients will return for blood tests
           and a routine clinic visit. HCV viral load will be measured. Follow-up visits every 3
           months for an additional year will include a blood test to measure HCV viral load and a
           complete physical examination.

      Coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has
      risen dramatically since the explosion of the HIV pandemic twenty years ago, with one third
      of all HIV positive persons also infected with HCV. Numerous studies have suggested that HIV
      exacerbates several steps in the natural history of hepatitis C, and as survival among
      HIV-infected patients increases, hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality is expected to
      follow a similar trend in coinfected patients. Some investigators advocate the initiation of
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for this population prior to the initiation of
      HCV therapy. It is postulated that HAART will improve the host immune function by increasing
      the CD4+ cell count and decreasing HIV viral load, thought to be advantageous for patients
      starting HCV therapy. Despite its promising hypothesis, whether HAART ultimately leads to a
      reduction in HCV load in coinfected persons remains controversial. This is a non-blinded,
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of HAART on the immunologic, virologic,
      and clinical responses to HCV treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin in coinfected
      individuals with CD4 greater than or equal to 500 cells/mm (3) or greater than or equal to
      350 cells/mm(3) and a viral load less than or equal to 40,000 copies/mL. The study will also
      address the safety and efficacy of administering a combination of HAART along with
      peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin to HIV-infected individuals. 128 patients who are
      coinfected with HIV and HCV will be recruited for the study and randomized to receive one of
      two treatment regimens: 1) control group: will be treated with peginterferon alpha-2b and
      ribavirin for 48 weeks, or 2) experimental group: will be treated with highly active
      antiretroviral therapy for six months. At that point, they will begin receiving peginterferon
      alpha-2b and ribavirin at the same doses as the control group for 48 weeks. During the
      72-week follow up period, these patients will be monitored for both HCV and HIV viral loads
      and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The results of the study will enable us to better delineate the
      relationship between the immune reconstitution effects induced by HAART and the clinical,
      immunologic, and virologic responses of coinfected persons treated with peginterferon and
      ribavirin. In addition, evaluating the safety of coadministering peginterferon, ribavirin,
      and HAART will further refine the best therapeutic regimen for this patient population.
