  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine temporal trends from 1995 and 2000 in the incidence rates of heart failure, its
      therapeutic management, and changes over time in the hospital and long-term survival of
      patients with heart failure.

      BACKGROUND:

      Heart failure is estimated to contribute to nearly 1 million hospitalizations and
      approximately 250,000 deaths annually in the U.S. The number of new cases of heart failure in
      the U.S. is estimated to exceed 400,000 annually. Though reliable estimates of the magnitude,
      incidence, and mortality of heart failure remain sorely lacking, heart failure is associated
      with a grim prognosis. However, little recent data exist, particularly from a community-wide
      perspective, to determine whether the incidence or survival associated with heart failure,
      and the management of this clinical syndrome, has changed over time.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study uses residents of the Worcester (MA) metropolitan area (1990 census 437,000) and
      examines changes over time in these and additional outcomes for patients with validated heart
      failure during 1995 and 2000. Complimenting the hospital surveillance of heart failure, newly
      diagnosed cases of heart failure occurring in members of the largest HMO in Central
      Massachusetts during 1995 and 2000 will be identified and monitored over time. To accomplish
      the study objectives, the medical records of residents of the Worcester metropolitan area
      hospitalized with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure and related diagnostic rubrics will
      be individually reviewed and validated according to pre-established diagnostic criteria. The
      use of traditional criteria for heart failure as well as development of new criteria for the
      epidemiological study of heart failure will be an important focus of this observational
      study. Records for additional hospitalizations and death certificates will be reviewed to
      examine trends in long-term survival of discharged hospital patients through the year 2005.
