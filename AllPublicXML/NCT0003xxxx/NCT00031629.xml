  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. Colony-stimulating
      factors such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side
      effects of chemotherapy. This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy
      plus filgrastim or pegfilgrastim works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent
      cancer of the uterus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel, gemcitabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF) or
      pegfilgrastim in patients with persistent or recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8, docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 8, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 9-15 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 9
      only. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-24
      months.
