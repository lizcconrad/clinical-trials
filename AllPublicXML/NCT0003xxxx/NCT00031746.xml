      RATIONALE: Soy protein supplement may prevent or delay the development of prostate cancer in
      patients who have elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of soy protein supplement
      in preventing prostate cancer in patients who have elevated PSA levels.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the reduction in the rate of prostatic cellular proliferation in patients with
           an elevated PSA (5 to 10 ng/mL) and a negative biopsy for prostate cancer when treated
           with daily soy protein supplements vs placebo.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on additional biomarkers of prostate cancer (PSA,
           high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, induction of apoptosis, sex steroid
           receptor expression, and loss of glutathione S-transferase-pi) in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on quality of life, including urinary and sexual
           function, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to race (Caucasian vs African American). After 2 weeks of daily oral
      placebo, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral soy protein supplement daily for 12 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily for 12 months. Quality of life is assessed
           at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients (80 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      12 months.
