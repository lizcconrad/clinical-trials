      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells and
      decrease the recurrence of melanoma of the eye.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients who are at high risk for recurrent melanoma of the eye.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether adjuvant NA17-A and melanoma differentiation peptides are effective in
           decreasing the occurrence of liver metastasis in HLA-A2-positive patients with primary
           ocular melanoma at high risk of relapse.

        -  Determine whether this regimen increases survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      size (medium vs large), prior treatment of primary tumor (surgery vs radiotherapy), and
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccination with NA17-A and melanoma differentiation peptides
           (e.g., tyrosinase, Melan-A, and gp100 antigens) subcutaneously and intradermally on days
           1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients then receive a vaccination once every 14 days for 4 doses,
           once every 28 days for 4 doses, once every 56 days for 4 doses, and then once every 3
           months for a total of 4 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6
           months for 2 years.

      All patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
