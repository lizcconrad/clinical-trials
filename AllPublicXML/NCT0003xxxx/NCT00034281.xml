      The purpose of this study is to investigate a safe dose of TAK-165, once daily (QD), in
      patients with HER2-tumor expression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a member of the Type 1 family of
      growth factor tyrosine kinases. HER2 forms hetero- and homo-dimers with other members of this
      family of tyrosine kinases. As a result of dimerization at the cell surface, intracellular
      signal transduction is initiated, resulting in cell proliferation.

      HER2 expression has been observed in a variety of human tumors including breast cancer,
      non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, and
      ovarian cancer. HER2 overexpression is associated with clinically more aggressive breast
      cancer, and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.

      TAK-165 is an active and selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity of HER2 being
      developed for patients with lower levels of HER2 expression. This study will seek to
      determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of TAK-165
      administered to subjects with tumors known to express HER2.

      The total duration of the study will be at minimum 8 weeks, or 56 Days. Subjects without
      progressive disease after 8 weeks may continue to receive study drug, provided that they do
      not meet criteria for withdrawal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have advanced or metastatic cancer which is refractory to standard therapy or subjects
             for whom there is no known effective therapy.

          -  Have a histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of a solid tumor known to
             express HER2.

          -  Have a predicted life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks.

          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status of greater than or equal to 60%

          -  Have recovered from toxicities of prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test result within 7 days of enrollment into the study. Male and female
             subjects of childbearing potential (including women who have been amenorrheic for less
             than 1 year) must use appropriate birth control during the entire duration of the
             study, or the subject must be surgically sterile.

          -  Have symptomatic brain metastasis

          -  Have received any other anti-cancer treatment or investigational drug/treatment within
             28 days prior to study Day 1.

          -  Have a history of another malignancy within the last 5 years.

          -  Have inadequate organ function.

          -  Have heart failure defined by an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 50% as
             measured by MUGA.

          -  Have Class II, III or IV symptoms of heart failure as defined by the New York Heart
             Association, or uncontrolled arrhythmias, or recent history of myocardial infarction
             or angina pectoris.

          -  Have a medical condition that may interfere with intake and/or absorption of the study
             drug (e.g., gastrectomy or resection of major portion of small intestine).

          -  Have any other serious disease or condition present at screening or at study Day 1
             that might affect life expectancy or make it difficult to successfully manage and
             follow the subject according to the protocol.
