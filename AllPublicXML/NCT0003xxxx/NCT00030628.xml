      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Radiosurgery may
      be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is
      not yet known if radiosurgery is more effective with or without whole-brain radiation therapy
      in treating brain metastases.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiosurgery with or
      without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases treated with
           radiosurgery with or without whole brain radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the time to CNS failure (brain) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life, duration of functional independence, and long-term
           neurocognitive status in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the post-treatment toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (60 and over vs under 60), extracranial disease (controlled for more than 3 months vs
      controlled for 3 months or less), and number of brain metastases (1 vs more than 1). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiosurgery.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiosurgery. Within 14 days, patients then undergo whole brain
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, the beginning of each treatment, at week 6, every 3
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 12, every 3 months for 9 months, every 4 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients (240 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
