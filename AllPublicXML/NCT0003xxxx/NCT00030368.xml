    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bortezomib with paclitaxel in treating
      patients who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Bortezomib may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      Combining bortezomib with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given in combination with
      paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 2 and 9 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8.
      For the first course only, patients do not receive paclitaxel on day 1. Courses repeat every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity or greater than 80% 20S proteasome
      inhibition. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6-9 patients are accrued and treated at
      that dose.

      Patients are followed at 21 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
