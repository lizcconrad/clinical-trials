      RATIONALE: Cyclosporine may improve low blood counts caused by hematologic cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cyclosporine in treating patients who
      have low blood counts caused by hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency of cytopenic response in patients with T-cell large granular
           lymphocytic leukemia treated with cyclosporine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 9 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
