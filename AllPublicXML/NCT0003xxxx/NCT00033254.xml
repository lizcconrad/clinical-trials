  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without
      thalidomide in treating patients who have brain metastases. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as thalidomide may stop the growth of
      brain metastases by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether radiation
      therapy is more effective with or without thalidomide in treating brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the overall survival of patients with multiple brain metastases treated with
      radiotherapy with or without thalidomide.

      II. Compare the time to tumor progression in patients treated with these regimens.

      III. Compare the time to neuro-cognitive progression in patients treated with these regimens.

      IV. Compare the cause of death distribution in patients treated with these regimens.

      V. Compare the frequency of toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. VI. Evaluate
      and compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      recursive partitioning analysis class (I vs II) and planned chemotherapy after whole brain
      irradiation (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Arm II: Patients
      undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Beginning on the first day of radiotherapy, patients
      receive oral thalidomide once daily.

      Treatment with thalidomide continues for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of
      radiotherapy, and then every 2 months for 1 year.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 332 patients (166 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 14.5 months.
