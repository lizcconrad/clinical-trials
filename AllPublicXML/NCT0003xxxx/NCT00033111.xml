      The purpose of this study is to assess cabergoline for the Treatment of Cocaine Dependence
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of cabergoline in reducing cocaine use in subjects with
      cocaine dependence. This is a DB, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study where
      subjects will receive either .5mg cabergoline or placebo for 12 weeks with a 4 week
      follow-up.

    <description>Success in the reduction of cocaine use was determined by comparing cocaine non-use days (self-report confirmed or disproved by urine BE level at each study visit) expressed as the weekly mean proportion of non-use days to the total number of non-missing study days that week.</description>
