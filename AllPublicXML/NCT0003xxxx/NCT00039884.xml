  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial (a type of research study) designed to describe the efficacy
      (effectiveness) and toxicity (safety) of a new medical treatment, NESP (Novel Erythropoiesis
      Stimulating Protein). This study will be offered to patients with cervical cancer undergoing
      a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. This treatment may lower your red blood cells.
      The use of NESP may stimulate the body to produce more red blood cells. Our hypothesis is
      that higher red blood cells will be beneficial to the patient during treatment for cervical
      cancer.
