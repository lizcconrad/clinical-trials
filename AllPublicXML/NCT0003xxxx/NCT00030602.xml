      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have recurrent prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of PSA-3 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51
      on PSA levels in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine whether the T lymphocyte immune response to PSA-3
      and HLA-A2 antigen-presenting cells that endogenously produce PSA is increased in patients
      treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the duration of the PSA and/or immune responses in
      patients treated with this regimen. V. Correlate immune and PSA responses in patients treated
      with this regimen. VI. Determine the efficacy of a second (boost) vaccination with this
      regimen in patients with a PSA or immune response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive PSA-3 peptide vaccine emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously in 2 sites on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who show an immune or prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      response are followed until disease progression, defined as a diminution or disappearance of
      an immune response or 2 consecutive increases in PSA over the nadir. Patients are eligible
      for a second series of injections at the time of progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
