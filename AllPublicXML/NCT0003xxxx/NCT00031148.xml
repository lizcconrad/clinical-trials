  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety and efficacy of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to
      prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow
      (BM) or peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GVHD remains the major complication of allogeneic BM transplantation and is initiated during
      the conditioning of the recipient for transplant when the host tissues are damaged. Research
      has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a critical organ in GVHD
      pathophysiology. Agents that protect the GI tract may provide prophylaxis against the
      cytokine cascade and can lead to a reduced incidence and severity of GVHD. KGF is a protein
      that stimulates the growth of epithelial cells including those of the GI tract. KGF can
      protect the GI tract, prevent GVHD, and preserve donor T-cell function.

      Patients will receive standard GVHD prophylaxis in addition to the study drug. Overall GVHD
      will be graded weekly during the first 2 months after transplant, then every other week to
      Day 100. Response to therapy will be measured through the use of severity indices, physical
      exam, and laboratory serum values.
