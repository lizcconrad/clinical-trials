      RATIONALE: Highly focused ultrasound energy may be able to kill cancer cells by heating the
      tumor without affecting the surrounding tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of focused ultrasound energy in treating
      patients who have prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the ability of Sonablate to focus ultrasonic waves for the purpose of
           selectively destroying prostate cancer tissue, with resultant drop in PSA levels to
           below 0.5 ng/mL and negative biopsy for cancer cells, in patients with organ-confined
           prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      A probe is inserted into the rectum. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy using
      the Sonablate system is delivered to the prostate tissue over approximately 2-3 hours.
      Patients with residual cancer lesion (by biopsy), PSA greater than 0.5 ng/mL or increasing
      PSA levels taken at least 2 months apart, visible prostate tissue on ultrasound, and no local
      or distant metastases after day 90 undergo retreatment with HIFU.

      Patients are followed at 2, 14, 30, 90, and 180 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
