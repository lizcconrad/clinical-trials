      RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as
      goserelin, leuprolide, flutamide, or bicalutamide may stop the adrenal glands from producing
      androgens. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor
      to kill tumor cells. Combining hormone therapy with internal radiation may be effective in
      treating locally recurrent prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hormone therapy followed by internal
      radiation in treating patients who have locally recurrent prostate cancer following
      external-beam radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the nature, intensity, and time course of health-related quality of life
           changes in patients with locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma treated with androgen
           suppression and transperineal ultrasound-guided brachytherapy after external beam
           radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the morbidity of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical patterns of tumor recurrence (i.e., time to local tumor
           progression or distant failure) and time to biochemical failure of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the post-brachytherapy dosimetric coverage of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive androgen suppression comprising goserelin subcutaneously (as either 4
      one-month depot injections or 1 one-month depot injection and 1 three-month depot injection)
      OR leuprolide intramuscularly (as 4 one-month depot injections or 1 one-month depot injection
      and 1 three-month depot injection or 1 four-month depot injection) AND oral flutamide 3 times
      daily for 112 days OR oral bicalutamide once daily for 112 days.

      Within 4 weeks after completion of androgen suppression, patients are sequentially enrolled
      to 2 different cohorts of brachytherapy.

        -  Cohort 1: Patients undergo initial-dose transperineal interstitial permanent prostate
           brachytherapy with iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103.

        -  Cohort 2: After a minimum of 1-year follow-up for all patients in cohort 1, if tolerance
           is acceptable, additional patients undergo higher-dose transperineal interstitial
           permanent prostate brachytherapy with iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, within 2 weeks prior to brachytherapy, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 83-166 patients (83 per cohort) will be accrued for this study
      within 1.5-3 years.
