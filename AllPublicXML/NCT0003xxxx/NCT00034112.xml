  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is
      effective for persons with emphysema as a component of their chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease.

      OMT sessions are designed to improve chest wall compliance and diaphragmatic function which
      produce an immediate positive change in pulmonary function parameters and chest wall
      mobility. This research project will be a significant step in expanding the understanding of
      the role of OMT in the treatment of chronic lung disease. It is expected to yield evidence
      that OMT is an important adjunctive modality that improves pulmonary function, increases
      exercise tolerance, relieves dyspnea, and improves quality of life in those with COPD, and
      that would have widespread clinical application plus significant economic benefits.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either OMT or sham treatments
      once a week for 13 weeks. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline; immediately
      following the first treatment; at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiation of treatment; and 4
      weeks after termination of the treatment. Outcome variables include pulmonary function tests;
      quality-of-life questionnaires (including emotional functioning, fatigue, and dyspnea); and
      measurements of exercise tolerance and chest wall mobility.
