  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the study drug,
      Talampanel, when used to treat patients with involuntary movements known as dyskinesias, as a
      result of treatment to Parkinson's disease.

      It is not clear why people with Parkinson's disease develop involuntary movements
      (dyskinesias) but studies show that blocking receptors in the brain for a chemical called
      glutamate decreases these movements. Talampanel is a drug which blocks these receptors.
