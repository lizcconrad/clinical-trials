      RATIONALE: Some types of lymphoproliferative disease are associated with Epstein-Barr virus.
      Combining reduced immunosuppressive therapy with donor white blood cells that have been
      treated in the laboratory to kill cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus may be an effective
      treatment for lymphoproliferative disease.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of reducing
      immunosuppressive therapy with or without donor white blood cells in treating patients who
      have Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease after organ transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of treatment with partially HLA-matched allogeneic cytotoxic T
           cells and reduction of immunosuppression, in terms of survival rate and time to
           remission in patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative
           disease after solid organ transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      transplanted organ type and transplant center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo sliding-scale reduction of immunosuppressive drugs from 1 of 5
           regimens at physician's discretion. Patients then receive partially HLA-matched
           allogeneic cytotoxic T cells IV over 5 minutes once weekly for a total of 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo reduction of immunosuppression as in arm I alone. Patients are
           followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
