      The primary goal of this study is to determine if people with metastatic melanoma who receive
      Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex - 96 (HSPPC-96 or Oncophage) after surgery live longer
      than people who may or may not have surgery but who receive conventional chemotherapy
      including IL-2/DTIC. A second goal is to determine the safety and frequency of side effects
      in subjects who receive therapy with HSPPC-96.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine whether subjects with stage IV melanoma randomized to HSPPC-96 have longer
           survival than subjects randomized to physician's choice including interleukin-2 and/or
           dacarbazine/temozolomide and/or complete tumor resection.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To determine frequency of adverse events in subjects randomized to HSPPC-96.
