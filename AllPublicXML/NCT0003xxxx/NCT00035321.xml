      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  Whether olanzapine plus fluoxetine in combination will help patients with
           treatment-resistant major depression.

        -  The safety of olanzapine plus fluoxetine in combination, plus and any side effects that
           might be associated with the combination.

        -  The effectiveness of olanzapine plus fluoxetine compared to olanzapine and fluoxetine
           alone.
