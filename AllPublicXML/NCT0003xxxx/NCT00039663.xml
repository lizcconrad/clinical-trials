      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in altering the natural
      history of HIV infection in many patients. However, this therapy may not be sustainable
      because of the toxicities of the medications. Evidence suggests that HIV-infected patients on
      HAART may be at risk for premature coronary artery disease. The exact cause is unknown. It is
      possible that the medications directly affect the endothelium (the lining of the arteries
      that supply blood to the heart) and lead to premature heart disease. Or because the
      medications cause lipid abnormalities (high cholesterol) and a condition of relative insulin
      resistance, in which the body has a difficult time processing sugars; known risk factors for
      endothelial dysfunction and heart disease. Therapeutic intervention that reverses these lipid
      abnormalities and/or insulin resistance may lower these risk factors, normalize endothelial
      function, and decrease the risk of heart disease.

      This protocol aims to assess endothelial function among a group of HIV-infected patients with
      varying degrees of viral activity and levels of immune function on a variety of HAART
      regimens. It also aims to evaluate the effect of three different medications on lipids,
      insulin resistance, and thus endothelial function. Understanding the factors involved in
      causing endothelial dysfunction will help better characterize the relative risks and benefits
      of early versus late and continuous versus intermittent HAART therapy. The research may offer
      some insights into the causes of premature heart disease among HIV-infected patients on HAART
      that could be more thoroughly investigated in subsequent clinical trials.

      A total of 75 patients will be recruited: 25 for each arm of the study. Each arm evaluates
      the potential benefit of a particular medication and will enroll sequentially. An endothelial
      function test will be performed on an outpatient basis. The first 25 patients will be
      assigned at random to receive pravastatin sodium or placebo; the next 25 will receive
      gemfibrozil or placebo; the final 25 will receive rosiglitazone or placebo. Patients will
      take the pills for 6 weeks, no pills for the next 4 weeks, and then the opposite treatment
      for 6 more weeks. Two weeks after the start of the study drug, blood will be taken to check
      for potential toxic side effects. After each 6-week treatment, blood will be drawn and
      endothelial function tests will be performed.

      The natural history of HIV infection in many patients has been dramatically altered through
      the use of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, this treatment paradigm of
      chronic chemotherapy may not be sustainable given the short and long-term toxicities of these
      medications. Among the more concerning are the development of atherogenic lipoprotein
      abnormalities and a state of relative insulin resistance. Logically, there has been concern
      that such metabolic disturbances may predispose towards cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Although these therapies have only been in widespread use for a short period of
      time, a growing body of evidence from case reports and cohort studies has suggested that
      HIV-infected patients on HAART may experience premature coronary artery disease. The
      explanation of this phenomenon is most likely multifactorial. In terms of pathophysiology,
      the relative contributions of HIV viral replication, host immune response, and the use of
      antiretroviral agents remains unknown. HIV-1 could possibly have a direct effect on the
      endothelium as has been suggested for other infectious agents such as chlamydia, herpes
      simplex, and cytomegalovirus. One could postulate that the virus might have some capacity to
      effect the production of nitric oxide (NO), as a pathogenic mechanism. It is unknown whether
      the medications have direct toxicities or whether the common underlying mechanism is
      drug-induced abnormalities in lipid and/or glucose metabolism. Furthermore, intervention with
      therapeutics that reverse these metabolic disturbances might ameliorate these risk factors,
      normalize endothelial function, and thus decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease among
      this patient population. Even if such patients are at no higher risk than HIV-negative
      patients with similar metabolic profiles, attention must be paid to modifiable risk factors
      as patients are living longer. This protocol aims to assess endothelial function among a
      group of HIV-infected patients with varying degrees of virologic control and levels of immune
      function on a variety of different HAART regimens. These patients will then be administered
      medications with known effects on lipid and glucose metabolism to determine if they might
      serve a role in improving these parameters and thus endothelial function. The results of this
      study will hopefully yield effective strategies to maintain the efficacy of HAART therapy
      while minimizing or reversing toxicities. Understanding the factors important to causing
      endothelial dysfunction will help better characterize the relative risks/benefits of early
      vs. late and continuous vs. intermittent HAART therapy. Additionally, it will hopefully offer
      some insights as to the underlying pathophysiology of the phenomenon of premature
      cardiovascular disease among HIV-infected patients on HAART that could then be more
      thoroughly investigated in subsequent clinical trials. We may ultimately learn that either
      the virus or antiretroviral drugs or the consequent lipid and insulin abnormalities they
      induce alters NO function at the level of the endothelium.
