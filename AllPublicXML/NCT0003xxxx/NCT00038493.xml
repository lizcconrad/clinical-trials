      This study will combine the chemotherapy agent temozolomide with the investigational drug
      SCH66336 (an agent which interferes with new cell growth). Patients will be treated with oral
      temozolomide on days 1-5 and oral SCH66336 on days 8-28 every 28 days.

      Temozolomide at a dose of, 150-200 mg/m2, will be administered orally, after fasting for one
      hour, once a day for 5 consecutive days (days 1 through 5) every 4 weeks (plus up to 3 days).
      The starting dose level of 200 mg/m2 will be used for patients who have not previously
      received any chemotherapy or at 150 mg/m2 for patients who have received previous
      chemotherapy.

      SCH66336 will be given orally, with water, in the morning and in the evening for three weeks
      (Days 8 - 28) every 28 days (plus up to 3 days) 1 hour before or after morning and evening
      meals. Patients will take 150 mg in the morning and 150 mg in the evening.

      Treatment courses may be repeated every 28 days following the first daily dose of
      Temozolomide for the previous course.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          -  Patients with histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by
             MRI scan after radiation therapy. The scan done prior to study entry documenting
             progression will be reviewed by the primary investigator to document tumor volume
             changes to provide a gross assessment of growth rate.

          -  Patients may have had: a) no prior chemotherapy, b) 1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy, c)
             1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy followed by 1 regimen for recurrent disease, or d) 1 or
             2 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or progressive tumor.

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital.

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan.
             A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dose
             that has been stable for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the
             date of imaging and registration a new baseline MR/CT is required. The same type of
             scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for
             tumor measurement.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

               1. They have recovered from the effects of surgery.

               2. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
                  eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease
                  post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the
                  immediate post-operative period or at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14
                  days prior to registration. If the 96-hour scan is more than 14 days before
                  registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the steroid dose is increased
                  between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required
                  on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years old, and with life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (Karnofsky Performance
             Scale; Appendix C).

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from
             prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks from vincristine, 6 weeks from
             nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for non-cytotoxic
             agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.
             (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the definition of
             non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC&gt; 1,500/mm3 and platelet count of
             &gt; 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function (SGPT and alkaline phosphatase &lt;2 times
             normal, bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg%), and adequate renal function (BUN and creatinine &lt;1.5
             times institutional normal) prior to starting therapy.

          -  Patients must have a normal QT interval on an EKG done within 2 weeks prior to study
             entry.

          -  Patients must not be taking primidone, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin
             anticonvulsants. Patients changing from these anticonvulsants to others that are
             allowed must be off the drugs listed above for at least 72 hours.

          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.

          -  Patients must not have:

               1. active infection

               2. disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism

               3. serious intercurrent medical illness.

               4. prior recurrence with either Temozolomide or a farnesyl transferase inhibitor

               5. oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods (Depo-Provera) of birth control.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant and both male and female patients must practice adequate
             contraception.

        Exclusion:

          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.

          -  Patients with the following are ineligible:

               1. active infection

               2. pregnancy and must practice adequate contraception

               3. disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism

               4. serious intercurrent medical illness

               5. previous treatment with either Temozolomide or a farnesyl transferase inhibitor

               6. oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods (Depo-Provera) of birth control.
