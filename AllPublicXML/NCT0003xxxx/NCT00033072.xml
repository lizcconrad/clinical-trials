      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential interactions between intravenous
      methamphetamine and oral selegiline.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of the selegiline concurrent with d-methamphetamine challenges of
      15mg &amp; 30mg i.v. with the focus being on cardiovascular responses (HR,BP) to the i.v.
      methamphetamine challenges. This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm
      study design to evaluate the safety of selegiline treatment, compared to placebo treatment,
      concurrent with i.v. methamphetamine challenges.
