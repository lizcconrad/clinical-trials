    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the ingestion of the herbal dietary
      supplement Ginkgo biloba extract has any effect on the efficacy of three classes of diabetic
      medications - (Glucotrol, Glucophage and Actose). Additionally, the study will examine the
      effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on pancreatic insulin production in non-diabetic subjects
      between the ages of 20 and 75 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herbal remedy is popular among those with chronic diseases, who may already be taking several
      prescription medications, thereby increasing the risk of drug-herb interactions. Ginkgo
      biloba extract is a popular dietary supplement that is ingested by the general population to
      enhance mental focus and by the elderly to delay onset of age-acquired loss of cognitive
      function. In subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), ingestion of Ginkgo biloba
      may decrease efficacy of the hypoglycemic agents and increase whole body insulin resistance.
      Because aging is a significant risk factor for the development of NIDDM as a result of a
      progressive decline in pancreatic function, and because the elderly chronically take multiple
      prescription medications, the increased use of Ginkgo biloba in this population may increase
      drug-herb interactions. Therefore, we shall examine the effect of Ginkgo biloba on the
      pancreatic function in the elderly to determine whether it may produce pancreatic dysfunction
      and a potential for the development of insulinopenia. The results of this study should
      provide valuable information for designing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of
      diseases in the insulin resistance syndrome.
