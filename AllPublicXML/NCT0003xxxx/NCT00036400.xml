  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of epoetin alfa on the
      reduction in red blood cell transfusions needed in gastric cancer patients and rectal cancer
      patients undergoing a treatment plan of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy,
      followed by surgery.

    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often experience anemia due to the disease itself, chemotherapy, or both.
      Quality of life is also affected, in part because of the fatigue associated with anemia.
      Previous studies with epoetin alfa have suggested that achieving a higher hemoglobin level
      may improve quality of life and help patients live longer. The primary objective of the study
      is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of epoetin alfa on the reduction in red blood
      cell transfusions needed in gastric and rectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiation), followed by surgery. The purpose of this
      study is to assess the effectiveness of 40,000 to 60,000 Units of epoetin alfa or matching
      placebo injected under the skin once weekly for up to 16 weeks (starting 1 week before
      chemoradiation and extending up to 4 weeks after surgery) in reducing red blood cell
      transfusions during the 16-week period. Other effectiveness measures include the ability of
      epoetin alfa to maintain baseline hemoglobin levels during the chemoradiation and its effect
      on quality of life and tumor response during the study period. The safety of epoetin alfa
      will be assessed by incidence and severity of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      physical examinations, and vital signs. The hypothesis of the study is that epoetin alfa is
      superior to placebo in reducing the number of transfusions, preventing anemia and improving
      quality of life during chemoradiation, surgery, and immediately after surgery. 40,000 to
      60,000 Units of epoetin alfa or placebo injected under the skin once weekly for up to 16
      weeks. First 4 weeks the dose is 40,000 Units; increased to 60,000 Units weekly starting at
      week 4 of chemoradiation if hemoglobin decreases by &gt;=1 g/dL and/or is &lt;=13 g/dL after 4
      weeks of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer or rectal cancer for whom
             the treatment plan is preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by
             surgery

          -  have a life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  have a baseline hemoglobin value of &gt;= 10 g/dL and &lt; 15 g/dL and adequate hematologic
             function

          -  have adequate liver and kidney function

          -  if female, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or practicing an effective
             method of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rectal cancer patients who have received chemotherapy or gastric cancer patients who
             have received more than two cycles of chemotherapy

          -  anemia due to factors other than cancer or chemotherapy (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or
             folate deficiencies, hemolysis or gastrointestinal bleeding)

          -  history of any other major medical condition or uncontrolled disease

          -  had a transfusion of white blood cells or packed red blood cells within one month

             months of study entry

          -  have received prior treatment with epoetin alfa or any investigational forms of
             erythropoietin within the previous six months.
