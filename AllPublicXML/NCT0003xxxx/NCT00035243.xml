  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the investigational drug EPO906, given by intravenous
      infusion (IV directly into the vein), is effective in shrinking tumors and preventing the
      growth of cells that cause kidney cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following patients may be eligible for this study:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented evidence of epithelial renal cell carcinoma
             with at least one measurable lesion (if previous radiation treatment, the target
             lesion must have demonstrated progression since the radiation)

          -  Patients must have had a prior nephrectomy

          -  Must have a life expectancy of greater than three (3) months

          -  Patients who have had 0-1 prior cytokine treatment regimen (i.e. IL-2, IFN-?) or
             relapsed less than one year after such treatment may be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following patients are not eligible for this study:

          -  Patients who have received more than one (1) prior cytokine regimen (i.e. IL-2, IFN?)
             or relapsed more than one year after receiving such treatment are not eligible

          -  Patients who have had any prior chemotherapy (including a combination therapy)

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement

          -  Patients with any peripheral neuropathy or unresolved diarrhea greater than Grade 1

          -  Patients with severe cardiac insufficiency

          -  Patients taking Coumadin or other warfarin-containing agents with the exception of low
             dose Coumadin (1 mg or less) for the maintenance of in-dwelling lines or ports

          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years prior to study entry except curatively
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer, or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Patients with active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection including
             abcesses or fistulae

          -  HIV+ patients

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.
