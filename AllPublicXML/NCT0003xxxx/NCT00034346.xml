  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been observed in
      kidney, prostate, colon, lung, breast, and other cancers, and is often associated with a poor
      prognosis. TGFa and EGF, the ligands for EGFR, are also overexpressed in some of these tumor
      types, suggesting a self-propagating stimulus that may be responsible for rapid tumor growth.
      Blocking this stimulus by blocking activation of EGFR with ABX-EGF, a fully human monoclonal
      antibody against EGFR, may prevent tumor growth and perhaps shrink tumors. Purpose: This is a
      Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABX-EGF in combination with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

        For complete inclusion and exclusion criteria, please refer to the investigator. Inclusion
        Criteria: - 18 years of age or older. - Pathological diagnosis of NSCLC. - Bidimensionally
        measurable disease. - Tumor tissue available for immunohistochemistry studies. - Tumor
        over-expressing EGFR as ascertained by immunohistochemistry. - Disease stage IIIB with

        Adequate hematology function - Adequate renal function - Adequate hepatic function - ECOG
        score of less than 2. - Brain metastases, if present; must be controlled and asymptomatic.
        Exclusion Criteria: - Calcium &gt; ULN (treatment for hypercalcemia allowed). - Use of any
        investigational therapy within 30 days of ABX-EGF infusion. - Any cancer therapy for NSCLC
        other than radiation therapy, surgery, or steroids. - Radiation therapy within 2 weeks
        before ABX-EGF infusion. - LVEF less than 45% as measured by MUGA. - Symptomatic
        ventricular arrhythmia or symptomatic conduction abnormality. - Myocardial infarction
        within 1 year before first dose of study drug. - History of cancer that has required
        treatment or been active within past 5 years, other than NSCLC, basal cell carcinoma, or
        cervical carcinoma in situ. - Women (e.g., of childbearing potential, who are
        post-menopausal for less than six months, not surgically sterilized or not abstinent) who
        are not willing to use an oral or implanted contraceptive, double barrier birth control, or
        an IUD during the course of the study and for 6 months following treatment. - Men not
        willing to use contraception upon enrollment into this study and for 1 month following
        treatment. - Women who are breast-feeding or have a positive pregnancy test within 72 hours
        of first study drug administration. - Known to be HIV positive. - Any patient who's best
        medical interests would not be met by entry in the study in the opinion of the
        Investigators.
