      This study will investigate the use of Reiki, an energy-based complementary and alternative
      medicine (CAM) intervention, as an approach to improve well-being for patients with advanced
      AIDS, and evaluate its effects on dimensions of well-being and quality of life.

      This study will investigate the use of Reiki, an energy-based complementary and alternative
      medicine (CAM) intervention, as an approach to improve well being for patients with advanced
      AIDS, and evaluate its effects on dimensions of well being and quality of life. The study is
      a two-group comparison between participants receiving Reiki plus usual medical care
      (treatment) and participants receiving usual medical care only (control).

      One hundred and forty-six patients with advanced AIDS will be enrolled and randomized into
      the two groups. Patients in the intervention (Reiki) group will receive a total of three
      one-hour Reiki sessions over a period of 6 weeks. Participants in both the intervention and
      control groups will be assessed at two times during the study period using repeated measures.
      We will investigate and compare changes in participants' anxiety, depression, pain, quality
      of life, and spiritual well being at the end of the intervention period. This is the first
      part of a longer-term research agenda to examine the use and effectiveness of complementary
      and alternative medicines for patients with advanced disease. We plan to examine one clinical
      context in which Reiki is currently provided. It is important to design studies that respect
      both the context of care and the practitioner-client relationship-elements essential to an
      understanding of the philosophy and delivery of CAM such as Reiki, and at the same time
      endeavor to outline a systematic approach to the study of CAM.
