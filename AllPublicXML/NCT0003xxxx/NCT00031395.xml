      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of clonidine alone or in
      combination with methylphenidate for children 7-12 years of age with attention-deficit,
      hyperactivity disorder.

      This trial will compare the benefits and side effects of two medications-clonidine and
      methylphenidate (MPH)-used alone or in combination to treat ADHD in children. MPH is
      FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children, and clonidine is FDA-approved
      for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Stimulant medications such as MPH are known to
      be safe and effective for the treatment of many ADHD symptoms. Such medicines, however, do
      not cure the condition or improve all of the symptoms of ADHD, and the long-term
      effectiveness of these medications is not well-known. In this study the participants will be
      randomly selected to receive one of four treatments: 1.) clonidine; 2.) MPH; 3.) clonidine
      and MPH; or 4.) a placebo (which is not an active medication, but a substance that is thought
      to have no biological effect). The time participation in the study is 16 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 7 through 12 in school.

          -  All subjects must meet DSM IV criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD of any subtype [21].

          -  Each subject must also satisfy the following criteria regarding the severity of ADHD
             symptoms: 1. ADHD must be viewed as clinically significant and worthy of treatment by
             medications as judged by the parent and the site investigator. Operationally,
             medication treatment will be considered indicated for any subject who has ADHD
             symptoms that significantly interfere with academic or social functioning and that
             have not improved (or are not expected to improve) sufficiently with
             non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., modifying the classroom environment,
             tutoring). 2. The site investigator's rating of global functioning on the C-GAS must
             yield a score of 70 or below. Scores below 70 on the C-GAS are designated as
             indicating abnormal function [22]. The score of 70 corresponds to the anchor point
             description: &quot;Some difficulty in a single area, but generally functioning pretty
             well.&quot;

          -  Screen of Intelligence using the vocabulary and block design subtests of the Wechsler
             Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition indicates an estimated I.Q &gt; 70.

          -  Informed consent/assent signed. We will not enroll any child who does not want to
             participate.

          -  The designated school for each subject agrees to participate in the study by
             completing all required questionnaires and following all specified procedures.

          -  The child must be able to swallow the tablets and capsules used in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with tic disorder of any type or tic symptoms, a primary diagnosis of major
             depression, pervasive developmental disorder, autism, any psychotic disorder, and
             mental retardation (based on current DSM criteria) will be excluded. We will not
             exclude subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder or
             conduct disorder.

          -  The presence of a known medical condition that would preclude the use of MPH or
             clonidine.

          -  Known pregnancy. A urinary pregnancy test will be performed for all menstruating
             female subjects. Female subjects of child bearing potential will be advised not to
             become pregnant. In this circumstance, study medication will be tapered and
             discontinued and the subject will be terminated from the study. A urinary pregnancy
             test will be repeated at the end of the study. Subjects who request information
             regarding possible birth control mechanisms will be referred to their primary care
             physicians.

          -  Known presence of impaired renal function. A routine urinalysis will be performed for
             each subject to exclude signs of renal failure.

          -  Known active cardiovascular disease/anomaly, which would be a contraindication for the
             use of MPH or clonidine.

          -  Subjects may not receive any other medication for the treatment of ADHD. Treatment
             with MPH or other stimulants must be discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment and treatment with other medications to treat ADHD (e.g., antidepressants,
             clonidine) must be discontinued for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects may not receive any other psychotropic medication (e.g., serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors), anxiolytics (e.g., clonazepam) or hypnotics. Any such medication must be
             discontinued at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Previous use of MPH or clonidine will be permitted.
