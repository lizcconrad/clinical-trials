      BACKGROUND:

      The VA HDL Intervention trial (VA-HIT) was a multicenter, placebo controlled, randomized
      trial that showed that gemfibrozil significantly reduced major cardiovascular events in 2531
      men with coronary heart disease, low levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and
      low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In addition to its unique lipid
      profile, the VA-HIT population also had a high prevalence of diabetes, impaired fasting
      glucose, or high fasting plasma insulin; central obesity; and hypertension, which are all
      components (together with high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) of a constellation of
      risk factors known as the metabolic syndrome. Since prior clinical trials have not enrolled
      this type of population, the VA- HIT database is a unique resource.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study used the VA-HIT database to study additional risk markers that were measured in the
      study population of 2,531 men with coronary heart disease. Specific analyses were: 1) the
      association between levels of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and other features of the
      metabolic syndrome, occurrence of major cardiovascular outcomes, and gemfibrozil efficacy; 2)
      the effect of gemfibrozil on progression of carotid atherosclerosis, as measured by B-mode
      ultrasound; 3) the association between LDL particle size distribution and lipoprotein
      subclass distribution; homocysteine; lipoprotein(a); C-reactive protein, tissue plasminogen
      activator; fibrinogen; and factor VII; major cardiovascular outcomes and gemfibrozil
      efficacy.
