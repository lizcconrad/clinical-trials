      The purpose of the study is to evaluate an intravenous (by injection) investigational
      medication to treat severe ulcerative colitis refractory to steroid therapy. The research is
      being conducted at up to 8 clinical research sites in the US and is open to both men and
      women ages 18 to 70 years old. Participants in the study will have a number of visits to a
      research site. All study-related care and medication is provided to qualified participants at
      no cost: this includes all visits, examinations and laboratory work.

      A Phase I, dose-escalation, pilot study designed to obtain safety and tolerability data on
      visilizumab administered to patients with severe ulcerative colitis that has failed to
      respond to steroid therapy. Patients who are currently receiving IV corticosteroids, but
      whose disease has not responded after at least 5 days of this therapy, will be eligible for
      the study.
