      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta-glucan use different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor
      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Combining beta-glucan and monoclonal antibody may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining beta-glucan and monoclonal
      antibody in treating patients who have metastatic neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of beta-glucan and monoclonal antibody 3F8 in
           patients with metastatic neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the biological effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral beta-glucan and monoclonal antibody 3F8 (MOAB 3F8) IV within 1.5 hours
      on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of beta-glucan and MOAB 3F8 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3-6
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
