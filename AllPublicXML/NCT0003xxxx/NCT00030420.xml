    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may slow the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib and docetaxel in
      treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer that has been previously
      treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy and feasibility of celecoxib combined with docetaxel in patients
           with advanced non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-based
           chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily (beginning on day -7 of the first course) and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses after CR. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) or a partial response
      (PR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses after SD or PR. At the discretion of the
      treating physician, patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising celecoxib only.

      Patients who discontinue therapy for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are
      followed for at least 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-28
      months.
