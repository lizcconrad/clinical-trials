      RATIONALE: Medroxyprogesterone and venlafaxine may be effective in relieving hot flashes. It
      is not yet known whether venlafaxine is more effective than medroxyprogesterone in relieving
      hot flashes.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone with
      that of venlafaxine in treating women who are experiencing hot flashes.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of medroxyprogesterone administered as 1 injection vs
           medroxyprogesterone administered as 3 injections (closed to accrual as of 1/22/03) vs
           venlafaxine for hot flash alleviation in women with symptomatic hot flashes.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine whether there is cross resistance between these 2 drugs in these patients.

        -  Compare the 1-year efficacy of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to age (18 to 49 vs 50 and over), current tamoxifen use (yes vs no), current
      raloxifene use (yes vs no), duration of hot flash symptoms (less than 9 months vs 9 months or
      more), and average frequency of hot flashes per day (2-3 vs 4-9 vs 10 or more). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. (Arm II closed to accrual as of 1/22/03.)

      All patients complete a daily questionnaire regarding number of hot flashes beginning on day
      1 and continuing for 7 weeks. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms.

    <description>All patients complete a daily questionnaire regarding number of hot flashes beginning on day 1 and continuing for 7 weeks. Patients receive oral venlafaxine once daily for 6 weeks beginning on day 8. After week 7, patients with satisfactory efficacy may continue venlafaxine for up to 6 months. Patients with unsatisfactory efficacy may cross over to arm III.
Patients are followed at months 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12.</description>
