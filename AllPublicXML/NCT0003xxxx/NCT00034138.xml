      The study will compare the pharmacokinetic profile of OvaRex MAb-B43.13 ascites fluid product
      and OvaRex MAb-B43.13 cell culture product. Safety and immune responses following treatment
      with the cell culture product will be evaluated.

      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel group, Phase 1/2 study in female
      patients with Stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer. The study will compare the
      pharmacokinetic profile of OvaRex MAb-B43.13 ascites fluid product and OvaRex MAb-B43.13 cell
      culture product. The study will also evaluate the safety of the cell culture product and the
      immune responses in patients following treatment. The study is being conducted in three
      phases:

        1. The pharmacokinetic assessment phase will include at least 24 patients, who will be
           randomized into two treatment groups to receive a single 2 mg dose of either ascites
           fluid product or cell culture product.

        2. The treatment phase will continue administration of two more monthly doses (weeks 4 and
           8) and all patients will receive cell culture product. Study patients will be followed
           for safety and immune response through week 20.

        3. The continuation phase will continue administration of cell culture product at the
           discretion of the investigator on a quarterly schedule for up to 104 weeks in eligible
           patients who tolerate therapy. Patients who continue treatment will be followed for
           serious adverse events and all patients will be followed for survival for up to 2 years
           after first treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of epithelial adenocarcinoma of ovarian, tubal or peritoneal
             origin.

          -  FIGO Stage III or IV prior to study.

          -  Serum CA125 level &gt;35 U/mL prior to or at initial surgery. Alternatively, serum CA125
             level &gt; or = 100 U/mL following surgery or immunohistochemical evidence of tumor
             tissue expressing CA125.

          -  Completed primary treatment following initial diagnosis, including chemotherapy
             involving a cisplatin or carboplatin-based regimen.

          -  Functional Performance Status &lt; or = 2 by ECOG scale.

          -  Medical assessment consistent with prognosis for an expected survival of at least 3
             months.

          -  Voluntary participation, signed informed consent and willingness to complete all study
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No surgery (not including minor surgical procedures), chemotherapy, or radiotherapy
             (whole abdomen, abdominopelvic or pelvic) within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study
             drug.

          -  No known refractory or recurrent disease requiring chemotherapy during the 4 weeks
             prior to, or planned 10 weeks after first study dose.

          -  Serum CA125 levels not &gt;800 U/mL at baseline evaluation.

          -  No gross (clinically evident) ascites.

          -  No immunotherapy (interferons, tumor necrosis factor, other cytokines or biological
             response modifiers, or BCG vaccines) within the previous 4 weeks of first study dose.

          -  No previous treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic
             purposes or serum human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA) not above upper limit of normal
             at baseline evaluation.

          -  Not on long-term chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin,
             ACTH, or corticosteroids.

          -  Ovarian tumors must be of low malignant potential or with noninvasive disease.

          -  No concurrent malignancy (except non-melanoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of
             cervix), unless curative treatment was received and patient has been disease-free for
             &gt; or = 5 years.
