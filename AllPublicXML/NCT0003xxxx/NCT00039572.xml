      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy such as boron neutron capture therapy may kill tumor cells
      without harming normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of boron neutron capture therapy in
      treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme or melanoma metastatic to the brain.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the time course, uniformity, and severity of acute and chronic normal tissue
           reactions in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or intracranial melanoma treated with
           boronophenylalanine-fructose complex (BPA-f) followed by cranial neutron irradiation
           using a new fission converter beam facility.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cranial neutron capture therapy in these
           patients.

        -  Determine, through serial objective measurements, the clinical response in patients
           treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of BPA-f in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cranial neutron capture therapy (NCT).

      Patients receive boronophenylalanine-fructose complex IV over 90 minutes followed by cranial
      NCT on days 1 and 2.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NCT until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
