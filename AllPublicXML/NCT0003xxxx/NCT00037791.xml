  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive chemotherapy is associated with significant thrombocytopenia, often requiring
      platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts. This investigational drug has demonstrated
      the ability to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of this
      investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with solid tumors,
      lymphomas or multiple myeloma who are receiving myelosuppressive treatment regimens requiring
      platelet transfusion support.
