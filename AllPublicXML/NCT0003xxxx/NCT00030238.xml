    <textblock>
      This study will examine the health effects of calcium supplements in overweight adults.
      Overweight adults often eat a diet low in calcium. Some studies have found low calcium intake
      in people who have some of the medical problems often seen in overweight adults. This study
      will see if extra calcium improves the health of overweight adults.

      Volunteers in general good health 18 years of age or older who are overweight (body mass
      index equal to or greater than 25 kilograms per square meter of body surface) may be eligible
      for this study. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not participate. The study
      includes four visits, described below.

      Visit 1

      Volunteers will be screened for participation in the study with a medical history, physical
      examination, and blood and urine tests. At home, they will collect a 24-hour urine sample;
      fill out questionnaires to assess their average calcium intake; and record their food intake
      for 7 days. Those enrolled in the study will continue with the next 3 visits.

      Visit 2

      Participants will complete a physical activity questionnaire, have their food diary reviewed,
      and meet with a dietitian for nutritional counseling. Triceps fold thickness and waist and
      hip circumferences will be measured three times. Body composition will be analyzed by a DEXA
      study. For this procedure, the subject lies on a flat table while a small dose of X-rays is
      passed through the body.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to take either calcium carbonate (1500 mg/day) or
      placebo capsules twice a day by mouth for 2 years. (The placebo looks like the calcium
      capsules but contains no calcium.) They will receive a 6-month supply of study capsules
      during visit 2 and return to NIH every 6 months for the next supply. They will also be sent
      questionnaires by mail every 3 months to complete information about health problems and how
      often the study capsules are being taken.

      Visits 3 and 4

      Visit 3 is scheduled after participants have taken the study capsules for 1 year; visit 4 is
      scheduled after 2 years (the end of the study). At each of these visits, participants will
      have a DEXA scan, blood and urine tests, blood pressure measurements, and measurements of
      height, weight, waist and hip circumference. They will complete questionnaires about their
      medical history, side effects of the study medications, dietary calcium intake, and physical
      activity, and they will meet with one of the study investigators to talk about any concerns
      regarding the study. At the fourth visit, participants will answer some additional questions
      about their study participation and return the Diet History Questionnaire that was mailed to
      them before the visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 97 million people in the United States are overweight or obese, and therefore
      have an increased risk for a number of other obesity-related co-morbid conditions (such as
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and Type 2 Diabetes) as well as for all-cause mortality. The
      total cost attributable to obesity amounted to $99.2 billion in the US in 1995 and this
      figure, like the prevalence of increased body mass, is rising at an alarming rate. At the
      same time calcium intake in the US adult population is far below the RDA (recommended daily
      allowance) and much below the daily optimal calcium intake recommended by the 1994 NIH
      consensus conference. An analysis of the NHANES III database suggests a strong inverse
      association between relative risk of obesity and calcium intake. Further, both prospective
      studies in animal models, and retrospective analyses of human studies suggest calcium
      supplementation may play a role in minimizing yearly weight gain, and may possibly induce
      small weight losses.

      In order to test the relationship between calcium intake and body weight, we propose to
      conduct a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of calcium
      supplementation (1500 mg/day of supplementary calcium vs. placebo) in adults with a BMI
      greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2). We will study the effects of supplemental calcium on
      body weight, body composition, and obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as insulin
      sensitivity and lipids. The effects of such supplementation on blood pressure will also be
      systematically evaluated. A control group of untreated, healthy, adults will also be enrolled
      for comparisons to study subjects.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: (Overweight Subjects)

        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:

          1. Good general health. Individuals taking medication for obesity-related co-morbid
             conditions will not be excluded.

          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          3. Body Mass Index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2).

          4. For women with childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at the initial
             evaluation.

          5. Normal fasting serum Ca (2.05-2.55 mmol/L) and serum phosphorous levels (2.3 - 4.3
             mg/dl).

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: (Normal Weight Subjects)

        Volunteers will qualify if the meet the following criteria

          1. Good general health.

          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          3. Body Mass Index 1-24.99 kg/m(2)

          4. For women with childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at the initial
             evaluation. Since these subjects have to undergo DXA (dual Energy X-ray
             Absorptiometry) scan screening in their second visit, for safety purposes, pregnant
             women will be excluded from participation in the study.

          5. Normal fasting serum Ca (2.05-2.55 mmol/L) and serum phosphorus levels (2.3-4.3
             mg/dl).

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA: (overweight subjects)

             Volunteers will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as
             needed) for the following reasons:

               1. A presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic (other than obesity-related
                  steatosis), gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper-

                  asthma not requiring continuous medication or sleep-apnea related disorders);

               2. Women who are pregnant, or who are currently nursing an infant; or who are having
                  unprotected intercourse;

                  condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence or
                  compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study;

               4. Subjects who regularly use prescription medications unrelated to the
                  complications of obesity {e.g., calcium channel blockers, diuretics (including
                  thiazide diuretics), beta-blockers etc}. Oral contraceptive use will be
                  permitted, provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two months

                  (AST/ALT greater than 3 times upper limit of normal range used in Clinical Center
                  assays), gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g. Cushing syndrome, hyper- or
