    <textblock>
      SCH66336 is a drug that has been designed to block the growth of tumor cells and encourage
      tumor cell death.

      This is a randomized study where patients will receive study drug or no drug. Participants in
      this study are scheduled to have surgery to remove head and neck cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically-confirmed stage II, III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
             neck.

          -  Patient's tumor is fully resectable and does not require radiotherapy to the entire
             buccal mucosa or patients who are to be treated with definitive radiation therapy as
             long as adequate (&gt;2cm^3) of tissue can be obtained post-therapy with SCH66336.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of &lt;/= 2

          -  Laboratory values (performed within 14 days prior to administration of SCH 66336):

               1. White blood cell count greater than 3.0 x 10^9/L

               2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 150 x 10^9/L

               3. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 gm/dL (100 gm/L). Patients may have
                  received transfusions and/or erythropoietin to attain this value. However, they
                  must have been stable without treatment for at least one week in order to be
                  eligible.

               4. Serum creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

               5. Total bilirubin less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

               6. SGOT or SGPT (only one of these tests needs to be performed) less than or equal
                  to 5.0 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (female patients of childbearing potential only), after
             signing informed consent and prior to registration.

          -  Patients may have received prior investigational therapy but at least 4 weeks must
             have elapsed with recovery from all toxicities.

          -  No more than two prior chemotherapy regimens for systemic disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are poor medical risks because of non-malignant systemic disease, as well
             as those with active uncontrolled infection.

          -  Uncontrolled heart disease (symptomatic ischemic heart disease or congestive heart
             failure, or either of these conditions with a variable medication requirement).

          -  Patients with QTc prolongation at baseline.

          -  Intractable vomiting (e.g., CTC Grade 2 or higher despite antiemetic medication) or
             any medical condition which could interfere with taking oral medication and
             gastrointestinal absorption.

          -  Patient has received prior induction chemotherapy.

          -  Patient exhibits confusion, disorientation, or has a history of major psychiatric
             illness which may impair patient's understanding of the informed consent.

          -  Prior therapy with a FPT inhibitor.

          -  Patient's life expectancy is less than 6 months.

          -  Patient has grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity from previous anticancer treatment or
             significant neuropathy from any cause.

          -  Patient requires total parenteral nutrition with lipids.

          -  Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapy, or surgery within four weeks prior
             to administration of SCH 66336. Nitrosourea or mitomycin C administration within 6
             weeks of SCH 66336.

          -  Lack of resolution of all toxic manifestations of prior chemotherapy, biologic or
             radiation therapy.

          -  Radiation therapy to greater than 30% of bone marrow as defined in Appendix D. (Whole
             pelvic radiation alone is not exclusionary.)

          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Men or women of childbearing potential who are not using an effective method of
             contraception. Use of oral contraception or other hormonal modalities by the patient
             is not permitted.
