  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to explore how well the combination of LY231514 and Gemcitabine work together
      in patients with breast cancer that has spread beyond the location of the original tumor.
      Patients must have previously received treatment with anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy
      drugs.

      Gemcitabine is given by vein over 30 minutes on days 1 &amp; 8 of each 21-day cycle. LY231514 is
      also given by vein over 10 minutes on day 8, following the Gemcitabine injection. Vitamin
      supplementation with oral folic acid and injectable B12 is initiated 7-10 days prior to the
      first dose of LY231514, and continuing throughout the patient's participation. Vitamin B12 is
      administered approximately every 9 weeks after the first injection. Appropriate antiemetic
      medication should be given to all patients. Dexamethasone 4mg PO twice daily is given for 3
      days per cycle, beginning 1 day prior to LY231514 dosing. This is given to prevent or lessen
      the possibility of a rash.
