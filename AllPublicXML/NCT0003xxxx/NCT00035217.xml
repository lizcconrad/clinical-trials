  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is controversy concerning the preferred treatment for men with localized prostate
      cancer with regard to the relative effectiveness of different treatments in controlling the
      cancer and how different treatments affect the patient's quality of life. The purpose of this
      research is to describe the disease course of prostate cancer and to determine the
      effectiveness, potential complications, and quality of life after different treatments in men
      with prostate cancer detected via screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or
      digital rectal examination
