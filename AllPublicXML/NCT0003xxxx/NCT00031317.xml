      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of the drug combination
      paroxetine and clonazepam in treating people with panic disorder (PD) and major depression.

      The main goal in treating people with PD is to rapidly reduce symptom severity and improve
      functioning. While numerous drug therapies have been used to treat PD, these treatments are
      limited by variable response rates and suboptimal side effect profiles. Evidence suggests
      that clonazepam given with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) can facilitate a
      rapid reduction in PD symptoms. However, it is unclear whether comorbid depression influences
      treatment response to the clonazepam and SSRI regimen. This study will examine whether
      combined treatment with clonazepam and the SSRI paroxetine will accelerate clinical response
      in participants with PD and comorbid depression. This study will also examine whether the
      benefits of treatment will be sustained until the end of the study despite tapering of
      clonazepam at the midpoint of the study.

      Participants in this study will be screened with medical and psychiatric interviews, a
      physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. Participants will then be
      randomly assigned to receive either paroxetine plus clonazepam or paroxetine plus placebo (an
      inactive pill) for 12 weeks. Participants will have weekly clinic visits during which
      symptoms and drug side effects will be checked and an interview to evaluate panic disorder
      and depression symptoms will be conducted.

      The main goal of treatment in patients with Panic Disorder (PD) is to effect a rapid
      reduction in symptom severity and improve functioning. While numerous pharmacological
      approaches have been used to treat PD, these treatments are limited by variable response
      rates, up to a 6-week lag period prior to the onset of clinical response, and sub-optimal
      side effect profile, including possible worsening of anxiety and insomnia.

      There is recent evidence that the benzodiazepine clonazepam prescribed with selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can facilitate a rapid reduction of symptoms in PD. The
      improvement in symptoms was maintained despite tapering the clonazepam prior to the end of
      the study. However, it was unclear if co-morbid depression influenced the treatment response
      to this regimen. In addition, a recent study in patients with major depression demonstrated
      that combined fluoxetine-clonazepam treatment resulted in a more rapid antidepressant
      response than the fluoxetine-placebo combination.

      The proposed study will examine whether combined treatment with a clonazepam and paroxetine
      in patients with PD and comorbid depression will accelerate the onset of clinical response at
      both panic and depression symptoms. PD with comorbid major depression is a more severe
      disorder than PD alone. We will also examine whether the rapid and clinically meaningful
      benefits will be sustained until the end of the study, despite tapering off clonazepam at the
      midpoint of the study. If this study turns out to be the case combined SSRI-benzodiazepine
      treatment may become a standard initial therapeutic approach to PD and comorbid major
      depression.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with a primary diagnosis of Panic Disorder without Agoraphobia or Panic Disorder
        with Agoraphobia according to DSM-IV criteria, and co-morbid major depressive disorder are
        eligible. Patients are required to have a weekly panic attack frequency of greater than or
        equal to 1/ week in the month prior to intake or a CGI score greater than 4 in the week
        prior to randomization. Patients with co-morbid major depressive disorder will be included
        provided that the onset of PD was earlier than the onset of the depressive disorder. The
        presence of co-morbid depression will be determined by using DSM-IV criteria for major
        depressive disorder, and HDRS scores will be in the moderately-to-severely depressed range
        (greater than 15).

        Subjects will be at least 18 years old. Those above age 65 years must be able to tolerate
        paroxetine starting dose of at least 20 mg daily and be without hepatic or renal
        impairment.

        Male and female subjects will be included.

        The patient must have given written informed consent prior to any study procedures.

        In addition, eligible patients must be in good physical health as confirmed by a complete
        physical exam (including normal vital signs), electrocardiogram, neurological exam, and
        routine laboratory tests of blood and urine.

        Patients will be drug free for at least 7 days when starting with the study medication. We
        will study both, untreated, symptomatic patients, and patients who did not respond to their
        pervious psychopharmacological treatment. The unsuccessful medication will be tapered off,
        and a medication-free period of 7 days will be established.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with any serious or unstable medical disorder or condition that would preclude the
        administration of paroxetine or clonazepam (e.g. epilepsy, severe head injury, meningitis,
        allergic to either drug).

        Patients who would be unable to comply with study procedures or assessments.

        Patients who meet DSM-IV lifetime criteria for benzodiazepine abuse or dependence.

        Patients who are on other psychotropic drugs must have discontinued them for at least 1
        week prior to randomization. Patients are ineligible who experience any current signs of
        symptoms of drug withdrawal during taper of unsuccessful medication.

        Patients who are currently at high risk for homicide or suicide.

        Patients who had previously failed an adequate trial of paroxetine or clonazepam.

        Women of childbearing potential who are not practicing a clinically accepted method of
        contraception or who have a positive pregnancy test or who are lactating.

        Patients who are currently treated with fluoxetine.
