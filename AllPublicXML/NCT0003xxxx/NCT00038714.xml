  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP) causes wart-like lesions along the throat area and
      can obstruct the airway or become malignant. The cause has been related to specific types of
      Human Papillomavirus (HPV). The purpose of the study is to assess the clinical effectiveness
      of a trial drug, SGN-00101, in children with RRP and also assess its safety.
