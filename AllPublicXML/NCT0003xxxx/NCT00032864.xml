      A Seattle VA study indicated lower extremity ulcers preceded 84% of diabetic amputations.
      Nearly half of the events that ban the causal chain leading to ulcers and amputation were
      initiated by ill-fitting footwear. Other investigators report similar findings for injurious
      footwear in their diabetic patient populations. Yet, the efficacy of footwear in preventing
      ulcers and amputations in the high-risk diabetic population has received limited experimental
      investigation. A British descriptive study followed diabetic patients with healed foot ulcers
      for two years and found reulceration occurred in 72% of patients who resume wearing their own
      footwear compared to 26% of patients who continued wearing &quot;prescribed&quot; footwear. A Swedish
      cohort study identified individuals with a foot ulcer and reported their 1, 3, and 5 year
      reulceration rates at 34%, 61%, and 70%, respectively, without further specifying footwear
      components. In a German diabetic population the reulceration rate was 87% in-patients who
      abandoned their custom shoes and resumed wearing their own shoes compared to 42% of those who
      continued to wear their custom shoes. Unfortunately, none of these studies compared the
      single or combined contribution of therapeutic shoes or insoles on foot ulcer prevention. Nor
      did these studies address patient adherence to prescribed footwear; thus the actual efficacy
      of various footwear interventions in foot ulcer prevention in this high-risk population is
      still to be tested.

      Primary Objective:

      Half of the 7,646 amputations performed in VA in 1996 were in veterans with diabetes. Lower
      extremity ulcers preceded about 85% of diabetic amputations. Minor trauma, often footwear or
      repetitive pressure related, initiated the majority of the ulcers. Persons with diabetes have
      unique footwear needs. In 1997, Gayle E. Reiber MPH, PhD, and Douglas G. Smith, MD of the VA
      Puget Sound Health Care System initiated a randomized clinical trial (1) to determine the
      extent to which study shoes and study inserts would reduce the incidence of re-ulceration in
      diabetic individuals with a prior foot ulcer history, and (2) to estimate costs of ulcer
      prevention using these strategies. A total of 400 patients from the VA Puget Sound Health
      Care System (n=189) and a Seattle-area Health Maintenance Organization, Group Health
      Cooperative (n=211), have now been randomized to one of three study arms: Arm 1 (n=120) study
      shoes and customized cork inserts; Arm 2 (n=119) study shoes and generic polyurethane
      inserts; and Arm 3 (n=161) controls who are wearing their own footwear. Patients in Arms 1
      and 2 received formal, leisure and athletic shoes built to study specifications by Cole-Haan
      for men and by Lowell Shoe for women. Patients will be followed for two years to determine
      the incidence and cost of foot re-ulceration.

      Study Abstract:

      A Seattle VA study indicated lower extremity ulcers preceded 84% of diabetic amputations.
      Nearly half of the events that ban the causal chain leading to ulcers and amputation were
      initiated by ill-fitting footwear. Other investigators report similar findings for injurious
      footwear in their diabetic patient populations. Yet, the efficacy of footwear in preventing
      ulcers and amputations in the high-risk diabetic population has received limited experimental
      investigation. A British descriptive study followed diabetic patients with healed foot ulcers
      for two years and found reulceration occurred in 72% of patients who resume wearing their own
      footwear compared to 26% of patients who continued wearing &quot;prescribed&quot; footwear. A Swedish
      cohort study identified individuals with a foot ulcer and reported their 1, 3, and 5 year
      reulceration rates at 34%, 61%, and 70%, respectively, without further specifying footwear
      components. In a German diabetic population the reulceration rate was 87% in-patients who
      abandoned their custom shoes and resumed wearing their own shoes compared to 42% of those who
      continued to wear their custom shoes. Unfortunately, none of these studies compared the
      single or combined contribution of therapeutic shoes or insoles on foot ulcer prevention. Nor
      did these studies address patient adherence to prescribed footwear; thus the actual efficacy
      of various footwear interventions in foot ulcer prevention in this high-risk population is
      still to be tested.
