  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Posaconazole (SCH
      56592) under an open label, treatment protocol for subjects with invasive fungal infections:

      A. which are refractory or resistant to standard antifungal therapies; B. for which there are
      currently no effective therapies; C. with a prior history of serious, severe or
      life-threatening toxicities while receiving antifungal therapy; D. with pre-existing organ
      dysfunction which precludes the administration of standard antifungal therapies.

      The current clinical trial is designed to provide posaconazole (SCH 56592 to subjects with
      invasive fungal infections a) which are refractory or resistant to standard antifungal
      therapies or b) for which there are currently no effective therapies. Subjects with such
      invasive fungal infections cannot be enrolled in controlled, randomized clinical trials.
      Secondly, this clinical trial is also designed to provide posaconazole (SCH 56592) to
      subjects with invasive fungal infections who c) have experienced serious or severe toxicities
      while receiving standard antifungal therapies or d) have pre-existing organ dysfunction such
      as renal dysfunction who require standard antifungal therapy which is precluded because of
      the toxicities associated with such therapy. This clinical trial also serves to allow
      collection of preliminary data regarding the safety and efficacy of posaconazole (SCH 56592)
      against a variety of invasive fungal infections which although serious and life-threatening
      are sufficiently rare so that they cannot be studied in a controlled, randomized clinical
      trial.

      This is an open-label, treatment protocol for a multi-center study of posaconazole (SCH
      56592) 200mg orally four times daily (QID) while hospitalized followed by posaconazole (SCH
      56592) 400mg orally twice daily (BID) on discharge from hospital, in the treatment of
      invasive fungal infections. Approximately 320 subjects have been enrolled at 160 clinical
      study centers in the US and worldwide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Proven or probable invasive fungal infections according to EORTC/MSG criteria.

          -  IFI are documented to be refractory to standard antifungal therapy OR intolerant to
             standard therapy.

          -  Able to take oral medication or take medication via enteral feeding tube.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of serious or severe hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to azole
             antifungals.

          -  Concurrent progressive neurological disease (except if due to invasive fungal
             infection)

          -  Use of medications that are known to interact with azoles and that may lead to
             life-threatening side effects: terfenadine, cisapride, ebastine at entry or within 24
             hours prior to therapy, or astemizole at entry or within 10 days prior to
             entry.concentration/efficacy of azole antifungals: rifampin, carbamazepine.

          -  Females pregnant or nursing.
