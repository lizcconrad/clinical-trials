    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether infliximab (Remicade ) is safe and effective for the
      treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Infliximab blocks the effect of a protein
      called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is associated with harmful inflammation in many
      diseases.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with active dermatomyositis or polymyositis that does not
      respond adequately to treatment with methotrexate and corticosteroids may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood
      and urine tests, chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, skin test for tuberculosis, HIV test,
      electromyography (described below), manual muscle testing, and functional assessments.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (described below) will be done to assess the degree and location
      of inflammation in the involved limbs. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram will be done
      if recent ones are not available. Patients who qualify for the study will be asked to undergo
      two muscle biopsies (surgical removal and analysis of small pieces of muscle tissue), one
      before initiation of treatment and another on the 16th week .

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 mg/kg body weight of infliximab or
      a placebo (inactive substance) by infusion through a vein over 2 hours. The infusions will be
      given at the beginning of the treatment period (week 0) and at weeks 2, 6 and 14. At week 16,
      strength will be assessed by manual muscle testing. Patients who improved with treatment will
      continue with the same infusion dose on weeks 18, 22, 30, and 38. Those who do not improve
      will be assigned by random allocation to receive either 5 mg/kg body weight or 10/mg/kg body
      weight of infliximab on weeks 18, 22, 30 and 38. Those who did not improve who were
      previously on the placebo infusion will receive an extra dose of either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg
      body weight of infliximab on week 16, while those patients who were previously on 3 mg/kg
      body weight of infliximab who failed to meet the improvement criteria will receive an
      infusion containing no medication on week 16. Patients will be admitted to the hospital for
      infusions at weeks 0, 14 and 38; the rest will be given on an outpatient basis. After the
      38th week, all infusions will be stopped and patients will be assessed on the 40th week.

      Participants will undergo some or all of the following tests and evaluations during
      treatment:

        -  Blood tests every week to look for antibodies seen with muscle inflammation. Some of the
           blood samples will be stored for later testing, including genetic studies to find
           genetic differences related to inflammation.

        -  Skin test for tuberculosis

        -  Chest x-rays at the beginning of the study (if a recent one is not available) and again
           at weeks 16 and 40 to look for active infection, detect signs of past exposure or
           infection with diseases such as tuberculosis, and assess the presence of lung disease
           that might be related to the myositis.

        -  MRI (usually of the legs) at the beginning of the study and again at weeks 16 and 40 to
           measure disease activity and extent of muscle involvement. This will also give an idea
           of the response to treatment. This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce
           images of body tissues. During the procedure the patient lies on a bed surrounded by a
           metal cylinder (the scanner).

        -  Muscle biopsy at the beginning of the study to diagnose muscle inflammation and again at
           week 16 to evaluate the response to treatment.

        -  Electromyography if the patient has not had an EMG previously. For this test, small
           needles are inserted into the muscle to assess the electrical activity of the muscle

        -  HIV test

      Patients whose disease worsen with treatment or who develop serious drug-related side effects
      will be taken off the study and referred back to their primary care physician for further
      therapy. Patients who improve will be referred back to their primary physician at the end of
      the study for possible continued treatment. Participants will be asked to return for
      follow-up visits every 6 weeks for a total of 30 weeks to monitor long-term effects of the
      drug

      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many
      diseases including inflammatory disorders, has been found to be elevated in the muscles of
      patients with dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM). A subset of patients with DM and PM
      do not respond readily to conventional therapy. Therefore, a controlled trial using
      infliximab, a chimeric IgG(1) kappa monoclonal antibody against TNF, may provide a
      therapeutic option and advance understanding in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This
      study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of infliximab in patients with DM and
      PM. We plan to enroll a maximum of 28 patients randomized at 1:1 ratio into 2 groups, placebo
      vs. infliximab at 5 mg/kg body weight. In the first phase of the study the placebo and
      infliximab infusions will be given at week 0, 2, 6 and 14. Primary outcome assessment will be
      done at week 16. Those who respond according to the criteria set for improvement in MMT will
      be given the option to remain on the same infusion (i.e. placebo or infliximab at 5 mg/kg
      body weight) at weeks 22, 30 and 38. Placebo non-responders will be given infliximab at 5
      mg/kg body weight in an open label fashion at weeks 16, 18, 22, 30 and 38. Patients who were
      initially on 5 mg/kg body weight of infliximab who failed to respond based on the criteria
      set will be placed on infliximab at 7.5 mg/kg body weight in an open label fashion on weeks
      22, 30 and 38. Pharmacokinetic modeling will be done in both phases of the study. A muscle
      biopsy will be done before treatment and again at 16 weeks of treatment. Microarray gene
      expression profiling of the muscle biopsy specimens will be done before treatment and again
      at 16 weeks. Clinical, functional and serological evaluations will be performed in every
      visit to assess other responses to treatment. Patients will be followed for 30 weeks after
      study termination to evaluate the long-term effects of the drug.
