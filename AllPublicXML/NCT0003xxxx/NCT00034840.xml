  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to demonstrate that MICARDIS® (telmisartan) is statistically
      superior to Diovan® (valsartan) in reducing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) following a missed
      dose at the end of a 6 to 8-week treatment period as measured by the 24-hour ABPM mean and to
      demonstrate that MICARDIS® is statistically superior to Diovan® in reducing DBP during the
      last 6-hours of the 24-hour dosing interval as measured by ABPM following a dose of active
      study medication at the end of a 6 to 8-week treatment period.

        equal to 95 mm Hg and less than or equal to 109 mm Hg and a baseline 24-hour ABPM mean DBP
        of greater than or equal to 85 mm Hg.

        Exclusion Criteria:
