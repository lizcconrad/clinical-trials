      This study will compare different ways of giving the drugs ganciclovir and valganciclovir to
      kidney or kidney and pancreas transplant recipients to determine the most effective dose of
      valganciclovir for protecting against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in these patients. One
      of the most common viral infections following organ transplant, CMV can cause serious illness
      and even death.

      Ganciclovir reduces the incidence of CMV disease after kidney transplantation. The drug is
      given either intravenously (through a vein) twice a day or by mouth 3 times a day.
      Valganciclovir is converted to ganciclovir in the body and is absorbed into the bloodstream
      better than oral ganciclovir. In most transplant patients, a single daily dose of
      valganciclovir prevents CMV. Because of these advantages, some transplant patients are being
      given valganciclovir instead of ganciclovir to prevent CMV infection. However, the drug has
      not been studied in kidney and kidney transplant patients. This study will provide dosing
      information for this patient population.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had a kidney or kidney and pancreas transplant at
      the NIH Clinical Center may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the
      following treatments and procedures:

      - Phase 1 - Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir for at least 7 days after transplantation.

      Sometime before starting phase 2, patients will provide a 24-hour urine collection to test
      for kidney function. The day before starting phase 2, they will have a cannula (small needle)
      inserted into an arm vein for about 12 hours to draw blood samples-one before starting the
      ganciclovir infusion, then at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes, and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after
      the dose.

        -  Phase 2 - Treatment with oral valganciclovir once a day for 7 to 21 days at a dose
           approximately equivalent to intravenous ganciclovir. Sometime between 4 and 21 days on
           this dose, patients will have blood sampling in the morning before taking the drug and
           then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the dose.

        -  Phase 3 - Treatment with valganciclovir at a dose reduced by half to approximate oral
           ganciclovir dosing.

      After at least 4 days on this dose, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 1 day for
      blood sampling before the drug dose and then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours
      after the dose. Kidney function will be assessed by blood tests within 2 days of the blood
      sampling. If kidney function is not within the normal range, further dosing and blood
      sampling will be delayed until kidney function returns to the normal range.

      - Phase 4 - Treatment with oral ganciclovir every 8 hours. After at least 4 days on this
      regimen, patients will be admitted to the hospital for 1 day for blood sampling before the
      drug dose and then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the dose. Kidney function will
      be estimated by blood tests within 2 days of the blood sampling. If kidney function is not
      within the normal range, further dosing and blood sampling will be delayed until kidney
      function returns to normal range.

      After completing phase 4, patients will continue valganciclovir daily or oral ganciclovir
      treatment and blood sampling for a length of time prescribed by the transplant surgeon.

      Cytomegalovirus in solid organ transplant recipients can result in significant morbidity and
      mortality due to concurrent immunosuppression. Traditionally intravenous followed by oral
      ganciclovir has been used to prevent and treat cytomegalovirus infection and disease in
      transplant recipients. Recently a new oral form of ganciclovir, valganciclovir has been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients
      with AIDS. Valganciclovir is more bioavailable and requires fewer daily doses and lower pill
      burden than oral ganciclovir. In addition valganciclovir can attain ganciclovir plasma levels
      similar to intravenous ganciclovir. This protocol will test the ability of valganciclovir to
      provide similar drug exposure (area under the curve, AUC) as oral and intravenous ganciclovir
      at equivalent doses in the setting of kidney and kidney-pancreas transplantation. Patients
      will receive four different dosing/dosage form schemes. Intravenous ganciclovir at 2.5mg/kg
      every 12 hours, which is the usual treatment at this facility post surgery will be
      administered for approximately 7 days (phase I), then patients will receive valganciclovir
      900 mg daily for 7 to 21 days (phase II), then patients will receive 450 mg daily for at
      least 4 days (phase III), and finally, ganciclovir 1000 mg every 8 hours for at least 4 days
      (phase IV). Serial blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analyses after each
      change in dose/dosage form (after each phase). After completion of the study, patients will
      be maintained on valganciclovir 450 mg daily for CMV prophylaxis or oral ganciclovir for a
      length of time prescribed by the transplant surgeon. By characterizing the pharmacokinetics
      of valganciclovir in kidney/pancreas transplant patients, it is hoped that appropriate dosing
      to prevent CMV disease and limit toxicity may be achieved.
