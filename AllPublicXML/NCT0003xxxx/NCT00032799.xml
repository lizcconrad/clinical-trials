  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of natalizumab in
      individuals diagnosed with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. It is thought that
      natalizumab may stop the movement of certain cells, known as white blood cells, into bowel
      tissue. These cells are thought to cause damage in the bowel leading to the symptoms of
      Crohn's disease.
