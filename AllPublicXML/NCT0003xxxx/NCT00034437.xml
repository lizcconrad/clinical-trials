  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate immune responses against cytomegalovirus (CMV). About 80 percent of
      adults have been exposed to this virus. CMV typically remains dormant (inactive) in the body,
      causing no problems. In people with immune suppression, however, the virus can become
      reactivated and cause life-threatening pneumonia. The knowledge gained from this study may be
      useful in developing ways to improve immune responses to CMV in stem cell transplant
      recipients.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age who have been exposed to
      cytomegalovirus are eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history and blood tests. Those enrolled will provide a 30-milliliter (6-tablespoon) blood
      sample once a week for 4 weeks and a final sample 2 months later. The blood will be used to
      design a test to detect immune responses against CMV and determine the differences in these
      responses among healthy individuals.

      The NHLBI Stem Cell Allotransplantation Program is researching methods to improve immunity
      against infectious organisms following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We are
      particularly interested in cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can cause serious problems in
      patients following transplantation. In the future, we hope to design ways to improve immune
      responses to CMV in transplant recipients, such as vaccinating transplant donors and/or
      patients against this virus. In order to characterize the effect of any such intervention on
      CMV immunity, we first need to better understand CMV immune responses in normal, healthy
      persons. This involves designing and validating an in vitro assay, which can reliably and
      consistently detect immune responses against CMV. Furthermore, we hope to define the temporal
      variability that exists in CMV responses in healthy individuals, which is essential for the
      design and implementation of all future studies. We plan to collect blood samples from 20
      normal volunteers who have been previously exposed to CMV (CMV seropositive individuals).
      Eligible individuals will be asked to donate blood on five occasions, once a week for four
      weeks and a fifth time, two months later. Eligible individuals must be 18-65 years of age,
      otherwise healthy, and seropositive for CMV exposure.
