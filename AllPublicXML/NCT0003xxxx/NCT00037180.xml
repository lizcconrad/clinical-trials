  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Diarrhea Prevention with an investigational drug trial, will evaluate whether adding an
      investigational drug to the standard treatment for advanced colorectal cancer can reduce the
      amount of diarrhea a patient experiences. The standard and approved treatment for patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer is repeated cycles of chemotherapy consisting of a
      combination of irinotecan (also known as CPT-11, Camptosar), 5-fluorouracil (also known as
      5FU), and leucovorin (also known as LV). Preclinical data from animal models suggest that the
      investigational drug may offer an effective means for preventing CPT-11/5FU/LV-induced
      diarrhea. It is also hypothesized that the investigational drug-mediated anti-angiogenesis
      could induce a favorable tumor response.
