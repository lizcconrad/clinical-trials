    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a long-acting
      injectable formulation of risperidone when switching from an oral antipsychotic in patients
      with schizophrenia.

    <textblock>
      For schizophrenia patients taking oral antipsychotic medications, a long-acting injectable
      formulation of a antipsychotic medication may eliminate the need for daily medication and
      enhance patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This is an open-label, non-randomized
      study of a formulation of risperidone (coated microspheres) injected into the muscle at 2
      week intervals over 12 weeks in patients with schizophrenia. The study has two phases: during
      the first 4 weeks, patients continue treatment with their present medication (haloperidol,
      quetiapine fumarate, or olanzapine); during the second phase of 12 weeks, patients receive
      the injectable formulation of risperidone, while continuing to receive their present
      medication for 3 weeks until the risperidone long-acting injectable reaches effective drug
      levels. For the remainder of the 12-week treatment phase, patients receive only injectable
      risperidone every 2 weeks. Safety evaluations include the incidence, type, and severity of
      treatment-emergent adverse events throughout the study; vital signs (pulse, blood pressure),
      clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      and extrapyramidial symptoms are also monitored at specified intervals. Assessments of
      effectiveness include the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and overall severity
      of illness measured by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. The study hypothesis is
      that long-acting injectible risperidone will be well-tolerated in the treatment of patients
      with schizophrenia after switching from treatment with an oral antipsychotic. Risperidone
      injections (25 milligrams[mg]) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Investigator may adjust dosage to
      37.5mg or 50 mg (maximum) or supplement risperidone injections with risperidone tablets
      (1mg), according to symptoms and treatment response.

             Diseases, 4th edition (DSM-IV)

          -  currently treated with either oral haloperidol, quetiapine fumarate, or olanzapine for
             4 months prior to trial entry

          -  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of &lt;=80 and score &lt;= 4 on

             substance dependence (except nicotine or caffeine dependence)

          -  history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare psychotropic-drug reaction, which
             may be characterized by confusion, reduced consciousness, high fever or pronounced
             muscle stiffness

          -  history of disease of the central nervous system, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease,
             Alzheimer's disease, or Huntington's disease

          -  known hypersensitivity, intolerance, or unresponsiveness to risperidone

          -  pregnant or nursing females, or those lacking adequate contraception.
