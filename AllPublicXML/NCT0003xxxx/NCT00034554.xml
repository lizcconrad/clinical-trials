    <textblock>
      Up to 24 patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma will be enrolled. Patients who are
      currently disease-free but at high risk for relapse are also eligible. Patients will receive
      vaccinations of gp75 at assigned dose levels. Patients who exhibit serologic and
      stable/clinical response are eligible to receive booster vaccinations. Patients will be
      evaluated for safety and efficacy throughout the duration of the study. In this study, the
      optimal biologically effective dose is defined as the lowest dose of gp75 that results in the
      production of anti-gp75 antibodies.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramuscular vaccination
      with gp75 DNA in patients with stage III or IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are to observe
      the patient for any evidence of anti-tumor response and to establish the optimal biologically
      effective dose. Up to 24 evaluable patients with stage III or IV metastatic melanoma or with
      stage III melanoma, currently disease-free, but at high risk for recurrence will be enrolled.
      Patients will be be enrolled into an assigned dose group and will receive five vaccinations
      of gp75. In order for dose escalation to proceed, only one patient in the current dose group
      may have demonstrated a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If a second patient experiences such
      toxicity then both patients will move down to the previous dose level, and the previous dose
      level will be considered to be the MTD. If no DLTs are encountered, patients will continue on
      study at the assigned dose level. Any patient experiencing a DLT will not receive further
      vaccination until the toxicity has resolved. Patients exhibiting both serological and
      stable/clinical response after receiving the fifth vaccination will be eligible to receive
      booster vaccinations. An additional patient will be accrued to the dose level for every
      patient that progresses prior to the fifth vaccination.

    <description>6 patients will be enrolled in each of the 5 vaccination groups. Patients in vaccination groups 1-3 will receive a total of 5(1 mL) vaccinations. Patients assigned to vaccination group 4 will receive a total of 5 (2.0 mL) vaccinations administered as 2 1 mL injections. Patients assigned to vaccination group 5 will receive a total of 5 (4.0 mL or 8.0 mg)vaccinations administered as 4 1 mL injections per vaccination treatment Patients will receive gp75 DNA vaccinations every 3 weeks for 5 vaccinations. Injection sites will be given intramuscularly and rotated for each dose using all 4 limbs with the exception of a site that had the removal of lymph nodes. Progression to next higher dose level will be based on the 5* patient safely completing the 2nd vaccination at the lower dose level.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a diagnosis of American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage 111 or
             IV malignant melanoma. A patient who is free of disease after surgical resection of
             stage 111 or IV disease, but at high risk (defined as a primary tumor &gt;4 rnm,
             satellite or in-transit lesions, one or more positive lymph nodes or distant

             have no more than five sites of disease. The skin represents one site regardless of
             the number of lesions. Stage 111 melanoma is defined as a pT4 primary tumor (&gt;4m in
             depth or Clark level 5) in-transit metastases, satellites lesions or regional lymph
             nodes involved with melanoma.Pathology slides must be reviewed by the investigational

             entry.

          7. The patient has adequate hematologic function as defined as a platelet count
             2100,000/mm3 and white blood cell (WBC) level 23,000/mm3.

             melanoma therapy.

          2. The patient has a medical condition or use of medication (eg, corticosteroids) that
             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or
             to respond immunologically to them, in the opinion of the investigator.

          3. The patient has received irradiation, chemotherapy, or systemic immunotherapy
             (interferon-alpha, or interleukin-2) within 30 days prior to study entry.

          4. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [PHCG],
             if applicable) or is breast feeding.

          5. The patient has received any investigational agents within 30 days of study entry.

          6. The patient has received prior cancer vaccine therapy.

          7. The patient has evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.

          8. The patient has evidence of an ocular abnormality, as detected by a slit-lamp
             ophthalmologic examination, within 4 weeks prior to study entry.
