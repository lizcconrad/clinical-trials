      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining rituximab with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab plus combination chemotherapy
      in treating patients who have HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with poor-prognosis, HIV-related non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma treated with rituximab combined with prednisolone, vincristine, and bleomycin.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV and bleomycin IV on day 1 and oral
      prednisolone every other day beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6
      courses. Patients also receive rituximab on days 14, 21, 28, and 35. Patients who achieve
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy after CR.

      Patients are followed every 1-2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
