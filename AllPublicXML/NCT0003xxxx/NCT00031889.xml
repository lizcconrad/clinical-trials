      RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      exemestane plus bicalutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of
      androgens. It is not yet known if exemestane is more effective with or without bicalutamide
      in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exemestane with or without
      bicalutamide in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer that has been previously
      treated with hormone therapy or surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of exemestane with or without bicalutamide as
           second-line therapy after failure of androgen suppression (luteinizing hormone-releasing
           hormone agonist or orchiectomy) in patients with stage IV prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the potential antagonistic effect of the weak androgen action of exemestane
           when combined with bicalutamide in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate prostate-specific antigen response and data of QOL, including scores for pain
           intensity and analgesic consumption, in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1-2), pain (none or mild vs moderate or severe), and participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive exemestane as in arm I and oral bicalutamide once daily.

      Treatment in both arms continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, on day 1 of course 2 and any subsequent
      courses, and at disease progression or treatment failure (if applicable).

      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-62 patients (10-31 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
