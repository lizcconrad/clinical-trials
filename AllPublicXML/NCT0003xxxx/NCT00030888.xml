      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of UCN-01 in treating patients who have
      unresectable stage III or stage IV kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of UCN-01, in terms of time to objective progression, in patients
           with stage IV or unresectable stage III renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-61 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
