    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have
      metastatic or unresectable solid tumors and liver or kidney dysfunction. Biological therapies
      such as erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of the
      tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in patients with solid tumors and
      hepatic or renal dysfunction.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      hepatic or renal dysfunction (albumin less than 2.5 g/dL, direct bilirubin less than 1.0
      mg/dL, any AST, and creatinine normal vs direct bilirubin 1.0-7.0 mg/dL, any AST, and
      creatinine normal vs creatinine 2.5-5.0 mg/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL or greater, AST less than 3
      times upper limit of normal, and direct bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dL).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at
      least 6 evaluable patients are treated at that dose.
