      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Radiolabeled monoclonal
      antibodies can locate and deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiolabeled monoclonal
      antibodies with rituximab in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not
      responded to high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan when
           administered with rituximab in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have
           relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours followed by indium In 111-labeled
           ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10 minutes on day 0. Patients receive
           rituximab IV again on day 7 followed by IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 3 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, 58 additional patients are treated at that dose
           level as in phase I.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 78 patients (20 for phase I and 58 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 2 years.
