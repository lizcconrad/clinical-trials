      The goal of this clinical research study is learn if a vaccine that contains the patient's
      own cancer cell immunoglobulin can shrink or slow the growth of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
      (CLL). This clinical trial is a dose escalation study in which the safety of this vaccine
      will be studied. This is a dose escalation study in which each patient will receive vaccine
      at one dose level. Patients will be injected with a fragment of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      containing the sequence of their own immunoglobulin gene. Patients will be required to have
      their diagnosis of CLL and stage confirmed prior to initiating vaccination. After vaccination
      patients will receive clinical and immunologic evaluation, including both humoral and
      cellular responses. The investigator will be assessing the patient's immune response or
      whether the patient's body recognizes the DNA vaccine. In addition, side effects and
      reactions to the vaccine will be evaluated.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine if patients with Binet Stage A CLL generate an immune response to an
           antigen delivered by a DNA vaccine.

        2. To determine if patients with Binet Stage A CLL generate an immune response to a tumor
           derived antigen delivered by a DNA vaccine.

        3. To determine the optimal dose of DNA vaccine to obtain anti-idiotype immune responses.

        4. To characterize any adverse effects of idiotypic vaccination with a DNA vaccine.

        5. To determine if DNA idiotypic vaccination is capable of inducing remission in BinetÂ´s
           Stage A CLL.
