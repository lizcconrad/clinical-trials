      The short-term research objectives of the proposed study are as follows:

        1. To measure the effects of audiological intervention on selected domain specific (i.e.,
           Communicative, Interpersonal, and Social roles) and overall functioning using the
           WHO-DASII, a generic health measure conceptually grounded in the ICIDH-2 model of
           disablement and functioning.

        2. To measure the effects of audiological intervention on selected domain specific (i.e.,
           Role Functioning-Emotional; and, Social Functioning) and overall functioning using the
           MOS-SF36V, a generic health measure currently utilized in the Veteran's Health
           Administration.

        3. To determine the accuracy with which measures of audibility (SII), hearing handicap
           (HHIE), and, hearing disability (APHAB) predict domain specific and overall functioning,
           and life-satisfaction as measured by the WHO-DASII and the MOS-SF36V will be evaluated.

        4. To compare hearing aid treatment effects as measured by changes in WHO-DASII domain
           specific and overall functioning scores to those measured by changes in disease specific
           instruments examining similar constructs.

        5. To compare hearing aid treatment effects as measured by changes in MOS-SF36V domain
           specific and overall functioning scores to those measured by changes in disease specific
           instruments examining similar constructs.

        6. To determine and compare cost-effectiveness of hearing aid intervention as calculated
           using WHO-DASII and MOS SF-36V outcome data.

      The long-term research objective is to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of
      audiologic intervention with those of other health care interventions commonly associated
      with the veteran population (e.g. mental health, cardiology, pulmonary, orthopedic, etc.).

      Specific Objectives with Projected Timetable:

        1. . Short-term objectives:

             1. . To measure the effects of audiological intervention on selected domain specific
                (i.e., Communicative, Interpersonal, and Social roles) and overall functioning
                using the WHO-DAS II, a generic health measure conceptually grounded in the
                International Classification of Impairment, Disability, and Handicap (ICIDH)-2
                model of disablement and functioning (WHO, 1999).

             2. . To measure the effects of audiological intervention on selected category specific
                (i.e., Role Functioning-Emotional and Social Functioning) and overall functioning
                using the MOS-SF36V, a generic health measure currently utilized in the Veterans
                Health Administration.

             3. . To determine the accuracy with which measures of audibility (SII), hearing
                handicap (HHIE), and, hearing disability (APHAB) predict domain specific and
                overall functioning, and life-satisfaction as measured by the WHO-DAS II and the
                MOS-SF36V will be evaluated.

             4. . To compare hearing aid treatment effects as measured by changes in WHO-DAS II
                domain specific and overall functioning scores to those measured by changes in
                disease specific instruments examining similar constructs.

             5. . To compare hearing aid treatment effects as measured by changes in MOS-SF36V
                domain specific and overall functioning scores to those measured by changes in
                disease specific instruments examining similar constructs.

             6. . To determine and compare cost-effectiveness of hearing aid intervention as
                calculated using WHO-DAS II and MOS-SF36V outcome data.

        2. . Long-term objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of audiologic
           intervention with those of other health care interventions commonly associated with the
           veteran population (e.g. mental health, cardiology, pulmonary, orthopedic, etc.).
