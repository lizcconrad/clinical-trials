    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare two different hormone therapy regimens in preventing
      endometrial cancer in women who have a genetic risk for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer.
      Hormone therapy may prevent the development of endometrial cancer in women with a genetic
      risk for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. It is not yet known which hormone therapy
      regimen is more effective in preventing endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of progesterone therapy versus combination
      estrogen and progesterone therapy on potential surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBs) relevant
      to endometrial carcinogenesis.

      II. To evaluate changes in histology and ultrasound appearance of the endometrium in women
      with HNPCC after 3 months of progesterone therapy versus combination estrogen and
      progesterone therapy compared with baseline.

      III. To establish a point estimate of the baseline frequency of endometrial abnormalities
      looking at histological and molecular markers in a cohort of females carrying an HNPCC gene
      mutation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      All patients undergo a baseline transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial biopsy.

      Arm I: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone intramuscularly once on day 1. Approximately 90
      days after the injection, patients undergo a repeat transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial
      biopsy.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral contraceptive pills (OCP) comprising ethinyl estradiol and
      norgestrel once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3-4 courses (3-4
      packs of OCP) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 1 week after starting
      the fourth pack of OCP, patients undergo a repeat transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial
      biopsy.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks and are encouraged to return in 6 months to participate in
      continued endometrial screening.
