      RATIONALE: VEGF Trap may stop the growth of solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by
      stopping blood flow to the cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VEGF Trap in patients who have relapsed
      or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap in patients with incurable relapsed
           or refractory solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the ability of this drug to bind and inactivate circulating vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these patients.

        -  Determine the dosing regimen that is optimal for neutralization of circulating VEGF in
           these patients.

        -  Determine whether antibodies to this drug develop in these patients.

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the ability of this drug to alter tumor vascular permeability and
           tumor growth in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap subcutaneously once daily on days 1, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 64 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of VEGF Trap until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 5 additional patients
      are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
