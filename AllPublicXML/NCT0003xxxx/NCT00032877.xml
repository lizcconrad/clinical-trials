      This study will examine blood or other tissue samples from patients with Fraser syndrome and
      patients with Fryns syndrome to try to identify the gene responsible for these diseases.
      Fraser syndrome is characterized by congenital abnormalities including cryptophthalmos (lack
      of eyelid formation), syndactyly (webbed fingers or toes) and abnormal genitalia. Patients
      may also have abnormalities of the nose, ears and larynx (voice box), cleft lip or palate,
      and kidney agenesis. Fryns syndrome is characterized by hernia through the diaphragm, cloudy
      cornea, coarse facial features, cleft lip or palate, abnormal fingers and toes, heart, kidney
      and brain malformations and hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid around the brain). This
      protocol consists of laboratory study only; it does not involve patient care or patient
      counseling.

      Patients with Fraser syndrome or Fryns syndrome are eligible for this study. Parents and
      healthy siblings of patients will also be included for genetic study, and parents of children
      with undiagnosed multiple congenital anomalies syndromes will be included for comparison
      study.

      Participants will provide a blood sample (about 8 to 10 teaspoons from adults; 1 to 3
      teaspoons from children) or sample of skin cells collected by swabbing the inner surface of
      the cheek. Some patients may undergo a skin biopsy, in which a small skin sample (about
      1/8-inch in diameter) is surgically removed. The tissue samples will be used to obtain DNA
      (genetic material) for laboratory testing. A permanent cell line-a collection of cells grown
      in the laboratory from the original tissue specimen-will also be established to enable
      additional testing in the future.

      We would like to determine the molecular genetic etiology of two rare human malformation
      syndromes, Fraser syndrome (OMIM 219000) and Fryns syndrome (OMIM 229850). To date, we are
      unaware of molecular genetic studies that have been performed in either syndrome.

      We are planning to perform molecular genetic studies on DNA specimens from affected
      individuals ascertained outside NIH by other clinicians and/or reported in the medical
      literature. Should these studies prove fruitful, we would plan to expand this work to a
      combined clinical and molecular study to fully delineate the phenotypes associated with these
      disorders.

      We plan to collect DNA specimens from affected patients and from unaffected siblings and
      parents and to evaluate the specimens in the laboratory by linkage analysis, physical
      mapping, candidate gene characterization and mutation screening. If the causative genes(s)
      for either syndrome are identified, then mouse models of the diseases may be developed and
      cell biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins may be undertaken.

      The cloning of these genes would enable better characterization of human developmental
      processes and improve patient counseling for individuals and families affected by these
      diseases.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        For Fraser syndrome, clinical criteria for inclusion will be by:

        Satisfying diagnostic criteria for Fraser syndrome. These are at least two major criteria
        and one minor criterion (listed below) or one major criterion and four minor criteria.

        Major criteria:

        Cryptophthalmos

        Syndactyly

        Abnormal genitalia

        Sib with cryptophthalmos syndrome

        Minor criteria:

        Congenital malformation of the nose

        Congenital malformations of the ears

        Congenital malformation of the larynx

        Cleft lip and/or palate

        Skeletal defects

        Umbilical hernia

        Renal agenesis

        Mental retardation

        Cryptophthalmos with additional anomalies consistent with the phenotypic spectrum of Fraser
        syndrome but without satisfying diagnotisic for Fraser syndrome may also be considered
        sufficient for inclusion.

        For Fryns syndrome, formal diagnostic criteria have not been published. The clinical
        criteria for inclusion will be:

        Diaphragmatic hernia with at least one additional anomaly found in the spectrum of Fryns
        syndrome, including cleft lip and or palate, renal or genital malformations, cerebral
        malformations or hydrocephalus, corneal clouding, craniofacial dysmorphism and
        brachydactyly or nail hypoplasia, pulmonary agenesis or microphthalmia.

        Patients with four or more of the additional anomalies may be included in the study.

        Parents and unaffected siblings will be also included for linkage analysis.

        Specimens of DNA or whole blood for DNA extraction collected outside the NIH may be
        accepted into the study if they are obtained through an approved NIH protocol consent form.
