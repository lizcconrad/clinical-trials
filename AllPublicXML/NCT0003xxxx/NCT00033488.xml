      RATIONALE: Screening tests may help doctors detect cancer cells early and plan more effective
      treatment for ovarian cancer.

      PURPOSE: Screening trial to determine the best procedure to detect ovarian cancer in women
      who have a high genetic risk for developing ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine an optimal screening procedure for ovarian cancer, in terms of the most
           appropriate screening test, criteria for interpretation of results, and screening
           intervals, in women at high genetic risk for developing ovarian cancer.

        -  Determine the physical morbidity and the resource implications associated with ovarian
           cancer screening in these women.

        -  Assess the feasibility of screening this high-risk population in terms of compliance
           rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo transvaginal ultrasonography of the ovaries (scheduled for the
      early follicular phase, day 3-6 of the menstrual cycle) and CA 125 measurement annually.
      Blood samples are collected every 4 months for analysis of CA 125 levels and novel markers.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
