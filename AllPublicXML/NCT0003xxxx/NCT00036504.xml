    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine: 1. If patients taking insulin lispro LM with
      metformin will have better overall control of their blood sugar than patients taking a long
      acting insulin comparator with metformin. 2. If there is a difference in the way the two
      treatments affect blood sugar control before and after meals and at night. 3. If there is a
      difference in the insulin dose required with the two treatments. 4. If there is a difference
      in the numbers of times patients experience low blood sugar with the two treatments. 5. If
      there is a difference in the effect on patients's body weight.

      The aim of the present study is to compare two treatments - LM twice daily plus metformin two
      or three times daily versus a long acting insulin comparator once daily plus metformin two or
      three times daily - in patients with type 2 diabetes who are currently using a regimen of one
      or more oral antihyperglycemic agents.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that, in patients with type 2 diabetes
      who are new to insulin, hemoglobin A1c at endpoint will be lower after treatment with insulin
      lispro LM twice daily plus metformin than after treatment with a long acting insulin
      comparator once daily plus metformin.

      This will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study comparing twice-daily
      insulin lispro LM plus two- or three-times-daily metformin to a once-daily long acting
      insulin comparator plus two- or three-times-daily metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes
      who were receiving one or more oral antihyperglycemic agents without insulin prior to the
      study.

      Following an 8 (+-2) week lead-in period consisting of treatment with NPH once daily at
      bedtime plus metformin two or three times daily, approximately 100 eligible patients will be
      randomized to one of two sequence groups, so that there are approximately 50 patients in each
      group. One group will receive 4 months of insulin lispro LM administered immediately before
      the morning and evening meals plus metformin two or three times daily followed by 4 months of
      a once-daily long acting insulin comparator at bedtime plus metformin two or three times
      daily. The other group will receive the reverse sequence.
