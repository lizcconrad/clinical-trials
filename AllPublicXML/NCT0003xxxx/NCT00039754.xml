  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a disease that resides primarily in the bone and has shown to be
      sensitive to radiation. Administration of a radiotherapy agent that targets the bone, such as
      Holmium-166-DOTMP, in conjunction with melphalan and an autologous stem cell transplant, may
      improve the patient's chance of responding to treatment. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the amount of Holmium-166-DOTMP that localizes in the bone and in normal organs,
      and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Holmium-166-DOTMP in the treatment of patients
      with multiple myeloma.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate the radiation absorbed dose to the bone marrow and
      kidneys based on whole-body gamma camera image data for comparison with that obtained using
      mathematical models based on whole body counting from a small gamma detection device called a
      thyroid probe; to obtain pharmacokinetic data following administration of 166Ho-DOTMP; and to
      evaluate safety and efficacy in patients who receive 25 Gy targeted therapy of 166Ho-DOTMP
      and 200 mg/m2 melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).
