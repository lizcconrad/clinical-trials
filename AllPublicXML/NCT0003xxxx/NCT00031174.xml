  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect white blood cells or plasma (the liquid part of the blood), or both,
      from healthy volunteers and from patients with rheumatic or kidney disorders for research
      purposes. Rheumatic disorders involve abnormalities of the immune system, the body s defense
      against disease. The immune system consists of white blood cells such as lymphocytes and
      monocytes, which produce substances such as antibodies and cytokines. White cells and plasma
      will be collected through a procedure called apheresis (described below).

      Healthy volunteers and patients with confirmed or suspected rheumatic or kidney disease who
      are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Patients must be participating
      in a current protocol of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
      Diseases or the National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes and Kidney Diseases. All candidates
      will be screened with a history, physical examination, and blood tests for hepatitis B and C
      and HIV infection. Women of childbearing age will be tested for pregnancy. Routine blood
      tests will be done in all volunteers, and in patients where needed. Pregnant women and people
      who test positive for hepatitis or HIV may not participate.

      Participants will undergo apheresis to collect lymphocytes, monocytes, or plasma from the
      blood. For this procedure, a needle is placed in a vein in the arm. Blood flows from the vein
      through a tube (catheter) into a machine that spins the blood, separating it into its
      components. The required cells or plasma are extracted, and the rest of the blood, including
      the red cells and platelets, is returned to the body through the same needle or through a
      second needle placed in the other arm.

      Cells collected from volunteers will be used in studies comparing the number and function of
      similar cells from patients with rheumatic diseases, focusing on the differences in number
      and function of the cells in health and disease. Components collected from patients will be
      used only for studies described in the protocol in which they are currently enrolled.

      Blood components will be collected using apheresis from normal volunteers and patients with
      rheumatic or kidney diseases. Mononuclear cells and plasma will be used by various
      investigators for research studies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - Subjects with Rheumatic Diseases:

        Patients with a diagnosed or suspected rheumatic or kidney disease, who are actively
        involved in a NIAMS or NIDDK protocol (have a current, signed consent form)

        Ability to give informed consent

        Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Subjects with Rheumatic Diseases:

        History of allergy to acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant

        History of bleeding diatheses

        Hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL

        Platelet count less than 50,000/mm(3)

        Pregnancy

        Inadequate peripheral venous access

        Active hepatitis B, C and/or HIV infection

        Symptomatic coronary artery or valvular heart disease

        Any concomitant illness that in the opinion of the investigators will substantially
        increase the risk of apheresis.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Healthy Volunteers:

        Subjects shall meet all donor eligibility criteria for autologous blood donation
        recommended or required by the Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks (1) and
        the Code of Federal Regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (2), with the exception
        of the travel exclusions related to malaria exposure and hypothetical exposure to the agent
        of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.

        Ability to give informed consent

        Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Healthy Volunteers:

        History of autoimmune or chronic rheumatic disease within the last 5 years, with the
        exception of osteoarthritis

        Active hepatitis B, C, and/or HIV infection

        History of allergy to acid-citrate (ACD) anticoagulant

        History of coagulopathies and bleeding diatheses

        Symptomatic coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease

        Hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL

        Pregnancy

        Inadequate peripheral venous access

        Any concomitant illness that in the opinion of the investigators will substantially
        increase the risk of apheresis or make the volunteer ineligible for study controls are
        needed for (eg: active infection, allergies, etc.)
