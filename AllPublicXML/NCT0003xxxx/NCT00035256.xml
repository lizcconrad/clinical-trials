  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the increase in spine bone mineral density
      that has been generally observed in previous clinical studies involving the study drug can be
      maintained or even increased if followed with raloxifene HCl. All qualifying study
      participants will receive the study drug followed by treatment with raloxifene HCl or
      placebo. All study participants will receive raloxifene HCl in the third phase of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The study is designed to compare the effect of 1 year of raloxifene treatment with the effect of placebo on maintaining teriparatide-induced increases in spine and hip BMD.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>An open-label treatment phase will extend the study for 1 year beyond the primary endpoint. During this final year of the study all patients will receive raloxifene.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The purpose of lengthening is to assess the differences in response to raloxifene when it is administered immediately following versus 1 year after(with and without a washout period) withdrawal from teriparatide.</measure>
