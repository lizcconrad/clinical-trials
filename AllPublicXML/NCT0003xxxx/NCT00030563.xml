      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells.
      Combining radiofrequency ablation with surgery may kill more tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Giving a chemotherapy drug after surgery and radiofrequency ablation may kill any
      remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of surgery with or without
      radiofrequency ablation followed by irinotecan in treating patients who have colorectal
      cancer that is metastatic to the liver.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the disease-free survival in patients with hepatic metastases from primary
           colorectal carcinoma treated with surgical resection with or without radiofrequency
           ablation followed by irinotecan.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the treatment-related toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the measurement of molecular markers with clinical outcome in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment with
      radiofrequency ablation in addition to resection (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo surgical resection with or without radiofrequency ablation. Beginning 4-8
      weeks after surgery, patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Chemotherapy
      repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
