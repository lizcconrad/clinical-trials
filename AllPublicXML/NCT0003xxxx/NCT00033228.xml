      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Infusing
      the vaccine directly into a lymph node may cause a stronger immune response and kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intranodal Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine in
           patients with stage IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunological response, as measured by changes in frequency of T cells
           specific against vaccine-encoded epitopes before and after treatment, in patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the clinical response, as measured by lactic dehydrogenase levels and
           radiologic assessment of lesions, in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine by continuous intranodal infusion on days
      1-4. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with evidence of stable or responding disease are eligible for 4
      additional courses of treatment.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 10 days after the last dose of study drug.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The first cohort of 6 patients received 500 ug of Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine.
