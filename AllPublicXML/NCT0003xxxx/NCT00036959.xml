      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABT-751, work in different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of ABT-751 in treating young
      patients with refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of ABT-751
           administered daily for 7 days every 21 days or daily for 21 days every 28 days in
           children with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity spectrum of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacodynamics of this drug by measuring the fraction of tubulin that is
           polymerized in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients before and after
           receiving this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Quantify responses in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess the effect of this drug on tumor vascularity and tumor blood flow using dynamic
           enhanced MRI in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of 2 different schedules
      of ABT-751. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 dosing schedules.

        -  Schedule 1 (closed to accrual as of 5/25/2009): Patients receive oral ABT-751 once daily
           on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Schedule 2 (closed to accrual as of 5/25/2009): Patients receive oral ABT-751 once daily
           on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      On each schedule, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ABT-751 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined,
      up to 9 patients (a minimum of 3 patients age 11 and under and 3 patients age 12 to 18) are
      treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
