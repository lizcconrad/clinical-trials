      Prior research shows that, after a stroke, emotional support from friends and family is very
      important in recovery from stroke. This study was designed to test whether a program of
      family sessions would lead to a faster recovery for stroke patients and lower stress for
      their families. The sessions were designed to mobilize the family and close friends of a
      stroke patient and help them to provide effective support to the patient. The aim of the
      study was to help patients who have recently had a stroke to achieve greater functional
      ability. Participants were randomly assigned to either the standard care or the treatment
      group. Those in the treatment group received standard care plus a maximum of 16 home-based
      sessions, or family meetings, with a specially-trained clinician. (The majority of
      participants received 14 or 15 sessions.) The sessions included stroke education, information
      about services and community resources, assistance with problem solving to aid in gaining
      independence, help with coping, and emotional support. The study is no longer enrolling
      patients and the study data has been collected. The data is now being analyzed.
