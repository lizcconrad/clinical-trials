      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it
      can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility and efficacy of sequential neoadjuvant docetaxel, cisplatin,
           and radiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with operable stage IIIB non-small cell
           lung cancer.

        -  Determine the rate of event-free survival at 1 year in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the operability and complete resection rate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the postoperative 30-day mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate, failure pattern, and overall survival in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Beginning 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose, patients without progressive disease
      receive radiotherapy 1-2 times daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19.

      Patients undergo surgery within 3-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
