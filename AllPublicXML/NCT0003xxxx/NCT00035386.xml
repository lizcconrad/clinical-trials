  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of a modified procedure for treating obstructive
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OHC). Patients with OHC have a thickening of the heart muscle
      that obstructs blood flow out of the heart, causing breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations,
      tiredness, lightheadedness, and fainting.

      The current treatment for OHC is a procedure called alcohol septal ablation (also
      percutaneous transluminal septal ablation, or PTSA), which involves injecting a small amount
      of alcohol into a tiny artery that supplies the part of muscle causing blood flow
      obstruction. The success of PTSA is limited, however, by problems of heart anatomy and the
      ability to find the appropriate artery to inject. Modifying the procedure by injecting the
      alcohol through the wall of the lower right chamber of the heart may improve its safety and
      effectiveness. The new technique requires positioning a catheter (a flexible tube) into the
      appropriate area of the heart. This study will test the ability to accurately guide the
      catheter to that area.

      Patients with OHC 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to have a cardiac
      catheterization may be eligible for this study. At the end of the catheterization procedure,
      participants will undergo intra-cardiac echocardiographic imaging. For this test, one of the
      catheters placed in the femoral artery (at the top of the leg) for cardiac catheterization
      will be substituted for a larger one. Through this catheter, a special catheter will be
      introduced and advanced to the heart to provide images. This pilot feasibility study does not
      involve injection of alcohol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and drug-refractory symptoms have
      traditionally been referred for cardiac surgery to widen the left ventricular (LV) outflow
      tract. More recently, percutaneous transluminal septal ablation (PTSA) has also been shown to
      thin the subvalvular septum and thereby to reduce LV outflow pressure gradients and to
      improve symptoms in obstructive HCM. However, this procedure is not infrequently limited by
      septal coronary artery anatomy and inability to identify and cannulate the appropriate artery
      that supplies the septal region of interest. Some attempts are also associated with coronary
      artery dissection, particularly, if there is associated coronary artery disease. A
      trans-right ventricular (RV) alcohol septal ablation (TRVASA) would significantly simplify
      the procedure, and increase its safety. The purpose of this study is to initially test our
      ability to visualize and guide a delivery catheter to a targeted part of the anterior
      interventricular septum involved in the generation of the LV outflow obstruction using
      intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). No therapy is intended: alcohol will not be injected
      into the septum in this initial study.
