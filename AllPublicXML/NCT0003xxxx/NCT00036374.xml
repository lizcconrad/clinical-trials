      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of infliximab
      (Remicade) in patients with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if infliximab in combination with methotrexate is
      safe and effective in the treatment of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The
      second purpose of this study is to see how children's bodies react to the combination of
      study drug and methotrexate. Patients will receive either infliximab at 3 mg/kg for 44 weeks
      or, placebo for 14 weeks followed by infliximab at 6 mg/kg for 30 weeks. Patients who
      complete the original study are eligible for additional treatment with 3 to 6 mg/kg of
      infliximab every 8 weeks for up to three years. Safety evaluations will be performed at
      specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs
      (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse
      events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive either infliximab at
      3 mg/kg for 44 weeks or, placebo for 14 weeks followed by infliximab at 6 mg/kg for 30 weeks.
      Patients who complete the original study are eligible for additional treatment with 3 to 6
      mg/kg of infliximab every 8 weeks for up to three years

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) with
             polyarticular JRA for at least 6 months, systemic JRA with a polyarticular course and
             no systemic symptoms (including fever, rash,hepatosplenomegaly, and serositis) for 1
             year prior to study entry, or pauciarticular JRA with a polyarticular course for at
             least 6 months prior to study entry. The patient should have had at least 6 months of
             persistent synovitis before screening.

          -  The patient must have at least 5 joints with active arthritis (ie, presence of
             swelling, or if no swelling is present, limitation of motion accompanied by pain,
             tenderness, or both) at the time of enrollment, with at least 3 of these active joints
             having limitation of motion accompanied by pain, tenderness, or both

          -  The patient must be at least 4 years of age, but less than 18 years (ie, after the 4th
             but before the 18th birthday), with onset of disease before age 16.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not be pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy within 6 months after
             the last study infusion

          -  Patient must not be incapacitated, largely or wholly bedridden, or confined to a
             wheelchair, or have little or no ability for age-appropriate self care

          -  Patient must not have a rheumatic disease other than JRA or any current systemic
             inflammatory condition (for example, Lyme disease,fibromyalgia, enthesitis-related
             arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, infectious or reactive
             arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, or parvovirus infection)
