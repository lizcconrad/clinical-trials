    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Posaconazole (SCH
      56592) under an open label, treatment protocol for subjects with invasive fungal infections:

      A: which are refractory or resistant to standard antifungal therapies; B: for which there are
      currently no effective therapies; C: with a prior history of serious, severe or
      life-threatening toxicities while receiving antifungal therapy; D: with pre-existing organ
      dysfunction which precludes the administration of standard antifungal therapies.

      The current clinical trial is designed to provide posaconazole (SCH 56592) to subjects with
      invasive fungal infections a)which are refractory or resistant to standard antifungal
      therapies or b) for which there are currently no effective therapies. Subjects with such
      invasive fungal infections cannot be enrolled in controlled, randomized clinical trials.
      Secondly, this clinical trial is also designed to provide posaconazole (SCH 56592) to
      subjects with invasive fungal infections who c) have experienced serious or severe toxicities
      while receiving standard antifungal therapies or d) have pre-existing organ dysfunction such
      as renal dysfunction who require standard antifungal therapy which is precluded because of
      the toxicities associated with such therapy. This clinical trial also serves to allow
      collection of preliminary data regarding the safety and efficacy of posaconazole (SCH 56592)
      against a variety of invasive fungal infections which although serious and life-threatening
      are sufficiently rare so that they cannot be studied in a controlled, randomized clinical
      trial.
