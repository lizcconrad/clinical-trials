      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill
      tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of
      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with
      sargramostim may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or
      without sargramostim in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the safety of melanoma peptide vaccine with or without sargramostim (GM-CSF) in
           patients with high-risk or metastatic melanoma.

        -  Compare changes in peptide-specific cellular and humoral immunologic profiles in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare tumor response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive melanoma peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase leader injected
           at 2 separate sites, Melan-A ELA injected at another site, NY-ESO-1a and NY-ESO-1b
           combined and injected at one site, and MAGE-10.A2 injected at another site,
           intradermally once weekly on weeks 1-6.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccine as in arm I. Patients also receive sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning 2 days before each vaccination and continuing
           for 5 days.

      Treatment in both arms continues through week 6 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
