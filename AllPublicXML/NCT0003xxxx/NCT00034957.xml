    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Other specific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply. In order to determine eligibility,
        further examination by the investigator is necessary.

        Inclusion Criteria: Eligible patients must be at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of
        NSCLC that has gotten worse during or after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.
        Patients must have at least one tumor that can be evaluated by the doctor during the
        investigational drug treatment. Any side-effects from prior chemotherapy must have
        subsided, and blood and urine tests must show adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney
        function.

        Exclusion Criteria: Any of the following will exclude patients from study participation:
        receipt of more than 1 prior regimen of chemotherapy for NSCLC (repeat of the same
        chemotherapy at different points in time count as 1 regimen). Irradiation to 25% or more of
        bone marrow, prior high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell support, current
        participation in other clinical trials, pregnant or breast-feeding women, known
        HIV-positive or AIDS-related illness.
