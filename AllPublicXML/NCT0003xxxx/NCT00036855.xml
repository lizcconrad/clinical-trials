    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy with or
      without peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or
      refractory lymphoma. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and deliver
      radioactive tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem
      cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by anticancer
      therapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8) when preceded by rituximab in children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive
      lymphoma for which no autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (AuPBSCT) is
      planned. (Group A) If the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in group A is purely hematological,
      determine the MTD of IDEC-Y2B8 when combined with rituximab, AuPBSCT, and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      in a second group of children with recurrent or refractory CD20-positive lymphoma. (Group B)
      II. Determine the DLT of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these patients. III. Determine the
      dosimetry of indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan preceded by rituximab in these patients.

      IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of rituximab and IDEC-Y2B8 in these
      patients.

      V. Assess the immune cell depletion (B-cell and T-cell) and recovery in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      VI. Determine the human anti-mouse antibody response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A (no planned peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC] support): Patients receive rituximab IV
      over 4-6 hours followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10 minutes
      on day 0 and undergo whole body imaging. Patients may then receive rituximab IV over 4-6
      hours followed by IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day 7.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each subgroup (A1, A2, and A3) receive escalating doses of
      IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined (subgroup A1 closed as of
      10/8/04). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      Some patients receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 35.

      GROUP B (planned PBSC support): Patients receive rituximab, IDEC-In2B8, and IDEC-Y2B8 as in
      group A. Patients also receive autologous PBSC IV over 30-60 minutes on day 21 and filgrastim
      (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 22 and continuing until blood counts recover or day
      35.

      If the DLT in group A is purely hematological, cohorts of 3-6 patients in group B receive
      escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as in group A.

      Patients in both groups are followed at days 63, 90, 180, 365, and then annually thereafter.
