      RATIONALE: Microwave thermotherapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above
      body temperature.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of microwave thermotherapy
      before surgery to that of surgery alone in treating women who have stage I or stage II breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of preoperative focused microwave thermotherapy followed
           by surgery vs surgery alone in women with early-stage primary breast cancer.

        -  Compare the reduction of tumor cells at surgical margins and second incision rates in
           women treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the percentage of pathological cell death in women treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the amount of surgically removed breast and tumor tissue in women treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the measurement of the extent tumor margins of the surgically removed breast and
           tumor tissue in women treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to tumor classification (T1 vs T2) and participating center. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I:Patients undergo ultrasound-guided placement of a microwave sensor and a
           temperature probe (before or after compression of the breast) and external placement of
           2 large opposing microwave emitters and up to 7 skin temperature sensors on the
           compressed breast. Patients then receive focused microwave thermotherapy that slowly
           heats the primary breast tumor and deep proximal breast tissue. In the absence of undue
           heating of the skin, a tumor temperature of 48-52Â° C is targeted and maintained for an
           equivalent thermal dose of 140-180 minutes.

      Within 60 days of thermotherapy, patients undergo lumpectomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo lumpectomy only. Patients are followed at 30 and 90 days after
           surgery, and then at the discretion of the physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200-222 patients (100-111 per treatment arm) will be accrued
      for this study.
