      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain substances to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. Applying topical imiquimod before abnormal cervical cells are removed
      may be effective in preventing cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of applying topical imiquimod
      before abnormal cervical cells are removed in preventing cervical cancer in patients who have
      recurrent or persistent cervical neoplasia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the chemopreventive efficacy of topical imiquimod followed by local ablative or
           excisional therapy vs ablative/excisional therapy alone in patients with recurrent or
           high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of imiquimod in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, disease (primary vs recurrent or persistent), severity of dysplasia
      (grade I vs grade II vs grade III), current tobacco use (yes vs no), planned surgical
      procedure (excisional vs laser vs cryotherapy vs other), and time since first abnormal Pap
      smear, including pathology of ascus favor dysplasia (less than 1 year vs 1-3 years vs more
      than 3 years). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo ablative or excisional therapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients have topical imiquimod applied to the cervix for 6-10 hours twice
           weekly for a total of 5 doses. Within 3-4 weeks after the final application, patients
           undergo ablative or excisional therapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after last dose of study drug (arm II only), 3-5
      days after ablation or excisional therapy, at 3 months, and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 months until 2 consecutive normal Pap smears or colposcopic
      exams, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until 5 years after completion of study
      therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66-152 (33-76 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 18 months.
