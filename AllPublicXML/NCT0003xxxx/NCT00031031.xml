  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Kanglaite Injection (KLT)is a novel broad spectrum anti-cancer injection produced from
      traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (the Coix Seed). It was approved in China in 1995 and has
      become the most popular anti-cancer drug in China. In June of 2001, the Phase I study of KLT
      commenced at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah, with the objectives of 1)
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety profile of KLT in patients with
      refractory solid tumors; 2) To determine the pharmacokinetics of KLT in patients with
      refractory solid tumors; and 3) To gather preliminary efficacy data. The method of testing is
      open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study.
