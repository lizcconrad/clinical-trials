  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have
      stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded
      to previous treatment. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rates (confirmed, complete, and partial) in patients with platinum-
      and taxane-refractory stage III or IV ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated
      with imatinib mesylate.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate, preliminarily,
      CD117 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression levels with response in patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
