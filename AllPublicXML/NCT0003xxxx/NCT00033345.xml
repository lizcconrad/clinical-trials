      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Indole-3-carbinol may be effective in preventing breast
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of indole-3-carbinol in preventing breast
      cancer in nonsmoking women who are at high risk for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of indole-3-carbinol for the prevention of breast
           cancer in non-smoking women at high risk for breast cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on metabolites of estrogen in urine of these
           participants.

        -  Determine other additional effects of this drug on selected indicators of drug
           metabolism and reproductive and hormonal function in these participants.

        -  Assess any possible antineoplastic activity of this drug in these participants.

        -  Determine the quality of life of participants receiving this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-blind study.

      Participants ingest study compound twice daily on weeks 1-12 or 1-16. Study compound is
      dispensed on weeks 1, 5, and 9. At times, study compound is oral placebo, and at other times,
      oral indole-3-carbinol.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks during study therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 participants will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
