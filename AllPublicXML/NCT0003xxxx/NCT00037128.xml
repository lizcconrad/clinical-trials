      Lupus flares and other symptoms associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be
      caused by a deficiency of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). GL701 is an investigational new drug
      meant to enhance DHEA levels. This study is designed to evaluate both the safety and efficacy
      of GL701 in male lupus patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patient must have a diagnosis of SLE &gt; 6 months according to the 1989 revised ACR

             on NO glucocorticoid therapy) unchanged for &gt; 6 weeks prior to study entry (including
             both screening and qualifying visits). Prednisone dose in patient's receiving
             alternate day therapy will be the mean daily prednisone dose

          -  Patient treated with azathioprine, methotrexate, or hydrochloroquine must be on a
             stable dose with no change in dose for at least 6 weeks preceding the study

          -  Patient must be able to read and speak English and willing to sign an informed consent
             in English

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patient with elevated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

          -  Patient diagnosed with liver disease, defined as AST or ALT &gt; 3x the upper limit of
             normal

          -  Patient ingesting body building/anabolic steroids within the last 6 months preceding
             the study

          -  Patient with end stage renal disease or receiving hemodialysis treatment

          -  Patient with serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min

          -  Patient receiving treatment with ACTH within the 3 months preceding study entry

          -  Patient receiving androgens, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, or
             other immunosuppressive agents, except azathioprine, methotrexate, and
             hydrochloroquine within the last 3 months

          -  Patient with known hypersensitivity to DHEA or the inactive ingredients used in the
             GL70l formulation (cornstarch, lactose, and magnesium stearate)

          -  Patient who participated in any prior DHEA study or administration of DHEA within the
             past 3 months

          -  Patient using any investigational agents within the longer of 30 days or 10 half-lives
             of the agent

          -  Patient with any condition which in the Investigator's or sponsor's opinion is
