      This study will use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for subtle
      differences in brain anatomy between patients with focal hand dystonia (also called writer s
      cramp) and healthy normal volunteers. Patients with hand dystonia have prolonged muscle
      contractions that cause sustained twisting movements and abnormal postures. These abnormal
      movements often occur with activities such as writing, typing, playing certain musical
      instruments such as guitar or piano, or playing golf or darts.

      Patients with focal hand dystonia and healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this study.
      Patients will be recruited from NINDS s database of patients with focal hand dystonia.
      Volunteers will be selected to match the patients in age, sex and handedness.

      This study involves two visits to the NIH Clinical Center. The first visit is a screening
      visit, in which patients and volunteers will have a medical history, physical examination,
      neurological examination, and assessment of handedness. Women of childbearing age will be
      screened with a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are exclude from this study.

      Those who join the study will return for a second visit for magnetic resonance imaging. MRI
      uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. For the procedure, the
      participant lies still on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder
      containing the magnet). Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical
      switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. The scan will last about
      45 to 60 minutes, at most. Some volunteers may be asked to return for a third visit to obtain
      a second MRI on a different scanner.

      Objective

      The term, dystonia, is used to describe a syndrome characterized by prolonged muscle
      contractions causing sustained twisting movements and abnormal postures of the affected body
      part(s). Although no structural brain abnormalities have been definitively demonstrated in
      the visual inspection of MRI scans from patients with primary focal dystonia, there are
      several lines of evidence for subtle structural brain abnormalities at both the subcortical
      and cortical levels. We hypothesize that those abnormalities might be detected by using
      appropriate acquisition and analysis methods.

      Study population

      This research will be conducted using patients with primary focal dystonia and normal
      volunteers.

      Design

      By using high-resolution 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 3 Tesla and high
      resolution anatomical images at 7 Tesla, we will detect structural changes in patients with
      primary focal dystonia in comparison with control subjects. VBM and DTI are methods
      implemented in the statistical parametric mapping software (SPM2). Magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) will use special software to calculate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
      levels in a region of interest.

      Outcome measures

      VBM and DTI analysis in SPM2 will enable us to make a voxel-wise comparison of local
      concentration/volume of gray/white matter among these groups of subjects. This study can lead
      to an improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of primary hand dystonia can help to
      elucidate dystonia s pathogenesis/etiology and may lead to specific preventative or
      therapeutic approaches. The MRS study will enable us to study GABA levels in the sensory
      motor cortices, prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in primary dystonia patients and normal
      subjects.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS: Healthy volunteers who consented to participate in the study and
        matched for age, sex, handedness with the group of patients with primary focal hand
        dystonia.

        PATIENTS: Patient with primary focal dystonia from our dystonia patient database who
        consented to participate in the study. This criterion will be established by the
        preliminary screening in the Human Motor Control Outpatient Clinic.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The following subjects will be excluded:

        Healthy volunteers with cognitive complaints, abnormal neurological exam or history of past
        neurological disease.

        Dystonia patients with the presence of a second neurological disease or condition; abnormal
        neurological findings on exam that are not related to primary focal dystonia.

        Subjects with past or present neuropsychiatric illness, head trauma with loss of
        consciousness, epilepsy, cerebro-vascular disease, migraine, past and present history of
        alcohol abuse, medical conditions that may alter cerebral structure.

        Subjects with abnormal MRI findings at visual inspection (prominent normal variants such as
        mega cisterna or cavum septum pellucidum, signs of severe cortical or subcortical atrophy,
        brain tumors, vascular diseases, trauma or AVMs).

        Subjects with any metallic objects within them just prior to MR imaging (cardiac or neural
        pacemaker, aneurysm clips [metal clips on the wall of a large artery], metallic prostheses
        [including heart valves and cochlear implants] or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal
        workers are also at risk for injury and may not take part in the study because of possible
        small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware.

        Subjects not capable of giving an informed consent.

        Women who are pregnant
