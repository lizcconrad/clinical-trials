  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MTC-DOX is Doxorubicin or DOX, a chemotherapy drug, that is adsorbed, or made to &quot;stick&quot;, to
      magnetic beads (MTCs). MTCs are tiny, microscopic particles of iron and carbon. When DOX is
      added to MTCs, DOX attaches to the carbon part of the MTCs. MTC-DOX is directed to and
      deposited in the area of a tumor, where it is thought that it then &quot;leaks&quot; through the blood
      vessel walls. Once in the surrounding tissues, it is thought that Doxorubicin becomes &quot;free
      from&quot; the magnetic beads and will then be able to act against the tumor cells. The iron
      component of the particle has magnetic properties, making it possible to direct MTC-DOX to
      specific tumor sites in the liver by placing a magnet on the body surface. It is hoped that
      MTC-DOX used with the magnet may target the chemotherapy directly to liver tumors and provide
      a treatment to patients with liver cancer.

      To be sure of the effect of MTC-DOX on liver cancer, it will be compared to the effect of
      Doxorubicin given through the vein.

      The study treatments will be administered every three weeks, (which is considered a study
      treatment cycle), until you complete six treatment cycles, the tumor grows, disappears, or
      you experience a side effect, which may cause you to leave the study. Follow-up visits will
      occur on Days 3, 10, and 21 following treatment in the first cycle and Days 7 and 21 for the
      remaining cycles, and also 60 days after you receive your last treatment cycle.

      Therefore, the purpose of this Phase 2/3 study is to evaluate safety, tolerance, and efficacy
      (survival time) of an MTC-DOX dosing strategy where the DOX dose is determined by tumor size

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients may be enrolled into this protocol only if all of the following inclusion criteria
        are met:

          -  Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by CT scan and meets the criteria
             described in Section 23.

          -  Total combined cross-sectional area of all hepatic tumors as determined by CT scan is
             between 4 and 200 cm2.

          -  Center of the tumor(s) mass must be &lt;/= 14 cm from the anterior lateral abdominal wall
             as determined by cross-sectional imaging at baseline. This is required for optimal
             placement of the magnet. If more than one tumor mass is present, all of the tumor
             masses must meet this criterion.

          -  Is ambulatory with a Karnofsky performance status score &gt; 60 and an estimated life
             expectancy of &gt; 3 months.

          -  Is judged by the investigator to have the initiative and means to be compliant with
             the protocol and be within geographical proximity to allow follow-up.

          -  Have the ability to give informed written consent prior to initiation of therapy.

          -  If female and of childbearing potential,must have a negative beta-HCG prior to
             receiving treatment.

          -  Must agree to use an effective method of contraception

        Patients will be excluded from enrollment if any of the following apply:

          -  Has a history of cancer other than hepatocellular (excluding resected basal cell
             carcinoma; or curatively resected stage 1 or less cervical cancer if disease free for
             5 years or more).

          -  Has had prior local radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks, mediastinal radiation
             therapy within the last 3 months, or chemotherapy within the last 4 weeks.

          -  Diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma or disease that precludes delivery of the drug to the
             tumor via a vessel that feeds the tumor.

          -  Has another active medical condition(s) or organ disease(s) that may either compromise
             patient safety or interfere with the safety and/or outcome (e.g., survival) evaluation
             of the study drugs. While this exclusion is not limited to the following
             abnormalities, if any of the following laboratory abnormalities are present, the
             patient should be excluded:

        WBC &lt; 2,000 /uL Platelets &lt; 50,000/uL Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 gm/dL Total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/dL
        ALT or AST &gt;/= 5 x upper limit of normal Serum Creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL INR &gt;/= 1.5

          -  Has cardiac dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.

          -  Has clinically significant pulmonary impairment

          -  Plans concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal and/or biological
             treatment for cancer including immunotherapy while on study.

          -  Has an indwelling cardiac pacemaker, cerebral aneurysm clips, or any other indwelling
             device or appliance that could be adversely affected by the use of the external
             magnet.

          -  Has documented evidence of hemachromatosis or hemosiderosis.

          -  Has CT or ultrasound evidence of portal vein invasion or thrombosis.

          -  Prior orthotopic hepatic transplant.

          -  Has received previous treatment with doxorubicin, idarubicin, and/or other
             anthracyclines or anthracenes.

          -  Has a known allergy to doxorubicin, MTC-DOX or any of their components.

          -  Has been treated with any investigational drug, investigational biologic, or
             investigational therapeutic device within 30 days of initiating study treatment.
