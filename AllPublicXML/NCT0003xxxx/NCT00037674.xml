  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topiramate
      compared with lithium or placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in
      patients with Bipolar I Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of two dose levels of topiramate (200 and 400 milligrams/day) compared with
      lithium and placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with Biplar
      I Disorder. The trial consists of 3 phases: a screening period; double-blind treatment for 12
      weeks; and an optional open-label period of at least 6 months. Efficacy assessments include
      the change from baseline to Day 21 for the total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score. Also
      included as efficacy assessments during the 12 week study are the Global Assessment Scale
      (GAS), Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
      (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and health-related quality of life measures at
      specified time intervals. Safety assessments include evaluation of adverse events throughout
      the study, rate of withdrawal from the study due to adverse events, and vital signs (blood
      pressure and pulse) througout the study, as well as changes in clinical laboratory tests
      (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations at
      specified times. The study hypothesis is that the change from baseline in Young Mania Rating
      Scale (YMSR) total score at Day 21 will be significantly better for the topiramate groups
      than for the placebo group and that the study drug will be well tolerated by the patients.
      Topiramate: oral tablets (50 milligrams[mg]); increasing from once daily (50mg) to 3-times
      daily; target total daily dose 200mg or 400mg, maintained through Week 12. Lithium: oral
      capsules (300mg); increasing from once daily (300mg) to three-times daily; target total daily
      dose 1500-1800 mg.
