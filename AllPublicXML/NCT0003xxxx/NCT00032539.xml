    <textblock>
      Patients in 'parent' cooperative study projects are interviewed about their experiences in
      the informed consent process.

      Intervention: (1) Cognitive stratification (obtained by a test of cognitive ability, followed
      by a tailored IC process); (2) Pre-recruitment video (a patient-activation video designed to
      prevent several common misconceptions; (3) Provide prospective research volunteers with a
      sense of the purpose and methods of controlled research); and (4) Evaluation of the informed
      consent process using the Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol (BICEP) developed in
      EQUIC-DP.

      Primary Hypothesis: The validity of informed consent can be improved, as measured by an
      independent interview of patients (BICEP), by at least one of three interventions described
      above.

      Primary Outcomes: The quality of the informed consent process, as measured by the BICEP
      (Brief Informed Consent Evaluation Protocol). The BICEP also offers a method to certify
      informed consent in routine use.

      Study Abstract: Customized Consent will develop and test an innovative, supplemental method
      of disclosing information to patients in the informed consent process. This disclosure
      strategy is intended to increase patients' understanding and satisfaction with the consent
      process. This study has two goals:

        -  to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to improve comprehension during
           informed consent; and

        -  to identify those patients for whom this intervention is most effective.

      The primary goal of EQUIC-CC is to determine whether an intervention, added to usual
      procedures for obtaining informed consent, is able to improve comprehension. The second goal
      of EQUIC-CC is to identify those patients for whom an augmented consent intervention is most
      effective, as well as to determine which subgroups of patients, if any, are most likely to
      benefit from visual information added to the usual disclosure phase of obtaining informed
      consent.
