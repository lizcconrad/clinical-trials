      The purpose of this study is to determine if PEG-Intron is better tolerated and more
      efficacious than standard interferons (Roferon, Intron) in patients with
      Philadelphia-positive Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. These patients should have previously
      received standard interferon therapy and have been intolerant, resistant, or have relapsed
      disease.

      It has been shown that patients who experience complete hematologic or at least a partial
      cytogenetic response to interferon will have improved survival times. In addition, evidence
      exists that even patients who do not demonstrate a cytogenetic response to interferon
      treatment can still benefit from treatment, in terms of survival, compared to patients not
      treated with interferon. This indicates that if a patient is better able to tolerate
      interferon, he or she may have improved survival even without cytogenetic response.
      Preliminary studies suggest that PEG-Intron is more convenient for patients (administered
      once weekly rather than daily), is better tolerated than interferon, and can produce
      hematologic remission in interferon-a resistant patients. Phase II studies are needed to
      ascertain the overall hematologic and cytogenetic response rates to PEG-Intron in such
      patients.
