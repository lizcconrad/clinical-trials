        Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Male 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, stage D1 or D2.

          -  Failure of androgen ablation (orchiectomy or LHRH, flutamide).

          -  Patients must have PSA progression and progression in measurable disease.

          -  No prior history of systemic chemotherapy.

          -  No investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  No radiation therapy or hormonal therapy within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  No isotope therapy within 6 weeks of study entry.

          -  No antiandrogens within 4 weeks of study entry. Patients must continue LHRH.

          -  If patients had prior surgery, it must be at least 21 days prior to study entry, and
             the patient must have recovered from all side effects.

          -  Patients must have stopped bisphosphonates 28 days prior to study entry.

          -  No prior malignancy allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
             skin cancer, or adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is
             currently in remission, and has been disease free for at least 5 years.

          -  Patients must have recovered from major infections and/or surgical procedures, and in
             the opinion of the investigator not have significant active concurrent medical
             illness, such as a history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders
             including psychotic disorders, dementia, or seizures that would preclude protocol
             treatment or survival.

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of the study and must sign
             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines.

          -  No other chemotherapeutic, biological response modifiers, radiation therapy,
             corticosteroid therapy, or hormonal concomitant therapy (except continuation of LHRH)
             may be given during treatment. Patients should not be planning on receiving
             concomitant bisphosphonates.

          -  ECOG Performance Status = 0-3.

          -  WBC &gt; or = 3500/ul or ANC &gt; or = 1500/ul.

          -  Bilirubin &lt; or = ULN.

          -  Creatinine &lt; or = 2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Platelets &gt; or = 100,000/ul.
