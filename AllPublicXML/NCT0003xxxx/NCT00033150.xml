      Brief Summary:

      Nearly 7% of elementary school children present with difficulties learning and using
      language. Unfortunately, language impairments are often long lasting and may have serious
      social, academic, and vocational ramifications. More than 1 million children receive language
      intervention in the public schools each year, and many more are seen in hospitals and other
      clinical settings.

      This randomized clinical trial compares the language outcomes of Fast ForWord to two other
      interventions (computer assisted language intervention without acoustically modified speech
      and individual language intervention) and to the outcomes of an academic enrichment (control)
      condition. Each year for 3 years, children will be randomly assigned to each of the four
      conditions at three regional sites (Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, and Lawrence, Kansas). The
      treatments will be administered in special summer programs. The primary research question is
      which intervention results in the most improvement in the composite language score from the
      Oral and Written Language Scales. Secondary questions include which intervention results in
      the greatest gains in conversational language,which intervention results in the greatest
      gains 3 and 6 months after training, which intervention results in the greatest improvement
      in auditory perception, and which intervention is the most cost effective.

      The results of the study will have theoretical and practical value. Theoretically, the study
      tests the temporal processing hypothesis of language impairment. Practically, the study will
      describe and compare the language, communication, auditory processing and academic outcomes
      of different language interventions. The study will help clinicians and administrators choose
      the most effective and least expensive treatment for the children they serve.
