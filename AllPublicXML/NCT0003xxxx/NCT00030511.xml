      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so
      that it can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy with
      fluorouracil before surgery in treating patients who have primary or recurrent bile duct
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate in patients with primary or recurrent biliary
           duct carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy and fluorouracil followed by
           surgical resection.

        -  Determine the tumor response, morbidity, failure patterns (locoregional vs distant), and
           survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily five days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients receive
      fluorouracil IV over 12 hours each day radiotherapy is administered. Four to six weeks after
      completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection. Patients with residual
      disease after resection may undergo boost radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression and then every 16 weeks after
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-47 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
