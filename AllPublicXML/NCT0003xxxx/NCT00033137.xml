  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the genetic cause of Birt Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome and the
      relationship of this disorder to kidney cancer. BHD is a rare inherited condition
      characterized by papules, or bumps benign tumors involving hair follicles on the head and
      neck. People with BHD are at increased risk of developing kidney cancer. Scientists have
      identified the chromosome (strand of genetic material in the cell nucleus) that contains the
      BHD gene and the region of the gene on the chromosome. This study will try to learn more
      about:

        -  The characteristics and type of kidney tumors associated with BHD

        -  The risk of kidney cancer in people with BHD

        -  Whether more than one gene causes BHD

        -  The genetic mutations (changes) responsible for BHD

      Patients with known or suspected Birt Hogg-Dube syndrome, and their family members, may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a family history and review of
      medical records, including pathology reports for tumors, and films of computed tomography
      (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

      Participants may undergo various tests and procedures, including the following:

        -  Physical examination

        -  Review of personal and family history with a cancer doctor, cancer nurses, kidney
           surgeon, and genetic counselor

        -  Chest and other x-rays

        -  Ultrasound (imaging study using sound waves)

        -  MRI (imaging study using radiowaves and a magnetic field)

        -  CT scans of the chest and abdomen (imaging studies using radiation)

        -  Blood tests for blood chemistries and genetic testing

        -  Skin evaluation, including a skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small skin tissue sample
           for microscopic evaluation)

        -  Cheek swab or mouthwash to collect cells for genetic analysis

        -  Lung function studies

        -  Medical photography of skin lesions

      These tests will be done on an outpatient basis in either one day or over 3 to 4 days. When
      the studies are complete, participants will receive counseling about the findings and
      recommendations. Patients with kidney lesions may be asked to return periodically, such as
      every 3 to 36 months, based on their individual condition, to document the rate of
      progression of the lesions.

      Background

        -  BHD is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited disorder which confers susceptibility to
           develop multifocal, bilateral renal cancer, spontaneous pneumothorax and
           fibrofolliculomas.

        -  BHD is caused by mutations in the BHD gene located on Chromosome17p11.2.

        -  Defining the genetic and biochemical pathways leading to renal tumorigenesis in BHD may
           lead to the development of new molecularly targeted drugs.

      Objectives

        -  To define the types and characteristics (including patterns of growth) of renal cancer
           associated with BHD.

        -  To determine the risk of renal cancer, lung cysts and fibrofollicullomas in patients
           with BHD.

        -  To define the natural history of BHD related renal tumors.

        -  To determine if other genes contribute to BHD.

        -  Identify genotype / phenotype correlations.

      Eligibility

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed fibrofolliculomas.

        -  Patients with clinical evidence of multiple skin papules consistent with
           fibrofolliculomas, and a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax or kidney cancer.

        -  A relative of a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of BHD.

        -  Patients with a known germline BHD mutation.

      Design

        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis, determine size
           and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and metastatic potential
           of renal tumors.

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations the BHD
           gene and to assess the relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.
