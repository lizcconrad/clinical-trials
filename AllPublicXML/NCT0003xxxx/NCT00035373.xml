  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate patients with tumors of the central nervous system
      (CNS) for eligibility in the National Cancer Institute s research studies. These patients
      will undergo a series of procedures, usually including a complete medical history and
      physical examination; laboratory testing of blood, CSF, urine, bone marrow, or other samples;
      an evaluation of tumor location and size by x-rays, CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic
      resonance imaging) scans, or nuclear medicine scans; lumbar puncture; electrocardiogram and
      echocardiogram; and procedures to evaluate the function of specific organs. A bone marrow
      biopsy is occasionally performed. Research samples may also be collected and stored to avoid
      having to do a painful test more than once. Tissue specimens collected during this process
      may be stored and used in future studies.

      Patients of both genders, any age, and all racial and ethnic groups with tumors of the CNS or
      a history of a CNS tumor are eligible. Up to 100 people are expected to participate.

      The physician will discuss the results of these procedures with the patient and his or her
      family. On the basis of the eligibility screening and the patient s wishes, the patient may
      then be enrolled in a primary research protocol.

      BACKGROUND:

      -Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 yrs of age) with tumors of the central nervous
      system who are being evaluated by the Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) for National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) primary research protocols will be entered onto this screening protocol for
      eligibility screening.

      OBJECTIVE:

      - Evaluate patients with tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS) for eligibility in
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) research protocols.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Patients with tumors of the CNS or a history of a CNS tumor who are being evaluated for
      protocols within the National Cancer Institute.

      DESIGN:

        -  The screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols
           will be conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.

        -  These procedures may include, but are not limited to, laboratory tests on blood, CSF,
           urine, or other specimens, and radiographic and nuclear medicine studies, which may
           require the administration of contrast or a radioisotopic tracer.

        -  This protocol will also allow for evaluation of existing tumor specimens to determine if
           targets are present, when applicable.

        -  In some cases, specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may
           be collected during the screening process in order to prevent us from having to subject
           the patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions (e.g., bone marrow
           aspirations).

        -  Research specimens will be discarded, if the patient is not eligible for or elects not
           to enroll on the primary research protocol. A total of 3000 patients will be enrolled.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 yrs of age) with tumors of the CNS or a history
        of a CNS tumor who are being evaluated for protocols within the National Cancer Institute.

        All patients or their previously designated LAR (Legally Authorized Representative) (if the
        patient is deemed by the treating physician to be impaired or questionably impaired in such
        a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable) must sign
        an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this
        study and the risks of the procedures that will be performed to assess eligibility for
        primary research protocols.
