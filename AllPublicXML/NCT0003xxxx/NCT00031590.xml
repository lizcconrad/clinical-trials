      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining low-dose radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy may be effective in
      treating primitive neuroectodermal tumor and medulloblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving low-dose radiation therapy together with
      combination chemotherapy after surgery to see how well it works in treating children with
      newly diagnosed primitive neuroectodermal tumor or medulloblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Reduce the late cognitive, auditory, and endocrinologic effects in children with newly
           diagnosed standard-risk posterior fossa primitive neuroectodermal tumor or
           medulloblastoma by reducing the adjuvant craniospinal radiotherapy dose by 25%, but
           maintaining a therapeutic efficacy (86% 3-year relapse-free survival) of current
           standard therapy by using maintenance chemotherapy comprising lomustine, cisplatin, and
           vincristine alternated with cyclophosphamide and etoposide.

        -  Evaluate the acute and subacute toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the late neurotoxic effects of low-dose craniospinal radiotherapy, in terms of
           cognitive, endocrinologic, and auditory function, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Adjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after prior resection,
           patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis 5 days a week for 2 weeks and
           then conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Beginning 1 week
           after the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive vincristine IV weekly for 6
           weeks.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction
           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive two 6-week courses of regimen A as outlined below
           alternated with one 6-week course of regimen B as outlined below for a total of 9
           courses (6 courses of regimen A and 3 courses of regimen B).

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive oral lomustine and cisplatin IV over 8 hours on day 0
                and vincristine IV on days 0, 7, and 14.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 0 and 1 and etoposide IV on
                days 0 and 1 and then orally on days 14-34.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

    <description>All subjects will undergo routine surgical staging of their tumor. Treatment must begin within 28 days of surgery. Craniospinal Radiation therapy will last for 6 weeks, five days per week. Once a week during radiation, subjects will also be treated with vincristine. 4 weeks after radiation and vincristine treatment is completed, all subjects will begin 9 cycles (each cycle lasts 6 weeks) of &quot;maintenance chemotherapy&quot; which will be given as 2 different drug combinations, Regimen A (Lomustine, Vincristine, and Cisplatin) and Regimen B (Cyclophosphamide, given with Mesna, and Etoposide) which will be given in the following order (total of 54 weeks):1st-Regimen A, 2nd-Regimen A, 3rd-Regimen B, 4th-Regimen A, 5th-Regimen A, 6th-Regimen B, 7th-Regimen A, 8th-Regimen A, 9th-Regimen B</description>
