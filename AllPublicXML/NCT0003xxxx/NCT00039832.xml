  <brief_summary>

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two types of blood thinners,
      abciximab (ReoPro) and reteplase (Retavase) for restoring normal brain blood flow after
      ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain).

      The only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke is the
      clot buster drug rt-PA. This treatment, however, is effective only if begun within 3 hours of
      onset of the stroke and most patients do not get to the hospital early enough to benefit from
      it. There is thus a pressing need to develop effective stroke treatments that can be
      initiated more than 3 hours after onset.

      Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have experienced a mild or moderate acute stroke
      between 3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      will be screened with a physical examination, blood tests and a magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scan (if an MRI was not done during the stroke evaluation).

      All participants will receive ReoPro. Some will also receive Retavase, which may boost the
      effectiveness of ReoPro. Retavase is administered in a single dose through a needle in the
      vein over 2 minutes. ReoPro is infused into the vein over 12 hours. Patients will be
      monitored with physical examinations, blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and three
      or four MRI scans of the brain to evaluate both the response to treatment and side effects of
      the drugs. An MRI scan will be done 24 hours, 5 days and 30 days after starting the study
      medication, and possibly during screening for this study.

      CT involves the use of specialized x-rays to obtain images of the brain. The patient lies
      still in the scanner for a short time while the X-ray images are formed. MRI uses a strong
      magnetic field and radio waves to demonstrate structural and chemical changes in tissue. MRI
      is more sensitive than x-ray in evaluating acute stroke. The patient lies on a table in a
      metal cylinder (the scanner) while the pictures are being taken. During part of the MRI, a
      medicine called gadolinium contrast is injected in a vein. This medicine brightens the
      images, creating better pictures of the blood flow.

      Objectives: This is a clinical trial to determine an acceptable dose of reteplase in
      combination with a fixed dose of abciximab for ischemic stroke 3-24 hours from onset.

      Study Population: Patients will be selected by criteria to minimize likelihood of toxicity
      and maximize likelihood of response. These criteria include age 18-80 years old, acute
      ischemic stroke of moderate severity (NIH Stroke Scale less than or equal to 16 and lesion
      volume on diffusion MRI less than approximately one third of the volume of the middle
      cerebral artery territory), positive MRI evidence of hypoperfusion corresponding to the acute
      stroke symptoms, no MRI evidence of chronic micro-hemorrhages, and no other clinical,
      radiological or laboratory features associated with risk of hemorrhage with thrombolytic
      therapy.

      Design: The study is open-label, dose escalation, safety and proof of principle study of the
      combination of intravenous abciximab and reteplase. A fixed dose of abciximab will be used in
      all patients: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (to a maximum of 30 mg) followed by a 0.125
      microgram/kg/minute infusion (to a maximum of 10.0 microgram/minute) for 12 hours. The five
      dosing groups for the reteplase dose are 0 U, 2.5 U, 5.0 U, 7.5 U, and 10.0 U. A maximum of
      72 patients will be treated using an adaptive statistical design, in which data on both the
      response and toxicity will be used to determine the dose for subsequent patients, thereby
      minimizing exposure to either ineffective or toxic doses. Non-investigational patient
      management will be standardized across all patients according to the NIH Stroke Center
      Clinical Care Pathway.

      Outcome Measures: The primary efficacy endpoint for response will be reperfusion by MRI 24
      hours after start of therapy. The primary safety endpoint for determination of toxicity will
      be any one of the following: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major systemic
      hemorrhage, or other serious adverse event related to study drug administration, including
      death, within 48 hours from start of therapy. The maximum acceptable rate of toxicity will be
      10% of patients treated at any dose level and the minimum acceptable rate of response will be
      50% of patients treated at any dose level. The outcomes will be monitored by a Data and
      Safety Monitoring Committee, which will have the authority to stop or recommend modifications
      of the trial for safety concerns. Other clinical outcome variables and imaging variables will
      be recorded and analyzed in secondary and exploratory analyses. If an acceptable dose is
      identified, then that will be investigated in a subsequent randomized placebo-controlled
      trial.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients may be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with onset between 3 and 24 hours prior to planned
             start of study drugs. Acute ischemic stroke is defined as a measurable neurological
             deficit of sudden onset, presumed secondary to focal cerebral ischemia, and not
             otherwise attributable to ICH or another disease process. Stroke onset will be defined
             as the time the patient was last known to be without the new clinical deficit.
             Patients whose deficits have worsened in the last 24 hours are not eligible if their
             first symptoms started more than 24 hours before. If the stroke started during sleep,
             stroke onset will be recorded as the time the patient was last known to be intact. A
             careful history is important to determine when the patient was last without the
             presenting deficits.

          2. Disabling neurological deficit attributable to the acute stroke at the start of study
             drugs.

          3. NIHSS less than or equal to 16.

          4. Evidence on PWI MRI of a perfusion defect corresponding to the acute stroke syndrome
             of at least 2cm in diameter in both long and short axis in any slice. The PWI will be
             assessed by relative mean transit time (MTT) images. The MRI evaluation must involve
             echo planar diffusion weighted imaging, MRA, and MRI perfusion. A normal appearing MRA
             with an appropriate perfusion defect is eligible. An apparent stenosis or occlusion on
             MRA with normal appearing perfusion distally will not be eligible. Poor quality or
             uninterpretable MRA will not make patient ineligible. Patients who have a normal DWI
             are eligible.

          5. Age 18 - 80 years, inclusive.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

        General:

          1. Current participation in another study with an investigational drug or device within,
             prior participation in the present study, or planned participation in another
             therapeutic trial, prior to the final assessment in this trial.

          2. Time interval since stroke onset of less than 24 hours impossible to determine with
             high degree of confidence.

          3. Symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if CT or MRI scan is negative for
             hemorrhage.

          4. Evidence of acute myocardial infarction defined as having at least two of the
             following three features: 1.) Chest pain suggestive of cardiac ischemia; 2.) EKG
             findings of ST elevation of greater than 0.2 mV in 2 contiguous leads, new onset left
             bundle branch block, ST segment depression, or T-wave inversion; 3.) Elevated troponin
             I

          5. Contraindication to MRI scan.

          6. Women known to be pregnant, lactating or having a positive or indeterminate pregnancy
             test.

          7. Patients who would refuse blood transfusions if medically indicated.

             Stroke Related:

          8. Neurological deficit that has led to stupor or coma (NIHSS level of consciousness

         16. Incomplete or uninterpretable DWI and PWI.

         17. DWI abnormality larger than approximately one third of the territory of the middle
             cerebral artery territory by qualitative assessment.

         18. Satellite DWI hyperintensity with corresponding hyperintensity on T2 weighted image or
             FLAIR in a vascular territory different than the index stroke (this is evidence of a
             new ischemic lesion possibly greater than 24 hours in duration).

             Safety Related:

         19. Persistent hypertension with systolic BP greater than 185 mmHg or diastolic BP greater
             than 110 mmHg (mean of 3 consecutive arm cuff readings over 20-30 minutes), not
             controlled by antihypertensive therapy or requiring nitroprusside for control.

         20. Anticipated need for major surgery within 72 hours after start of study drugs, e.g.,
             carotid endarterectomy, hip fracture repair.

         28. Major hemorrhage in past 21 days.

         29. Major surgery, serious trauma, lumbar puncture, arterial puncture at a
             non-compressible site, or biopsy of a parenchymal organ in last 14 days. Major
             surgical procedures include but are not limited to the following: major thoracic or
             abdominopelvic surgery, neurosurgery, major limb surgery, carotid endarterectomy or
             other vascular surgery, and organ transplant. For non-listed procedures, the operating
