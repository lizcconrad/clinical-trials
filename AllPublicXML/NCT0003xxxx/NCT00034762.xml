      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone compared with
      placebo in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is frequently observed in the elderly, often associated with psychotic symptoms such
      as delusion or hallucinations, or with behavioral disturbances such as aggressive behavior,
      wandering, and aimless behavior induced by the psychotic symptoms. This is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness and safety of risperidone (taken twice daily
      over 8 weeks) in the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
      Assessments of effectiveness include: Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease
      (BEHAVE-AD), a scale used for global assessment of symptoms associated with dementia; the
      Psychosis Cluster Scale of BEHAVE-AD, a subscale that assesses paranoid and delusional
      ideation as well as hallucination; and Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C), a measure
      of an improved or aggravated condition. Safety evaluations include the incidence of adverse
      events throughout the study; physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory
      tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), and assessment of extrapyramidal symptoms at
      specified intervals. The study hypothesis is that treatment with risperidone shows greater
      improvement in psychotic symptoms, as measured by the BEHAVE-AD psychotic cluster score, in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease, as compared to placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized
      that risperidone is well tolerated. Risperidone tablets (0.25 mg or 0.50 mg) or placebo
      tablets taken orally twice daily. Total daily dosage of 0.5mg on Day 1, 1.0mg on Days 3-5,
      and 1.5mg (maximum dose) on Days 5-13. Optimum dose maintained during Weeks 3-8 of
      treatment.Dose may be increased or decreased at investigator's discretion.
