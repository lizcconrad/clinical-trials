      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response. Combining
      vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 and either alum or sargramostim may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy
      with interleukin-12 and either alum or sargramostim in treating patients who have undergone
      surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the immune reactivity in patients with resected stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV
           melanoma vaccinated with tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 peptides emulsified with
           Montanide ISA-51 with interleukin-12 and either alum adjuvant or sargramostim (GM-CSF).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage
      (cutaneous stage IIB, IIC, III, and IV vs ocular and mucosal stage III and IV). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccine with tyrosinase:368-376 (370D)/gp100:209-217
           (210M)/MART-1:26-27 (27L) peptides emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51), low-dose
           interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously (SC), and alum adjuvant SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3,
           5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive peptide vaccine emulsified with ISA-51, high-dose IL-12 SC, and
           alum adjuvant SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive peptide vaccine emulsified with ISA-51 on day 1 and low-dose
           IL-12 SC and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27,
           and 53.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
