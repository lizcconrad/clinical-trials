    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation study is to evaluate an
      investigational monoclonal antibody administered as a first-line therapy to patients with
      acute, Grade II, III, or IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Patients will be eligible for
      enrollment within 24 hours of beginning standard steroid treatment. The research is being
      conducted at up to 10 clinical research sites in the US.

      A Phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation pilot study designed to obtain preliminary safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy information on visilizumab administered as a first-line
      therapy to patients with acute, Grade II, III, or IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). It is
      anticipated that up to 34 patients at up to 10 study centers could be eligible for enrollment
      in this study. Patients will be eligible for enrollment within 24 hours of beginning standard
      steroid treatment (2 mg/kg of methylprednisolone IV, or 10 mg/kg hydrocortisone IV, per day).
      Steroids will be rapidly tapered over one week following visilizumab administration.
