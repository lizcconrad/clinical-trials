  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study using I-131 Iodocholesterol which is an experimental
      radioactive chemical that when injected into the vein, is picked up in the adrenal glands and
      permits visualization with gamma imaging devices. These images are used in diagnosing a
      variety of adrenal abnormalities.Prior to the injection of I-131 Iodocholesterol, the patient
      will receive perchlorate capsules to block any uptake of I-131 by the thyroid gland if this
      is deemed important. The patient will continue to take these capsules throughout the period
      of imaging, which may last up to 1 week. The injection of I-131 Iodocholesterol will be given
      into a vein and the patient will return for images on at least 1 and possibly 2 occasions
      between 3-7 days after injection. If the case requires it, the patient may also be given a
      steroid in tablet form, dexamethasone, to take orally prior to and after the injection to
      suppress normal adrenal function so that the abnormal tissues can be more easily detected.
