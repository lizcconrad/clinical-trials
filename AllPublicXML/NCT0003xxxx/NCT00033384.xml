      RATIONALE: CI-1040 may stop the growth of tumors by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer
      cell growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CI-1040 in treating patients who have
      metastatic or unresectable breast, colon, pancreatic, or non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of CI-1040 in patients with non-small cell lung,
           breast, colon, or pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life (overall and for each tumor type) of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the relationship between study drug concentration and antitumor response in
           these patients and target suppression and safety of this drug.

        -  Correlate target suppression (pERK) with antitumor effects of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate the mRNA expression profile of the tumors with antitumor effects of this drug
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (non-small cell lung vs breast vs colon vs pancreas).

      Patients receive oral CI-1040 twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 28 days during the first 6 months of
      study therapy.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52-172 patients (13-43 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
