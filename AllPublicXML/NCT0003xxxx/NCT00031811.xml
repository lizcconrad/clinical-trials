      RATIONALE: Raloxifene and exercise may improve bone health and quality of life in breast
      cancer survivors. Assessing bone health and quality of life may improve the ability to plan
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of raloxifene with or without
      exercise compared with exercise alone in women who have been previously treated for breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effects of raloxifene with or without exercise versus exercise alone on
           bone reabsorption rate, bone formation rate, and bone density in women previously
           treated for breast cancer.

        -  Determine the effects of these regimens on the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized
      to one of four treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are asked to exercise 5 days a week with instruction. Patients also
           receive oral placebo once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral raloxifene once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients are asked to exercise as in arm I. Patients also receive oral
           raloxifene once daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. All patients receive oral calcium
           supplements once daily. Treatment continues in all arms for 24 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 3 months during study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
