      The purpose of this study is to determine the side effects and antitumor response of patients
      with lymphoid malignancies to Deoxycoformycin (DCF)/Pentostatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deoxycoformycin(DCF)/Pentostatin is a T-cell cytotoxic drug with previously reported
      responses in lymphoid malignancies but larger studies are needed.
