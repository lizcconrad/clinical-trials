      RATIONALE: Interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin may be able to deliver cancer-killing substances
      directly to solid tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intravenous interleukin-4 PE38KDEL
      cytotoxin in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic kidney cancer, non-small cell
      lung cancer, or breast cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin in patients
           with recurrent or unresponsive, metastatic renal cell, non-small cell lung, or breast
           cancer that overexpresses interleukin-4 receptors.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug, including the
           duration and intensity of these toxic effects, in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antibody response (if any) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor activity of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive interleukin-4 PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) IV over 10 minutes once daily on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or detection of neutralizing antibodies.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NBI-3001 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
