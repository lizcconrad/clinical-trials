  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy can often cause anemia in patients with cancer. Anemia is a low number of red
      blood cells. The symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, dizziness, headache, chest pain, and
      shortness of breath. Erythropoietin is a hormone made by the kidneys that signals the bone
      marrow to produce more red blood cells. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been produced in
      the laboratory and has the same effect as the hormone produced by the body. Use of
      recombinant human erythropoietin allows the body to produce more red blood cells, possibly
      eliminating or decreasing your symptoms and the need for a red blood cell transfusion.
      Recombinant human erythropoietin is FDA approved to treat anemia in cancer patients receiving
      chemotherapy. This clinical study is investigating the effectiveness of darbepoetin alfa for
      the treatment of anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies who are receiving
      chemotherapy every three weeks. Darbepoetin alfa is a recombinant erythropoietic protein that
      stimulates the production of red blood cells. This medication has not been approved to treat
      cancer patients with anemia, however it has been approved by the FDA to treat chronic renal
      failure patients with anemia.
