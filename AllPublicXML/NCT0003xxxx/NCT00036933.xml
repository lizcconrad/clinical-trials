      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Biological therapies such as QS21 use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Combining vaccine therapy with QS21 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with QS21 in
      treating patients who have prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant
           QS21 in patients with prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the antibody response in patients treated with this vaccination therapy.

        -  Assess post-immunization changes in PSA levels and other objective parameters of disease
           (radionuclide bone scan) in patients treated with this vaccination therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant QS21
      subcutaneously once weekly on weeks 0-2, 6, 14, and 26 in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients whose antibody titers against Globo-H or MUC-2 antigens fall below 1/40
      and who have no disease progression may receive a seventh vaccination after week 50.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until biochemical relapse or radiographic
      disease progression.
