  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a patented type of exercise poles, developed to assist runners rehabilitating
      from lower body injuries. These poles may offer older adults improved stability, reduced fear
      of falling, and lessened lower body pain when exercise walking.

      Phase 1 (being concluded as of Feb 2002) used 18 older adults to investigate prototype
      versions of the running poles. Preliminary results, after 3 months of testing, indicate the
      poles are safe and effective. Phase 2 will use improved versions of the poles, which are
      currently in development, with a group of around 125-150 subjects over a longer length of
      time (12 months). Changes in walking gait quality, balance, strength, body composition,
      exercise adherence, and subjective perceptions of wellness will be assessed before, during,
      and after the 12 month exercise session.
