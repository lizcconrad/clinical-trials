  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine blood cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
      (PNH) after they receive a blood transfusion to determine if certain proteins (GPI-linked
      proteins) in the transfused blood transfer to the patient's blood cells. GPI-linked proteins,
      which are normally present on red cells and regulate red cell survival, are absent in
      patients with PNH. Their lack is believed to account for the premature destruction of red
      blood cells in these patients, resulting in a low hemoglobin and hematocrit. Patients may
      experience fatigue, flank pain and other symptoms, requiring treatment with blood
      transfusion.

      Patients with PNH 18 years of age or older with group A1 blood who require at least three
      units of red cells and who have not been transfused with group O blood within the last 3
      months may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center for the following procedures:

        -  Interview about the severity of their anemia-related symptoms

        -  Blood test

        -  Blood transfusion, if required. Patients will be transfused with compatible group O
           blood. The donor blood will be washed (rinsed with a salt solution) until it is 99% free
           of donor plasma. Group O blood is given instead of group A1 in order to be able to
           distinguish the patient's cells from the transfused cells.

      Blood samples of 3 teaspoons each will be drawn 1 day, 1 week, and 3 weeks after the
      transfusion. These samples may be collected by the patient's doctor locally and sent to NIH
      by mail.

      If it is found that GPI-linked proteins transfer to the patient's cells, the study will also
      examine how long the proteins remain attached and will assess whether the proteins are
      functional and prevent cell destruction.

    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal bone marrow disorder, resulting from an
      acquired, somatic X-linked mutation of the PIG-A gene in an hematopoietic stem cell. Absence
      of PIG-A function in a cell prevents synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
      moiety, which anchors many different types of proteins to the cell membrane. Intravascular
      red cell destruction, the hallmark of the disorder, is caused by susceptibility of the
      abnormal erythrocyte to complement-mediated lysis; this sensitivity is due to lack of CD59, a
      potent inhibitor of the late components of complement and reactive lysis. In vitro studies
      from this laboratory have demonstrated transfer of GPI-linked proteins, CD55 and CD59, from
      normal to deficient cells and transfer is associated with resistance to hemolysis. Patients
      with PNH frequently require transfusion as their standard care. In addition, patients with
      all blood groups requiring transfusion will often receive compatible group O blood. Group O
      blood is prevalent in blood bank inventories; and red cell survival after transfusion is
      equal to that after transfusion of &quot;in group&quot; blood. The purpose of this study is to examine
      protein transfer of GPI-linked proteins from transfused cells to deficient cells obtained
      from patients with PNH. Patients with group A(1) blood will receive compatible group O blood
      so that donor and recipient blood cells can be discriminated. Flow cytometric studies will be
      performed subsequently to determine if transfer of GPI-linked protein to patients' cells has
      occurred.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The following must be met before the subject may be enrolled:

        PNH patients with group A(1) blood who require at least three units of red cells as judged
        by their primary care physician; criteria for transfusion would include hemoglobin below
        7.5 g/dl or symptoms related to anemia (impaired exercise tolerance, angina, shortness of
        breath) that warrant therapy.

        A PNH clone of greater than 40% and not have been transfused with group O blood for at
        least three months previously.

        Eighteen years of age or older.

        Karnofsky performance status of 60% or better.

        Adequate organ function as defined by serum creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl.

        Able to comprehend and willing to sign an informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Any one of the following eliminates a subject from participating:

        Evidence of uncontrolled infection.

        Known alloimmunization to red cell antigens.

        Treatment with investigational agent or hematopoietic growth factors within 4 weeks of
        study entry.

        Psychiatric, addictive or any disorder that compromises ability to give truly informed
        consent.

        Patients who are moribund or who have concurrent hepatic, renal, cardiac disease.
