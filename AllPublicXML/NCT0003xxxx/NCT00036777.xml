    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01 with carboplatin in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors. UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      UCN-01 with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity and other toxicities of
      UCN-01 when combined with carboplatin.

      II. Preliminarily evaluate the antitumor effect of the combination of carboplatin and UCN-01.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and carboplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour followed by UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and UCN-01 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not

             composition to UCN-01 or other agents used in study

             mellitus should be excluded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
