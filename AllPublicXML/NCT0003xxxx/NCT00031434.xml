  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how ganciclovir is metabolized when administered
      intravenously (by a needle inserted into a vein) following valganciclovir syrup, given by
      mouth to newborns and young infants with symptoms of congenital (present at birth)
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. The study also seeks to identify a dose of valganciclovir that
      provides a comparable blood concentration to ganciclovir present in the blood of newborns
      with symptomatic congenital CMV disease. All study participants will receive 6 weeks of
      antiviral therapy (defined as ganciclovir and/or valganciclovir). Infants from 0 to 30 days
      old will participate in the study for 2 years.

    <textblock>
      Recent trials have demonstrated that ganciclovir treatment of neonates with symptomatic
      congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease involving the central nervous system results in
      improved hearing function (or maintenance of normal hearing function) and prevents hearing
      deterioration at 6 months. Furthermore, ganciclovir therapy may prevent hearing deterioration
      at 1 year. Ganciclovir recipients also have a more rapid resolution of their transaminase
      elevations and a greater degree of short term growth in weight and head circumference
      compared with untreated patients. Valganciclovir, the oral product of ganciclovir, has been
      developed as a syrup formulation and presents the opportunity to treat longer, but
      pharmacokinetic data are needed in infants first to assure the correct dose is being
      utilized. This Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label trial will assess the safety/tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics (ganciclovir concentrations) following administration of oral
      valganciclovir to neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease. A total of 24 patients
      will be evaluated. All patients entered into this study will receive 6 weeks (42 days) of
      antiviral therapy (defined as ganciclovir and/or valganciclovir). Two different dose
      determination strategies will be applied in this protocol. The first is an individual patient
      approach. The second is a group dose modification strategy. The primary endpoint is
      pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir following administration of oral valganciclovir syrup. The
      pharmacokinetics will be assessed by a population approach to PK data analysis. Secondary
      endpoints are: the pharmacokinetics of valganciclovir following administration of oral
      valganciclovir; the correlation of ganciclovir plasma concentrations following administration
      of intravenous ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir syrup with CMV whole blood viral load;
      lack of vomiting and/or diarrhea associated with the administration of oral valganciclovir
      syrup; and assessment of toxicity, such as neutropenia, associated with the administration of
      oral valganciclovir syrup.

    <description>Valganciclovir is a mono-valyl ester pro-drug of ganciclovir, which is rapidly converted to ganciclovir on absorption. Valganciclovir oral syrup formulation for administration will be provided as a 15g powder blend containing 3g valganciclovir base, for constitution in 120 mL amber glass bottles. The beginning oral valganciclovir dose under investigation is 14 mg/kg. The dose of oral valganciclovir syrup will be adjusted for the baby's weight and renal function. Weights upon which dosage will be adjustments will be made will be obtained on study days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.</description>
