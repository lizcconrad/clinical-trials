      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells.
      Combining radiofrequency ablation with surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiofrequency ablation with
      surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the acute effects of intraoperative radiofrequency tumor ablation (RFA) in
           patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the treatment-related toxicity in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the dimensions of the RFA lesion produced by the ablation procedure in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo intraoperative radiofrequency tumor ablation over 10-15 minutes for
      each tumor immediately followed by tumor resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
