      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of homoharringtonine in treating
      patients who have refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of salvage therapy comprising homoharringtonine in patients with
           refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the antileukemic efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive remission induction therapy comprising homoharringtonine (HH) IV
      continuously on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity until a complete remission (CR) is achieved or the patient fails to respond after 3
      courses.

      Patients who achieve a CR during induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising HH
      IV continuously on days 1-7. Maintenance treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
