  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDMS) is one of the most serious of the childhood rheumatic
      diseases. The theory behind this trial is that early introduction of etanercept or
      methotrexate will prove to be effective in the treatment of JDMS. Pretreatment muscle
      biopsies, we believe there will be abnormalities in the blood vessels that will be correlated
      with worse physical strength and daily functional ability. The long-term goal is to improve
      the treatment of this serious childhood onset rheumatic disease and to better understand the
      pathogenic mechanism for the development of the vasculopathy (disorder of blood vessels) of
      JDMS. Identification of the specific mechanism of the vasculopathy may allow for the rational
      introduction of biologic treatments focused on vascular growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality of JDMS is 3-39% with over 40% of patients demonstrating long-term disability.
      Current first line therapy is high-dose corticosteroids with the attendant significant
      drug-related toxicity. Over 30% of JDMS patients fail to respond adequately to steroids and
      require additional immunosuppression, none of which have been tested in prospective,
      randomized, controlled trials. The unique occlusive vasculopathy in JDMS is critical in the
      pathogenesis and predictive of prognosis but poorly understood. Elevated levels of tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) alpha have been shown to be present in JDMS and are associated with a
      more severe and chronic course.

      Seventy-five children with definite JDMS will be enrolled in a 24-month prospective,
      randomized, multicentered trial comparing 3 treatments: oral prednisone (P), combination of
      oral prednisone and methotrexate (P/MTX), and combination of oral prednisone and etanercept
      (P/E). Primary response measures will be muscle strength and mean duration of steroid
      therapy. Secondary response variables are disability in daily function and height and weight
      growth velocity (steroid toxicity measures). The combination of P/E will be tested and
      compared to both P alone and the combination of P/MTX after 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of
      treatment. In addition, the combination of P/MTX will be compared to P alone after 3, 6, 12,
      18, and 24 months of treatment. In pretreatment muscle biopsies, proangiogenic factors (such
      as vascular endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor), angiostatic
      factors (such as angiostatin and endostatin), and vascular morphology (vessel number, width,
      length and area) will be quantified and tested for ability to predict muscle strength and
      functional ability 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months later.
