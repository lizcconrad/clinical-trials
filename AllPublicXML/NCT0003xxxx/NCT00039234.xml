      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells.
      Histamine dihydrochloride may help interleukin-2 kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells
      more sensitive to the drug. It is not yet known if interleukin-2 is more effective with or
      without histamine dihydrochloride in treating stage IV melanoma that is metastatic to the
      liver.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with or
      without histamine dihydrochloride in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma that is
      metastatic to the liver.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the duration of survival in patients with stage IV melanoma with hepatic
           metastasis treated with interleukin-2 with or without histamine dihydrochloride.

        -  Compare the progression-free survival, response rate, response rate of hepatic tumors,
           and lack of disease progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of these regimens, in terms of frequency, severity, and causal
           relationship of adverse events, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center location (North America vs Europe), lactate dehydrogenase (less than ULN
      vs ULN or greater), and metastatic sites (liver only vs liver and other sites). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 1
           and 2 of weeks 1 and 3 and days 1-5 of weeks 2 and 4. Patients also receive histamine
           dihydrochloride SC over 10-30 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 1-4.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I. In both arms, treatment repeats every 6 weeks
           for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 224 patients (112 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
