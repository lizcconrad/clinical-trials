      The purpose of this study is to develop methods for studying the effect of bodywork therapy
      on symptoms of fatigue in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.

      The proposed project is a randomized pilot trial of a Swedish-style massage therapy
      intervention for the treatment of fatigue in patients who are undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
      Fatigue is the most common complaint of patients receiving treatment for cancer, but is often
      difficult to treat and causes a substantial decrement in patients' quality of life. Massage
      therapy is a non-invasive intervention used in many patients with cancer for symptom control.
      Prior small studies have suggested some efficacy of bodywork therapies in conditions
      characterized by fatigue, such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Based on these
      results, massage therapy may provide an important adjunct in ameliorating fatigue and
      enhancing cancer patients' well being.

      The proposed study is a 12-week, randomized, three-arm, parallel-comparison clinical trial
      comparing the effects of a Swedish-style massage regimen to a sham bodywork control and a
      usual-care group for fatigue reduction in cancer patents undergoing chemotherapy. Patients
      with breast, ovarian, prostate, or colo-rectal cancer will be enrolled; the primary outcome
      measure is a quantitative assessment of fatigue symptoms. This study will determine efficacy,
      functioning, perceptions of fatigue, and quality of life. This study should provide not only
      important data on the potential efficacy of massage therapy for the treatment of fatigue, but
      also advance the methodology for studying CAM interventions for difficult-to-treat
      symptomatic conditions.
