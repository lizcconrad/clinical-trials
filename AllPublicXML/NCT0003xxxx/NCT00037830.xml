  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the short term effects (24 Weeks) of GM1 on
      Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, as well as the effects of long-term treatment (120 Weeks)
      with GM1 on disease progression, and to examine the extent to which GM1 treatment influences
      the underlying disease process in PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to further examine the extent to which GM1 ganglioside can improve
      symptoms, delay disease progression, and, perhaps, partially restore damaged brain cells in
      PD patients. GM1 ganglioside is a chemical that is normally found in the brain and is a
      normal part of the outer covering or membrane of nerve cells. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of GM1 to standard PD treatment. In addition to studying clinical measures of
      motor and cognitive functioning, the investigators will use PET (positron emission
      tomography) scanning to image the brain and the dopamine nerve endings in a subgroup of
      patients. Patients with mild to moderate idiopathic PD will be divided into 2 groups. One
      group will receive GM1 for 24 weeks and the other will receive placebo. At the end of this 24
      week period, all patients will enter into a 96 week treatment period in which all patients
      will receive GM1.

      In parallel, a group of standard-of-care patients with mild to moderate PD will be monitored
      over a 1 to 2 year period to assess the natural progression of PD. These patients will
      receive the same clinical evaluations as the treatment group subjects but they will not
      receive the experimental medication.

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (Part III) motor scores assess 14 symptoms some of which separately assess symptoms in different body parts (e.g. right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg) and each symptom is rated on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 108. Each subject was independently rated by two observers at each study visit and a mean score was calculated for analysis.</description>

        <description>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) A four part scale used to assess the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Part I contains questions concerning the patient's mentation, behavior and mood. Part II asks questions about the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. Part III is the motor examination of the patient's symptoms ranging in scores from 0 to 4 with 0 equaling either normal or absence of symptoms. The minimum score on this section is 0 and the maximum is 108. Part IV asks the patient questions about any complications of therapy they have experienced within the past week. However, for this study the total UPDRS included Parts I, II, and III. A higher the score on the scale indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

Part III is the motor examination of the patient's symptoms ranging in scores from 0 to 4 with 0 equaling either normal or absence of symptoms. The minimum score on this section is 0 and the maximum is 108. Part IV asks the patient questions about any complications of therapy they have experienced within the past week. However, for this study the total UPDRS included Parts I, II, and III. A higher the score on the scale indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (Part III) Motor Score From Baseline to Week 72 Assessed Off Medication.</title>
        <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (Part III) motor scores assess 14 symptoms some of which separately assess symptoms in different body parts (e.g. right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg) and each symptom is rated on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 108. Each subject was independently rated by two observers at each study visit and a mean score was calculated for analysis.</description>
