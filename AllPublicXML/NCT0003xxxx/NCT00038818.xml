      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate response rates of acute or chronic Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following CD8
      depleted DLI (Depleted Donor Lymphocyte Infusions) in patients with Chronic myelomonocytic
      leukemia (CMML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLM), Multiple
      Myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HD).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate safety and treatment related mortality after CD8 depleted DLI.

        -  To evaluate the time to onset of GVHD following DLI and response to GVHD treatment.

        -  To evaluate the incidence and timing of pancytopenia following DLI.

        -  To evaluate disease-free survival, overall survival and relapse rates in three cohorts
           of patients; early relapse CML, late relapse CML and lymphoproliferative disorders (HD,
           CLL, NHL and MM).

        -  To evaluate the need and efficacy of second or subsequent CD8 depleted donor lymphocyte
           infusions.

        -  To evaluate the number of apheresis procedures needed to collect appropriate doses of
           CD4+ cells.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Patients of any age who have previously undergone allogeneic hematopoietic
             transplantation and have evidence of donor cell engraftment (&gt;20% donor cell within
             three months of study entry)

          -  Expected survival &gt;4 weeks

          -  CML patients with molecular, cytogenetic or hematologic relapse following allogeneic
             transplantation

               1. Molecular relapse- patients are eligible if bcr/abl is detectable at any time
                  after day 180 post-allogeneic transplantation or if a negative bcr/abl PCR test
                  was documented post-transplantation and the bcr/abl test is now positive by
                  consecutive PCR determinations at least 4 weeks apart.

               2. Cytogenetic relapse-patients are eligible if standard cytogenetics demonstrate
                  &gt;10% t (9,22) positive cells greater than 60 days after myeloablative
                  transplantation or 10% t (9,22) positive cells greater than 100 days after
                  nonmyeloablative transplantation.

          -  CML patients with accelerated phase or blast crisis following allogeneic
             transplantation

          -  Patients with CLL, NHL, MM, or HD who have evidence of disease relapse or persistent
             disease at 60 days post-allo BMT and/or:

               1. MM- patients with a rising M-protein is detectable at 180 days post-transplant

               2. NHL - patients with molecular evidence of disease (bcl-2, t (4,11), etc.) at 180
                  days post transplant

               3. CLL, NHL or HD - patients with clear cut evidence of tumor growth at any time
                  post-transplant are eligible

          -  Patients undergoing an HLA -identical or 5/6 antigen match transplant from a related
             or unrelated donor

          -  Patient's original donor must be available for lymphocyte donation

          -  There must be no evidence of active acute or graft-versus-host disease and patients
             should be off all immunosuppressive agents for, at least, two weeks prior to DLI.
             Patients on stable dose of methylprednisolone (&lt;16 mg/d) without evidence of active
             GVHD are also eligible.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod PS&lt;2 (see appendix 7), Cr&lt;2.5, bilirubin &lt;3, and
             transaminases (SGPT, SGOT) &lt;4x normal

          -  Patient must be able to sign informed consent
