      <recruitment_details>The publication describing study results (Coombes RC et al; N Engl J Med 350; 1119) stated that 4742 participants were enrolled in study. It was later discovered that 2 participants were randomized twice. Hence, 4740 participants were enrolled in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Main study also included 3 sub-studies only for the purpose of tolerability assessment: endometrial status, bone metabolism and quality of life (QoL). Out of 4740 enrolled participants, data for 16 participants from a center were excluded since it was considered unreliable. Results are reported for remaining 4724 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>BMD measurements for Lumbar spine (LS) and Proximal Femur (Total Hip [TH]) were performed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for participants who entered the bone-metabolism sub-study. Results were scored as T-score. T-score indicated how many standard deviations higher or lower participant’s value was when compared to the young normal reference mean. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for osteoporosis, a T-score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)-1.0 was classified as normal, a T-score of greater than -2.5 to less than -1.0 as osteopenic, and a T-score less than or equal to (&lt;=)-2.5 as osteoporotic. Here 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

        <description>The TOI was defined as the sum of 23 items based on following Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Breast version [FACT-B] subscales: Physical well-being (7 items), Functional well-being (7 items), Breast cancer subscale (9 items). Each item was scaled from 0=‘Not at all’ to 4=‘Very much’. Total TOI score ranged from 0 to 92, where higher TOI score indicated better health-related quality of life (QoL). A change of five points in the TOI scores was considered clinically meaningful. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively. Results for 30, 36, 48, 60 months were not reported because data for these time points was only summarized as graphical presentation.</description>

        <description>The FACT-ES assessed health-related QoL in participants with breast cancer. ES subscale comprised of 18 items (hot flushes,cold sweats,night sweats, vaginal discharge,vaginal irritation,vaginal bleeding,vaginal dryness,discomfort with intercourse,lost interest in sex,gained weight,light headed/dizzy,vomiting,had diarrhea,headaches,felt bloated,breast tenderness,mood swings, felt irritable).Participants indicated how true a statement was for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For items that were negatively framed, the scores were reversed for the analysis so that higher scores equated to a good QoL. Total FACT-ES score was calculated as sum of all the 18 items and ranged from 0 to 72, where higher score indicated better QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

        <description>FACT-GBE assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) in participants with breast cancer. It consisted of 56 items,summarized to 7 subscales(subscale 1 to 6 constituted total FACT-B and subscale 7 constituted total ES):physical well-being(7 items), social/family well-being(7 items),relationship with doctor (2 items),emotional well-being(6 items),functional well-being(7 items),breast cancer subscale(9 items),endocrine symptoms(18 items). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using 5-point scale from 0(not at all) to 4(very much). For items that were negatively framed,scores were reversed for analysis so that higher scores equated to good QoL. Total FACT-GBE score=sum of all 56 items(range 0 to 224, where higher score indicated better QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

        <description>The PWB subscale assessed physical well-being related QoL in participants with breast cancer. PWB subscale comprised of 7 items (energy lack, nausea, family needs, pain, side effects, felt ill, forced to stay in bed). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For items that were negatively framed, the scores were reversed for the analysis so that higher scores equated to a good QoL. Total PWB score was calculated as the sum of all the 7 items and ranged from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated better physical well-being related QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

          <description>The SWB subscale assessed social/family well-being related QoL in participants with breast cancer. SWB subscale comprised of 7 items (distant from friends, emotional support, support from friends, family acceptance, family communication, close to main support, sexual satisfaction). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For items that were negatively framed, the scores were reversed for the analysis so that higher scores equated to a good QoL. Total SWB score was calculated as the sum of all the 7 items and ranged from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated better social/family well-being related QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

        <description>The RWD subscale assessed relationship with doctor in participants with breast cancer. RWD subscale comprised of 2 items (confidence in doctors, doctor answered questions). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Total RWD score was calculated as the sum of the 2 items and ranged from 0 to 8, where higher score indicated better relationship with doctor. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

        <description>The EWB subscale assessed emotional well-being related QoL in participants with breast cancer. EWB subscale comprised of 6 items (felt sad, proud of coping, lost hope, felt nervous, worried about dying, worried about condition worsening). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For items that were negatively framed, the scores were reversed for the analysis so that higher scores equate to a good QoL. Total EWB score was calculated as the sum of the 6 items and ranged from 0 to 24, where higher score indicated better emotional well-being related QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

          <description>The FWB subscale assessed functional well-being related QoL in participants with breast cancer. FWB subscale comprised of 7 items (able to work, work fulfilled, able to enjoy life, acceptance of illness, sleeping well, enjoyed normal fun activities, contented with QoL). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Total FWB score was calculated as the sum of the 7 items and ranged from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated better functional well-being related QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

        <description>The BCS subscale assessed health related QoL in participants with breast cancer. BCS subscale comprised of 9 items (short of breath, self-conscious dress, tender/swollen arms, sexually attractive, bothered by hair loss, worried about familial risk, worried about family stress, bothered by weight change, able to feel like a woman). Participants indicated how true a statement had been for them using a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For items that were negatively framed, the scores were reversed for the analysis so that higher scores equated to a good QoL. Total BCS score was calculated as the sum of the 9 items and ranged from 0 to 36, where higher score indicated better QoL. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</description>

Endocrine items were grouped in five categories vasomotor (hot flushes, cold sweats, night sweats, sleeping difficulties), neuropsychological (lack of energy, nervous feeling, lightheaded/dizzy, headaches, mood swings, feeling irritable), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, gained weight, vomiting, diarrhea, bloated feeling), gynecological symptoms (vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, vaginal bleeding, vaginal dryness, discomfort with intercourse, lost interest in sex, breast tenderness) and other symptoms (pain, feeling ill, side effects). Number of participants who reported severe endocrine symptoms (defined as response categories “quite a bit” and “very much”) were presented.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Polyps, Fibroids and Ovarian Cysts: Endometrial Sub-study</title>
          <description>Number of participants with presence of polyps (POL) and fibroids (FIB) at post-baseline time points compared to the baseline (BL) status of ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘missing’ (that is, participants reporting POL/FIB at post-baseline time points who had yes, no or missing POL/FIB status at baseline, respectively) were presented. Result for number of participants with ovarian cysts was not analyzed at post-baseline time points as very few participants reported ovarian cysts at baseline.</description>
          <population>Evaluable population for endometrial sub-study. Analysis was based on actual treatment received. 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group,respectively.</population>
