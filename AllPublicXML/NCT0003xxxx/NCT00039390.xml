  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gefitinib and capecitabine
      in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of solid tumors. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining gefitinib and capecitabine may kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gefitinib and capecitabine in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine the pharmacologic profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gefitinib and capecitabine.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-14 and oral capecitabine twice daily on
      days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib and
      capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
