  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-HIV drug therapy works best when the drugs are taken exactly as prescribed by a doctor.
      Because anti-HIV therapy often involves multiple drugs, some people have difficulty taking
      them all correctly. The easier it is to take anti-HIV drugs, the more likely people will take
      them as prescribed and get the best results. This study will see if people are more
      successful in taking anti-HIV drugs once a day or twice a day. It also will determine if
      having a health care professional oversee each weekday dose helps people control their HIV
      infection. The study will compare taking a three-drug combination twice a day versus taking a
      three-drug combination just once a day. The study will also compare patients taking the drugs
      on their own to patients taking the drugs in the presence of a clinical worker. Viral load
      (amount of HIV in the blood) and drug side effects will be measured.

      While many factors contribute to the success or failure of antiretroviral therapy for HIV,
      among the most important are factors that influence adherence to a treatment regimen, such as
      duration of therapy, dosing frequency, pill burden, side effects, and patient behaviors.
      Inconsistent adherence or nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy can result in suboptimal
      drug exposure. Suboptimal drug exposure can, in turn, impact short- and long-term patient
      outcomes by increasing the likelihood of drug resistant HIV mutants and subsequent virologic
      and clinical failure. It is therefore essential to design treatment regimens that promote
      long-term adherence to potent antiretroviral therapy. This study will evaluate the relative
      contribution of reduced-frequency dosing and directly observed therapy on the magnitude and
      durability of virologic suppression in patients treated with potent antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms. Arms A, B, and C receive the
      same daily dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), emtricitabine (FTC), and stavudine extended
      release (d4T XR) or tenofovir DF (TDF). In Arm A, drugs are self-administered for 48 weeks;
      LPV/r is taken twice daily and FTC and d4T XR or TDF once daily. In Arm B, all drugs are
      self-administered once daily for 48 weeks. In Arm C, drugs are taken once a day under
      directly observed therapy during Weeks 0-24, and then by self-administration during Weeks
      25-48. Adherence to the regimen is measured using an electronic drug monitoring system. Viral
      load, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, population pharmacokinetics, and quality of life
      indicators are measured throughout the study. The tolerability and safety of the treatment
      regimens are also monitored.
