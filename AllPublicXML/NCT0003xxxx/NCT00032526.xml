  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most clinicians who care for patients with inflammatory airway diseases such as allergic
      rhinitis and asthma are aware of the negative effects of certain sights, sounds and smells
      that can precipitate clinical exacerbations in certain susceptible patients. This is thought
      to be due to subconscious associations between these observable stimuli paired and actual
      exposure to allergens that induce clinical symptoms. The severity and duration of these
      symptoms are typically related to levels of anxiety and/or depression in affected patients.
      Classical conditioning of the immune response has been described in many animal and some
      human studies in association with administration of immunosuppressive drugs. In successfully
      conditioned individuals, subsequent exposure to the conditioning stimulus alone produces
      immunosuppressive changes similar to those caused by the drugs themselves. Since disease
      exacerbating conditioning appears to be prevalent in allergic patients, these conditions make
      an excellent human model for understanding the relationships between classical conditioning,
      psychological stress (particularly anxiety and depression) and immune regulation. Thus this
      proposal will seek to examine the hypothesis that antiinflammatory effects of
      pharmacotherapeutic agents can be classically conditioned and are clinically effective due to
      changes in immunoregulatory imbalances known to occur in patients with allergic airway
      diseases. The effectiveness of this therapeutic approach will be significantly affected by
      levels of psychological stress and individual suggestibility. This will be investigated with
      the following Specific Aims: (1). Determine the relative effectiveness of classical
      conditioning by a novel gustatory stimulus paired with immunosuppressive doses of
      corticosteroid on in vivo and in vitro immune responses (allergen - specific vs. general) of
      patients before, during and after classical conditioning correlated with level of clinical
      response; (2) Determine the role of neuroendocrine mechanisms (particularly catecholamines)
      on the inducibility and duration of the conditioned immune responses; and (3) Investigate the
      influence of psychological stress levels (including anxiety and depression) and/or
      suggestibility on baseline immune changes, success and duration of the classical
      conditioning.

      These data will help define parameters for classical conditioning in humans, establish a
      model to investigate mechanisms and serve as the basis for development of future
      interventional protocols for severe inflammatory diseases involving classical conditioning.
