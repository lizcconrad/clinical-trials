      risperidone solution in the treatment of adolescents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

      This is a clinical study of an investigational drug called risperidone in the treatment of
      schizophrenia in adolescents. Initially children (age 2 to 12 yrs) and schizophreniform
      subjects were also allowed but excluded following protocol amendment.

      The study will include approximately 260 patients aged 13 to 17 years with a diagnosis of
      schizophrenia. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups on enrollment and will
      be given risperidone as an oral solution each day for 8 weeks at doses within one of two dose
      different ranges, according to the assigned study group.

      Initially the two dose range were 0.15-0.4 mg/day and 1.5-4mg/day but were changed in
      protocol amendment to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose with a minimum of 3.5mg/day and
      maximum of 6mg/day (resp. 0.35 and 0.6mg/day in low dose treatment arm) Risperidone lower
      dose (0.35-0.6 mg/day [subjects &gt;=50kg] or 0.007-0.012 mg/kg/day [subjects &lt;50 kg]) as 0.1
      mg/mL oral solution or risperidone higher dose (3.5-6 mg/day [subjects &gt;=50 kg] or 0.07-0.12
      mg/kg/day [subjects &lt;50 kg]) as 1 mg/mL oral solution for 8 weeks. Daily dose can be given
      all at once or through 2 administrations (in morning and evening); the dose is increased
      based on efficacy and tolerability.
