      RATIONALE: Heating melphalan to several degrees above body temperature and infusing it to the
      affected area directly around the tumor may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of hepatic arterial infusion with melphalan
      in treating patients who have unresectable liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of hepatic arterial
           infusion with melphalan in patients with unresectable liver cancer.

        -  Determine the regional and systemic toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous hepatic arterial infusion, using a double balloon catheter in
      the inferior vena cava to isolate circulation to the liver, with melphalan over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment may be repeated when all toxic effects are grade 2 or less. Patients undergo
      staging at 4 weeks after completion of the second treatment. Patients may receive 2
      additional treatments.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional
      patients are treated with melphalan at the recommended dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 4 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
