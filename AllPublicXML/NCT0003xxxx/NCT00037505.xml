  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to examine whether depression influences immune
      system function. Studies indicate that individuals who are depressed experience coronary
      heart disease at a higher rate than expected. This study's goal is to begin identifying
      mechanisms that might be responsible for this process. This research also examines whether
      behavioral processes (e.g. smoking) or hormonal processes (e.g. adrenaline release) are
      responsible for immune system differences between depressed and nondepressed people

      To qualify for participation, subjects are to be between the ages of 18-55, medically healthy
      and free of all medication three months prior to enrollment. Half of them will be clinically
      depressed; the remaining one half will be healthy controls without a history of psychiatric
      illness. All subjects who qualify for the study will attend two laboratory sessions. During
      the first visit, participants will undergo a structured psychological interview, complete
      questionnaires about their mood, personality, and behavior, and have blood drawn to assess
      their immune system function. During the second visit, participants will complete additional
      questionnaires about their mood, personality, and behavior. The subjects will also
      participate in a mock job interview to look at their body's response to stress. Before and
      after the interview, the subjects will have blood drawn and be asked to collect saliva
      samples to assess their immune system function. In addition to the two laboratory visits,
      participants will be asked to collect additional information while going about their normal
      activities. In order to accomplish this, they will be given a small hand held portable
      computer. Four times each day for four days, the computer will signal them to collect a
      saliva sample. This will be used later to measure hormone levels. This study will explore
      changes in the immune system and metabolic system that might predispose depressed individuals
      to develop heart disease
