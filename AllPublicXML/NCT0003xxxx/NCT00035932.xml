  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how well atazanavir (ATV) works in combination with
      ritonavir (RTV) or saquinavir (SQV) with tenofovir (TDF) and a nucleoside to reduce the viral
      load of treatment experienced subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is a
      comparison arm with lopinavir (LPV)/RTV and TDF and a nucleoside.

    <description>The MACS adherence questionnaire asks patients how many medication doses they missed during the previous day, 2 days, 3 days and 4 days. Drug-specific questions included adherence with dose and frequency. Adherence was defined as taking all doses and numbers of pills as prescribed for each medication. This strict adherence cut-off was based on the guidelines stating that anything less than excellent adherence may result in a virus breakthrough and development of resistance.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a 5-item questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) are scored on a 3-level scale: no problems (1), some problems (2), extreme problems (3). Using a standard algorithm, responses are summarized into a single score, the EQ-5D Health Index Score (HIS), which ranges between 1 (representing perfect health) and 0 (representing the worst imaginable health state or death). The smallest coefficient of change is 0.03.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D has a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which is a feeling thermometer-like scale with a range between 0 and 100. Patients are required to draw a line from a box on the VAS scale to an actual mark on the thermometer-like scale that corresponds with a number that reflects their self-assessed health status at the time they are completing the questionnaire. Higher VAS scores indicate better overall health. There is no minimum clinically important difference reported in the literature for VAS.</description>

        <title>PR Interval and Change From Baseline by Analysis Time Point</title>
        <description>The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, and reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval is therefore a good estimate of AV node function.</description>

          <title>PR Interval and Change From Baseline by Analysis Time Point</title>
          <description>The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, and reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval is therefore a good estimate of AV node function.</description>

        <title>Adherence to Regimen Though Week 48 Based on MACS the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Adherence Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The MACS adherence questionnaire asks patients how many medication doses they missed during the previous day, 2 days, 3 days and 4 days. Drug-specific questions included adherence with dose and frequency. Adherence was defined as taking all doses and numbers of pills as prescribed for each medication. This strict adherence cut-off was based on the guidelines stating that anything less than excellent adherence may result in a virus breakthrough and development of resistance.</description>

Using a standard algorithm, responses are summarized into a single score, the EQ-5D Health Index Score (HIS), which ranges between 1 (representing perfect health) and 0 (representing the worst imaginable health state or death).

        <description>The EQ-5D has a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which is a feeling thermometer-like scale with a range between 0 and 100. Patients are required to draw a line from a box on the VAS scale to an actual mark on the thermometer-like scale that corresponds with a number that reflects their self-assessed health status at the time they are completing the questionnaire. Higher VAS scores indicate better overall health. There is no minimum clinically important difference reported in the literature for VAS.</description>

          <title>Mean Score of European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Baseline, Mid-Study (Week 24), and Final (Week 48)</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D has a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which is a feeling thermometer-like scale with a range between 0 and 100. Patients are required to draw a line from a box on the VAS scale to an actual mark on the thermometer-like scale that corresponds with a number that reflects their self-assessed health status at the time they are completing the questionnaire. Higher VAS scores indicate better overall health. There is no minimum clinically important difference reported in the literature for VAS.</description>
          <population>Treated participants; as-randomized population (refers to the treatment regimen assigned at randomization). n=number of participants evaluated with EQ-5D at given time point.</population>
