  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relative merits of vestibular rehabilitation
      and Tai Chi for patients with inner ear (vestibular) disorders.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is proposed a randomized, blinded, controlled trial comparing vestibular rehabilitation
      (VR) to Tai Chi (TC). Our overall goal is to explore whether, and if so, how TC can improve
      functional, dynamic stability in persons with vestibulopathy (VSP). It is hypothesized that
      the TC group will demonstrate significantly greater improvement in performing functional
      activities than the VR group.

      Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned into either TC instruction or VR. Both treatment
      groups will receive identical duration treatment once a week for 10 weeks, with supplemental
      home exercises. It is hypothesized that 1) TC improves whole-body dynamic locomotor stability
      more than does VR; 2) TC improves gait coordination during planned and unplanned obstacle
      encounters more than does VR; 3) TC improves whole-body speed related movement control more
      than does VR.
