      The purpose of this multicenter study is to determine if insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I)
      slows the progressive weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Study
      participants will be followed for 2 years once enrolled. They will receive either placebo or
      the active IGF-I. Examinations will take place at approximately 6-month intervals.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to determine whether IGF-1 (MyotrophinTM) slows progression
      of weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Three hundred thirty patients with ALS
      from 20 medical centers participated in this double blind, placebo-controlled two-year study.
      Half the patients received IGF-1 and the other half received placebo. The drug will be
      administered twice a day.

      ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor
      neurons. IGF-1 is a neurotrophic factor essential for normal development of the nervous
      system and shows protection of motor neurons in animal models and cell culture systems. It is
      thought to block cell death pathways and promote muscle re-innervation and axonal growth and
      regeneration.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Change in Composite Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in the MMT score. MMT involved the examination of 34 muscle groups with standard positioning. The final MMT score represented an average of the 34 muscles examined, and ranged from 10 to 0(10 normal strength, 0 paralyzed). The individual muscle score was based on the medical research council (MRC) grading scale (1-5) modified to a 10 point system corresponding to the MRC modifications of plus and minus (5, 5-,4+,4,4-,3+,3, 3-,2,1,0; with 5 being normal strength and 0 paralyzed).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Alive and Tracheostomy-free at 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who elected to proceed to tracheostomy were assessed the month of their procedure. Subjects who continuously utilized non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for greater than 10 days were assessed as being ventilator-dependent on the first day they began continuous Non Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV). All subjects were followed for the 24 month time period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The final secondary outcome measure was the rate of change in the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) score. The ALSFRS-r was completed at each visit (randomization and then at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-randomization). This is a scale from 0 to 48 assessing functional impairment in 12 clinically relevant areas in ALS. Forty-eight is normal with full function and zero is total loss of function in all clinical functions. As with the MMT scores a score of 0 was imputed on the day of death. Analysis of the ALSFRS-r scores as a secondary outcome was performed in similar manner as MMT score.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in the MMT score. MMT involved the examination of 34 muscle groups with standard positioning. The final MMT score represented an average of the 34 muscles examined, and ranged from 10 to 0(10 normal strength, 0 paralyzed). The individual muscle score was based on the medical research council (MRC) grading scale (1-5) modified to a 10 point system corresponding to the MRC modifications of plus and minus (5, 5-,4+,4,4-,3+,3, 3-,2,1,0; with 5 being normal strength and 0 paralyzed).</description>

        <title>Rate of Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale.</title>
        <description>The final secondary outcome measure was the rate of change in the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) score. The ALSFRS-r was completed at each visit (randomization and then at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-randomization). This is a scale from 0 to 48 assessing functional impairment in 12 clinically relevant areas in ALS. Forty-eight is normal with full function and zero is total loss of function in all clinical functions. As with the MMT scores a score of 0 was imputed on the day of death. Analysis of the ALSFRS-r scores as a secondary outcome was performed in similar manner as MMT score.</description>

            <groups_desc>The final secondary outcome measure was the rate of change in the ALSFRS-r score. The ALSFRS-r was completed at each visit (randomization and then at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-randomization). As with the MMT scores a score of 0 was imputed on the day of death. Analysis of the ALSFRS-r scores as a secondary outcome was performed in similar manner as MMT score.</groups_desc>
