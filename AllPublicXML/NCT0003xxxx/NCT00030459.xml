      RATIONALE: Palliative therapy may help patients with advanced cancer live more comfortably.
      It is not yet known if palliative therapy is more effective with or without chemotherapy in
      treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of palliative therapy with or
      without different chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of palliative therapy alone versus palliative therapy with
           mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin versus palliative therapy with vinorelbine in
           patients with malignant mesothelioma.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive palliative therapy alone comprising non-chemotherapeutic therapy
           (e.g., radiotherapy, painkillers, steroids, relaxants, and special pain relief
           techniques).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive palliative therapy as in arm I and chemotherapy comprising
           mitomycin IV (courses 1, 2, and 4 only), vinblastine IV, and cisplatin IV over 4 hours
           on day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive palliative therapy as in arm I and chemotherapy comprising
           vinorelbine IV over 5 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-6 and 9-14.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline for all patients; at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12 for arm I;
      at weeks 4, 7, 10, and 13 for arm II; at weeks 3, 6, 10, and 13 for arm III; at weeks 21 and
      29, and then every 8 weeks thereafter for all patients.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1 year.
