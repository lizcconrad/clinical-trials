  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have mantle
      cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective responses in patients with previously treated mantle cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with CCI-779.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine whether this
      drug inhibits cell proliferation pathways in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable
      disease receive a maximum of 6 courses. Patients with partial response receive a maximum of
      12 courses. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.

    <description>The proportion will be evaluated separately for each dose group. The proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed CR or PR, or success, will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
