      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of clozapine in
      children and adolescents with treatment resistant bipolar disorder. This study will also
      explore how the brain functions in early-onset bipolar disorder.

      Bipolar disorder (BPD) in children and adolescents is a serious illness that carries a high
      risk for chronicity, impairing comorbidities, and completed suicide. Treatment options are
      often limited by inefficacy or intolerable side effects. Open trials in adult bipolar
      subjects and several case series in children and adolescents provide preliminary evidence
      that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, may be effective in treatment-resistant bipolar
      disorder. The first specific aim of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of
      clozapine compared to placebo in a double-blind study of children and adolescents with
      treatment refractory BPD. Other specific aims involve exploring the pathophysiology of
      early-onset BPD by 1) testing the hypotheses that, compared to controls, children with BPD
      have increased psychophysiological reactivity to emotional stimuli and decreased prepulse
      inhibition; 2) obtaining samples of genetic material from affected probands and their parents
      for later analysis; and 3) identifying anatomic changes in the brains of children with BPD
      using structural MRI.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (All 5 must be met): Children with BPD

        Ages 8-17

        Currently meets criteria for bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, as determined by the K-SADS
        diagnostic interview.

        Treatment-resistant, defined as a history of unsuccessful trials of lithium (documented
        level of greater than 0.8 mEq/L), valproic acid (documented level of greater than 50
        ug/ml), carbamazepine (documented level greater than or equal to 6 ug/ml), a neuroleptic as
        well as a combination of two of these agents. Each trial must have been at least 6 weeks
        long. A trial will be considered unsuccessful if the medication was discontinued because of
        intolerable side-effects.

        The child should be in treatment with a community psychiatrist to whom they will return
        upon completion of the study.

        Current CGAS score less than 50

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Children with BPD

        Full scale IQ less than 80

        Meets criteria for substance use disorder in the three months prior to randomization

        Currently pregnant, lactating, or sexually active without using a barrier method of
        contraception

        Previous treatment with clozapine

        History of seizures

        History of leukopenia or agranulocytosis

        Presence of an unstable medical illness

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: CONTROLS

        Control subjects will be age- and sex- matched to the BPD subjects. They will have normal
        physical and neurological examinations, and an identified primary care physician. Both
        control subjects and their first-degree relatives must be free of current or past
        psychopathology.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: CONTROLS

        I.Q less than 80; ongoing medical illness; neurologic disorder (including seizures);
        pregnancy; meeting past or present criteria for any diagnosis on the K-SADS-PL; meeting
        criterion A of post-traumatic stress disorder (exposure to a traumatic event).
