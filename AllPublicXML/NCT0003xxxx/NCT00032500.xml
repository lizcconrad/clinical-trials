      The purpose of this study is to determine whether three Echinacea preparations with different
      chemical compositions are effective for prevention or treatment of the common cold.

    <textblock>
      Echinacea is a widely used herbal remedy for the common cold. Previous clinical trials
      designed to assess the efficacy of Echinacea for prevention or treatment of the common cold
      have produced inconsistent results. A variety of different Echinacea products have been used
      in these clinical trials. Recent studies indicate that different Echinacea preparations have
      dramatically different phytochemical profiles. The available clinical trial data provide no
      information about the potential role of the different constituents of Echinacea in common
      cold prevention or treatment. Our hypothesis is that the variation in reported clinical
      effectiveness may be due to differences in the phytochemical profile of the Echinacea
      preparations used. This study will address the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the
      effectiveness of chemically defined extracts of E. angustifolia root which contain alkamides,
      echinacoside or polysaccharidelglycoprotein for common cold prevention or treatment; 2)
      Assess the correlation between specific Echinacea metabolites in serum and nasal secretions
      and efficacy for prevention and treatment of colds; and 3) Determine the effect of different
      Echinacea preparations on the host response to rhinovirus infection.
