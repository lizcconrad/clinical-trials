  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with esophageal cancer that has spread to other areas. The purpose
      of this study is to:

        1. Determine how well a combination of taxol, UFT, and leucovorin work in these patients,

        2. Determine the survival of patients with metastatic esophageal carcinoma treated with
           this combination of drugs.

        3. Identify the side effects of this drug combination.
