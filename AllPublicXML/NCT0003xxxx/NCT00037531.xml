      To evaluate the safety of long-term administration of sirolimus oral solution for up to 5
      additional years, or until the tablet formulation is commercially available (whichever occurs
      first) in solid organ transplant recipients who are currently receiving sirolimus and who
      have completed clinical trials with sirolimus (with or without cyclosporine (CsA). To
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of long-term administration of sirolimus tablets
      administered for up to 5 years, or until the tablet formulation is commercially available in
      solid organ transplant recipients who are currently receiving sirolimus and who have
      completed clinical trials with sirolimus (with or without CsA) or who are currently enrolled
      in protocol 0468E1-306-US.

             sirolimus may be enrolled into the study.

          -  Signed and dated informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:
