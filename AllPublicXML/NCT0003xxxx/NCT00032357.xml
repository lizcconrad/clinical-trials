      Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study #410, The Iron and Atherosclerosis Trial, FeAST, a
      24-hospital prospective randomized single-blinded clinical trial of graded iron reduction was
      conducted between May 1, 1999 and April 30, 2005, and has now been completed. A total of
      1,277 primarily male participants with peripheral arterial disease were entered. The primary
      outcome was all cause mortality and the secondary outcome combined death plus non-fatal
      myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.

      The original JAMA abstract (2007) reported no overall effect of iron reduction intervention
      by phlebotomy. However, pre-planned analyses according to randomization variables at entry,
      including age and ferritin level, were described in the JAMA paper showing improved outcomes
      with iron reduction with younger age by quartile for the secondary endpoint (p for
      interaction =0.004) and also suggested a favorable effect in smokers (p for interaction
      0.006). Age analyzed as a continuous variable using the Cox proportional hazards regression
      model and log relative hazard plots revealed that age interacted nonlinearly with treatment
      in both primary (p=0.04) and secondary (p&lt;0.001) outcomes. The Cox model showed improved
      primary (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.90, p=0.02) and secondary (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24-0.68,
      p&lt;0.001) outcomes in youngest age quartile participants (age 43 to 61) randomized to iron
      reduction versus control. Thus, an interaction between age and level of body iron may have
      masked beneficial effects of iron reduction in the overall cohort.

      Detailed analysis of the effect of age and ferritin levels published in the American Heart
      Journal confirmed that iron reduction significantly improved primary and secondary outcomes
      in youngest age quartile participants, as described above, displayed as Kaplan-Meier plots.
      Mean follow-up ferritin levels (MFFL) declined with increasing entry age in controls. Older
      age (p=0.026) and higher ferritin (p&lt;0.001) at entry predicted poorer compliance with
      phlebotomy and rising MFFL in iron reduction participants. Iron reduction intervention also
      produced greater ferritin reduction in younger participants. Improved outcomes with lower
      MFFL occurred in iron reduction patients for both primary (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23,
      p=0.028) and secondary (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.0-1.20, p=0.044) outcomes, and for the entire
      cohort: primary outcome (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23, p=0.037). Improved outcomes occurred with
      MFFL below versus above the median of the entire cohort means: primary outcome HR 1.48, 95%
      CI 1.14-1.92, p=0.003; secondary outcome HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50, p=0.067.

      Thus, lower iron burden predicted improved outcomes overall and was enhanced with iron
      reduction by phlebotomy. Controlling iron burden may improve survival, and prevent or delay
      non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. These findings warrant confirmation using further
      studies.

      A possible effect of iron levels on risk of cancer as well as vascular disease was recognized
      at trial inception. Participants with visceral malignancy within the preceding five years
      were excluded from this study. However, information was collected prospectively on the
      occurrence of new visceral malignancy and cause-specific mortality including death due to
      cancer. As reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, a new visceral
      malignancy was diagnosed during follow-up in 60 control and 38 iron reduction participants, a
      37% (HR 0.63; 95% CI = 0.42 - 0.95, p = 0.026) decrease in risk with iron reduction. Reduced
      cancer risk with iron reduction was confirmed on time-to-event analysis (HR = 0.65; 95% CI =
      0.43 - 0.97, p = 0.036). Reduced risk was observed for several common tumor types. Iron
      reduction participants had lower cancer - specific mortality and lower all-cause mortality in
      participants diagnosed with cancer (HR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.21 - 0.72, p = 0.003 and HR = 0.49;
      95% CI = 0.29 - 0.83, p = 0.009 respectively), compared to control participants. MFFL during
      follow-up in those participants randomized to iron reduction who developed cancer were
      comparable to levels in control participants (t93 = 0.8, p = 0.428). The MFFL in participants
      randomized to iron reduction developing cancer was 127 ng/mL, 95% CI = 71.2 - 183.0. The MFFL
      was significantly lower in participants not developing cancer, 76.4 ng/mL, 95% CI = 71.4 -
      81.4, p = 0.017). Participants randomized to iron reduction developing cancer appeared to be
      relatively non-compliant with intervention.

      Analysis of data from the FeAST study continues to delineate interactions between iron status
      and smoking, lipid levels and statin use, diabetes and race. It has been shown that ferritin
      levels ranging from about 70 to 79 ng/mL are associated with lower mortality and levels of
      inflammatory markers. Statin use, while not a randomization variable, has been monitored and
      shown to relate to lower ferritin levels.
