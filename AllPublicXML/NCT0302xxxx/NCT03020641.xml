    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that applying a low intraperitoneal pressure pneumoperitoneum
      (≤ 8mmHg) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the adverse impact on the surgical peritoneal
      environment (measured as gene expression of extracellular matrix, adhesion and inflammatory
      cytokine as well as oxidative stress response and apoptotic index), can be minimized and
      probably clinical outcomes might be better.

      Cholelithiasis is one of the most frequent abdominal diseases requiring surgical treatment.
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently the procedure of choice to remove the gallbladder.
      There is growing evidence that increased intra-abdominal pressure pneumoperitoneum, even for
      short periods of time, is associated with both transient and sometimes persistent adverse
      effects that might negatively affect the surgical peritoneal environment .There are some
      studies that have demonstrated that using low intraperitoneal pressure pneumoperitoneum,
      undesired effects like adverse impact on peritoneal tissue and negative clinical outcomes
      could be reduced.Therefore intraperitoneal pressure target during laparoscopy should be the
      lowest to allow surgery be securely performed. Many strategies have been tested in order to
      improve the volume of gas can be insufflated inside the abdominal cavity while maintaining
      low pneumoperitoneum pressure during laparoscopy.So far the most studied strategy has been
      deep neuromuscular blockade.However the effect of the depth of neuromuscular blockade in the
      intraabdominal volume is still controversial as sometimes in humans its benefits are
      marginal.There is scarce information in the medical literature regarding the adverse impact
      on peritoneal tissue of high pneumoperitoneum pressure during laparoscopy in humans. In
      addition available data are provided by non-prospective, non-randomized and small sample
      studies, so randomized controlled trials are required to ascertain this issues.To our
      knowledge our study is the first prospective and randomized controlled trial in humans aiming
      to study the adverse impact of high pressure pneumoperitoneum on peritoneal tissue as well as
      to associate it with clinical outcomes.
