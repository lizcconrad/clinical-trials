  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women and annually accounts for 10% of new
      malignancies worldwide. In mainland China, approximately 169,000 females are diagnosed with
      breast cancer every year and constitute 12.25% of the breast cancer incidents worldwide.
      Additionally, 30% of early breast cancer turns metastatic, which is often incurable.
      Different from women with early breast cancer, women with metastatic breast cancer(MBC)must
      receive lifelong treatment, experience higher levels of emotional/physical distress, and feel
      frequent uncertainty about their health/possible death. They are also challenged to manage
      distressing adverse effects induced by different adjuvant treatments and experience heavy
      self-care demands during the transition period from being a patient to being a survivor.
      Thus, specific interventions to help women with metastatic breast cancer to recover from this
      traumatic event have been designed, and one of these is supportive-expressive group
      therapy(SEGT).SEGT has been found to achieve improvement in anxiety, depression, quality of
      life (QoL), family functioning, and satisfaction with treatment. However, the effect of SEGT
      on survival is inconsistent. Initial studies examining SEGT have reported a mean survival
      advantage of 18 months, however, these findings could not later be replicated.Yet, no study
      has reported a survival disadvantage for those given SEGT. In addition, we found no published
      articles on the application of SEGT among women with MBC in China. Owing to this dearth of
      previous research, it is unclear whether this therapy would exhibit positive effects within
      Chinese culture. Thus, we developed a &quot;Be Resilient to Breast Cancer&quot;(BRBC) program that is
      culturally tailored for Chinese females with MBC. This program was adapted from SEGT and is
      designed to increase resilience(defined as the capacity to bounce back after encountering a
      traumatic event) and QoL, decrease emotional and physical distress(allostatic load), and
      eventually prolong longevity. To better adapt to Chinese culture, we added education hosted
      by professional staff (e.g., clinical psychologists, dietician, Chinese medicine
      practitioner, etc.)in an effort to foster self-efficacy to combat symptoms (such as pain,
      fatigue, intrusive thoughts, etc.) through knowledge and technics (such as breath control,
      meditation, etc.),and to help patients gain a sense of control in their life. Second, trained
      mentors, who were breast cancer survivors themselves, were added to the group discussion to
      create non-hierarchical, reciprocal relationships through the sharing of experiences with
      those facing similar challenges. These mentors also provided women with first-hand
      information about treatment and offered suggestions to combat barriers to recovery.

    <description>ALI was a composite index measured by 14 indicators from different physiological systems, including body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), resting pulse(RP), the standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDRR, heartbeat to heartbeat), resting systolicand diastolic blood pressure(SBP and DBP, respectively), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, serotonin, hormone cortisol(HC), C-reactive protein(CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Cluster of Differentiation 4/ Cluster of Differentiation 8(CD4+/CD8+). These indicators were selected to evaluate the functions of sympathetic nervous system (SNS), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA), cardiovascular, inflammation, and immunization. If a physical indicator was diagnosed as abnormal (i.e., RP of 107; normal range 60-100), patient would receive 1 point. Higher point totals indicated higher allostatic load. ALI range was from 0(extremely low) to 14(extremely high).</description>

    <description>The BRBC program consists of education and group discussion, and lasted for 12 months. Women in IG attended weekly meetings lasting for 120 minutes. Education took approximately 45 minute. Qualified professionals from various disciplines were invited to provide lessons to ensure the quality of the educational sessions. The group discussion followed the presentation and began with mentors sharing their experience with the topic, followed by participant discussions regarding life changes since diagnosis (e.g., physical, emotional, social, spiritual). Each group consisted of 7-9 patients and 3 leaders (2 mentors and 1 facilitator, including a clinical psychologist, nurse clinician, or social worker). The time of group discussion varied from 45-75 minutes. This was intended to foster support among group members,both in and out of sessions.</description>

Additionally, all patients received an educational brochure about breast cancer every 1 to 2 months, and relaxation therapy was provided to both groups to prevent demoralization from random assignment.</description>
