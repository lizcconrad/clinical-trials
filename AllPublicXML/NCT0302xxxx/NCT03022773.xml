      The purpose of this study is to understand the role of nutrition and its effects on the eye
      and other tissues. The investigators propose to study this by validating and correlating
      various non-invasive measurement methods of carotenoid concentrations in the human eye and
      skin tissue.

      A secondary objective is to correlate blood levels of carotenoids on a sub-set of
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The macula of the human retina (the structure responsible for high acuity vision essential
      for reading, driving and recognizing faces) is colored an intense yellow due to the
      deposition of two carotenoid compounds, lutein and zeaxanthin. These xanthophyll carotenoids
      are derived exclusively from the diet, and are hypothesized to protect the macula from
      light-induced oxidative damage by virtue of their light-screening and antioxidant properties.

      Epidemiological studies have shown that high dietary intake and blood levels of lutein and
      zeaxanthin are associated with lower rates of vision loss due to age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD).

      It is of interest to correlate carotenoid levels in the eye and skin tissues with blood
      levels of carotenoid compounds.

    <description>Carotenoid measurements of the eye (macula) are obtained through non-invasive ophthalmic photographs using the Heidelberg Spectralis imaging system.
Carotenoid measurements of the skin are measured by a laboratory instrument that uses a painless blue laser light for exposure of the skin and a photodetector for scattered light.
Carotenoid measurements in the blood are obtained through routine venipuncture.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient age 7 or older, undergoing routine dilated ophthalmology examinations at
             the Moran Eye Center will be eligible to participate.

          -  Patients with adult vitelliform dystrophy. (This condition initially presents in
             adulthood as bilateral subtle and often asymptomatic macular lesions, which are often
             misdiagnosed as early age-related macular degeneration (AMD)).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under age 7 will not be eligible to participate.
