    <textblock>
      The Randomized Control Trail included 4,172 low-birth weight children between February 2008
      and September 2013 in Bissau. The children who were included in the RCT and who are living in
      the Bandim Health Project study area will be visited. The study assistants will ask about the
      health of the child and of both parents. Furthermore, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) scar
      status of both child and parents will be checked.
