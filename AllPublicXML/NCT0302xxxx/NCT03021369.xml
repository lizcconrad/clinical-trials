    <textblock>
      The digital pleural drainage system Topaz+ by Medela is compared to the analogue system
      Atrium OCEAN by Maquet in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      The study is prospectively randomized with an all-comer setup. The patients are randomly
      selected for one of the systems. The surgery is performed in the standard fashion and chest
      tubes are placed routinely by the surgeon depending on the type of surgery. A retrosternal 32
      French drain is placed in every patient and pericardial and/or pleural drains are optional.

      The postoperative course does not vary from the clinical standard and the chest tubes are
      removed according to institutional standard. The clinical data about fluid amount, time of
      removal, air leaks, tamponade are routinely collected in a digital patient documentation
      system.

    <measure>Detection of air leak due to lung leakage or injury during surgery by the pleural drainage system.</measure>
    <time_frame>Occurrence of air leak is until the drain is removed (usually postoperative day 2 or 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The Thopaz+ system displays the amount of air leak on the screen in ml/min and the Ocean system is a 'wet seal' system, where bubbles in the box might indicate an air leak. If air leak is detected, the train cannot be removed and has to stay until no more air leak is detected. If air leak is unclear, chest x-rays with clamped drains are performed. If an pneumothorax is visible in the x-ray, the drains have to stay, otherwise they can be removed safely. The digital air leak detection and quantification by the Thopaz+ system might help in clearly detecting the air leaks.</description>
