    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination of molecular and biomarkers
      with functional imaging can predict pathologic response and clinical outcomes in squamous
      esophageal cancer patients who undergo trimodality therapy which includes neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy and surgery

    <textblock>
      The recommended care for the management of locally advanced esophageal cancers is neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by esophagectomy based on the NCCN guideline. The rate of
      pathologic complete response (pCR) after nCRT was around 25-30%, reflecting potential cure of
      unresectable esophageal cancer receiving CRT. Since esophagectomy might have substantial
      morbidity and mortality rate, establishing the model for predicting nCRT response and
      survival will guide neoadjuvant treatment decisions and personalized treatment. Thus surgery
      might be spared in some patients with complete responses after nCRT, and surgery could be
      selectively reserved for those with only partial or no response to CRT. However, reported
      models yield unsatisfactory results due to small sample size and low accuracy, and most cases
      were adenocarcinoma and few models were used to predict survival. This study will
      prospectively collect the tissue and blood samples of locally advanced esophageal cancer
      patients, detect CRT resistance biomarkers, assess the SUV value and texture parameters of
      18F-FDG PET-CT as well as ADC values DWI-MRI. The investigators will use advanced statistical
      tools to establish the model and further validate the model in another group of patients.The
      investigators will also establish a model for survival prediction. This model might possibly
      guide the personalized treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients in China.

    <description>Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG) was used for pathology analysis. Primary tumor and positive lymph node regression were classified into five histologic tumor regression grades. Grade 1 (complete regression) showed absence of histologically identifiable residual cancer and fibrosis extending through the different layers of the esophageal wall, with or without granuloma. Grade 2 was characterized by the presence of rare residual cancer cells scattered through the fibrosis. Grade 3 involved an increase in the number of residual cancer cells, but fibrosis still predominated. Grade 4 showed residual cancer outgrowing fibrosis. Grade 5 was characterized by the absence of regressive changes.</description>

    <description>This study will prospectively collect the tissue and blood samples of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients, perform CRT resistance biomarkers testing and functional imaging analysis including SUV value and texture parameters of 18F-FDG PET-CT as well as ADC values DWI-MRI before treatment, 2-3 weeks after the initiation of CRT, and 4 weeks post-nCRT. The investigators will use advanced statistical tools to establish the model and further validate the model in another group of patients. The investigators will also establish a model for survival prediction.</description>
