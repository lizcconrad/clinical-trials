    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study will assess the efficacy, safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of emicizumab administered at a dose of 6 milligrams
      per kilogram (mg/kg) every 4 weeks in participants with hemophilia A with or without
      inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII). The study consists of 2 parts: a pharmacokinetic (PK)
      run-in part followed by an expansion part.

          -  Participants using rFVIIa or willing to switch to recombinant activated factor VII
             (rFVIIa) as primary bypassing agent for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds

             administration of study drug

          -  Participants without FVIII inhibitors, that is with less than (&lt;) 0.6 Bethesda unit
             per milliliter [BU/mL];&lt; 1.0 BU/mL only for laboratories with an historical

             immune tolerance induction (ITI) must have done so at least 5 years before screening
             and must have no evidence of inhibitor recurrence (permanent or temporary) indicated
             by detection of an inhibitor greater than (&gt;) 0.6 BU/mL (&gt; 1.0 BU/mL only for
             laboratories with an historical sensitivity cutoff for inhibitor detection of 1.0

          -  History of illicit drug or alcohol abuse within 48 weeks prior to screening, in the
             investigator's judgment

          -  Participants who are at high risk for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (for example,
             have a previous medical or family history of TMA), in the investigator's judgment

          -  Previous (within the last 12 months) or current treatment for thromboembolic disease
             (with the exception of previous catheter-associated thrombosis for which
             anti-thrombotic treatment is not currently ongoing) or signs of thromboembolic disease

          -  Other conditions (for example, certain autoimmune diseases) that may currently
             increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis

          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity associated with monoclonal antibody
             therapies or components of the emicizumab injection

          -  Known HIV infection with cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 cells counts &lt;200 cells per
             microliter (cells/mcL)

             use during the study, with the exception of anti-retroviral therapy

          -  Concomitant disease, condition, significant abnormality on screening evaluations or
             laboratory tests, or treatment that could interfere with the conduct of the study, or
             that would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an additional unacceptable risk
             in administering study drug to the participant

          -  Pregnancy or lactation or intention to become pregnant during the study

          -  Women with a positive serum pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to initiation of
