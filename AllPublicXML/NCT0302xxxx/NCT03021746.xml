    <description>The focus of this approach is for Peer Leaders (PL) to provide Diabetes Self Management Support (DSMS) with the oversight of Parish Nurses (PN). The first component starts with group-based Diabetes Self Management Education (DSME) provided by Certified Diabetes Educators (CDE), co-facilitated by PN and PL and held at the church. PL will also facilitate activities including behavioral goal setting, monthly phone contacts, and preparation for a diabetes-related health care visit, with oversight of PN. As the study progresses, PL and PN will have progressive leadership responsibilities. Following DSME, participants will be invited to attend 12 months of monthly DSMS support groups led by the PL, with oversight from the PN. This approach allows for PN to provide direct supervision to PL in areas of clinical content, educational methods, and group facilitation and communication skills.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Peer Leader Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This approach will contain the same elements as the PN plus PL approach, except that a PN will not be used. Rather, PL will provide all aspects of DSMS, including behavioral goal setting, monthly phone contacts, and preparation for a diabetes-related health care visit. This approach will be delivered in a group setting. DSME will be provided by CDEs and co-facilitated by a PL to ensure consistency in the DSME content. Following DSME, participants will be invited to attend 12 monthly DSMS groups led by PL. Following the group sessions, participants will transition into a period of ongoing support. During this time, participants and PL will be encouraged to foster DSMS through programs and initiatives that are meaningful to them, utilizing the existing church infrastructure. If needed, PL may contact the CDE for additional information</description>

Following DSME, participants will be invited to attend 12 months of monthly, DSMS support groups led by the PN. Following support sessions, participants will transition into a period of ongoing support, where the participants and PN will be encouraged to continue to foster DSMS through programs and initiatives that are meaningful to them, utilizing the existing church infrastructure. The PN may answer clinical questions and may contact the CDE for additional information if needed.</description>
