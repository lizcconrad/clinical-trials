    <textblock>
      In this clinical research,48 cases TB (Tuberculosis patients) participants and 48 cases
      non-TB participants with lung disease who all meet the standard are divided into different
      groups through a randomized and blind method. Every subject inject intradermally ESAT6-CFP10
      and TB-PPD (tuberculin purified protein derivative) in different arms of the same person by
      blind method. Specific gama-interferon (γ-IFN) detection is needed before the
      injection.Measure the induration and (or) redness of longitudinal diameter size and
      transverse diameter vernier caliper by vernier caliper after injection 24h, 48h and 72h. At
      the same time, we observe all kind of adverse events in order to assess the safety of drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical research,we make sure of the safety in the crowd 5-18 years old firstly,then
      carry out the crowd of under 5 years old(including 5).

      Firstly, 24 cases TB (Tuberculosis) participants and 24 cases non-TB participants with lung
      disease who are all 5-18 years old and meet the standard respectively are divided into
      different groups through a randomized and blind method.

        1. ESAT6-CFP10(10ug/ml) in left arm and TB-PPD in right arm

        2. ESAT6-CFP10(10ug/ml) in right arm and TB-PPD in left arm Inject intradermally
           ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD in different arms of the same participant. For each of
           participant, the person in this clinical research, the study uniform is that every
           subject injects firstly left arm, observe no obvious adverse reaction, then another drug
           inject in right arm. Measure the induration and (or) redness of longitudinal diameter
           size and transverse diameter vernier caliper by vernier caliper after injection 24h, 48h
           and 72h. At the same time, we observe the vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood
           pressure and temperature), local reactions (rash, pain, itching and skin mucous
           membrane) and a variety of adverse events.

      Secondly, 24 cases TB (Tuberculosis) participants and 24 cases non-TB participants with lung
      disease who are all less than 5 years old are divided into two different groups and the
      procedure are as the same as 5-18 years old.

      Finally, we calculate the sensitivity (positive coincidence rate) by TB (Tuberculosis
      patients), the specificity (negative coincidence rate) by non-TB participants with lung
      disease, and verify the safety and effectiveness of ESAT6-CFP10(10ug/ml) for the clinical
      auxiliary diagnosis of tuberculosis.
