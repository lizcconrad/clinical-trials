  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effect of cerebral oxygen saturation as an early
      predictor of neurological outcomes in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after
      cardiac arrest
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study is planned as a prospective observational study. Patients undergoing therapeutic
      hypothermia in our intensive care unit after cardiac arrest will be enrolled. Each patient's
      cerebral oxygenation will be monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in every 6
      hours during our 24 hour lasting hypothermia period. Afterwards, patients will be monitorised
      in every 6 hours during the first day of hypothermia and than the mean values of daily
      cerebral oxygen values will be noted in the third, fourth and fifth days of nomothermia.
      Regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) will be noted from left and right probes. Full Outline of
      Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and cerebral performance category
      scale (CPC) will be noted at the beginning of therapeutic hypothermia and each day during
      normothermia, day 21 and the day of discharge from ICU.

    <description>During the first 48 hours of hospitalization, we will collect the cerebral oximetry values in the two cerebral. hemispheres.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The cerebral oximetry values (average of the two hemispheres) will be compared between patients with good and poor neurological outcome according with CPC score</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 8 times during the first 48 hours of hospitalization, the third day, fourth day and fifth day and the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2-4 weeks and a 12 month follow up will be performed</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebral oximetry values (average of the two hemispheres) will be compared between patients with good and poor neurological outcome according to the CPC score.
CPC 1: Conscious and alert with normal function or only slight disability CPC 2: Conscious and alert with moderate disability CPC 3: Conscious with severe disability CPC 4: Comatose or persistent vegetative state CPC 5: death. CPC will be evaluated at the time of admission to intensive care unit and day 21.CPC score (CPC = 1 become good score - 2 and bad become CPC = 3-5).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The cerebral oximetry values (average of the two hemispheres) will be compared between patients with good and poor neurological outcome according with Four score</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for 8 times during the first 48 hours of hospitalization, the third day, fourth day and fifth day and the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2-4 weeks and a 12 month follow up will be performed</time_frame>
    <description>The cerebral oximetry values (average of the two hemispheres) will be compared between patients with good and poor neurological outcome according to the Fourscore (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness):It evaluates four functional categories: eye response, motor response, brainstem reflexes, and respiration pattern (including mechanical ventilation). All the four categories are scored from 0 to 4 points, with 4 representing normal, and 0 indicating no function.</description>

    <description>As we start the targeted temperature management protocol (24 hours of hypothermia adjusted to 33-36 C and afterwards up to five days of normothermia [36.5 C]) NIRS sensor pads will be placed over the right and left frontal area. Regional cerebral oxygen values will be continuously recorded at the NIRS monitor. Tests to assess neurological outcome will be performed. Patients will be assessed in terms of neurological performance tests and regional cerebral oxygen.</description>
