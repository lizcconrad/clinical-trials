  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Craniosynostosis (CS) is a common malformation occurring in ~4 per 10,000 live births in
      which the sutures between skull bones close too early, causing long-term problems with brain
      and skull growth. Infants with CS typically require extensive surgical treatment and may
      experience many perioperative complications, including hemorrhage and re-synostosis. Even
      with successful surgery, children can experience developmental and learning disabilities or
      vision problems. Most often, CS appears as isolated nonsyndromic CS (NSC). Of the several
      subtypes of CS, unilateral or bilateral fusion of the coronal suture is the second most
      common form of CS accounting for 20-30% of all NSC cases. The etiology of coronal NSC (cNSC)
      is not well understood, although the published literature suggests that it is a
      multifactorial condition. About 5-14% of coronal craniosynostosis patients have a positive
      family history, with a specific genetic etiology identified in &gt;25% of cNSC cases, suggesting
      a strong genetic component in the pathogenesis of this birth defect. The causes for cNSC and
      its phenotypic heterogeneity remain largely unknown. An international team of investigators
      will generate large genomic and gene expression datasets on samples from patients with cNSC.
      State-of-the-art imaging, genetic, and developmental and systems biology approaches will be
      used to quantitatively model novel pathways and networks involved in the development of cNSC.
      Novel variant-, gene- and network-level analyses will be performed on the genomic data
      obtained from cNSC cases, their relatives, and controls to identify novel variants and
      genetic regions associated with cNCS. Quantitative, analytical, and functional validations of
      these predictions will provide insights into the etiology and possible therapeutic targets
      for CS and potentially other bone-related disorders.

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of the Program Project, Craniosynostosis Network, is to elucidate normal
      and abnormal craniofacial biology to ultimately improve the treatment of craniofacial
      disorders. Craniosynostosis and other skull abnormalities are among the most common human
      malformations usually requiring surgical and medical intervention. The Network will integrate
      three projects and two cores. Scientists with diverse expertise including anthropology,
      morphometry, imaging, birth defects, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, epidemiology,
      statistics, and systems biology will explore the determinants of the fate of the relevant
      mesenchymal progenitor cells, abnormalities in osteogenesis that contribute to global skull
      growth abnormality and premature closure of cranial sutures, especially the coronal suture.
      High quality genomic data will be obtained from patients with coronal nonsyndromic
      craniosynostosis (cNSC) and their available parents. Novel genome-wide variant-, gene- and
      network-level analyses will be performed on these families to identify novel variants and
      genetic regions associated with coronal craniosynostosis.

      This study is a multi-center, open-enrollment, retrospective study, employing both
      family-based and case-control study designs.

      Approximately 4000 cNSC patients, their family members, and controls will be recruited by
      Mount Sinai and the majority will be recruited from the more than 10 collaborating
      institutions worldwide.

    <ipd_description>Clinical results from chromosomal analysis and DNA mutation analysis performed in CLIA approved laboratories with standard clinical genetic counseling will be given to the patient upon request. Individual research results will be made available to the individual from the PI or their primary care physician (PCP) who has obtained preliminary results from the PI from our non-CLIA laboratory, as long as the PCP can confirm and validate the lab results through a CLIA approved lab before the results are given to the subjects.</ipd_description>
