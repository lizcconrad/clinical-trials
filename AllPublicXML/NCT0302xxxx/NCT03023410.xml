  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to draw relationships between the soft-tissue related complications
      contributing to early TKA revision and the loading and positional patterns from
      intraoperative tibial trial sensors. The data from the sensors may enable the surgeon to
      address such soft-tissue abnormalities that may otherwise be unknown during traditional total
      knee revision procedures. The utilization of sensors should in theory, help diagnose the
      potential causes attributing to soft-tissue imbalance and may lead to a decreased need for an
      all component revision. Furthermore, the economic implications from converting a total
      revision to a partial revision could have a profound effect to the patient and healthcare
      provider such as decreased rehabilitation regimes and opportunity for cost savings. Eligible
      revision patients who agree to participate will be followed for a period of 12 months
      following the revision procedure. Patient reported outcomes measures (PROM) such as the 2011
      Knee Society Score (KSS) and the Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) will be
      collected at baseline (pre-operatively) and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months
      post-procedure. All outcomes will be scored to observe changes from baseline at 12-months.
      Cost-analyses of sensor-assisted revision TKA will be performed to include OR costs, facility
      and physician fees, as well as payments to post-acute collaborators such as SNFs, rehab
      hospitals, PT and home care providers. A quantitative analysis of commercial payer claims /
      usage data (e.g., CMS Medpar data) will be used to examine costs associated with traditional
      revision TKA procedures.

    <description>This survey is subdivided into a knee score that rates only the knee joint itself and a functional score that rates the patient's ability to walk and climb stairs. Patient expectations as well as patient satisfaction are also evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>This survey is primarily used to measure health related quality of life, to estimate disease burden and to evaluate disease-specific impact on general and selected populations. The items on the questionnaire correspond to eight principal health domains including general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy-fatigue , social functioning and mental health</description>
