  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study covers the first trial of the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus (CKKA) vaccine
      on humans (healthy volunteers), which has been developed in Turkey and has completed
      preclinical toxicology studies to be performed on experimental animals. Also, this study is a
      Phase I, randomized, double-blind, national, single-center, placebo-controlled study that is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CKKA vaccine. A total of 60 (12 + 48)
      healthy male and/or female volunteers will be participating in this study, and the study is
      planned to last approximately one year.
