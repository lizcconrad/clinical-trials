    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of extending time of continual urinary drainage (using
      transurethral foley catheter) for patients with early failures of vesicovaginal fistula
      repairs. Half of those included will be randomized to replacement of foley catheter for a
      length of 14 additional days, while the other half will be discharged (no intervention). Both
      groups will be examined for outcomes at 3 months post-repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, there is no standard of care nor consensus for the proper management of repaired
      vesicovaginal fistulas that begin leaking prior to or immediately after scheduled catheter
      removal. In the past, extension of time with catheterization has been tried, with patients
      becoming fully healed by the time of catheter removal. However, some patients who are
      discharged with a fistulous leak later return at follow up completely dry, with a closed and
      healed fistula. This study will compare, in a prospective, randomized manner, extension of
      catheterization vs no intervention, to see if in such patients extending catheterization will
      improve their likelihood of complete fistula healing.
