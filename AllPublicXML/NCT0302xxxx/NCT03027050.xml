  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was aimed to evaluate the contributions of T-PRF treatment combined with open flap
      debridement on biological markers in GCF and periodontal outcomes in chronic periodontitis
      patients. 29 patients (58 sites) with chronic periodontitis were treated either with
      autologous T-PRF with OFD or OFD alone. GCF growth factor levels and relative RANKL/OPG ratio
      at baseline and 2, 4 and 6 weeks postoperatively were analyzed, and clinical parameters such
      as probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL) and gingival margin level (GML) at
      baseline and 9 months after surgery were compromised.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 29 medically healthy patients (12 females and 17 males; age range 28-49 years,
      mean±SD: 38.22±8.21) with chronic periodontitis at the outpatient Ataturk University,
      Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Erzurum, Turkey, were selected for the
      study. The study, conducted from November 2015 to June 2016, was planned as a randomized,
      double-blinded, controlled clinical trial that used a split-mouth design. This study was
      proved by the ethics committee of Ataturk University Faculty of Dentistry, and all patients
      received verbal information regarding participation and provided written informed consent for
      including to the study.

      Bone loss characteristics of the patients were diagnosed with full-mouth radiographs and
      cone-beam computed tomography. This study included the patients with moderate-to-severe
      chronic periodontitis with a probing depth of 5 mm or deeper and horizontal bone loss (one-
      or two-wall shallow interproximal defects) of at least two quadrants of the jaws after
      Phase-I periodontal therapy. After re-evaluating the results of Phase-I therapy, patients
      with any of the following were excluded from the study: 1) smoking or tobacco use in any
      form; 2) medications known to affect periodontal treatment and blood coagulation; 3) systemic
      conditions known to affect periodontal status; 4) pregnancy/lactation; and 5) poor oral
      hygiene (plaque index [PI] &gt;1.5) (Sillness and Loe; 1964). Patients with teeth with 3-wall
      intrabony defects, gingival recession, endodontic lesion, or furcation involvement were also
      excluded.
