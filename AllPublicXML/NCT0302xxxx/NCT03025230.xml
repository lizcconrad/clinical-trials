      Hypothesis The application of intramuscular electrostimulation will be more effectiveness
      than the dry needling in myofascial trigger points treatment.

      Objetives:

      To determine the effectiveness of intramuscular electrostimulation in the treatment of
      trigger points of the levator scapula muscle for the improvement of pain in mechanical
      cervicalgia.

      Participants: Subjects with diagnosed of myofascial pain syndrome in cervical region and
      active trigger points in levator scapulae muscle, randomly assigned to experimental or
      control group.

      Intervention: Control group: one session of dry needling in active trigger points;
      experimental group: one session of intramuscular stimulation in active trigger points.

      Main Outcomes Measures: Pain, pressure pain threshold (PPT), active cervical range of motion
      and strength muscle . The measures will be taken before, after and one week after the
      interventions.

      The muscle pain is one of the most common forms of musculoskeletal pain. Within muscular
      pain, the presence of myofascial trigger points (PG) in the musculature is a important and
      prevalent problem.

      Currently one the techniques most used in the treatment of PG is dry needling. Dry needling
      has been shown effective in the treatment of neck pain associated with PGs.

      To our knowledge, there are no studies that they have compared the effectiveness of dry
      needling and intramuscular stimulation by applying an electric current.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial that aims to demonstrate that the application of an
      electric current associated with dry needling in the treatment of PG.

      In this study we will treat subjects with cervical pain who they have active PGs in the
      levator scapulae muscle.
