    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well an interactive tailored website works in promoting sun
      protection and skin self-check behaviors in patients with stage 0-III melanoma. An
      internet-based program may help individuals to perform skin self-checks and engage in sun
      protection behaviors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of the interactive tailored website (ITW) versus usual care on skin
      self-examination (SSE) and sun protection behaviors among individuals diagnosed with
      melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine mediators of the impact of the intervention. The effects of the intervention on
      SSE and sun protection behaviors will be mediated by melanoma knowledge, self-efficacy for
      SSE and sun protection behaviors, perceived benefits of SSE and sun protection behaviors,
      perceived barriers to SSE and sun protection behaviors, and perceived controllability of
      melanoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine moderators of the impact of the intervention. To evaluate whether ITW effects
      are moderated by the following factors: time since diagnosis, disease stage, age, sex,
      income, education, Internet experience, distress about melanoma, worry about recurrence, and
      evaluation and usage of the ITW.

      OUTLINE:

      Phase I: Patients review draft website content materials in a semi-structured format and
      provide feedback via open- and closed-ended questions for the development, testing, and
      finalization of ITW.

      Phase II: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients access ITW and complete each module over 30-40 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients receive usual care and are then offered ITW.

      All patients in Phase II complete surveys over 20-40 minutes at 8, 24, and 48 weeks.
