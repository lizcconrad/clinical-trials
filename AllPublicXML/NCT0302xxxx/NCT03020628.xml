      This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind Phase III Clinical trial. The purpose
      of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the quadrivalent cell
      culture-derived influenza vaccine compare to the trivalent cell culture-derived influenza
      vaccine in children aged 6~35 months.

      Subjects are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to NBP607-QIV 0.5mL versus NBP607-TIV 0.25mL.
      To assess the immunogenicity, antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination
      inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained at pre-vaccination and 28 days post-vaccination. To
      assess the safety, solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited
      adverse events for 28 days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. The serious adverse
      events are collected during 6 months post-vaccination.
