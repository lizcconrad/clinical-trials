      The current study is designed to investigate the difference of plasma orexin A levels between
      Dexmedetomidine group and controlled group at emergence time from total intravenous
      anesthesia who will undergo elective lumbar surgery.

      DESIGNING: Forty patients with ASA physical status I or II scheduled for elective surgery
      under general anesthesia (lasting for 2h to 4h) were enrolled. Anesthesia was induced with
      propofol 1-2mg/kg and sufentanyl 0.2-0.3μg/kg. Following muscle relaxation with iv
      cisatracurium besylate 0.2mg/kg endotracheal intubation was performed. Anesthesia was
      maintained with target controlled infusion propofol (targeted concentration:1-2ug/ml ) and
      remifentanil (targeted concentration: 2-6ng/ml ). Muscle relaxation was maintained with
      intermittent, but it do not injected in 1h before surgery completion. Propofol and
      remifentanil were titrated to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60 during
      anesthesia. The end-tidal carbon dioxide level was maintained between 30 and 40 mmHg by
      controlled mechanical ventilation. When the surgery was completed the investigators adjust
      the targeted concentration of propofol 0.1ug/ml and targeted concentration of remifentanil to
      2ng/ml then stop all anesthetics. Dexmedetomidine group target controlled infusion
      dexmedetomidine (induction dose 1ug/kg with 10min, maintain dose 0.5ug/kg/h until 30min
      before surgery completion). Control group infusion same saline. Record time from stopping
      anesthetics to emergence and total doses of anesthetics. Arterial blood (2.5ml) was collected
      at the following time, such as before and 1h after induction of anesthesia, at emergence (1
      min after tracheal extubation) and half an hour after tracheal extubation. 2.0ml Arterial
      blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15min at −4 ◦C in order to separate plasma then stored
      at −80 ◦C until assay for orexin A concentrations. 0.5ml Arterial blood was measured blood
      glucose.
