      This study aimed to verify whether orange juice, source of citrus flavonoids and vitamin C,
      may contribute to the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-three patients with chronic hepatitis C who were being treated with pegylated
      interferon combined with ribavirin, according to the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic
      Guidelines for Viral Hepatitis C and Co-infections of the Brazilian Health Ministry were
      randomly divided into two parallel groups: (1) orange juice (n = 23), which were supplemented
      with orange juice (500 mL/d) for 8 weeks; (2) control group (n = 20) composed of patients
      that were not drinking orange juice regularly. The recruitment process began in February
      2012, the intervention was carried out from May 2012 to July 2012, and the data analysis
      started in September 2012. The sample number took into account variances on total cholesterol
      with a type I error α = 0.05 and a type II error β = 0.2 (80% power) (Dourado et al., 2015).
      The minimum sample size should have 20 individuals per group (n = 40), considering an
      approximately 15% dropout rate. Primary and secondary endpoints were the reduction of total
      cholesterol and modification of biochemical markers, respectively. Kolmogorov Smirnov and
      Levene test assessed normality and homogeneity of data, respectively. Assessment of the data
      was performed in all participants on the first and last day of the experiment. All the
      parameters were compared between the juice group and the control group using General Linear
      Model of Repeated Measures Analysis. Differences in baseline patients' characteristics
      between the two groups were analyzed by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The LSD signed
      rank post-test was used to assess significant changes in parameters after the start of
      treatment in each group, and the differences were considered statistically significant at p &lt;
      0.05.

    <description>The patients were instructed to drink orange juice in two daily portions during eight consecutive weeks. Patients from both groups were asked to maintain their usual lifestyle, diet, and physical activity, and they were checked weekly by the researcher's team. Assessments of anthropometric data, dietary intake, as well as blood sample collection for biochemical analysis were performed in all participants on the first and last day of the experiment.</description>
