      The assessor is responsible for all clinical procedure that will be conducted in this study
      during all the visits:

      Panoramic radiograph and periapical radiographs will be made on the prospected abutment teeth
      to evaluate the crown-root ratio, the apical condition of the abutment and their alveolar
      bone support.

      The preliminary impression will be performed with irreversible hydro-colloid impression
      material (alginate), The impressions will be poured with type IV dental stone to obtain
      diagnostic casts. Maxillary Face-bow will be recorded. The diagnostic casts will be mounted
      on semi adjustable articulator in centric occluding relation to evaluate the interarch
      distance and occlusal plane.

      Special trays will be constructed and Mouth preparation will be performed by preparing
      guiding planes and rests seats will be prepared opposing to the edentulous area. Final
      impression will be taken by elastomeric impression material. The impression will be poured
      into type IV dental stone in order to obtain master cast. The master cast will be surveyed.
      The proposed design will be as follows: metal framework base saddle for edentulous areas on
      both sides connected with palatal strap. Aker's clasp on all abutments with buccal retention.
      The denture base will be tried in with acrylic teeth in patient's mouth. After that, the
      denture base of the partial denture will be processed incorporation with the metal framework
      into the two different materials to be evaluated. The first group will receive the partial
      denture in which the metal framework incorporated with the denture base fabricated from PEEK
      material. The second group will receive the partial denture in which the metal framework
      incorporated with the denture base material fabricated from BRE-FLEX.

    <intervention_name>PEEK</intervention_name>
    <description>Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a synthetic, tooth colored polymeric material that has been used as a biomaterial in orthopedics for many years but recently used as removable prosthetic material. Advantages of this polymer material are elimination of allergic reactions, high polishing qualities, low plaque affinity, and good wear resistance.
It has been proven that it shows high mechanical and biological properties. Studies evaluating the properties of this material are limited and need more clinical tests.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bre.flex</intervention_name>
    <description>Bre.flex is a nylon-based thermoplastic material, composed of nylon PA 12 (polyamide).Nylon exhibits high physical strength, heat resistance and chemical resistance. It can be easily modified to increase stiffness and wear resistance. Nylon resin can be semi-translucent and provides excellent esthetics but it is a little more difficult to adjust and polish.</description>
