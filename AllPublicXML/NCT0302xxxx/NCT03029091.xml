  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Losartan potassium in
      subjects with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), both those with a connective tissue disorder
      (CTD) and those without a CTD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of Losartan potassium to see what
      effects (good and bad) it has on participants and their Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). If a
      subject has Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) the researchers want to see what effects (good or
      bad) Losartan has on EoE.

      EoE is an inflammatory disease in the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the
      stomach) that is typically triggered by exposure to certain things in food. Connective Tissue
      Disorders (CTDs) are disorders that affect the connective tissues in the body, such as fat,
      bone, and cartilage.

      Eosinophils release a protein called TGF-beta. Losartan may decrease the amount of the
      protein and therefore help EoE and CTD.

      Losartan is a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for use in adults and children over 6 years of age who have high blood pressure. This
      medication has not been studied in people with EoE.

          -  does or does not have diagnosis of a connective tissue disorder (CTD)

          -  has been on a high dose of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for at least 8 weeks prior to a
             diagnostic endoscopy of EoE without histologic resolution (i.e., ≥ 15
             eosinophils/HPF).

               2. have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and at each monthly study
                  visit.
