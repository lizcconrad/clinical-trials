  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt an existing couples-level HIV prevention intervention
      for community populations (CONNECT I/II; PI: El-Bassel) to enable implementation among
      couples affected by incarceration (PRISON CONNECT) and pilot test its feasibility and
      acceptability among men incarcerated in the Connecticut Department of Correction (CTDOC) and
      their community-dwelling committed female partners.

      This pilot study will recruit male inmates in the Connecticut Department of Correction and
      their community-dwelling female partner. Using an adapted version of an efficacious
      couples-level HIV prevention intervention for community populations (CONNECT; PI: El-Bassel),
      this study will pilot test a single in-prison intervention session using face-to-face or
      teleconferencing modalities and a brief community follow-up session. Feasibility and
      acceptability among the inmates and their partners will be assessed.

    <description>Using tracking information provided at the time of in-prison session of PRISON CONNECT investigators will initiate contact with couples within the first month of release and conduct the follow-up visit at a location/time convenient for couples (e.g., team's research facility in New Haven, CT). The session will include a review of PRISON CONNECT intervention content.</description>
