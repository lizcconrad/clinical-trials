      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible patients with Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.

      This program is designed to provide access to niraparib prior to approval by the US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA).

      To be eligible, patients with Recurrent Ovarian Cancer following a partial (PR) or complete
      response (CR) to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy and must have experienced a PR
      or CR after the penultimate (next to last) platinum-based chemotherapy for at least 6 months
      without disease progression after this chemotherapy.

      If a patient qualifies for participation in an ongoing niraparib clinical trial or is already
      participating in a niraparib clinical trial, she will not be able to participate in the EAP.

      Ongoing clinical trials for niraparib include:

        -  A Phase 3 trial in patients who have received first-line treatment for ovarian cancer
           (the PRIMA trial, NCT # 02655016)

        -  A Phase 2 trial in patients who have received multiple lines of treatment for ovarian
           cancer (the QUADRA trial, NCT # 02354586)

        -  A Phase 1/2 trial in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
           or recurrent ovarian cancer. (the TOPACIO trial, NCT # 02657889)
