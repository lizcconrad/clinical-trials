  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      270 untreated patients, age between 18 and 65 years , with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (B-DLCL) were treated with a pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PL-doxorubicin) modiÔ¨Åed
      CHOP-rituximab regimen. PL-doxorubicin 35-40 mg/m(2)and epirubicin 70mg/m(2) were given in
      combination with standard dosage of prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab
      (according to CHOP-R regimen) every 21 days for six courses.

      PL-doxorubicin 35-40 mg/m(2) and epirubicin 70mg/m(2) were given on day 1 in combination with
      standard dosage of prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide (according to CHOP regimen)
      every 21days for six courses. The choice to adopt the dosage of 30 mg/m2(instead of 50 mg/m2
      of conventionaldoxorubicin) was based on pharmacokinetic data and on the results of previous
      studies in lymphoma.Rituximab 375 mg/m2 was given on day 0 in subsequent courses of therapy.
      Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given in the presence of grade 4 neutropenia or
      febrile neutropenia until hematological recovery. Treatment was stopped if lymphoma
      progressed, the patient refused further participation,or if there was any other intercurrent
      clinical condition or adverse event.
