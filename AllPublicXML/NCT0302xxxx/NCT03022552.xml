  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational cohort study, will investigate the platelet phenotype,
      platelet genetic composition, and role of platelets as effector cells in women with
      myocardial infarction (MINOCA or MI-CAD) and controls. This study, which will take place at
      NYU and Bellevue Medical Center, may have concurrent enrollment with the HARP Main Imaging
      (NCT02914483) and HARP Stress Ancillary Studies (NCT02270359). Additionally, a group of age
      and race matched disease controls 'CATH-NOCA' composed of women with stable angina referred
      for cardiac catheterization, will be enrolled. Blood obtained during the initial
      catheterization, 2 months post-MI, and following the stress study (for those participants
      enrolled in the stress study) will be utilized for platelet testing.

        This study may have concurrent enrollment with the HARP Main Imaging (NCT02905357) and HARP
        Stress Ancillary Studies (NCT02914483). This study population includes women who present to
        the hospital with an MI, with non-obstructive coronary artery disease or obstructive artery
        disease, are eligible for blood collection. Additionally, a group of age and race matched
        disease controls 'CATH-NOCA' will be composed of women with stable angina referred for
        cardiac catheterization.
