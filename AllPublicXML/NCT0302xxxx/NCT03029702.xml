  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a significant clinical and public health burden, affecting over
      400,000 pregnant women in the United States each year. Without adequate treatment, women with
      GDM and their infants are at risk for substantial morbidity. Because of this, experts
      recommend treatment focused on normalization of hyperglycemia to improve outcomes. However,
      providers have limited capacity to predict which treatment will achieve glycemic goals. This
      results in a choice based on provider and patient preference and a trial and error approach,
      which can create delays in glycemic control within the short (8-10 weeks) window between
      diagnosis and delivery. Maternal and fetal morbidity may be related to a mismatch between
      glycemic pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of glucose-lowering agents. In fact, GDM
      is heterogeneous, with predominant insulin resistance (IR) in 50%, insulin secretion deficit
      (ISD) in 30%, and a combination of both in 20% of women as underlying mechanisms of
      hyperglycemia. This variation in GDM pathophysiology and clinical outcomes supports the use
      of an individualized treatment approach. The overall goal of this project is to investigate
      an individualized treatment approach for GDM where treatment is based on each woman's GDM
      mechanism. The study will employ the same treatment in both arms, but choice of treatment
      will differ based on study arm (matched or unmatched to GDM mechanism).
