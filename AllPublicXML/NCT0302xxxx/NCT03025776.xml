      To further develop interventions, the investigators need a better understanding of which task
      requirements (i.e. size or weight of object, location in workspace, etc.) drive a person
      after stroke to use 2 hands (as opposed to 1), and how the severity of their injury impacts
      this relationship and compare this to reaching in age-matched healthy controls subjects. A
      better understanding of this relationship will promote more informed development of
      rehabilitative interventions. This study proposes to explore in people after stroke and
      healthy controls: i.) how specific functional tasks requirements relate to 1 vs. 2 handed
      use, and ii.) how stroke severity impacts this arm use. We are proposing to study 15
      individuals more than 6 months after stroke in the CSU Motor Behavior Lab for a two x 3 hour
      session of task-related reaching in sitting and 33 age matched (double sample size) healthy
      controls. The investigators will systematically vary task requirements (i.e. object size or
      weight, location in workspace, etc.), and record use of 1 versus 2 hands using videotaping as
      well as recording of quality of arm movement (kinematics) and muscle activity (EMG) in both
      arms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        subjects post-stroke

          -  passive flexibility (i.e. passive range of motion) in both arms such that the elbows
             can be straightened within 15 degrees of normal and shoulders be flexed (lifted up) at
             least 90 degrees and the hand needs to be able to open at least 75% of the way

          -  Actively (of each subject's own accord/ability) they must be able to, without assist
             in sitting and standing: straighten each elbow within 15 degrees of full range of
             motion, lift each arm up at at least 60 degrees from at the side, open each hand from
             a gross grasp volitionally.

          -  able to lift a glass jar using 1 or 2 hands in sitting and standing 10&quot; above the
             table top.

          -  able to come to CSU for two x 3 hour visits with or without assistance of their
             caregiver/significant other

          -  No arm/hand injury within the last 3 months. * Individuals with common visual deficits
             post-stroke (1 side partial visual field cut aka homonymous hemianopsia) will be
             included.

        Healthy controls:

        -age matched (double sample size); no known injury to arms within last 3 months, able to
        carry out experimental task, no neurologic diagnoses/perceptual or sensory deficits
        affecting arm movement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have any additional/other neurologic condition (i.e. Parkinsons
             Disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury)

          -  severe perceptual neglect (tested using clock drawing test ).

          -  Any individual who cannot answer phone screen questions competently and/or follow
             simple 2 step commands during the in-person screen
