  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complications that could occur during or after the extraction of the mandibular third
      molar teeth with pericoronitis affect patient's life quality considerably. Various scales are
      used to reveal how much the life quality of patients is affected this treatment. The aim of
      this study is to identify the long term life quality of patients through the OHIP-14 TR scale
      without removing the mandibular third molar teeth with mild pericoronitis.

      Increasing the lenght stay in the mouth at a maximum rate and following the patient up after
      the necessary treatment and information procedures are completed. As a result of clinical and
      radiographical examinations fifty-five voluntary patients whose average age was 24 and who
      have semi or fully errupted vertical mandibular third molar teeth with the diagnosis of mild
      pericoronitis were included in the study.After the patients in the study filled out the form
      including their contact and demographic data and dental symptomsand completed OHIP-14 TR
      scale which last about 5 minutes, their curretage and operculectomy treatments were done
      under local anesthesia. The patients were invited for reexamination on seventh day after the
      treatment. Also, an active patient follow up about life quality was performed by phone at
      1,3,6 month after the treatment using the self -assessment question form and the OHIP-14 TR
      scale.
