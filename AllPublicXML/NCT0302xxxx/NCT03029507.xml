      The proposed study is a cohort-randomized controlled trial of Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy-enhanced ShipShape (ACT+SS) compared to the standard ShipShape-only program, for
      overweight or obese Navy personnel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a cohort-randomized controlled trial of ACT-enhanced SS (ACT+SS)
      compared to the standard SS-only program. Cohorts of Navy personnel (N = 280 across 28
      cohorts) who are referred to the SS program due to failing or being at risk of failing the
      body composition assessment (BCA) or who are overweight/obese will be randomized to receive 8
      weekly ACT+SS intervention groups or 8 weekly standard SS-only intervention groups. The
      scientific aims are to: 1) determine the effectiveness of ACT+SS compared to the standard
      SS-only program; 2) examine psychological flexibility as a mechanism underlying intervention
      response; and 3) explore potential moderators of intervention response. The primary outcome
      is the percent weight loss. Secondary outcomes include BMI, body fat %, indices of physical
      activity, problem eating, functioning and quality of life, emotional functioning and indices
      of psychological flexibility, measured at baseline, mid- and post-intervention, and 3- and
      6-month follow-up and self-reported BCA status at 6-month follow-up. The investigators have
      purposefully designed a cohort-randomized trial with interventions that are pragmatically
      implemented in a real-life military setting, and outcomes that are immediately relevant to
      service members and leadership. The cohort randomization is essential to the feasibility and
      acceptability of the research in this setting. The military-relevant and generalizable
      findings are more likely to have impact within the military. SS provides an ideal comparison
      arm that is the current standard of practice in the Navy. Integrating ACT with SS in this
      setting overcomes many of the logistical, practical, chain-of-command, and other challenges
      that have typically impeded research in the military. The investigators have thoughtfully
      selected primary and secondary outcomes that are theoretically linked, and additional
      assessments that are empirically-based and will allow better understanding of mediators and
      moderators of intervention response in Navy personnel.

These include: a) education for nutrition and physical activity; b) creating and documenting goals for weight loss and physical fitness; c) a food diary to track eating habits throughout the program; d) developing behavioral strategies to initiate/maintain an exercise program; e) monitoring of physical activity (pedometer provided by the study); and f) identifying and overcoming personal triggers for over-eating.</description>
