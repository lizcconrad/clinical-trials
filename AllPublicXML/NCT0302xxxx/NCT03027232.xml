      The protocol is to draw peripheral blood from healthy volunteers for in vitro studies. The
      aims of these in vitro studies are to determine the cellular and intracellular mechanisms by
      which hypertonic saline and ATP release regulate neutrophil and lymphocyte functions.

      The proper regulation of leukocyte function is critical for immune defense and to prevent
      autoimmune diseases. Many aspects of immune cell regulation are unknown. A better
      understanding could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to improve immune function in
      patients suffering from various diseases.

      The investigators have found that hypertonic conditions regulate leukocyte functions through
      feedback mechanisms involving ATP release and purinergic receptors. The purpose of the
      proposed protocol is to obtain access to peripheral blood from healthy volunteers to study
      these complex regulatory mechanisms in more detail.

    <measure>Immune cells will be studied in vitro to learn about basic mechanisms of immune cell signaling.</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood is collected as needed; time frame: indefinitely. Blood used between 1-7 days after blood draws.</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this study is to obtain blood from healthy subjects (volunteers) for in vitro studies to explore how immune cells function. Cells will be isolated and subjected to various tests including stimuli that simulate immune cell activation in health and disease. Subjects will not be subjected to any treatments. Only some of the cells (leukocytes) in the blood will be studied. For example, activation events such as cytokine production, the ability of leukocytes (=immune cells) to detect and respond to bacterial products will be assessed. No identifiable information about study subjects will be kept.</description>

      Blood is collected from all subjects in the same fashion. Purpose: isolation of immune cells
      for in vitro studies of cell function.

      This is an observational study in human beings in predefined groups of individuals who are
      healthy and volunteer to donate blood for laboratory science studies. Subjects in the study
      receive neither diagnostic, therapeutic, nor other interventions, and the investigator does
      not assign specific interventions to any of the subjects of the study.
