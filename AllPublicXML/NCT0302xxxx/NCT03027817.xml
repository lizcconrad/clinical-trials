  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positioning a patient in prone position under anaesthesia significantly alters cardiovascular
      physiology. Cervical myelopathy patients are known to have autonomic dysfunction. Such
      patients when positioned in prone position under anaesthesia carry a higher risk of
      developing hemodynamic changes and this can compromise spinal cord perfusion.

      This prospective observational study was conducted on 30 patients with cervical myelopathy
      who underwent surgery in prone position at NIMHANS, Bangalore hospital. The non invasive
      cardiac output monitor (NICOM, Cheetah Medicals) was used to record various hemodynamic
      parameters. The hemodynamic parameters were recorded at baseline, post induction, post
      intubation, prior to prone position, post prone position, and every five minutes thereafter
      upto 20mins.

      The hemodynamic parameters that were recorded using the NICOM monitor:

        -  HR - Heart rate (beats /min)

        -  NIBP - non invasive blood pressure (mmHg)

        -  MAP - mean arterial pressure(mmHg)

        -  CO - cardiac output (l/min)

        -  CI - cardiac index (l/min/m2)

        -  SV - Stroke volume (ml/beat)

        -  SVV -stroke volume variability (%)

        -  TPR - total peripheral resistance (dynes. sec/cm5)
