      To compare the morphologic and functional outcomes of internal limiting membrane
      peeling-reposition versus peeling in idiopathic macular holes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will be performed at a single center. Eligible patients with
      idiopathic macular holes will be equally randomized to internal limiting membrane (ILM)
      peeling-reposition group or ILM peeling group through computer-aided random allocation.

      A standard 3-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed by a single surgeon using the
      Constellation 23 gauge vitrectomy system (Alcon Laboratories Inc, Fort Worth, Texas,
      USA).After posterior vitreous detachment was achieved, peeling of the ILM was performed by an
      end gripping forceps with the assistance of Brilliant Blue G. In ILM peeling-reposition
      group, the peeled ILM flap is flatten back to peeled area with assistance of
      perfluoro-n-octane. In ILM peeling group, a round shape with 2.5 to 3.5 disc diameter of ILM
      is peeled. This is followed by a complete fluid-gas exchange. Patients are instructed to
      posture sitting position for 4 hours then maintain facedown position for 7 days
      postoperatively in ILM peeling-reposition group. Patients are encouraged to maintain a
      face-down position for 7 days postoperatively in ILM peeling group.

      Postoperative measurements of BCVA and spectral domain optical coherence tomography(SD-OCT)
      are conducted at 1,3 and 6-month follow-up visits by independent masked observers. Macular
      light sensitivity and fixation stability are determined with microperimetry at 1,3, and 6
      months of follow-up. Mf-ERG, M-score chart and VFQ-25 chart are performed 1,3, and 6 months
      of follow-up.

      Comparison of BCVA, anatomical closure were primarily performed between the two groups. Then,
      the morphologic changes of inner retina and the functional parameters measured from
      microperimetry, Mf-ERG, M-score chart, VFQ-25 chart were analyzed.

    <description>After dying with Brilliant Blue G (BBG, Brilliant Blue; Gender, Germany), a horizontal ILM strip is peeled off in inferior quadrant of macular area. Then the ILM was peeled from inferior to superior area continuously. The&quot; ILM roll &quot; was unfolded with assistance of perfluoro-n-octane (PFO). Finally, the position of the fixed ILM flap is adjusted under PFO bubble using flute needle or forceps.This was followed by a complete fluid-gas exchange using 14% perfluoropropane gasPatients are introduced to posture sitting position for 4 hours then maintain facedown position for 7 days postoperatively.</description>

    <description>After dying with Brilliant Blue G (Brilliant Blue; Gender, Germany), a horizontal ILM strip is peeled off in inferior quadrant of macular area. Then, the strand of ILM was peeled off radially from the foveal center to vascular arcade. In result, a round -shaped with 2.5-3.5 disc diameter ILM -peeled area was created.This was followed by a complete fluid-gas exchange using 14% perfluoropropane gas. Patients are encourage to maintain facedown position for 7 days postoperatively.</description>
