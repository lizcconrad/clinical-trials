    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of SuperFIT, an integrative lifestyle intervention
      for preschool children. It will consist of both an preschool component and a family component
      and is aimed at increasing healthy nutrition and physical activity. Half of the participating
      preschools will implement SuperFIT, while the other half of the preschools will continue as
      usual.
