    <textblock>
      Cognitive remediation (CR) is the best treatment to improve neurocognitive abilities for
      individuals with psychosis, however, there is no gold standard method of cognitive
      remediation available. Cognitive training refers to the training component of CR in which
      people practice computerized exercises that train specific cognitive abilities. There is no
      agreed upon approach within the field as to the type of training that is most effective with
      some studies, training higher level cognitive abilities, some training perceptual abilities,
      and others training general cognitive skills. This study will directly compare two competing
      methods of cognitive training on measures of neurophysiology, neurocognition, functional
      competence, and real-world functional performance.

    <description>Executive Training (ET) involves training on computerized cognitive exercises that have graded increases in difficulty so that the participant is always challenged. A therapist will be in the room with participants to address any difficulties with the program and facilitate generation of strategies. ET will be delivered in both individual and group settings.</description>
