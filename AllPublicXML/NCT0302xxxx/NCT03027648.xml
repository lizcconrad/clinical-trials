      Objective: To investigate the effects of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
      (LNG-IUS) for symptomatic adenomyosis.

      Methods: From December, 2006 to December, 2014, symptomatic patients of adenomyosis diagnosed
      (with dysmenorrhea and/or menorrhea) by transvaginal ultrasound in outpatient or inpatient
      clinics of Peking Union Medical College Hospital were given the treatment of LNG-IUS. Before
      and after placement of LNG-IUS, during each following period, all the parameters were
      recorded prospectively, including carrying status of IUS, symptoms and scores of
      dysmenorrhea, menstruation scores, biochemical indicators, physical parameters, menstruation
      patterns and adverse effects.

      Primary outcome measures: symptoms and scores of dysmenorrhea and menorrhea

      Second outcome measures: carrying status of IUS
