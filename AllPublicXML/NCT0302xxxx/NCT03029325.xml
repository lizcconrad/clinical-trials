  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators use a genome-wide approach within a case-control design to identify SNPs that
      show evidence of association with lung cancer risk and survival.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators also investigate how genetic variants may affect cancer treatment, at various
      stages of disease development, in order to determine prognostic and predictive factors for
      survival.

        Lung cancer cases and healthy controls are recruited from Massachusetts General Hospital
        patient population. Cases come from Thoracic Surgery or Cancer Center. Controls are usually
        spouses or friends of cases, or in some cases unrelated to a specific case.
