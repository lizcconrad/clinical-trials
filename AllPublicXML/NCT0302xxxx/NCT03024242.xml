      Bivalve vaginal speculum insertion is a basic final step of vaginal examination.
      Unfortunately, it can't be inserted in young girls, virgins, nulliparous women with narrow
      vagina, women with vaginismus or patients with a history of previous vaginal surgery. In such
      cases, the value of vaginoscopy (examination of the vagina without speculum) is evident.
      Indications of vaginoscopy are expanding. In addition to confirmation of suspected vaginal
      masses or polypi diagnosis, it can be used to diagnose laceration of the vaginal wall in
      girls due to foreign body , traumatic injuries or sexual abuse. In a systematic review, the
      effectiveness and feasibility of using hysteroscopy for exploration of the immature genital
      tract (vaginoscopy) were documented.It may help in the diagnosis and treatment of gynecologic
      disorders in adolescent patients with an intact hymen, limited vaginal access, or a narrow
      vagina. Another recent systematic review highlighted the importance of Vagino-hysteroscopy as
      an easy way to gain access to the cervical canal and an important tool with which to diagnose
      and treat vaginal lesions.

      In practice, we notice leakage of excessive irrigating fluid per vagina with poor
      visualization during vaginoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, no study addressed a solution
      to improve visualization and success of vaginoscopic surgery. This study aims to test
      feasibility and doctor satisfaction of performing conventional diagnostic vaginoscopy if
      compared to tight diagnostic vaginoscopy and success on performing tight vaginoscopic surgery
      in patients with vaginal or cervical lesions.
