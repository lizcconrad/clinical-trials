  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, prospective clinical trial, the investigators enrolled acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) patients after consolidation therapy. Patients with minimal residual disease
      (MRD) receive decitabine treatment if patients do not receive stem cell transplantation. The
      MRD clearance rate is the primary outcome to measure the efficacy of decitabine regimen.

      In this open-label, prospective clinical trial, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients after
      consolidation therapy are enrolled. Patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) after
      consolidation therapy receive decitabine treatment if patients do not receive stem cell
      transplantation. The treatment regimen includes three course of decitabine regimen at a dose
      of 20mg/m² on day1-5. The MRD clearance rate is the primary outcome to measure the efficacy
      of decitabine regimen.
