      Comparison of effectiveness of placental blood drainage after spontaneous vaginal delivery in
      decreasing the duration, blood loss,and complications of the third stage, against no drainage
      of placental blood.

      The patients will prospectively randomized equally into two groups (100 each in the study and
      control groups).

      Group-A (Study group)—Placental blood was drained.

      Group-B (Control group)—Placental blood was not drained.

      In all the patients detailed medical and obstetric history will taken. In each patient, the
      pre-delivery pulse rate, blood pressure, and Hb gm% will noted. Immediately after vaginal
      delivery, after clamping and cutting the cord—the cord will unclamped and the blood will
      drained until the flow ceased. In the control group, the clamped cord will not released.
      Blood lost in the third stage of labour will measured by collecting the blood measuring bag.
