  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of nivolumab in patients with oral
      cavity cancer (OCC) who are about to undergo surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OCC patients who are scheduled for surgery will be given Nivolumab prior to surgery to see if
      there are any changes in surgical outcomes.

    <measure>Objective response rate using pathological response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate: the sum of patients with either a pCR defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals present in the surgical specimen or partial pathologic response defined at least a 30% reduction in the size of the lesion in the surgical specimen. The reduction in size will be determined by comparing the pretreatment clinical measurements (the sum of the greatest axial measurement obtained with calipers at the time of initial evaluation) with the final pathologic measurements.</description>

    <description>3. Intratumoral immune activity assessed by levels of immune stimulatory cytokines including IL-2, IFN γ, and IL-12 or inhibitory cytokine, IL10 and TGF-beta, in OCSCC tumor lysates will be measured flow cytometrically by cytokine bead array.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed histologically proven locoregional OCSCC (T stage 2-4) without
             evidence of distant metastases. OCSCC includes the subsites of oral tongue, floor of
             mouth, gingiva, retromolar trigone, and buccal mucosa OR

        Recurrent or persistent histologically proven locoregional OCSCC (recurrent T-stage 2-4)
        that was initially treated with surgery alone. To allow sufficient tumor tissue for the
        immunological analyses, patients with T1 OCSCC will be excluded. Eligibility criteria will
        also include the following:

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        WOCBP must use appropriate method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method
        to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo
        five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.

        sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to registration Women
        who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and
        azoospermic men are not required to use contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior immunotherapy or treatment with another anti PD 1 agent.

          -  Concomitant malignancies except cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell
             carcinoma

          -  Unresectable primary tumor or regional disease or distant metastases.

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Note: Subjects are permitted to enroll
             if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger

          -  Presence of condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10
             mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days
             of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease.
