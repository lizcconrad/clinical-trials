  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to test 2 types of dosing schedules of
      tremelimumab and durvalumab to learn if one is more effective in patients with high-grade,
      platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The safety of
      the dosing schedules will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Neither durvalumab nor tremelimumab are FDA approved or
      commercially available for the types of cancer in this study. They are currently being used
      for research purposes only in these diseases. The study doctor can explain how the study
      drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 115 participants will have screening tests to learn if they are eligible to take part
      in this study. Up to 100 participants that are found eligible will be enrolled in this study.
      All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups (the Combination group or the Sequential
      group). This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse
      than the other group.

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks.

      Combination Group:

      If you are assigned to the Combination Group, you will receive 4 cycles of tremelimumab and
      durvalumab together, followed by 9 cycles of durvalumab alone.

      If your disease gets worse at any point you will begin a standard of care treatment chosen by
      the study doctor or you will be given the option to enroll on another study. If you receive a
      standard of care treatment, the study doctor will discuss the risks and procedures with you
      in detail. If you choose to enroll on another study, a separate consent form will be provided
      and you will be taken off this study.

      Sequential Group:

      If you are assigned to the Sequential Group, you will receive 4 cycles of tremelimumab alone,
      and then if the disease gets worse, you will receive 9 cycles of durvalumab alone. The study
      doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each time you receive tremelimumab or durvalumab, it will be given by vein over about 60
      minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 13 cycles.

      If you are in the combination group, you may receive the standard of care treatment after the
      study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest or until the disease
      get worse.

      If you are in the sequential group and you complete the full 13 cycles of the study drugs
      without the disease getting worse, you will have follow up visits until the disease gets
      worse or until you begin receiving treatment on another study.

      You will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable to follow
      study directions, or if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      Study Visits:

      Combination Group:

      All visits will occur on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-13:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system testing, and
           to check the functioning of your thyroid. If you are able to become pregnant, the
           routine blood tests will include a pregnancy test during Cycle 1.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you did at screening. You will alternate among
           completing 7, 5, and 2 of the questionnaires each cycle.

      During Cycle 1 only:

      °You will return to the clinic for blood draws (1 tablespoon each time) for biomarker and
      immune system testing on Days 8, 15, and 22.

      During Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 only, about 3 weeks after you receive the study drugs,
      you will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      During Cycle 3 only, you will have a core tumor biopsy for biomarker and immune system
      testing.

      You may be asked to have 1 or 2 interviews at a point between Cycles 2 and 4 and/or Cycles 6
      and 8. You may decline to take part in one or both of these interviews.

      If the disease gets worse at any point you will begin a standard of care treatment chosen by
      the study doctor or you will be given the option to enroll on another study.

      If the disease does not get worse after the 13 cycles of treatment with the study drugs, you
      will enter a waiting period. If the disease gets worse during the waiting period, you will
      then begin a standard of care treatment chosen by the study doctor or you will be given the
      option to enroll on another study.

      During the waiting period, the following tests and procedures will be performed after 30 days
      and then at every 2 months until you begin the standard of care treatment chosen by your
      doctor or you leave the study:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning
           of your thyroid.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the 7 questionnaires from screening.

      If you receiving the standard of care treatment, you will follow the same study visit
      schedule that you did while receiving tremelimumab and durvalumab, except you will not have
      the blood draws and biopsy for biomarker and immune system testing.

      Sequential Group:

      All visits will occur on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system testing, and
           to check the functioning of your thyroid. If you are able to become pregnant, the
           routine blood tests will include a pregnancy test during Cycle 1.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you did at screening. You will alternate among
           completing 7, 5, and 2 of the questionnaires each cycle.

      During Cycle 1 only:

      °You will return to the clinic for blood draws (1 tablespoon each time) for biomarker and
      immune system testing on Days 8, 15, and 22.

      During Cycles 2 and 4 only, about 3 weeks after you receive the study drugs, you will have an
      MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      You may be asked to have an interview between Cycles 2 and 4. You may decline to take part in
      this interview.

      During Cycle 3 only, you will have a core tumor biopsy for biomarker and immune system
      testing.

      After Cycle 4 or if the disease gets worse, whichever occurs first, you will wait at least 8
      weeks to allow the tremelimumab to clear your system and then you will receive up to 9 cycles
      of durvalumab only (Cycles 5-13).

      About 1 month into the 8-week waiting period, you will have a study visit. The following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning
           of your thyroid.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the 7 questionnaires from screening.

      You will begin receiving durvalumab on Day 1 of Cycle 5.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 5-13:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning
           of your thyroid.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you did at screening. You will alternate
           between completing all 7 of the questionnaires and only 4 of the questionnaires each
           cycle.

      During Cycle 5 only, you will have an EKG to check your heart function.

      During Cycles 5 and 6 only, an additional blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for
      immune system testing.

      You may be asked to have an interview between Cycles 6 and 8. You may decline to take part in
      this interview.

      During Cycles 6, 8, 10, and 12 only, about 2 weeks after you receive the study drugs, you
      will have an MRI or a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      End of Study Visit:

      After you have received your last dose of the study drugs or the standard of care treatment
      chosen by the study doctor, you will have an end of study visit. The following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the functioning
           of your thyroid. If you can become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the 7 questionnaires from screening.
