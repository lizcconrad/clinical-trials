    <description>Evaluate the clinical outcome at least one year after surgery by examining the patient and asking targeted questions on the symptoms regarding the former hiatal hernia (using visual analogue scale questions on dysphagia, meteorism, bloating, reflux and retrosternal pain). Furthermore the patients are asked about their general satisfaction regarding the performed surgical intervention.</description>
