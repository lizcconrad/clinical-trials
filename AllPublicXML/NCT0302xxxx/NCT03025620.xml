  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory potential
      of an adequate intake of alpha-linolenic acid in elderly.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that diets high in long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFA) decrease the risk of fatal ischemic heart disease.Both epidemiologic studies and
      clinical trials demonstrate substantial cardioprotective effects of alpha linolenic acid
      (ALA) from vegetable oils.However, little is known about the relation of the dietary intake
      of ALA with ischemic heart disease among older adults.In this study, elderly volunteers will
      be asked to ingest a supplement of a vegetable oil providing 1g of ALA, or an equivalent
      amount of linoleic acid as sunflower oil, for a diet period of 6 weeks.Serum samples will be
      collected before the dietary intervention and 6 weeks later.Plasma biomarkers of
      inflammatory, lipid cardiovascular risk factors and serum and red cell membrane fatty acid
      composition will be determined on all samples.
