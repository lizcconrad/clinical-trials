      This is a retrospective chart review. The purpose is to look at the outcomes for women and
      newborns who decided to attempt a trial of labor after 3 or more previous cesarean sections.

      In 2006, the vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rate was 8.5%, compared to a rate of 28.3%
      in 1996. This was also associated with a rise in the rate of cesarean section from
      approximately 20% to 31.1% over that same period of time. In that 10 year period, some
      hospitals stopped offering a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) altogether.

      Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states in Practice
      Bulletin 115 (2010), Vaginal Birth After Previous Cesarean Delivery, &quot;it is reasonable to
      consider women with 2 previous low transverse cesarean deliveries to be candidates for
      TOLACâ€¦Data regarding the risk for women undergoing TOLAC with more than two previous cesarean
      deliveries is limited.&quot;

      In 1994, a study reviewing10 years of data regarding trial of labor after cesarean. Of their
      population with 3 or more previous cesarean deliveries, 30% of patients underwent a trial of
      labor, with a 79% success rate. In this group, the uterine rupture rate was 1.2% with zero
      perinatal deaths related to rupture, which is compared to a rupture rate of 1.8% and 1
      perinatal death in the group of 2 previous cesarean deliveries.

      In 2002, another study described the outcomes of women who underwent a trial of labor after 2
      or more previous cesarean deliveries at two large university hospitals in the Netherlands,
      but it included just 59 patients total and only 4 of these had 3 previous cesarean
      deliveries. No patients with more than 3 previous cesarean deliveries had a trial of labor.

      A study in 2010, described a large cohort of women from the northeastern United States with 3
      or more previous cesarean deliveries, including those attempting VBAC. This cohort included
      89 women, of whom 79.8% had a successful VBAC. However, of the women who had a TOLAC, 40.4%
      delivered in a university hospital and only 18.0% in a hospital with an OB/GYN residency,
      compared to 56.9% and 25.4% of women who had an elective repeat cesarean section. In the
      group that had a TOLAC, there were no cases of uterine rupture.

      There still remains a lack of data about the outcomes of the delivery of women who desire a
      trial of labor after 3 or more previous cesarean deliveries at a single institution.

      The investigators will analyze and compare the management and outcomes of women and neonates
      for patients who attempted a trial of labor after 3 or more previous cesareans. We will also
      compare them to women and neonates of patients who underwent a repeat cesarean section
      without a trial of labor.
