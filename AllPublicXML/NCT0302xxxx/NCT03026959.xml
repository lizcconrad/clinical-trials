  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is preliminary empirical support for the use of mindfulness interventions during the
      perinatal period; suggesting that mindfulness training may be an effective treatment approach
      for reducing depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and reducing anxiety, stress,
      and psychological distress during the postpartum period. To extend on these findings, the
      purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief mindfulness-based
      program in protecting maternal mental health and well-being using a randomized controlled
      trial.

    <textblock>
      Based on the results reported in the existing literature that show that formal
      mindfulness-based practice is effective for improving mental health status and preventing
      depressive symptom relapse, this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief
      mindfulness-based program, offered during pregnancy, in reducing mothers' psychological
      symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period. A brief program has the advantage being
      more economical to facilitate compared to full-length programs and also requires a shorter
      commitment from pregnant women, who are also attempting to manage multiple other new and
      existing demands (e.g., obstetrics appointments, work).

      As emerging research suggests that women are particularly vulnerable to increased depressive,
      anxious, obsessive, compulsive, and hypomanic symptoms during the perinatal period these are
      the main psychological symptoms that will be assessed. As well, perceived stress and
      psychological resiliency will also be assessed for in order to examine changes in these
      domains in relation to mindfulness engagement. Furthermore, as a reduction in maternal
      psychological symptoms has been reported to have implications for mother-infant bond, the
      mother's interpersonal functioning, and maternal quality of life, the investigators will also
      assess to see if there are corresponding changes in these domains related to mindfulness
      engagement.

    <description>Participants assigned to the mindfulness group will attend four weekly sessions that are each 1.5 hours in length. The sessions will follow the structure described by Short, Mazmanian, Ozen, &amp; Bédard (2015). The structure is designed to first enhance learners' foundation skills in mindfulness and progresses into teaching learners more advanced mindfulness skills.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the social group will also attend four weekly sessions that are each 1.5 hours in length. Each session will have participants focus on a creative tasks while permitting task related discussion. In this way the format is designed to parallel the mindfulness group, where participants engage in a new activity each week and have an opportunity to discuss the activities with the group without engaging in any formal intervention.</description>
