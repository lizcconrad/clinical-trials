  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From April ,2014 to April 2015,31 patients with fractures of the proximal humerus were
      treated in our hospital. According to anatomic neck fractures (ANF) and surgical neck
      fractures (SNF), we divided the patients into two groups. All the patients were followed at
      least 1 year.
