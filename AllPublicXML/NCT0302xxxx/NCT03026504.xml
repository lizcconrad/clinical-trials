  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of baricitinib in the treatment of
      giant cell arteritis. All participants will be taking prednisone at the start of the study.
      The prednisone will be reduced according to a standardized tapering schedule while
      participants continue to take one tablet of baricitinib daily for 52 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baricitinib, an orally administered, potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and
      JAK2 has shown preliminary safety and efficacy in chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory
      conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This small molecule is uniquely suited
      as a potential novel therapeutic agent in GCA because of its suppressive effect on both the
      Th17 (IL-6, IL-23) andTh1 (IL-12, IFN-γ) pathways.

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of baricitinib in a population of
      patients with relapsing GCA. The study is an open-label pilot study assessing the safety and
      tolerability of baricitinib (4 mg daily, oral, for 52 weeks) in addition to a standardized
      glucocorticoid taper. It is anticipated that adjunct baricitinib will be safe and well
      tolerated by patients with GCA and demonstrate preliminary efficacy as measured by reducing
      inflammatory markers, decreasing steroid requirements and increasing relapse-free survival.

             clinically significant malignancy for &lt; 5 years.

               1. Subjects with uterine cervical carcinoma in situ that has been resected with no
                  evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease for at least 3 years may participate
                  in the study

               2. Subjects with basal cell or squamous epithelial skin cancers which have been
                  completely resected with no evidence of recurrence for at least 3 years may
                  participate in the study.

         13. Active infections, or history of recurrent infections or have required management of
             acute or chronic infections as evidenced by any of the following:

               1. Currently on any suppressive therapy for a chronic infection (such as
                  tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, or atypical
                  mycobacteria).

               2. History or suspicion of chronic infection (e.g. prosthetic joint infection)

               3. Hospitalization for treatment of infection within 60 days of baseline visit

               4. Use of parenteral (IV or IM) antimicrobials (antibacterial, antifungals,
                  antivirals, or antiparasitic agents) within 60 days of baseline or oral
                  antimicrobials within 30 days of baseline visit for treatment of an active
                  infection. This does not include the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis against
                  pneumocystis pneumonia since this is considered standard of care for patients on
                  prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day for longer than 3 consecutive months.

         14. Have had symptomatic herpes zoster infection within 12 weeks prior to screening.

         15. Have a history of disseminated/complicated herpes zoster [for example, multidermatomal
             involvement, ophthalmic zoster or Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement]

         16. In the opinion of the investigator, are at an unacceptable risk for participating in
             the study.

         17. Have known or documented diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         18. Have known or documented primary immunodeficiency.

         19. Have had household contact with a person with active tuberculosis (TB) and did not
             receive appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB.

         20. Have had evidence of active TB or have previously had evidence of active TB and did
             not receive appropriate and documented treatment.

         21. Have evidence of latent TB as documented by a local lab positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold
             test and a normal chest x-ray, unless a patient completes at least 4 weeks of
             appropriate treatment prior to study entry and agrees to complete the remainder of
             treatment while in the trial.

               1. If the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test results are positive, the patient will be
                  considered to have latent TB and will be excluded. If the test is indeterminate,
                  the test may be repeated once within 2 weeks of the initial value. If the repeat
                  test results are again not negative, the subject will be considered to have
                  latent TB (for purposes of this study) and will be excluded.

               2. Exceptions include subjects with a history of active or latent TB who have
                  documented evidence of appropriate treatment and with no history of re-exposure
                  since their treatment was completed. (Such subjects would not be required to
                  undergo the protocol specific TB testing, but would require a baseline chest
                  x-ray).

         22. Have a positive test for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) defined as:

               1. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or

               2. Positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) If any of the Hepatitis B
                  tests have an indeterminate result, confirmatory testing will be performed by an
                  alternate method.

         23. Have Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody with confirmed
             presence of HCV).

         24. Have any of the following specific abnormalities on screening tests:

               1. ALT or AST &gt; 2 x ULN

               2. Total bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN

               8. eGFR &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m²

             In the case of any of the aforementioned laboratory abnormalities, the tests may be
             repeated once within approximately 2 weeks from the initial values, and values
             resulting from repeat testing may be accepted for enrollment eligibility if they meet
             the eligibility criterion.

         25. Are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of screening or enrollment.

         26. Are females of childbearing potential who do not agree to use 2 forms of highly
             effective birth control when engaging in sexual intercourse with a male partner while
