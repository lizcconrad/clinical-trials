  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open label single blinded multi-centre observational study involving a
      study group of patients already undergoing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
      (ICD)(including Cardiac resynchronisation therapy device (CRT-D)) implant. A standard
      30-minute electrophysiological (EP) cardiac stimulation protocol will be performed at the end
      of the ICD implant at baseline. This EP test will be performed whilst measuring a 12-lead ECG
      and will be correlated with event rates to establish their effectiveness in predicting
      arrhythmia risk. The minimum follow up period should be 18 months and maximum of 3 years,
      which is how long the study is funded for. This study is not randomised as all study patients
      will be receiving the EP study performed at baseline. A minimum of 440 patients will be
      recruited to document event data at standard clinical ICD follow up intervals - equating to a
      maximum of 6 visits. Blinding will be maintained at the core lab were the ECG analysis will
      be performed by a nominated researcher who will not have details of patient health status.

    <measure>Regional Restitution Instability Index (R2I2), the mean of the standard deviation of the residuals from the mean gradients for each ECG lead across a range of diastolic intervals, will be determined from an EP study carried out at ICD implant.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 - 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>For each lead of the surface ECG, the QTpeak will be plotted as a function of TpeakQ, and gradients were fitted by using 40ms overlapping least squares linear segments as described previously by Taggart et al. [9]. For each lead, in each 40 ms segment, the difference of the gradient from the mean gradient in that 40 ms segment will be calculated. The mean of the standard deviation of these values will be taken as the R2I2.
An R2I2 cut-off of 1.03 (no units) will partition the study population into high and low risk groups.</description>
