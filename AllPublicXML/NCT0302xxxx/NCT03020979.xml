  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant ascites is a severe complication of many types of human cancer. Animal and clinical
      analyses have shown that angiogenesis plays a critical role in the formation of malignant
      ascites. Therefore, drugs such as apatinib that target angiogenesis may control the
      development of malignant ascites. The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      apatinib in patients with refractory malignant ascites.

      The study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with refractory
      malignant ascites. A total of 120 patients with performance status 0-2 were enrolled in this
      study and 500mg apatinib tablets were administered orally, once daily until disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity or patients withdrawal of consent.
