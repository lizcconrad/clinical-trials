      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  If there are any differences in the way LY3202626 is handled by the body when taken in
           two different forms

        -  Whether a high fat meal affects the way the body handles LY3202626

        -  How well tolerated LY3202626 is

      There are three (3) study periods for all participants. Participants will be admitted to the
      clinical research unit (CRU) each period and will be discharged from the CRU following the
      completion of 2 overnight stays and up to 36 hours after dosing with LY3202626.

      The study will last about 50 days, not including screening.
