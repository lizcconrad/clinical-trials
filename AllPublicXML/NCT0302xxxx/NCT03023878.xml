    <textblock>
      The safety profile of blinatumomab after frontline R-chemotherapy, consisting of either
      R-CHOP (14 or 21) or R-DA-EPOCH or R-CHOEP, will be determined. The study will consist of a
      screening period of up to 14 days, a standard of care (SOC) R-chemotherapy run-in period of
      approximately 21 weeks, a 12 to 16 week blinatumomab treatment period, a 30-day safety
      follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period that begins after the safety follow-up
      visit is completed until 1 year from the first dose blinatumomab.
