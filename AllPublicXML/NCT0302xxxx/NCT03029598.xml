  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and carboplatin work in treating
      patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back or has
      not responded to previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      pembrolizumab and carboplatin may work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical response rate of platinum chemotherapy and pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in platinum chemotherapy pretreated ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary
      peritoneal.

      II. To examine whether retreatment with platinum chemotherapy in platinum resistant ovarian,
      fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers improves progression free survival by
      concurrent administration of MK-3475.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent administration of MK-3475 with
      platinum chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube,
      and primary peritoneal cancers.

      II. To determine the relationship between PD-L1 expression and response to the combination of
      MK-3475 and platinum.

      III. To assess the overall survival of patients treated with the combination of MK-3475 and
      platinum.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore changes in gene expression of pre and post treatment tumor samples.

      II. To explore whether treatment with MK-3475 and platinum alters soluble factors in sera,
      peripheral immune responses and immune cell profile.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes on days 8 and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
