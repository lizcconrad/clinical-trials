  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the orbital atherectomy system (OAS), a newer generation
      atherectomy device, reduces the incidence of microcirculatory compromise as compared to older
      generation rotational atherectomy (RA) due to differences in the mechanism of
      athero-ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of heavily calcified coronary lesions necessitates the use of ablative devices
      that aid in successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, atherectomy devices
      generate microparticles that embolize to the distal coronary microcirculation and may
      compromise myocardial tissue perfusion.

      Two mechanisms that deserve particular attention are the eccentric mounting of the OAS crown
      and the higher flow rates on the vasodilator flush. Firstly, as opposed to rotational
      atherectomy where the larger, centrally mounted burr may cause obstruction of flow during the
      atherectomy, the smaller eccentrically mounted crown in OAS allows continuous perfusion
      during both atherectomy as well as rest periods. Second, both during rest and atherectomy,
      the flow rates of vasodilatory flush is higher in OAS compared to RA. Combined, these
      differences in coronary and vasodilator flush flow could lead to improved perfusion of the
      distal circulation, particularly during the atherectomy runs when risk of embolization is
      highest.

      The loss of microcirculatory function can be transient, with partial or complete restoration
      of microcirculatory blood flow, or permanent. As shown in studies of patients with acute
      coronary syndromes, the loss of microcirculatory function is a critical and independent
      predictor of myocardial recovery and adverse outcomes. The putative protective effects of OAS
      on coronary microvasculature may therefore be of major clinical significance and impact.
