      Estimation of the concordance of Tc 99m localization in liver metastases from colorectal
      carcinoma using SPECT/CT imaging and abdominal FDG (PET)/CT imaging per subject.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-center, comparator study of IV injected Tc 99m
      Tilmanocept in the localization and detection of liver metastases in subjects with confirmed
      CRC. The study will be divided into two cohorts.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tc 99m tilmanocept
      administered intravenously. SPECT/CT imaging of the subject's abdominal cavity will be
      reviewed to establish concordance with FDG PET imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has provided written informed consent with Health Information Portability
             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization before the initiation of any
             study-related procedures.

          -  Subjects must be ≥18 years old;

          -  The subject must have a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon and/or rectum with
             FDG PET/CT confirmed metastases to the liver;

          -  The subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0-3;

          -  The subject must be at least 4 weeks past any major intraabdominal surgery, including
             surgery to the liver;

          -  Subjects with prior malignancies other than colon and/or rectum cancer are allowed,
             provided they have been treated with curative intent, and have no evidence of
             recurrence of that malignancy;

          -  Each subject must have no more than 10 qualifying liver lesions that have been
             clinically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon by FDG PET/CT imaging.

          -  If of childbearing potential, the subject has a negative urine pregnancy test within
             48 hours before administration of Tc 99m Tilmanocept, has been surgically sterilized,
             or has been postmenopausal for at least 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The subject has undergone any liver surgery, exclusive of a biopsy.

          -  The subject has known sensitivity to dextran.

          -  The subject has had preoperative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy
             within the 10 days prior to Tc 99m Tilmanocept administration

          -  Before the administration of Tc 99m Tilmanocept, has received any radiopharmaceutical
             within 7 radioactive half-lives of that radiopharmaceutical

          -  Has received an investigational product within the 30 days prior to Tc 99m Tilmanocept
             administration
