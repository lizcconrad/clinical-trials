    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is a significant postoperative problem and it could be persistent if
      proper management is not provided. However, each patient shows different intensity of pain
      and different sensitivity to analgesics even if they underwent same procedures. Therefore, it
      would be useful to find the way to predict the postoperative pain sensitivity.

      Propofol, a popular anesthetic agent, induces pain during injection, which can not completely
      prevented by opioid or lidocaine in some patients. This is considered to be related to
      patient's pain sensitivity and it might be associated with postoperative pain sensitivity.

      Therefore, the relation of propofol injection pain and postoperative pain intensity will be
      explored.
