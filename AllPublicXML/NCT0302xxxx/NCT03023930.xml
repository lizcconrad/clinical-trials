  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of (1) Implementation Facilitation (IF)
      on rates of provision of Emergency Department (ED)-initiated buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP)
      treatment with referral for ongoing medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and the (2)
      effectiveness of IF on patient engagement in formal addiction treatment at 30 days.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a Hybrid Type 3 Effectiveness-Implementation framework and a modified stepped
      wedge design. The study will be conducted at four EDs with a high prevalence of patients with
      untreated opioid use disorder (OUD). The four sites will receive the same sequence of
      evaluations and interventions: the baseline evaluation period after the standard
      dissemination practice, the IF phase, and continuation of facilitation into the IF evaluation
      period. The timing of initiation of the study activities at each site will be randomly offset
      by ~ 3 month increments to accommodate logistical constraints of simultaneous implementation
      at all sites. The study populations will include (1) ED providers and staff involved in the
      treatment of patients with OUD; (2) Community opioid treatment provider and program staff
      involved in providing care for patients with OUD referred from the ED; and (3) ED patients
      with moderate to severe OUD.
