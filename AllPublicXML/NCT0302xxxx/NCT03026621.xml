      OBJECTIVES:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not 'Restore' lignite extract mineral
      supplement impacts the microbiome composition of the mouth and gut. Additionally, participant
      urine samples will be examined to determine whether or not 'Restore' mineral supplement
      impacts the composition urine biomarkers and toxins.

      BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE There is mounting evidence that the composition of the microbiome can
      change quickly. Unpublished case reports have shown significant shifts in the microbiome when
      participant's diet changes from a high carbohydrate to a high fat diet. Clinically, the use
      of 'Restore' mineral supplement has led to the bulking of stool in people using it for the
      first time within one or two days of first dose, further indicating a change in the gut
      microbiome.

      Given these observations, this clinical trial was designed to examine how taking 'Restore'
      mineral supplement may impact the microbiome by examining the gut bacteria composition at two
      days, and again at two weeks. Our hypothesis is that taking Restore alone can lead to a
      quantifiable shift in the diversity of the microbiome as measured by the Simpson's Diversity
      Index, a mathematical measure of species diversity in a community. This index provides more
      information about community composition than simply species richness by also taking into
      account the relative abundances of different species.

      There is also evidence that Restore mineral supplement can impact urine composition.
      Specifically, we will be examining the change in the presence of zonulin, glyphosate,
      creatinine-albumin ratio, and stem cells.

    <description>The study design is a double-blind case-control trial, whereby half of the participants will be &quot;cases&quot; and will be asked to take 5mL 'Restore' mineral supplement three times each day. The other half of the participants will be &quot;controls&quot; and will be asked to take 5mL of a placebo three times each day. Both the study leader and the participants will be blinded to who receives Restore and who receive placebo.</description>
