Common carotid artery cut then performed a longitudinal arteriotomy on the front of the anterior surface of the internal carotid artery. Under the visual control performs a sequence of endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery. Plastic arteriotomy performed patche of ksenoperikardial (Kemperiplas-Neo) treated with epoxy compounds.</description>

    <description>Under local anesthesia Sol.Novocaini 0.25%, or endotracheal anesthesia using the standard access the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, isolated on identical distance external carotid artery. Carotid glomus separated and moves downward and backward bifurcation of the common carotid artery. External carotid artery is cut off at an angle of 45º from the mouth with a portion of the common carotid artery, then performed a longitudinal arteriotomy on the front of the medial surface of the internal carotid and posterior-lateral surface of the external carotid artery. Under the visual control performs a sequence of endarterectomy of the internal and external carotid arteries. The final recovery of the arteries is performed by crosslinking of their walls with each other in a side by side type between the internal and external carotid arteries 6/0 Polypropylene thread with two needles.</description>
