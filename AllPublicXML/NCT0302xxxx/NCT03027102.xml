  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the safety and toxicity of incremental doses of Double Negative
      T (DNT) cells in human subjects with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNT cells are
      mature T lymphocytes that comprise ~1% of white blood cells in humans. Injection of DNTs from
      healthy donors has been demonstrated to be effective against AML cells. DNT cells will be
      collected from healthy volunteers and injected into patients.
