    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine whether five days of ginger (Zingiber officinale)
      supplementation is effective at reducing muscle soreness and improving muscle function
      following downhill running. Long-distance running is often associated with acute muscle pain,
      swelling, and reduced muscle functioning, and consequently, many runners utilize
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal
      side-effects such as stomach discomfort, nausea, dyspepsia, asymptomatic ulcers, and
      symptomatic ulcers that, although rare, can be fatal. Ginger is a botanical compound that is
      Generally Recognized as Safe by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Evidence from
      osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and resistance-training models indicate that ginger is
      effective at reducing general pain and muscle soreness. Therefore, this study will supplement
      60 runners with roughly 1.5 g/day of ginger root or a placebo for 2 days prior to, the day
      of, and 2 days after downhill running. Participants will be evaluated for muscle soreness and
      function before and after the downhill run.

    <measure>Muscle Soreness Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days before a 40-minute downhill run, the day of a 40-minute downhill run, 24 hours after a 40-minute downhill run and the two days after a 40-minute downhill run</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to mark a slash on a 100 mm line the muscle soreness of their lower extremities, with descriptors of &quot;no soreness'' indicated at 0 and ''unbearably painful&quot; at 100. Participants will rate overall lower-extremity soreness at rest, while performing a stand-to-sit movement, and while running at a moderate pace.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days before a 40-minute downhill run, the day of a 40-minute downhill run, and two days after a 40-minute downhill run</time_frame>
    <description>An algometer will be applied to the participant's quadriceps muscle. An algometer is a handheld device with an integral load cell that transduces the pressure applied to the participant. The investigator will apply force slowly and smoothly while the participant concentrates on when the force applied by the investigator transitions from a feeling of pressure to a feeling of pain. The force level applied when the participant begins to feel pain will be considered the pain pressure threshold. The location of the measurement will be 10 cm above the superior crest of the patella. The average of two measurements will be taken.</description>

    <measure>Vertical Jump Test Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days before a 40-minute downhill run, the day of a 40-minute downhill run, and two days after a 40-minute downhill run</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will jump as high as possible using the squat jump technique. Participants will perform three trials.</description>

    <measure>1.5-mile Run Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days before a 40-minute downhill run and two days after a 40-minute downhill run</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a maximal effort 1.5-mile run on a motorized treadmill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung Function Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Two days before a 40-minute downhill run and two days after a 40-minute downhill run</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' lung function will be tested before the 1.5-mile run and at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes post-exercise. Lung function will be assessed with a spirometer by having participants perform a maximal forced expiration. Breathing difficulty will also be measured before and after the run with the Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale.</description>
