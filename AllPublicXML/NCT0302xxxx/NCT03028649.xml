  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of 12-week with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate
      (HMB) and a placebo (PLA) supplementation on body composition, anaerobic and aerobic
      capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained
      athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of HMB supplementation is of great interest in sport. In view of the inconclusive
      character of the results of the studies conducted to date and of a relatively low number of
      studies investigating the effectiveness of HMB supplementation over a longer period on a
      large population of trained athletes, the aim of this study was to verify the effect of
      12-week with HMB and a placebo supplementation on body composition, anaerobic and aerobic
      capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained
      athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.

    <description>Group taking oral supplementation with calcium salt of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyric acid produced by Olimp Laboratories. A single capsule contained 1250 mg Ca-HMB, which corresponds to 1000 mg of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate.
Interventions:
The experimental procedure for each athlete included a 12-week HMB supplementation - 3 capsules of the assigned preparation a day in 3 doses: upon waking, immediately after training, and before sleep. On non-training days, the participants were instructed to consume one serving with each of three separate meals throughout the day.
Between the 12-week HMB and PLA or a PLA and HMB treatment, a 10-day washout period was introduced.</description>
