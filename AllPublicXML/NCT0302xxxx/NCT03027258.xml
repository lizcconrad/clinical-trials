  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to adopt sustainable community networks (in this case churches) to
      implement an integrated community-based screening that incorporates mobile health technology
      (mHealth) to make prenatal test results available at the point-of-delivery to guide medical
      management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a
      mobile health platform that captures results for HIV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and sickle cell
      genotype obtained from participants during the Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) program;
      store data in a secure, web-based database; encrypt data on a &quot;smart card&quot; which is given to
      participants, and make these data available at the point-of-delivery using a cell-phone
      application to read the &quot;smart card&quot;. Data on the web-based database can also be accessed
      directly using the cell phone application. Evidence exists that when clinician have maternal
      records available at the point of delivery, they are more likely to initiate antiretroviral
      prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants, administer the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine with 24
      hours for infants born to women who have positive hepatitis B surface antigen and screen
      infants born to mothers with sickle cell trait to allow early identification and initiation
      of penicillin prophylaxis for infants who have sickle cell disease.

    <description>Effectiveness will be determined by assessing the impact of the mHealth platform on key outcomes such as screening for HIV, HBV, and sickle cell genotype, and health care utilizations for follow up visits. This will be measured by calculating the percentage of pregnant women that used the &quot;smart card&quot; at the point-of-delivery.</description>

    <description>HBI participants who consent will be enrolled in this study and will have data collected from their community screening stored in a secure, web-based database. The stored data will be encrypted into a Quick Response code embedded in a &quot;smart card.&quot; A unique identification number and participant's blood group type will be on the outside of the card. There will be no names or any other identifiers. Each participating center will identify a dedicated delivery room staff that will be trained to read the contents of the card using the cell phone application as well as enter new data in the participant's profile. When a participant presents at delivery without the card, information can still be obtained from the secure, web-based database and confirmed using the participant's name, date of birth and cell phone number. This information is provided to the clinician to guide management of the infant.</description>
