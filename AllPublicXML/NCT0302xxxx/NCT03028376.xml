  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PreTBI II study aims to investigate the diagnostic potential of prehospital S100B and
      GFAP measurements in prediction of need for neurosurgical observation and/or intervention in
      moderate TBI patients, to rule-in high-risk patients. Ultimately to select patients who will
      benefit from neuro surgical expertise in specialized departments and thereby possibly better
      patient outcome. Hopefully also minimize treatment delay, secure optimal resource consumption
      and streamline patient courses by predicting the presence of neurotrauma.

      Hypotheses:

        1. A prehospital serum S100B level &gt; 0,10 microgram/L and expectedly above a certain and
           currently unknown cut-off value indicates the need for neurosurgical observation and/or
           intervention in moderate TBI patients.

        2. A prehospital serum GFAP level above a certain and currently unknown cut-off value can
           significantly predict a need for urgent neurosurgical observation and/or intervention in
           moderate TBI patients.

        3. Biomarker dynamics between prehospital and in-hospital biomarker values of S100B and
           GFAP can significantly predict a need for urgent neurosurgical observation and/or
           intervention.

        4. Biomarker dynamics between prehospital and in-hospital biomarker values of S100B and
           GFAP can significantly predict hospital course and outcome of patients with moderate
           TBI.
