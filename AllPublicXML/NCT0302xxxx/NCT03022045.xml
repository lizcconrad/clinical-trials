    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For generalized pustular psoriasis

          -  Have a diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis for at least 60 days prior to
             informed consent based on the diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Dermatological
             Association (JDA). Subjects not fulfilling one of the diagnostic criteria i.e.,
             &quot;accompanying systemic symptoms including fever or malaise&quot; at the time of screening
             can be entered.

          -  Subjects with an erythema area with pustules accounting for ≥ 10% of the body surface
             area (BSA), and with a severity assessment criteria score (JDA total score) specified
             by the JDA of less than 14.

          -  Must be candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for generalized pustular
             psoriasis, as assessed by the investigator.

        For erythrodermic psoriasis

          -  Have a diagnosis of erythrodermic psoriasis prior to informed consent.

          -  Subjects with an inflammatory erythema area accounting for ≥ 80% of the BSA at
             screening and at the time of the first administration of the study drug.

          -  Must be candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy for erythrodermic psoriasis,
             as assessed by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous exposure to risankizumab.

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational study or less than 30 days (from
             screening) since completing another investigational study (participation in
             observational studies is permitted).

        For generalized pustular psoriasis

          -  Subjects with active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than generalized pustular
             psoriasis that might confound trial evaluations according to investigator's judgment.

        For erythrodermic psoriasis

          -  Subjects with active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than erythrodermic psoriasis
             that might confound trial evaluations according to investigator's judgment.

          -  Subject diagnosed with medication-induced or medication-exacerbated EP.
