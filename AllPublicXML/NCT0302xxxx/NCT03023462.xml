    <textblock>
      One of the most common complications after hernia repair is postoperative and chronic pain.
      TAP (transverse abdominis plain) block is a recommended multimodal method of reducing
      postoperative pain in laparoscopic and open inguinal hernia repair. The objective of this
      study is to determine whether the use of a perioperative echo guided unilateral TAP block has
      a superior effect on postoperative pain after laparoscopic inguinal repair compared to the a
      Quadratus Lumborum 3 Block with a long acting local anesthetic.

    <textblock>
      One of the most common complications after hernia repair is postoperative and chronic pain.
      Postoperative pain is an expected but undesirable effect after an operation, which can result
      in an prolonged hospital stay or longer time to return fully to normal daily activities.
      There are indications that an insufficient treatment of postoperative pain is a risk factor
      for persistent or chronic pain after open and laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (Berndsen
      FH 2007) (Nienhuijs SW 2005).

      TAP (transverse abdominis plain) block is a recommended multimodal method of reducing
      postoperative pain in laparoscopic and open surgery (El-Dawlatly AA 2009; 102). TAP block
      (Meyer A 2015) and a Quadratus Lumborum 3 Block (Adhikary, S.D. 2017) are both recommended
      for inguinal hernia repair. The objective of this study is to determine, whether the use of a
      perioperative echo guided unilateral TAP block has a superior effect on postoperative pain
      after laparoscopic inguinal repair compared to the Quadratus Lumborum 3 Block with a long
      acting local anesthetic. There will be no further analysis in this study regarding the
      evidence of open hernia inguinal repair and chronic pain.

      The primary endpoint:

      Differences in pain scores between the 2 groups until 48 hours after the operation.

      The secondary endpoints:

        -  Pain at the incision site

        -  Deep pain and pain on coughing

        -  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption

        -  Postoperative nausea and vomiting

        -  Antiemetics administered

        -  Sedation scores Power and Sample Size Calculator The number of patients required for the
           study was calculated on the basis of VAS, which was found to be 22±12 mm in Peterson PL
           study (Petersen, et al. 2013 (30):7). We were interested in a reduction by 20% in the
           group given IFB. Assuming α=0,05, we calculated that we need 46 patients (23 in each
           group) to achieve a power of 80% (β=0.2).

           50 adult patients have to be scheduled for primary inguinal hernia repair includes.

      The study is randomized:

        -  Group QLB: Quadratus Lumborum 3 Block using ropivacaine 7,5 mg/ml, 30ml

        -  Group TAP: Transversus abdominis plane block, 20 ml of ropivacaine 7,5 mg/ml and
           inguinal field blocks.

      Subcutaneous wound infiltration in all patients with ropivacaine 5 mg/ml, 5-10 ml.

      Premedication: Paracetamol 2g General anaesthesia: TCI (Target Control Infusion = Anesthesia
      protocol): Propofol and Remifentanil Surgical procedure: Inguinal hernia repair

      Postoperatively:

        -  Oral paracetamol and codeine-fixed combination up to 1000 mg and 60 mg, respectively,
           every 6 h

        -  In case of insufficient analgesia, as judged by the patient, ketobemidone 1 mg IV.

        -  When nausea and vomiting occurs postoperatively, ondansetron 4 mg IV administers as the
           drug of first choice followed by droperidol 0,625 mg IV if the nausea/vomiting persists.

      Collected data:

        -  Postoperative pain at rest and during activity evaluates by 100-mm visual analog scale
           (VAS) and 4-points verbal pain score (VPS; with no pain= =, slight pain = 1, Moderate
           pain = 2, and severe pain = 3) on admission to recovery, and every hour until discharge.

        -  Rescue analgesic consumption during 0 to 4, 4 to 24 and 24 to 48 h.

        -  Sedation, nausea and vomiting record by the same 0 - 3 scale (none, slight, moderate,
           strong) during recovery

        -  Time of postoperative mobilization with corresponding pain score.

        -  Time of discharge-to-home readiness according to standard criteria, including stable
           vital signs, no bleeding from the surgical site, ability to void, absence of excessive
           nausea and pain, and ability to dress and walk without support.

        -  Side effects including nausea and/or vomiting (0 to 4, 4 to 24, and 24 to 48 h),
           antiemetics administered (0 to 24 and 24 to 48 H), grade of sedation (0 to 10 scale,
           where 0 = awake, and 10 = aroused on stimulation), and other side effects and symptoms
           of LA (Local Anesthetics) toxicity.

      Telephone interview at 24 h, 48 h and 7 days, with questions:

        -  Pain during rest and activity using the VPS

        -  Total need og analgesics

        -  Sedation

        -  Nausea

        -  Level of activity

        -  Overall satisfaction with the per- and postoperative period on a 0 - 3 scale: not
           satisfied, slight, moderate or highly satisfied.
