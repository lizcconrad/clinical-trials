  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled
      trial to evaluate an active choice intervention with and without social comparison feedback
      to increase physician statin prescribing rates for eligible patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
      States. Strong evidence indicates that statin medications can reduce the risk of CVD and for
      those with CVD statins have been shown to reduce mortality. Despite this evidence, statins
      are under-prescribed. In this study, the investigators will test the effectiveness of nudges
      targeted to physicians using active choice and social comparisons feedback to increasing the
      rate at which statin medications are prescribed to patients eligible based on national
      practice guidelines.
