  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug, NU-0129,
      based on Spherical Nucleic Acid (SNA) platform when infused in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. The SNA consists of nucleic acids arranged on the
      surface of a small spherical gold nanoparticle. This is a first-in-human trial to determine
      the safety of NU-0129. NU-0129 can cross the blood brain barrier (a filtering mechanism that
      carry blood to the brain). Once within the tumor, the nucleic acid component is able to
      target a gene called Bcl2L12 that is present in glioblastoma multiforme, and is associated
      with tumor growth. This gene prevents tumor cells from apoptosis, which is the process of
      programmed cell death, thus promoting tumor growth. Researchers think that targeting the
      Bcl2L12 gene with NU-0129 will help stop cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of intravenous NU-0129 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze drug concentration in serum at specific time points after drug administration.

      II. To demonstrate intratumoral penetration of NU-0129. III. To assess the feasibility of
      giving NU-0129 as a standard treatment for recurrent GBM or GS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze tumor tissue for Bcl2L12 expression levels after NU-0129 administration.

      II. Preliminary response (progression free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS] at 6
      months; overall response rate [ORR]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive NU-0129 intravenously (IV) over 20-50 minutes and undergo standard of care
      tumor resection within 8-48 hours.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and
      then every 84 days for up to 2 years.
