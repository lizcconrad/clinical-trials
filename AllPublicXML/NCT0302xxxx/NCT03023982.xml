  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new conceptual regional anesthesia the PECs II block (modified pectoral and serratus nerves
      block) has been described for pain control after thoracic surgery, one of the indications to
      perform this method is analgesia for surgeries or procedures involving lateral chest wall

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PECs I block was found to be very effective after breast cancer surgery and sub-pectoral
      prosthesis for pain control management.

      This block is provided by injection into another myofascial plane, this time between
      pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscle at the level of 3rd and 4th rib.PECs II block
      is simple in performance with a high success rate and minimal incidence of complications,
      especially, if used ultrasound approach that gives a good understanding of anatomy of the
      lateral thoracic wall.

      In present clinical trial we are going to compare PECs block for pain control with
      traditional pain management techniques based on IV opioids and NSAIDs treatment in patient
      undergoing thoracic surgery in early postoperative period.

    <description>The patient population will include patients that undergo either open thoracotomy or thoracoscopy for anatomic and non-anatomic lung resection. The standard thoracoscopy approach in our institute includes three holes technic. There are two incisions of 1 cm and utility incision of 4 cm. The standard thoracotomy is posterior- lateral thoracotomy which divided the latissimus dorsi muscle but spears the serratus anterior muscle.</description>
