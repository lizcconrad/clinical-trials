  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, trial in clinically-stable older adults. Up to 300
      eligible older adults 60 through 80 years of age will be enrolled at a 1:1 ratio into
      multiple dose/formulation treatment arms. Safety and immunogenicity data through Day 56 will
      be used to select a vaccine candidate to potentially evaluate in a Part 2 study. Proportions
      of subjects in various strata will not be pre-specified and the goal will be to achieve an
      approximately equal distribution of subjects with these characteristics across the treatment
      groups. Serology measures consistent with the study outcomes will be reported.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females 60 through 80 years of age who are ambulatory and live in the
             community or in an assisted-living facility that provides minimal assistance, such
             that the subject is primarily responsible for self-care and activities of daily
             living. Subjects may have one or more chronic medical diagnoses, but should be
             clinically stable as assessed by:

               -  Absence of changes in medical therapy within one month due to treatment failure
                  or toxicity (dose adjustments of ongoing therapies for optimal effect, or
                  replacements within a class of drugs due to convenience or cost, will be deemed
                  acceptable),

               -  Absence of medical events qualifying as SAEs within one month of the planned
                  vaccination on Day 0, and

               -  Absence of known, current, and life-limiting diagnoses which, in the opinion of
                  the investigator, render survival to completion of the protocol unlikely.

          2. Willing and able (on both a physical and cognitive basis) to give informed consent
             prior to study enrollment. To complete the consent process, all qualifying subjects
             will correctly answer at least 4 out of 5 questions of the informed consent form (ICF)
             comprehension assessment in no more than 2 attempts.

          3. Able to comply with study requirements. As the protocol procedures involve telephone
             contacts for safety ascertainment, eligible subjects must have a reliable access to a
             telephone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received any prior RSV vaccine.

          2. Participation in research involving any additional investigational product (drug /
             biologic / device) within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination.

          3. History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination or a history of Guillain-Barré
             syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of any prior influenza immunization.

          4. Receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine within 14 days prior to the Day 0 dose of
             test article or any other vaccine within the 4 weeks prior to the Day 0 dose of test
             article.

          5. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as
             determined by history and/or physical examination.

          6. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥ 10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical,
             inhaled, and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

          7. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

          8. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature ≥ 38.0°C on the planned
             day of vaccine administration).

          9. Known disturbance of coagulation. Potential subjects receiving aspirin, clopidogrel,
             prasugrel, dipyridamole, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin under good
             control for cardiovascular prophylaxis or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease or
             stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation will NOT be excluded.

         10. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse.

         11. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric
             conditions deemed likely to impair the quality of study compliance or safety
             reporting).
