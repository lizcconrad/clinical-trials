      This study will assess the immunomodulatory activity of entinostat in patients with advanced
      renal cell carcinoma receiving the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab. The overall hypothesis is
      that entinostat will increase the immune response and anti-tumor effect induced by the PD-L1
      inhibition by suppressing Treg function. We have chosen renal cell carcinoma that has been
      reported to respond to PD1/PD-L 1 inhibition. The schedule of entinostat is based on our
      previous experience with this agent. Based on our working hypothesis that low dose HDAC
      inhibitors will have a suppressive function on Tregs but not on T effector cells, the
      starting dose of entinostat will be 1 mg and will be escalated up to 5 mg rather than the 10
      mg dose. The combination also with bevacizumab will provide an effective VEGF inhibition that
      may potentiate the immune response and anti-tumor effect induced by atezolizumab. The
      proposed dose and schedule for atezolizumab and bevacizumab has been shown to be well
      tolerated in prior Phase/I/II studies and is currently tested in a Phase III randomized study
      in patients with renal cell carcinoma with sunitinib as a control arm. The highest proposed
      dose level for entinostat (5 mg) represents 50% of the recommended Phase II dose for this
      compound as a single agent.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase l/II, open-label, safety, pharmacodynamics and efficacy study of atezolizumab
      in combination with entinostat and bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma. This clinical study will be composed of a Dose Finding Phase (Phase I) and a
      two-stage Dose Expansion Phase (Phase II) (i.e. Phase II Stage I &amp; Phase II Stage II).

      In Phase 1, patients will be treated with oral entinostat every 7 days, with bevacizumab at
      the fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and with atezolizumab at the fixed dose of 1200
      mg IV every 3 weeks. Each cycle length is 21 days. Three dose levels of entinostat will be
      tested in 3-patient cohorts according to the 3 + 3 standard design (level 1 = 1 mg, level 2 =
      3 mg and level 3 = 5 mg). The 5 mg dose represents 50% of the recommended entinostat dose as
      a single agent.

      For Phase I, the starting dose level of entinostat will be 1 mg PO every 7 days. The first
      dose level will have a minimum of 3 patients treated (unless the first 2 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) before the 3rd patient is enrolled. DLTs are defined as grade
      ≥ 3 hematological/non hematological toxicities attributable to entinostat and/or bevacizumab
      and atezolizumab during the first 21 days of the combination treatment.

      If DLTs occur in 1 patient treated at the starting dose level, a minimum of 3 additional
      patients will be treated at this dose level. If DLTs occur in more than 1 patient in the
      first 6 patients, the study will be terminated. If a DLT occurs in 1/6 patient, dose level 1
      will be considered the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D). If no DLTs occur at the starting
      dose level 1, 3 additional patients will be treated at the next dose level (level 2). If no
      DLTs occur at the dose level 2, 3 additional patients will be treated at the next dose level
      (level 3). If no DLTs occur at dose level 3, this dose level will be recommended for the
      Phase II portion of the study. Patients who experience grade ≥ 3 toxicity and recover to ≤
      grade 1 (or to pretreatment baseline level toxicity) may continue treatment at the next lower
      level. The Phase II dose will be RP2D of entinostat (i.e., the highest tested dose that is
      declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor).

      Once the RP2D is identified, the Phase II portion (Simon's two stage design) will be opened.
      During Phase II, the study will have a run-in period with entinostat for one cycle followed
      by atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the second cycle, and then the combination phase (i.e.,
      atezolizumab + bevacizumab + entinostat for all cycles thereafter). The reason for the run-in
      period during the Phase II is to obtain data on the immunomodulatory effects of entinostat
      separately from bevacizumab and atezolizumab.

      In Phase II Stage I, 32 patients with prior treatments will be enrolled in two - Phase II
      cohorts: 18 treatment naïve (anti-PD1 naïve) patients (Cohort A) and 14 anti-PD1 resistant
      (defined as patients who have been on PD1 inhibitors for at least 6 months and have
      progressed by either clinical or radiographic assessment) patients (Cohort B). If ≥ 5
      responses are observed in Cohort A, Stage II will be conducted with 15 additional patients.
      Cohort B is a pilot arm which aims to test atezolizumab in anti-PD1 resistant patients. If
      there is no response to atezolizumab, then the RP2D dose of entinostat will be added to the
      standard dose of atezolizumab. If there is a response to atezolizumab, patients will continue
      to be treated with atezolizumab alone.

      The RP2D is the dose of entinostat, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab in combination chosen for
      further clinical development. Further experience in Phase II may result in a RP2D dose lower
      than the maximum tolerated dose.

      Objectives:

        1. Primary Phase I: To assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab in combination
           with entinostat and bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

        2. Primary Phase II: To assess the objective response rate of atezolizumab in combination
           with entinostat and bevacizumab in anti-PD 1 naïve patients and atezolizumab in
           combination with entinostat in anti-PD 1 resistant patients with advanced renal cell
           carcinoma.

        3. Secondary: To assess the objective response rate (Phase I only), progression-free
           survival and overall survival.

        4. Correlative: To characterize PD-L1/2, immune cell subsets, and miRs in tumor and/or
           blood in correlation with response.
