  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II
      as an autologous bone-regenerating graft in the reconstruction of deficient bone in two
      clinical indications:

        1. Long bone extra-articular comminuted fracture

        2. Large bone defect or gap incapable of self-regeneration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary Endpoint:

      To establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is safe under the
      following conditions:

        -  No treatment-related appearance of heterotrophic bone ossification

        -  No excessive bone formation at the transplantation sites

        -  No abnormalities in the treated sites

      Secondary Endpoint:

      To establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is effective under
      the following conditions:

        1. Long bone extraarticular comminuted fracture:

           - Enhancement of fracture healing is considerably faster than the common time period
           known for these clinical conditions in at least two thirds of the treated subjects.

        2. Large bone defect or gap incapable of self-regeneration:

             -  A newly formed bone tissue is generated within the bone gap which re-establishes
                bone continuity in at least two thirds of the treated subjects.

    <description>Bone union will be evaluated by the RUST score. Each cortex will be assigned a RUST score of 1 to 3, based on the appearance. 1 - lowest score for continuity, 3- highest score for continuity.

    <description>Surgery will be performed under local or general anesthetics according to the Investigator's and anesthesiologist discretion.
A standard orthopedic approach will be made according to the fracture site.Then the transplantation of BonoFill-II into the fracture site and the fixation of the fracture by intramedullary nail or plate and screws or external fixator as required will be performed.
internal fixation (plate and screws and intramedullary nails) will not be routinely removed. External fixators will be removed upon achievement of satisfactory bone union.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Long and short bones extra articular comminuted fracture:

          -  Subject with fracture requiring temporary fixation (to be carried out prior to
             enrollment in the study) followed by definitive treatment (to be carried out in the
             framework of the study). This could be the outcome of various reasons, such as an open
             fracture, and/or a multisystem injury where definitive treatment could not have been
             performed upon admission.

          -  Long and short bones extra and intra articular defect/gap or non union, incapable of
             self-regeneration. Intra articular non union is a result of unsuccessful arthrodesis
             (artificial induction of joint ossification between two bones by surgery).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intra-articular fractures

          -  Age is under 18 or above 75

          -  A simple fracture manageable by one definitive treatment

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Patients with active infection anywhere in the body except in the injured bone site
             that is in question and needs osteogenic treatment.

          -  Subjects with recorded medical history diseases such as heart diseases, renal failure.

          -  Subject treated currently with systemic steroids.

          -  Subjects with known autoimmune diseases, such as Addison's disease, Celiac disease -
             sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), Dermatomyositis, Graves disease, Hashimoto's
             thyroiditis, Multiple sclerosis, Myasthenia gravis, Pernicious anemia, Reactive
             arthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, Systemic lupus erythematosus.

          -  Subjects diagnosed with osteoporosis

          -  Subjects that have a known scar healing problem (keloid formation).

          -  Subjects treated with Bisphosphonate drugs

          -  Oncology patients in treatment

          -  Subjects who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment in the past

          -  Subjects participating in another clinical trial 30 days prior to and during the study
             period.

          -  Subjects with a known history of any significant medical disorder, which in the
             investigator's judgment contraindicates the subject's participation.

          -  Subjects with any known allergy for local/general anesthesia.

          -  Positive serology for either HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          -  Abnormal clinically significant laboratory test and findings, as per the
             investigator's judgment.
