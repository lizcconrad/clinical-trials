  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn more about liver fibrosis and methods to detect it. We
      will evaluate and compare multiple MRI based measures of liver fibrosis in subjects with and
      without liver disease.

      While liver biopsy is still considered the gold standard for diagnosing and assessing the
      presence and degree of liver fibrosis and inflammation, it has disadvantages including the
      potential for sampling error and risk of complications, including life-threatening bleeding.
      New imaging modalities such as MR Elastography, T1 mapping, T2 mapping, T1 rho, and
      magnetization transfer allow rapid, non-invasive evaluation of liver parenchymal
      characteristics and may be able to detect and quantify parenchymal fibrosis alleviating the
      need for biopsy. To date, the quantitative performance of these different techniques has not
      been extensively studied. This study is a single-center trial of non-invasive MR imaging
      techniques aimed at detecting and measuring liver fibrosis. Once optimized, these
      technologies may later be deployed in hypothesis driven research studies and/or routine
      clinical exams in the pediatric population here at CCHMC and/or as part of a multi-center
      study with specific IRB approval for that project.

      To assess the relative performance of each technique, correlation across techniques, and
      reproducibility across the range of fibrosis, 32 subjects will be enrolled in this
      preliminary study sub-divided into 4 groups (Group 1: Healthy/ Normal controls; Group 2:
      F1/F2 fibrosis as determined by prior biopsy (low grade fibrosis group); Group 3: F3/F4
      fibrosis as determined by prior biopsy (high grade fibrosis group), Group 4: Hepatic
      steatosis with fibrosis (NAFLD group)). 8 healthy subjects without known or suspected liver
      disease will be enrolled as normal controls. 8 subjects each with known fibrosis based on
      liver biopsy within the last 6 months will be enrolled in Group 2 and Group 3 (total = 16). 8
      subjects with known hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis based on liver biopsy within the
      last 6 months will be enrolled in Group 4.
