  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomized, mono-centric, prospective interventional study that will assess the
      efficacy of the loco-regional anesthesia PECS on the rate of chronic pain, 6 month after a
      patient will have either received a mastectomy or a mastectomy associated with axillary nodes
      dissection, and/or a reconstruction by prosthesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the care given to treat breast cancer while the patient
      receives a total mastectomy. It is done by evaluating the technique of anesthesia PECS used
      during this procedure so that the rate of chronic pain can be measured 6 month after the
      operation.

      As well as total mastectomy, patients are also eligible for an axillary lymph node dissection
      (ALND) and a reconstruction of the breast by prosthesis as options.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  Evaluating the effectiveness of the PECS anesthesia technique on the trajectory of acute
           post-operative pain and on chronic pain after 12 month of the surgery

        -  Evaluating the type and intensity of the pain

        -  Evaluating the quality of life

        -  Study the link between chronic pain and the trajectory of acute pain.
