  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) is a natural molecule that can make a significant contribution to the
      success of embryo implantation phase, because it exerts, directly or indirectly, an
      immunomodulatory activity. ALA has the ability to regenerate antioxidants molecules that
      facilitate embryo implantation, and to stimulate the production of local mediators useful for
      implantation. This study is a prospective clinical trial and aims to evaluate the
      reproductive outcomes of Italian couples following oocyte donation fresh cycles when
      receiving per os tablets of lipoic acid. Indeed, the control group had only the standard
      treatment (vaginal progesterone), whereas the study group, in addition to that, received ALA
      (300 mg, 2 times per day) by oral route, from the day of donors oocyte pick up until the
      pregnancy test. If the childbearing occurred, treatment continued until the 8th week of
      pregnancy. Primary outcome of the study is the implantation rate while the positive hCG rate,
      the clinical pregnancy rate, the miscarriage rate and the live-birth rate are secondary
      outcomes .
