  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good glucose control in type 1 diabetes is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes
      complications and self monitoring of glucose levels is an important component of achieving
      and maintaining glucose control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves overall glucose
      control in all age groups when used continuously, and reduces the incidence of low blood
      glucose (hypoglycaemia) in people with good glucose control. Hypoglycaemia is one of the
      commonest metabolic complications of type 1 diabetes and, if it occurs frequently, people can
      become less aware of it. This reduced aware of hypoglycaemia has significant risks including
      seizures, coma and even death, and has an impact on people's ability to drive and function.

      The Abbott Libre intermittent glucose monitoring system provides up to 8 hours of
      retrospective continuous glucose monitoring data to users when the monitor is waved in
      proximity with the sensor. In contrast to realtime CGM the Libre system sensor is used for 14
      days and is non-adjunctive (does not require calibration to capillary blood glucose).

      This clinical study proposes to assess the impact of Libre on frequency, duration and
      severity of hypoglycaemia, compared with the Dexcom G5 realtime CGM and will focus on people
      with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia.
