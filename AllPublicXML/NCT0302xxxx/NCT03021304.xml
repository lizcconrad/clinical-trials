  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the correct real-world use of a safety syringe for the repeat
      self-administration of mepolizumab SC. This Phase III study will be an open-label,
      single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug product in a safety
      syringe (100 milligrams [mg]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (3 doses) in
      subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg mepolizumab SC as a
      single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or administered in the upper
      arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 weeks including
      pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment period which concludes with
      end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab. Approximately
      55 Subjects will be enrolled in the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Observed Third Dose at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>During the clinic visits the Investigator or designee evaluated if the participants were able to self-administer the third dose at Week 8 by visual inspection immediately following injection and by using an 'Observer checklist' based on the safety syringe Instructions for Use (IFU). The 'self-administration' was defined as administration of mepolizumab liquid drug product in safety syringe either by the participants themselves or by their caregiver. Failure to perform one of the critical steps was deemed to be failure to successfully administer the injection. Participants with data available at Week 8 have been analyzed. Analysis was performed on All Subjects (Safety) Population which comprised of all enrolled participants attempting at least one self administration of mepolizumab liquid drug product in a safety syringe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Unobserved Second Dose Outside the Clinic Setting at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The participant (or caregiver), self-administered the dose of study treatment outside the clinic and without observation during Week 4, up to 24 hours after attending clinic Visit 3. The 'self-administration' was defined as either administration of mepolizumab liquid drug product in safety syringe by the participants themselves or by their caregiver. The participant/caregiver completed an 'At home Checklist' outlining the various steps in the IFU to use the safety syringe. On returning to clinic the investigator inspected whether the returned safety syringe showed any signs that the full dose had not been administered.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Observed Third Dose at Week 8</title>
        <description>During the clinic visits the Investigator or designee evaluated if the participants were able to self-administer the third dose at Week 8 by visual inspection immediately following injection and by using an ‘Observer checklist’ based on the safety syringe Instructions for Use (IFU). The ‘self-administration’ was defined as administration of mepolizumab liquid drug product in safety syringe either by the participants themselves or by their caregiver. Failure to perform one of the critical steps was deemed to be failure to successfully administer the injection. Participants with data available at Week 8 have been analyzed. Analysis was performed on All Subjects (Safety) Population which comprised of all enrolled participants attempting at least one self administration of mepolizumab liquid drug product in a safety syringe.</description>

        <description>The participant (or caregiver), self-administered the dose of study treatment outside the clinic and without observation during Week 4, up to 24 hours after attending clinic Visit 3. The ‘self-administration’ was defined as either administration of mepolizumab liquid drug product in safety syringe by the participants themselves or by their caregiver. The participant/caregiver completed an ‘At home Checklist’ outlining the various steps in the IFU to use the safety syringe. On returning to clinic the investigator inspected whether the returned safety syringe showed any signs that the full dose had not been administered.</description>
