    <textblock>
      Chronic pain, life style factors and quality of life (KROKIETA) is a multicenter study that
      aims to analyze life style factors, socioeconomic and psychometric properties, metabolic
      problems, drug use, quality of life and biochemical variables in chronic non-cancer pain
      patients. The life style factors will be compared to those of normal population. At baseline,
      the study patients fill in questionnaires (A-E), the patientsÂ´ weight, length, waist and
      blood pressure are measured, pain-related factors are recorded and blood samples taken.
      Changes in the quality of life of the study patients will be evaluated by questionnaires
      during follow-up at 2 years and 5 years.

      Chronic pain co-occurs with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, depression, smoking and
      sleep problems. Nutrition and low physical activity may predispose to chronic pain. To gain
      information on the life style factors of adult chronic pain patients referred to university
      hospital or central hospital pain clinics in Finland, 477 patients have been recruited to the
      study. The patients fill in questionnaires on sociodemographic factors, pain, medication, use
      of health services, physical activity, smoking, use of alcohol or other substances, sleep,
      quality of life, nutrition and psychological factors at their first visit to the pain clinic.
      Height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse are measured by the study
      nurse. A blood sample for analysis of blood sugar, cholesterol (total, LDL, HDL),
      triglycerides, HbA1c and sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) is taken. The pain clinician
      records the pain diagnosis, medication and other methods of pain management chosen. The
      patients will be sent follow-up questionnaires at 2 years and 5 years after baseline.
