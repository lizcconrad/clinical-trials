    <textblock>
      This is a single center study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I a formulation that
      incorporates cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), administered once as a single dose of three
      sprays orally, followed by multiple dosing (3x daily oral sprays) over days 3-6 and then a
      repeat pharmacokinetic study during the final oral dose administered as the first dose on day
      7 to ascertain CPC accumulation.

      ARMS Pharmaceuticals LLC intends to apply for approval of ARMS-I as a prescription drug for
      the prevention of influenza, rhinovirus and RSV (collectively, &quot;vURTI's). The company plans
      on confirming the limited systemic bioavailability, through conducting a study to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I administered orally in healthy adults. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I following oral
      administration to healthy subjects. Specifically, investigators will assess whether there is
      measurable systemic exposure and if so, to determine the plasma and pharyngeal fluid
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of ARMS-I after single and multiple oral dosing. The
      secondary objective will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ARMS-I.
