    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, dose escalating, phase Ib trial, which will be
      conducted in No. 302 Hospital of China. There are three cohorts at dose of 4.2mg, 6.3mg and
      8.4mg. All healthy volunteers will be randomized into Hepalatide or placebo group at 4:1
      rate, all healthy volunteers will be received treatment drug by abdominal subcutaneous
      injection once a day for seven days and will be observed for 3 days.
