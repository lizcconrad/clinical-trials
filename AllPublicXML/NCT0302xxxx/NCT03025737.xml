      The aim of the present proposal is to investigate the development of distinct morphological,
      functional, biochemical and molecular aspects of short- and long-term sport-induced changes
      in the heart, to get a better understanding on the (patho)physiology of athlete's heart. The
      main goal of our research is to deepen our knowledge on the proper differentiation between
      beneficial (physiological) and harmful (pathological) consequences of professional sport,
      thereby effectively preventing potential cardiovascular complications of athletes.

      CLINICAL METHODS

        1. Sport specific questionnaire, patient history and physical examinations - In our
           detailed questionnaire, specific information is collected about quantity and quality of
           training, personal and family history and presence of sport specific and general
           symptoms.

        2. Laboratory biochemical examination - Besides the regular routine laboratory parameters,
           several specific parameters associated with physical exercise are planned to be
           measured, such as cardiac biomarkers.

        3. 12-lead ECG - Resting standard 12-lead digital ECG will be recorded. Extended analysis
           will be performed according to the latest recommendations.

        4. Holter ECG - 24 hour Holter ECG will be recorded. Extended Holter ECG analysis will be
           performed.

        5. Detailed echocardiography

        6. Detailed CMR examination

        7. Body composition analysis - With a sophisticated bio-electrical impedance analysis,
           comprehensive whole body composition and hydration analysis will be performed.

        8. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing - Sport specific protocols will be used on both
           treadmill and bike ergometers.
