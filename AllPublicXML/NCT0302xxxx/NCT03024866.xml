  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective-prospective study design. Patients who completed treatment
      approximately 3 years (range of 2-4 years) at time of IRB approval of this study will be
      identified and any existing data in the patient's record will be collected in addition to
      conducting office visits for long-term follow-up.

      This is a retrospective-prospective study design. Patients who completed treatment
      approximately 3 years (range of 2-4 years) at time of IRB approval of this study will be
      identified and any existing data in the patient's record will be collected in addition to
      conducting office visits for long-term follow-up. The study will include 2 parts:

        1. Retrospective chart review: Collect data from patient records who completed treatment a
           minimum of 2 years prior to study onset and determine the feasibility of doing a matched
           pair cohort study comparison of eBx versus Mohs surgery. The history, demographic and
           treatment data will be retrospectively collected from up to 320 subjects previously
           treated with eBx for the treatment of NMSC and up to 320 subjects previously treated
           with Mohs surgery for the treatment of NMSC.

        2. Prospective Follow-up: Patients will return for long-term follow-up visits for the
           investigators to assess the lesion site, document absence of recurrence/ absence of
           recurrence, toxicities, and collect patient reported outcomes.
