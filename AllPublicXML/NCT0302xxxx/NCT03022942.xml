      To evaluate the acute and chronic effects of costal mobilization techniques and diaphragmatic
      release in chest cavity kinematics, diaphragmatic mobility and functional capacity in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

      Study will be a controlled clinical trial in which participants will be randomized into 2
      groups: GROUP A (costal mobilization techniques and Manual Diaphragm Release Technique),
      GROUP B (Manual Diaphragm Release Technique). After the initial evaluation, participants will
      undergo six sessions of care according to randomization and will be reevaluated in 3
      following situations: immediately after the first session, at the end of treatment and one
      week after the last session. The evaluation will be performed through Optoelectronic
      plethysmography , Pollar, Ultrasound and 6-minutes walk test.

    <description>Costal mobilization technique (Rib raising): The patient will be lying. The Therapist supports the last four pulps of both hands at the rib angles, gently traverses the rib angles in the posterior-anterior direction, using the stretcher as a lever to facilitate the elevation of the costal angles. Siting: The Therapist hugs the patient by supporting the ribs of the fingers at the rib angles, gently traverses the rib angles bilaterally in the anterior-lateral direction. Manual Diaphragm Release Technique: The therapist makes manual contact with the underside of the costal border of the common cartilage of the last rib. In the inspiratory phase, the therapist draws the points of contact with both hands in a cephalad direction and slightly Accompanying the movement of the rib cage.</description>
