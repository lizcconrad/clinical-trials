  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate antibiotic use is a major public health concern. Excessive exposure to
      antibiotics results in emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria, potentially avoidable
      adverse drug reactions, and increased healthcare utilization and cost. As antibiotic
      prescribing in emergency departments and urgent care centers remains unchecked, national
      professional organizations including the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and
      the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology (SHEA), and an Executive Order from the President of
      the United States, recommend expansion of antimicrobial stewardship to these ambulatory care
      settings. The goal of antimicrobial stewardship is to effectively promote judicious
      antibiotic use in all healthcare settings, yet stewardship programs have not achieved their
      potential in terms of either reach or effectiveness. Reach has been limited by implementation
      mostly in inpatient settings; at the same time, recent critical experiments in behavioral
      science suggest that the effectiveness of existing stewardship programs could be greatly
      augmented through inclusion of behavioral nudges, benchmarked audit and feedback, and
      peer-to-peer comparisons.

      In this proposed acute care project, the investigators will compare a package consisting of
      education for providers using existing materials from CDC's GetSmart campaign adapted for the
      acute care setting led by a physician champion at each site (the adapted intervention), to a
      more intensive intervention that incorporates adapted GetSmart materials enhanced with
      individualized audit and feedback, peer comparisons, and behavioral nudges (the enhanced
      intervention). The comparative effectiveness of the enhanced intervention will be evaluated
      in a multicenter cluster randomized trial nested within a quasi-experimental study of acute
      care stewardship. The investigators' hypothesis is that both interventions will reduce
      inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for antibiotic nonresponsive acute respiratory
      infections (ARIs) in emergency departments and urgent care centers, but that the enhanced one
      will be more effective. The investigators will use an interrupted time series study design to
      measure the impact of their interventions against the baseline period of usual care as well
      as against seasonally-adjusted historical controls. The cluster randomized design for the two
      types of acute care stewardship interventions will allow measurement of the difference-
      in-differences in antibiotic prescribing rates for acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis,
      viral pharyngitis, influenza, and nonspecific URI. Translation of proven behavioral
      techniques is a new and innovative approach to improving prescribing decisions. This project
      will expand stewardship to a new setting using innovative and effective approaches including
      the adaptation of behavioral techniques for ED and urgent care settings. The investigators
      will also further establish their research group as a network for developing novel tools,
      measuring outcomes for antimicrobial stewardship, and disseminating research findings through
      acute care setting-specific toolkits.

In addition to these methods, the investigators will add posters within exam rooms which will include modified GetSmart content and other nudges such as physician pictures with their signed public commitment to antibiotic stewardship or flair denoting commitment to stewardship. The investigators will also provide physicians with personalized monthly performance ranking with each physician receiving the designation of &quot;top performer&quot; or &quot;not a top performer&quot; based on their appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices for acute respiratory infections. This will be the Enhanced Antimicrobial Stewardship Commitment and Feedback intervention.</description>
