  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the distribution of carbohydrates and fat in
      the diet of women with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy. More specifically, it will look at
      the distribution of carbohydrate in the diet during weeks 29-32 of pregnancy. The
      carbohydrate distribution and fat content of the meal will be compared to maternal glucose
      control, preprandial glucose levels, and the percentile for weight of the infant at birth. In
      addition, each meal and snack will be classified as low-moderate fat or high fat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review. Data will be collected on all patients seen whose blood
      sugar and food logs were at least 75% complete. By calculating carbohydrate amounts at meals
      and snacks, as well as classifying meals and snacks as high fat, we will examine the
      correlation to higher preprandial blood glucose values and large for gestational age infants.
      Preprandial glucose levels will be reviewed, questioning whether the biggest contributor is
      the composition of the previous meal or additional snacks between meals.
