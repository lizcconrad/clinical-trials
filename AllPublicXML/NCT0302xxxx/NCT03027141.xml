  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      investigate how a change in facial appearance is initially represented in brain circuits and
      then alters over time, as the new face becomes recognized as &quot;me&quot;.

      Investigators will try to identify areas of the brain responsible for processing and storing
      information about self-facial recognition; Examine how these areas of the brain respond to
      images of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;non-self&quot; and; Investigate how the brain responds, over time, to
      changes in facial recognition, particularly at time points: i) prior to facial injury, ii)
      post-injury but prior to facial transplantation, and iii) after receiving facial
      transplantation.

      Before surgery, investigators will compare activity in the brain when participants are
      looking at their pre-injury and their injured face with activity when they are looking at the
      persons face with whom they are familiar with. This will identify whether there are
      differences between how the brain responds when patients view their current facial appearance
      and when viewing their face before facial disfigurement. Investigators will then scan the
      patients post-operatively when the transplant team deems the patient ready; this will depend
      on reduction of post-operative swelling, improved communication with the treatment team, and
      patient psychological status. Activity in the brain will be compared when participants are
      looking at pictures of the familiar other person, with pictures of their pre-injury,
      pre-transplant disfigured face and pictures of their post-transplant facial appearance.
      Participants will be scanned again, at least two months later, with the same set of stimuli.
      Activity in the brain will be compared when participants look at their pre-transplant
      disfigured face and their new face, compared with activity when they look at the familiar
      other. This will allow investigators to see the differences in how the brain responds to the
      new facial appearance over time.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have suffered from severe facial disfigurement which warrant facial
             transplantation and have been evaluated and approved for transplantation, will be
             included.

        Exclusion Criteria:
