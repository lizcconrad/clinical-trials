  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive disease that affects mainly small and medium
      joints and, in the absence of appropriate background therapy, leads to progressive joint
      destruction, functional, psychological, social and occupational repercussions.

      Several biomedicine treat this pathology, including rituximab (RTX). It is recommended to
      evaluate the therapeutic response to RTX and re-administer it from the 24th week when the
      goal of remission has not been achieved. However, the optimal modality for reprocessing
      remains to be determined.

      To this end, different approaches have been explored, such as lymphocyte typing or ultrasound
      monitoring. The pace of these examinations, however, remains wide and their cost is not
      negligible. This is why we propose here to explore the track of a tight follow-up nurse
      DAS28.

      The hypothesis is that a tight nursing follow-up can detect the symptomatic recovery earlier
      than the current medical follow-up.

    <description>In addition to the usual follow-up by their rheumatologist tight nursing follow-up patients will benefit of
a training session to self-assess their RA: Self-assessment of the number of painful and swollen joints, of pain and disease activity (global assessment by the patient) (self-DAS). During this session, a scheduled dosage of ESR and CRP levels will be given to the patient.
A monthly call by a nurse who inquires about the results of the patient's self-assessment. As soon as she suspects a relapse of RA, she plans a consultation to confirm or not the relapse. For this purpose, she calculates the DAS28 taking into account the results of the biological test, the articular count and the disease activity. Clinical relapse is documented by a DAS28-CRP &gt; 2.7</description>
