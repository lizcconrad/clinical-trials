  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth replacement is a significant issue in the World. Such replacement is considered
      important by patients to improve aesthetics, function and quality of life. Tooth replacement
      is therefore a significant issue. Resin-bonded bridges (RBBs) are conservative and
      cost-effective tooth replacement option that involves minimal tooth preparation and are
      secured in place with an adhesive cement by bonding to the outer enamel layer of the tooth.
      Clinical reports of these prostheses at the University of Hong Kong shows some of the highest
      success rate and greatest longevity in the dental literature. However, a problem with this
      type of prosthesis in that it still needs some tooth preparation to accommodate the framework
      thickness of the bridge. In some patients with tooth wear, this may mean cutting through the
      enamel crown down into dentine which will weaken the tooth. In light of the tooth preparation
      some patients will refuse this treatment, in particular patients with dental drill phobias.

      The aim of this study is to investigate RBBs with tooth preparation and with no tooth
      preparation for the replacement of single missing teeth in a randomized controlled trial.
      However, a significant consequence of a no preparation RBB will mean that after cementation
      the prosthesis will interfere with the patient's bite, making the bridge prosthesis stand
      high. This will take time for the patient's original occlusion to re-establish itself by the
      movement of the tooth supporting the bridge. Despite the success of &quot;supra-occluding&quot;
      restoration has been reported in some studies, currently neither no preparation nor
      supraoccluding dental bridges are the standard of care for general dental practitioners and
      have not been reported on as a clinical trial in the literature. Most symptoms reported for
      supraoccluding restorations were transient and are reversible. The findings of this research
      will have significant impact on the teaching and practice for clinical prosthodontics and
      patient care worldwide. Patients will have a dental prosthesis that requires no dental
      drilling, no local anaesthetic and will have a stronger tooth supporting the bridge that
      should have greater longevity. More patients, in particular phobic patients will therefore
      seek treatment for tooth replacement with this conservative treatment option.
