  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary angioedema is a rare inherited disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of the
      accumulation of fluids outside of the blood vessels, blocking the normal flow of blood or
      lymphatic fluid and causing rapid swelling of tissues in the hands, feet, limbs, face,
      intestinal tract, or airway. Usually, this swelling is not accompanied by itching, as it
      might be with an allergic reaction. Swelling of the gastrointestinal tract leads to cramping.
      Swelling of the airway may lead to obstruction, a potentially very serious complication.
      These symptoms develop as the result of deficiency or improper functioning of certain
      proteins that help to maintain the normal flow of fluids through very small blood vessels
      (capillaries).

      In some cases, fluid may accumulate in other internal organs. The severity of the disease
      varies greatly among affected individuals. The most common form of the disorder is hereditary
      angioedema type I, which is the result of abnormally low levels of certain complex proteins
      in the blood (C1 esterase inhibitors), known as complements. They help to regulate various
      body functions.

      The characteristic symptom of hereditary angioedema is recurrent episodes of swelling of
      affected areas due to the accumulation of excessive body fluid. The areas of the body most
      commonly affected include the hands, feet, eyelids, lips, and/or genitals. Edema may also
      occur in the mucous membranes that line the respiratory and digestive tracts, which is more
      common in people with hereditary angioedema than in those who have other forms of angioedema
      (i.e., acquired or traumatic). People with this disorder typically have areas of swelling
      that are hard and painful, not red and itchy (pruritic). A skin rash (urticaria) rarely is
      present.

      The symptoms of hereditary angioedema may recur and can become more severe. Injury, severe
      pain, surgery, dental procedures, viral illness, and/or stress can trigger or worsen the
      recurring symptoms.

      Symptoms associated with swelling in the digestive system (gastrointestinal tract) include
      nausea, vomiting, acute abdominal pain, and/or other signs of obstruction. Edema of the
      throat (pharynx) or voice-box (larynx) can result in pain, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia),
      difficulty speaking (dysphonia), noisy respiration (stridor), and potentially
      life-threatening asphyxiation.

      Hereditary angioedema is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Genetic diseases are
      determined by two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.

      Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for
      the appearance of the disease. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can
      be the result of a spontaneous new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual.

      The symptoms of hereditary angioedema type I develop due to a deficiency of a protein known
      as complement component C1 esterase inhibitor.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7,5 ml
      EDTA blood and/or a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis in
      those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,
      sequencing of hereditary angioedema disease type 1 will be done.
