  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study brain imaging of a substance called tau, which is
      found in brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease, using the Tau binder, 18F-THK-5351, for
      live imaging of tau in the brain. The main goal of this proposal is to study whether diabetes
      status (type 2 diabetes [referred to as diabetes] and pre-diabetes, compared with normal
      glucose tolerance [NGT]), is associated with increased tau accumulation in the brain, one of
      the culprits of Alzheimer's disease, in a community-based group of middle aged
      Caribbean-Hispanics with a mean age of 63 years. The investigators propose to conduct tau
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 30 middle aged Hispanics.

    <textblock>
      The burden of late onset Alzheimer's dementia (LOAD) and its antecedents is increasing
      without known prevention or cure, and diabetes seems to be one of the strongest risk factors.
      The predominating causal model in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is based on the amyloid
      hypothesis, which posits that amyloid (A) deposition in the brain causes synaptic dysfunction
      resulting in early memory deficits and progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      dementia. Tau has also gained increasing interest as an AD pathology feature, biomarker, and
      treatment target.

      There are no known curative or preventive measures for LOAD. One of the strongest potential
      LOAD risk factors is type 2 diabetes, an abnormal elevation of blood glucose associated with
      microvascular and macrovascular complications including cerebrovascular disease. Many studies
      have reported an association of diabetes with dementia, including LOAD and vascular dementia
      (VD). Most studies have found that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of both LOAD
      and VD, with a stronger association for VD compared with LOAD. Thus, this study focuses on
      the relation of diabetes, pre-diabetes, and elevated glucose, with AD.

    <description>This group consists of 30 adult subjects: 10 with Type 2 diabetes, 10 with pre-diabetes, and 10 with normal glucose tolerance. Each subject will receive a baseline scan and a follow-up PET scan with 18F-THK-5351.</description>

A small amount of 18F-THK-5351 will be injected into the IV enough time has passed for this contrast to collect in the tissue in the brain (approximately one half-hour), and participant will lie on a bed which slides into a PET Scanner to complete Tau imaging.</description>
