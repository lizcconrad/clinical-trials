  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking following acute coronary syndrome can reduce mortality up to 50%. However,
      depression and smoking are highly co-morbid and depressed mood may interfere with cessation
      and independently predicts mortality. Thus, a single, integrated treatment for both smoking
      and depression could be highly effective in reducing post-acute coronary syndrome mortality.
      Behavioral Activation (BA) is a well established treatment for depression and has recently
      shown promise as a treatment for smoking cessation. The investigators systematically
      developed an intervention integrating gold standard smoking cessation counseling with
      existing BA based mood management techniques for post-ACS smokers; Behavioral Activation
      Treatment for Cardiac Smokers (BAT-CS).

      Objective: For this R56 the investigators will conduct a vanguard trial to pilot all methods,
      materials, and systems for the later fully powered BAT-CS vs. attention control trial. The
      investigators will enroll up to 36 smokers with ACS and randomize them to 12 weeks of BAT-CS
      or an attention control (Health and Wellness Education). Both groups will be offered the
      nicotine patch if medically safe.

    <description>All participants will receive one hour of standard smoking cessation counseling during their hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome. Participants will be randomized 1 week after discharge. Those assigned to BAT-CS condition will receive 5 more counseling sessions over the 12 weeks after discharge. The first will be up to one hour and will be conducted in person. The next 4 sessions will occur by phone and will take about 30 minutes. Post-discharge sessions will be focused on smoking cessation and mood management using behavioral activation techniques. Participants will be offered the nicotine patch if medically cleared.</description>
