    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the 30-day mortality outcome of the septic shock
      patients who are treated with ultrasound-assisted fluid management using change of the
      inferior vene cava (IVC) diameter during respiratory phases in the first 6 hours compared
      with those treated with &quot;usual-care&quot; strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock (SS) is globally prevalent in with high mortality rate.The current focuses on
      initial treatment of this condition emphasize on the early recognition, prompt administration
      of antibiotic, and restoration of hemodynamic with aggressive fluid resuscitation and
      vasopressor. Regarding the initial fluid therapy, administration of empirical crystalloid at
      the dose of 30 ml/kg is recommended in the guideline. The ultrasound-assisted management of
      shock patients has been introduced in the past decade and now is widely used. By using the
      measurement of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter change during respiratory phases, physicians
      can predict the fluid responsiveness in the shock patients and tailor the fluid therapy
      during the resuscitation.Unfortunately, clinical outcome related to the use of this concept
      in SS resuscitation has not been well studied. Inadequate resuscitation with fluid therapy is
      related with higher mortality; however, fluid bolus or positive fluid balance that may result
      from &quot;too aggressive&quot; fluid administration is also associated with increased mortality in SS
      patients. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the 30-day mortality outcome of the
      SS patients who were treated with ultrasound-assisted fluid management using change of the
      IVC during respiratory phases in the first 6 hours compared with those who were treated with
      &quot;usual-care&quot; strategy. The secondary outcomes were to compare the rate of the need for
      mechanical ventilation (MV) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) as well as the 6-hours
      lactate clearance and the change in Sequential Organ Failure (SOFA) score in 72 hours.

    <description>The treating physician will promptly assess the IVC diameter to obtain the collapsibility index (IVCCI) (or distensibility index, IVCDI) of an eligible patient. A previous study showed that IVCCI &gt; 40% were strongly associated with fluid responsiveness. Accordingly, the patient will be given 10 ml/kg of bolus of 0.9% normal saline solution (NSS) each time when the IVCCI &gt; 40% is discovered and serial measurements will be done after each intravenous bolus is achieved until the IVCCI &lt; 40 % during our protocol. Prompt empirical antibiotics will be given to the patients within one hour before the treatment allocation.</description>

    <description>Patients will be promptly and empirically treated by 30 ml/kg loading of NSS in this treatment arm. After the NSS bolus, treatment with either the additional intravenous fluid or a vasopressor is given depended on physicians' discretion during the 6-hour study period. Prompt empirical antibiotics will be given to the patients within one hour before the treatment allocation.</description>
