  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the ability of vorinostat to induce the
      transformation of Class 2 uveal melanoma cells into a cell phenotype that resembles normal
      melanocytes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept, single-center, open-label study of an FDA-approved drug,
      vorinostat, a Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, for patients with Class 2, high-risk
      uveal melanoma with localized eye tumors. The primary aim is to test if vorinostat can
      transform aggressive class 2 uveal melanoma cells into cells that look more like normal
      melanocytes as observed in the laboratory. Uveal melanoma patients that meet the inclusion
      criteria outlined in this protocol will be consented and asked to provide a fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) biopsy of their uveal melanoma primary tumor. This biopsy will be submitted
      for gene expression analysis to determine the phenotype of the tumor. A total of 10 patients
      who meet the criteria of Class 2 uveal melanoma and no radiologic evidence of metastases will
      be treated with 400 mg of vorinostat daily for 15 days. On Day 15, patients will be asked to
      provide a second FNA biopsy prior to receiving the standard of care local definitive therapy
      either plaque radiotherapy or enucleation.

                  disorder of bilirubin metabolism (e.g., Gilbert syndrome) will be eligible at the
                  discretion of the treating physician and/or the principal investigator.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation until 4 months after completion of study drug
             administration. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             test at time of enrollment. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree
             to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study therapy,
             and 4 months after completion of study drug administration.

         10. Willingness to comply with all the visits and procedures (including providing all
             biological specimens) as required by the protocol and the informed consent form (ICF).

         11. Ability to understand the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the
             research study and to provide valid written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Definitive therapy of the primary uveal melanoma by either surgery or radiotherapy

          2. History of another malignancy except for those who have been disease-free for 3 years,
             or patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and/or
             patients with indolent secondary malignancies not requiring active therapy, are
             eligible. Consult the study Principal Investigator if unsure whether second
             malignancies meet the requirements specified above.

          3. Any major surgery or extensive radiotherapy, chemotherapy with delayed toxicity,
             biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 21 days prior to initiation of study
             therapy.

          4. History of prior vorinostat use.

          5. Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days

          6. Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to vorinostat (i.e. HDAC inhibitor hydroxamates such as
             panobinostat and belinostat).

          7. A QT interval corrected (QTc) for heart rate using the Bazett's formula (QTcB) ≥ 480

             to the increased risk of thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding.

          9. Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with vorinostat.

         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             the study requirements.
