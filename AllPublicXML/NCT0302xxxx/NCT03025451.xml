  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from participants in Athens CHIP classes from May 2011 to present will be analyzed to
      evaluate the differences in outcomes based on: 1) gender, 2) age, 3) whether a household
      member participated in the class with them.

      Participants had health screens before and after completing the class. The data from the
      health screens that will be utilized for comparison will include: body mass index (BMI),
      blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar and lipid levels.

      Identified data will be provided to the PI from Live Healthy Appalachia/CHIP on a flash
      drive. This data will be password protected by the research team. The data will consist of
      two different databases, 1) identifiers with health screen results, 2) identifiers with
      demographics (age, gender, household member in class). The researchers need data from both
      databases for this study. Each participant has been assigned a unique participant number by
      CHIP.

      The databases will be combined by the research team, allowing the demographics to be matched
      to the biomarkers. The unique CHIP identifier will be maintained as a participant ID, while
      all other identifying data will then be deleted from the database.

      The data will then be analyzed for relationships by a statistician.

    <description>CHIP focuses on food, diet, activity, exercise, stress management, by viewing videos, cooking demonstrations, discussion, and exercise. Intervention nurtures intelligent self-care through enhanced understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, and risk factors associated with chronic lifestyle related diseases. The primary focus is the consumption of plant-based whole foods, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. The goal was to keep dietary fat below 20% of total calories, daily intake of added sugar below 10 tsps, sodium below 2,000 mg, and cholesterol below 50 mg. High fiber food intake (&gt;35 g/day) is encouraged, and flexibility exercises, a daily walk of 30 minutes or 10,000 steps and daily use of stress management techniques.</description>
