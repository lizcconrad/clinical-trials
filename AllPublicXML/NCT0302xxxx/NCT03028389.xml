  <brief_summary>

      To investigate whether limb remote ischemic preconditioning (LRIP) could safely decrease the
      incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery.

    <textblock>
      Remote ischaemic preconditioning may confer the cytoprotection in critical organs. We
      hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would safely decrease the
      incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery.The primary outcomes
      included the incidence of delirium in the first 7 days after surgery using the Confusion
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale.The quality of recovery over a
      6-month period was evaluated as well.Secondary endpoints included length of stay in the
      hospital after surgery (from day of surgery to hospital discharge), occurrence of
      non-delirium postoperative complications, and all-cause 6-month mortality.

    <description>The limb RIPC protocol was applied after anesthetic induction and before the start of surgery. The limb RIPC was induced by placing a blood pressure cuff on the left upper arm of patient for three inflating-deflating cycles: 5 min inflating to 200 mmHg followed by a 5 min reperfusion with deflating the cuff.</description>
