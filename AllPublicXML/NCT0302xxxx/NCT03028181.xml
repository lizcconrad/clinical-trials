  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess and analyze some selected antioxidants and laboratory parameters
      during hospitalization of the patients with acute pancreatitis. It will allow to better
      understanding of the mechanisms of disease and the development of better diagnostic,
      treatment and monitoring.

      It is an observational diagnostic study and does not involve any additional administration of
      medicinal substances, modification of treatment or dropping the use of routine methods of
      treatment of a disease. The study procedure includes detailed personal medical history as
      separate document like as a routine medical interview, and three times taking a small amount
      of venous blood (together about 15 ml), in the first, third, and seventh day of
      hospitalization (in the case of longer hospital treatment).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients were classified into the group of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP)
             due to clinical symptoms (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain with
             tenderness on palpation on physical examination), personal interview and clinical
             method used in the diagnosis of pancreatitis - laboratory tests (elevation in serum
             lipase or amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal) and
             characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging (contrast-enhanced computed
             tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transabdominal ultrasonography).
             In patients with characteristic abdominal pain and elevation in serum lipase or
             amylase to three times or greater than the upper limit of normal, no imaging was
             required to establish the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In patients with abdominal
             pain that was not characteristic for acute pancreatitis or serum amylase or lipase
             levels that were less than three times the upper limit of normal, or in whom the
             diagnosis was uncertain, the investigators performed abdominal imaging with a
             contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan to establish the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis
             and to exclude other causes of acute abdominal pain. In patients with severe contrast
             allergy or renal failure, the investigators performed an abdominal MRI without
             gadolinium.

          -  The volunteers classified as healthy based on the research conducted by clinicians of
             primary medical care (control group)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  other accompanied diseases than acute pancreatitis (the patients groups)

          -  Individuals of the control group with diagnosed disease as well as alcohol and drugs
             abusers
