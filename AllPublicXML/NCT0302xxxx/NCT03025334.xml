    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) has been classically regarded as a &quot;movement disorder&quot;, so earlier
      work has focused on treating motor symptoms only. As PD patients now have longer life
      expectancy, the relatively slowly progressing cognitive deficits (compared to their motor
      deficits) have become one of the major challenges. Approximately 80% of PD patients
      eventually become demented. Therefore cognitive dysfunction is one of the most significant
      factors affecting the quality of life of patients with PD. While dementia in Parkinson's
      disease is routinely treated by cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil and rivastigmine),
      their efficacy on mild cognitive impairment found in non-demented PD is questionable.
      Alternative approaches have been proposed including transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) but no consensus has been reached. This can be attributed mainly to: (1) imprecise
      knowledge of the underlying functional circuitry mediating this disease manifestation and (2)
      inter-individual variability. Here, the investigators will utilize a novel personalized
      network analysis approach to elucidate on the underlying mechanisms of the effect of tDCS on
      cognitive dysfunction in non-demented PD patients.

      It has been well documented that the caudate nucleus plays an important role in cognitive
      dysfunction found in PD. In the investigators' preliminary resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) study, they have shown that the connectivity of the right caudate
      nucleus is correlated to cognitive status of PD patients measured by the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA). The investigators hypothesize that tDCS on the left and/or right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may restore the functional connectivity of the right caudate
      nucleus which may in turn improve patients' cognitive performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet diagnostic criteria for idiopathic Parkinson's disease, defined as
             the presence of two or more of the cardinal clinical features of PD in the absence of
             known causes of parkinsonism such as encephalitis or neuroleptic treatment

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

          -  defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM-5)

          -  Age &gt; 40

          -  fluent in English.

          -  Patients' cognitive statuses will be evaluated by the participating neuropsychiatrist
             or a trained psychiatry or neurology resident.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with dementia (defined as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 18)

          -  Atypical parkinsonian features including myoclonus, apraxia, oculomotor abnormalities,
             ataxia, sensory loss, or pyramidal signs.

          -  Abnormal MRI

          -  metal implants or a cardiac pacemaker

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women (female subjects of child bearing potential will be
             screened for pregnancy before MRI imaging).

          -  severe dyskinesia that may interfere with the quality of the scan (e.g., dyskinesia
             involving head movement).

          -  severe hypertension.

          -  cardiovascular disease.

          -  Patients with a history of seizure, stroke, moderate to severe head injury, high
             intracranial pressure, severe headaches, or presence of other neurologic disease that
             may be associated with an altered seizure threshold; or concurrent medication use,
             such as tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic medications, or other drugs that are
             known to lower seizure threshold

          -  secondary conditions that may significantly alter electrolyte balance or lower seizure
             threshold.

          -  Family history of epilepsy.
