  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part observational study evaluating the feasibility of implementing an
      EHR-based model within a community oncology practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: The research team will use a sociotechnical work systems model, developed by
      researchers at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Systems Engineering Initiative for Patience
      Safety (SEIPS), to guide analysis of the work system barriers and facilitators to
      implementing an EHR-based care planning model in community oncology practice, collected from
      direct observations.

      Part 2: The research team will measure reach/maintenance (percentage of survivors with
      EHR-based survivorship care plans (SCPs) over a 9-month time period) and impact (pre/post
      survey of patient satisfaction and perceived care coordination).

Clinician seeking survivorship related information or resources through use of technology or discussion with other clinicians
Survivorship work or tasks performed by the clinician including adding, modifying or extracting information from the EHR and adding or modifying information in the care plan</description>
