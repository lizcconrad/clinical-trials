  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted reproduction treatment in patients with low ovarian reserve is a big difficult
      clinical problem. Growth hormone (GH) is crucial in the development of follicles since
      preantral follicle to ovulation and can promote steroid hormones and gamete formation,
      increase the granular cell sensitivity,and inhibition of follicular atresia. Latest research
      shows that GH can improve egg quality through regulating mitochondrial function of the
      oocytes and increase the rate of embryo euploid. It becomes a new argument in that promotion
      of clinical pregnancy rate in assisted reproduction treatment. GH applied in the field of
      assisted reproduction 30 years experience of applicable people, but drug dosage, drug
      intervention time continue to explore. 2015 China assisted reproductive stimulate ovulation
      medicine expert consensus recommend joint GH for poor ovarian response, repeated implantation
      failure patients and older patients assisted fertility treatment, but not on the specific use
      time limit, the daily dose of drugs and curative effect. How to maximize growth hormone
      potential advantage in improving the egg quality bothers the clinical doctors. We had a
      self-controlled retrospective analyses in growth hormone application and found that the
      average daily injections of GH dose 2 iu for 45 days can significantly improve the embryo
      quality in patients with low ovarian reaction. And now long-acting recombinant human growth
      hormone is available, which make it convenient for patients. A forward-looking experimental
      is expected to answer clinical practical problems and provide proper GH regimen for low
      ovarian responder.

      This study is a pilot study to investigate the effect of growth hormone in assisted
      reproductive technology clinical outcome of poor responder.

      Design: randomized controlled trial. Setting: Assisted reproductive technologies unit.
      Patients: patients diagnosed poor ovarian responder who is in accordance with the inclusion
      criteria, and not meet the exclusion criteria, who had repeated IVF treatment from Mar 2017
      to Aug 2019.

      Intervention: The comparison was made between GH group and the control group, both groups are
      conducted with the mini-dose GnRH-a long protocol for IVF treatment. GH group use Long-acting
      recombinant human growth hormone 14IU qw, until the day of hCG.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study is live birth rate. The secondary
      outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate, number of oocytes retrieved, fertility rate, normal
      fertilization rate, rate of transferable embryo and good quality embryo rate.
