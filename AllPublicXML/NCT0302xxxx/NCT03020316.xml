  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a pilot prospective randomized study of using a peer mentor with or
      without transcendental meditation as compared to usual care for women with newly diagnosed
      heart disease (coronary artery disease or CAD). The study is designed to explore the effect
      of these interventions on medication adherence and a number of additional outcomes. The
      results of this pilot study will be used in the design of larger future trials.

      The targeted population is for adult women with a new diagnosis of CAD made on the basis of a
      myocardial infarction or a coronary revascularization procedure requiring inpatient
      hospitalization at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

      The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of a peer mentor to usual care
      will improve self-reported medication adherence for women with newly diagnosed CAD as
      compared with usual care. The further addition of meditation sessions will provide further
      incremental benefit to medication adherence.

      This pilot study will be a prospective randomized study to evaluate the effects of
      peer-mentor intervention with or without transcendental meditation on medication adherence
      and other health behaviors on women with newly diagnosed CAD. Patients and mentors will be
      periodically surveyed about quality of life, health behaviors, medication adherence, medical
      knowledge, hospital admission and quality of the peer mentor-subject relationship. Subjects
      will have serial measurement of noninvasive biometrics (blood pressure, BMI) and routine
      serum markers (lipids).

      The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of a peer mentor will improve
      self-reported medication adherence for women with newly diagnosed CAD as compared with usual
      care. The addition of transcendental meditation sessions will further improve adherence.

      Arm 1 - Standard Of Care (SOC) Arm 2 - SOC and subjects will be matched with a peer mentor
      Arm 3 - SOC, subjects will be matched with a peer mentor, and will be trained in
      transcendental meditation

      Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months with surveys and
      assessments

    <description>Subjects will be assigned a peer mentor (a volunteer woman with CAD). After initial contact, the peer mentor and subject will be encouraged to communicate at whatever frequency or medium they deem most appropriate. This may include speaking by telephone, personal email or meeting in person. Mentors (and subjects if willing) will be asked to keep a log of such contacts, which will be provided to the study staff at interval reassessments.</description>
