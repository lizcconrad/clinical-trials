  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study serves to test a previously evaluated falls prevention intervention recommended by
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, entitled the Study of Accidental Falls in the
      Elderly (SAFE) Health Behavior and Exercise Intervention, to evaluate if the intervention is
      accessible to older adults with low vision receiving services from the Southeastern Blind
      Rehabilitation Center (SBRC). This study also serves to pilot a version of the SAFE
      intervention that has been adapted to be accessible for individuals with low vision at SBRC.

      This study serves to compare the comprehension and retention of individuals completing a
      version of the SAFE falls prevention intervention adapted for low vision versus individuals
      receiving the original intervention. One group of participants will complete the standard
      SAFE intervention format while another group will complete the same intervention with written
      materials adapted for those with vision loss. One intervention (either standard or adapted
      SAFE program) will be delivered at a time. The SAFE intervention is comprised of four,
      90-minute group classes that address environmental, behavioral, and physical falls risk
      factors. Classes involve lecture and group discussions as well as review of low intensity
      exercises. The adapted content is presented in large print with high contrast and has been
      rewritten on a lower grade level. A nutritionist, a physical therapist, a physician, 5 older
      adults with low vision, 10 low vision occupational therapist, and 5 health literacy experts
      provided feedback to strengthen the adapted intervention.
