  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of different types of diets (high and normal protein) on lean
      and fat mass, and strength in postmenopausal women practitioners of resistance exercise. Two
      groups will be created: high protein (1.2 protein g/body mass/day) and normal protein (0.8
      protein g/body mass/day). The same training will be performed for both groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups will undergo the same training protocol, differing only on the protein content of
      the diet. The dietary assessment will be made through the 24-hour food recall, being
      conducted at the beginning, middle and end of the intervention. Resistance exercises for
      upper and lower limbs will be performed, at 70% of one repetition maximum. SPPB, tug,
      6-minutes and 400 meters will be performed.
