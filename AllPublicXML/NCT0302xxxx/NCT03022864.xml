  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is an ideal model for study on acute pain changing into chronic pain. The
      functional imaging of magnetic resonance can reflect the extent and character of pain exactly
      and the structural imaging of it can be a sign of the change. By analyzing fMRI results of
      participants with acute pain and following them up for three months, the investigators expect
      to find objective indicators for acute pain changing into chronic pain and give preventive
      analgesia for people with high risk of chronic pain.

      The day before surgery, evaluate and choose patients according to inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Use the same anaesthesia and management and record information needed by the case
      report format. Patients are examined by fMRI on their brains during the first week after
      surgery. Follow up the patients after surgery for three months to find out whether they have
      chronic pain. The NRS, DN4, ID pain and QLQ-C30 are used for each patient.
