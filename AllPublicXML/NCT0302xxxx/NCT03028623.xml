  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of salpingectomy versus
      standard tubal ligation in women undergoing surgical sterilization at the time of a planned
      cesarean delivery. Salpingectomy is currently being investigated as a potential strategy for
      ovarian cancer prevention. While this procedure is currently performed during hysterectomies,
      its feasibility at the time of cesarean delivery is not well established.

      This randomized, prospective clinical trial will compare the two sterilization methods to
      demonstrate that salpingectomy compared with standard tubal ligation at the time of cesarean
      delivery will not result in increased operative time, blood loss or other complications. This
      study is necessary to promote salpingectomy as a standard sterilization method during
      cesarean deliveries.
