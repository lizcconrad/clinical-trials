  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-marketing study is to provide prospective evidence that the Magseed
      and SentimagÂ® is effective for lesion localization in patients undergoing surgical excision
      of a breast lesion and to summarize measures of product safety and performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, prospective, open label, single arm study of Magseed and Sentimag in
      patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion.

      Subjects will have the Magseed marker deployed under imaging guidance up to thirty days prior
      to surgery.

      The Magseed marker will be localized using the Sentimag system during surgery and removed
      with the lesion.

      After the lumpectomy procedure, subjects will be evaluated for safety and patient reported
      outcomes.
