  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the residual ridge resorption at anterior and posterior maxillary and
      posterior mandibular ridges among conventional complete dentures and implant overdenture
      wearers, and determine its association with the relative occlusal forces distribution,
      treatment groups and other patient variables.

    <textblock>
      A total of forty-six edentulous patients participated in this clinical study divided into two
      groups as following; complete denture group (CD) consists of 23 patients wearing conventional
      complete dentures and another Implant overdenture group (IOD) consists of 23 patients wearing
      mandibular complete overdenture with 2 implants. Two panoramic radiographs at baseline and in
      a follow-up to 7 years were used to measure the ratio of bone changes between the anatomical
      bone area and the reference area in the maxillary and the mandibular ridges. The occlusal
      contacts percentage of force in maximum intercuspation anteriorly and posteriorly were
      recorded for both groups by using T-Scan III system.

      Oral and written information in English or Malay language, regarding the study, was provided
      and written consent obtained before enrolment.
