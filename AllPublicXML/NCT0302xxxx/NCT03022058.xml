  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EarEEG system is a novel non-invasive, unobstructed and discrete method for recording EEG
      in which the signal is recorded using dry-contact electrodes embedded on a customised ear
      piece. One intended medical indication of the EarEEG system is the detection of
      hypoglycaemia-induced changes in the EEG in patients with type 1 diabetes. Currently, no
      studies exist investigating the detection of hypoglycaemic episodes by use of ear electrodes.
      While a finger prick test accurately measures the blood glucose level, it does not provide
      continuous measurements, and hence it is unreliable as a hypoglycaemia alarm. Recent studies
      have indicated that the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) reduces the risk of severe
      hypoglycaemia. However, some find these devices troublesome to use and utilisation of CGM has
      remained limited to date. Observational data show that only a small percentage of patients
      with type 1 diabetes are using CGM on an ongoing basis. Thus, there is a medical need for a
      reliable hypoglycaemia detection device which is easy and convenient to use.

      This clinical study aims at investigating the feasibility of measuring hypoglycaemia induced
      changes in the EEG by use of the EarEEG system.
