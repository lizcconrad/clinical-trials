  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and stress are obstacles of youth smokers to quit smoking, youth smokers who have
      positive thinking and less depression exhibited smoking abstinence at last. Adventure-based
      training could enhance participants' self-efficacy, self-esteem and also improve mental
      health of children and youth by doing physical activity. On the other hand, previous mobile
      phone-based studies (e.g. short messaging services or Apps) showed that the mental health of
      youth had been improved by providing instant response to the subjects when they felt
      depressed. A paper published recently proved that WhatsApp group could prevent relapse among
      the quitters. Thus, adventure-based training and social support in WhatsApp group would
      predict to reduce depression and stress so as to quit smoking in youth.
