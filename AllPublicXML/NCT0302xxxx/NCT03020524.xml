      A single cohort, open-label pilot study of the safety and tolerability of a single infusion
      of autologous CD4+ T-cells genetically modified with an HR2, C34-peptide conjugated to the
      CXCR4 N-terminus using a lentiviral vector in HIV-infected subjects. This is a first in human
      study of C34-CXCR4 T cells

    <textblock>
      There will be a single cohort in this study, which consists of subjects with well-controlled
      HIV replication on HAART. Within this cohort will be 3 escalating doses of T-cell infusions.
      A modified 3+3+3 dose-escalation design will be followed, in which the standard
      dose-escalation algorithm is stopped when a maximum of 9 evaluable subjects or a DLT stopping
      point has been reached, whichever comes first. At each dose level, three patients are
      treated. For dose levels 1 and 2, if 0/3 subjects have a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then
      the dose is escalated. If 1/3 has a DLT (grade 3 or higher unexpected, related adverse event
      [AE]) at a dose level then 3 additional patients are treated at that dosage before
      escalating, and if &lt;2/6 have DLT (i.e. no additional DLT is observed) then the dose is
      escalated to the next planned dose level and patients treated until a maximum of 9 evaluable
      subjects has been reached. The study will comprise of 5 steps:

      Step 1, all participants will undergo leukapheresis to obtain CD4 positive T-cells that will
      be genetically modified. A second leukapheresis and a rectal biopsy will provide baseline
      specimens to evaluate the size of the HIV reservoir

      Step 2, all participants will receive a single infusion of C34-CXCR4-modified CD4+ T-cells at
      one of 3 dose levels. The first 3 subjects will receive dose level 1 of 0.8-1x109 transduced
      CD4+T-cells. Provided no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is seen at the first dose level, the
      next 3 subjects will receive infusion at the 2nd dose level of 2.4-3x109 transduced CD4+
      T-cells. If no DLT occurs at that dose, the final 3 subjects will receive the 3rd dose level
      of 0.8-1x1010 transduced CD4+ T-cells. In the event of a DLT (grade 3 or higher unexpected,
      related AE) recruitment will be paused pending DSMB decision.

      Step 3 all participants will participate in a 16-week analytical treatment interruption
      beginning 4 weeks after T-cell infusion.

      At the end of step 3 all participants will undergo mini-leukapheresis and rectal biopsy

      Step 4 all participants will be advised to resume antiretroviral therapy and will be followed
      until plasma HIV RNA falls below the limit of detection.

      In Step 5 all participants will undergo leukapheresis and rectal biopsy at 52 weeks post
      infusion. At the completion of the study, participants will be asked to participate in a
      long-term follow-up study as required by regulatory authorities.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to enrollment and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA VL.

          -  Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent.

          -  Men and women ages ≥18 years.

          -  Clinically stable on their first or second HAART regimen. Changes while the patient
             HIV viral load is undetectable does not count toward the number of ART regimens used,
             only changes made for virologic failure (for example an individual switching from an
             NNRTI-based regimen to an integrase inhibitor based regimen while the HIV viral load
             is undetectable will still be in their first regimen). Site investigator anticipates
             that a fully active alternative ART regimen could be constructed in the event of
             virologic failure on the current ART regimen.The current regimen should have no
             changes within 4 weeks of enrollment. Subjects must be willing to continue on current
             antiretroviral therapy for the duration of the study except for the duration of the 16
             week analytical treatment interruption. (NOTE: changes to safely begin the treatment
             interruption -see section 5.6- are permitted).

          -  Screening HIV-1 RNA that is ≤50 copies/mL using a FDA-approved assay performed by any
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent within 30 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL using a FDA-approved assay for at least 24 weeks prior to
             enrollment performed by any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its
             equivalent.

               -  NOTE: HIV-RNA must be measured at least once in the last 24 weeks and at least 3
                  days before the screening measure. Single determinations that are between &gt;50 and
                  &lt;400 copies/mL (ie, blips) are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent
                  determinations are ≤50 copies/mL. The screening value may serve as the subsequent
                  determination ≤50 copies/mL following a blip

               -  NOTE: subjects who have participated in other trials using ATI's will be
                  permitted since detectable virus during the interruption does not represent
                  virologic failure. These subjects should have at least 24 weeks of VL &lt;50
                  copies/mL.

          -  Screening CD4+ T-cell count ≥450 cells/ mm3 within 30 days of enrollment.

          -  Started ART with nadir CD4+ ≥200 cells/ mm3.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to enrollment meeting
             the following criteria:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000 cells/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin:≥10.0(males); ≥9.5 (females) g/dL

               -  Platelet count: 100,000/mm3

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault

             cardiac disease or hemodynamic instability.

               -  NOTE: Subjects with a history of cardiac disease may participate with a
                  physician's approval.

          -  History or any features on physical examination indicative of a bleeding diathesis

          -  Have been previously treated with any HIV experimental vaccine within 6 months prior
             to enrollment, or any previous gene therapy using an integrating vector.

               -  NOTE: Subjects treated with placebo in an HIV vaccine study will not be excluded
                  if documentation that they received placebo is provided.

          -  Use of chronic systemic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents
             (e.g., interleukin-2, interferon-alpha or gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating
             factors, etc.) within 30 days prior to enrollment.

               -  NOTE: Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. If subjects
                  are prescribed a brief course of oral corticosteroids, the use should be limited
                  to less than 7 days. Use of steroids before apheresis and immune assessment blood
                  draws should be discouraged as it will affect white blood cell function.

          -  Anticipated use of aspirin, dipyridamole, warfarin or any other medication that is
             likely to affect platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the
             2-week period prior to leukapheresis

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry elevations in LFTs, bilirubin, lipase and serum
             creatinine due to HAART medication are not exclusionary, when in the opinion of the
             investigator, the abnormalities are not attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal disease.
             Such baseline elevations must be due to HAART.

          -  Receipt of vaccination within 30 days prior to enrollment.

               -  NOTE: It is recommended that subjects enrolling into this study should have
                  completed their routine vaccinations (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and
                  tetanus diphtheria booster) at least 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Have an allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin,
             DMSO and Dextran 40).
