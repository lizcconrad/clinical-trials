  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 3 dosage level, placebo-controlled, Phase
      1/2 study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      the monoclonal antibody GSK3196165, in Japanese subjects with active moderate-severe
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite treatment with methotrexate(MTX). The subjects will receive
      GSK3196165 in combination with methotrexate therapy for the 12 weeks of treatment period.
      Approximately 55 subjects will be screened to achieve 40 randomized subjects, so as to have
      approximately 10 subjects in each treatment group.
