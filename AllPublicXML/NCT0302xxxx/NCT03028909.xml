  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine if MEDI8852 administered with standard of care
      (oseltamivir) will reduce the time to normalization of respiratory function for adults who
      are hospitalized with influenza caused by Type A strains and to determine if MEDI8852 has an
      acceptable safety profile in adults who are hospitalized with influenza caused by Type A
      strains.

      The MEDI8852 phase 2b study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous
      (IV) dose of MEDI8852 or placebo administered in conjunction with oseltamivir in adult
      subjects who are hospitalized with influenza caused by Type A strains. Approximately 450
      subjects will be enrolled at study centers in North America, Europe, and other regions.

        must have evidence of not being pregnant upon enrollment and have a negative pregnancy test
        prior to administration of investigational product. Females of childbearing potential are
        defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
        oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy), premenarchal, or postmenopausal (defined as 12

        to receipt of a positive diagnostic test for influenza A; confirmed with positive rapid
        antigen test (supplied or approved by the sponsor), or confirmed with culture, polymerase
        chain reaction, or antigen testing at the study site. Onset of influenza symptoms ≤ 144
        hours (≤ 6 days) prior to randomization. Receiving supplemental oxygen. Expected to
        participate in the study through Day 60.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study drugs or interpretation of subject safety or study results.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study involving an investigational
             treatment. -Hospitalized &gt; 72 hours (&gt; 3 days) prior to receipt of a positive
             diagnostic test for influenza A.

          -  Receipt of &gt; 72 hours or &gt; 6 doses of treatment with a neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor.
             -Receipt of any investigational antiviral medications within 30 days prior to study
             drug dosing.

          -  Previous receipt of an influenza mAb within past 100 days.

          -  Pregnant or nursing female.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any components of
             the study drugs (MEDI8852 or oseltamivir).

          -  Diagnosis of influenza B infection within 14 days prior to randomization.

          -  Employees of the sponsor, clinical study site, or any other individuals involved with
