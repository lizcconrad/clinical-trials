      The purpose of this study is to investigate text messaging as a way to enhance
      mindfulness-based treatment for smoking cessation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot investigation of mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment
      incorporating between-session text messaging (&quot;iQuit Mindfully&quot;). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: Mindfulness-based Addiction Treatment (MBAT) or iQuit
      Mindfully (MBAT with the addition of between-session text messages).

      All participants will receive in-person group treatment based on the 8-week MBAT protocol in
      addition to nicotine patch therapy and self-help materials. Participants assigned to iQuit
      Mindfully will receive additional support via text messaging. Assessments will occur at
      baseline, at each of the weekly in-person visits, at end of treatment, and at 1-month
      follow-up. Feasibility, smoking abstinence, mindfulness practice, and indicators of tobacco
      dependence and psychological well-being will be assessed.
