  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic risk factors, such as central obesity, increase the risk of chronic diseases in
      adulthood and are prevalent in many university students. Increasing the knowledge about
      healthy nutrition and physical activity can positively impact students' lifestyle and prevent
      weight gain. This study aims to investigate the impact of online educational methods on
      nutrition knowledge, dietary habits, BMI, and physical activity in a sample of university
      students in the UK. Anthropometric measurements will be assessed and questionnaires will be
      completed at the beginning and at the end of the study. Written consent will be sought, the
      voluntary nature of participation will be emphasized while anonymity and confidentiality will
      be strictly maintained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is a randomized-controlled trial with two data collection points: one at the
      beginning and one at the end of the study. The study will include healthy students from two
      UK Universities, who they will be randomly assigned either to the intervention or to the
      control group. Participants in both groups will be asked to undertake measurements and
      complete questionnaires before and after the study. Measurements include the assessment of
      BMI, body fat, lean mass, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and blood
      glucose. In addition, nutrition knowledge and dietary habits will be estimated using online
      questionnaires as well as the level of physical activity using the IPAQ questionnaire and
      pedometers. Participants in the intervention group will receive access to an educational
      website including information about fruit and vegetables, fat, sugars, fast-food, meat, salt,
      meals and snacks, food labels, exercise, and alcohol. Each category will be linked to an
      online quiz-game that will include questions related to the topic. Students will be asked to
      play the games as much as they want to improve their knowledge scores. Access to the website
      and the games will be available for 10 weeks. Participants in the control group will receive
      no intervention. After 10 weeks, participants will be asked to undertake the same
      measurements and complete the same questionnaires as they did in the beginning of the study.
      The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an online educational intervention, using
      game elements, on the level of nutrition knowledge of students, as well as, whether any
      changes in knowledge impact changes in dietary habits, physical activity and weight-related
      factors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of nutrition knowledge (score in units)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The level of nutrition knowledge will be assessed using the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ) (Kliemann et al., 2016). The GNKQ includes questions with multiple choice answers, presented in 4 sections: section 1 is related to dietary recommendations, section 2 is related to food groups, section 3 is related to health food choices and section 4 is related to diet, disease and weight association. Each correct answer gets a point (otherwise null) and the maximum score is 88 for the overall questionnaire, 18 for section 1, 36 for section 2, 13 for section 3 and 21 for section 4.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary habits (score in units)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary habits will be assessed using the questionnaire of Leppälä, J. et al. (2010). The questionnaire includes 18 questions in relation to whole grain products, fat containing foods, dairy products, vegetables and fruits, sugar and meal pattern. A scoring system is provided as a manual to calculate the total score based on the answer given to each question. The total score represents diet quality (Index of Diet Quality) and can be ranged from 0-15, with 9 or less points indicating a poor diet quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity [vigorous activity (days/week, minutes/week), moderate activity (days/week, minutes/week), walking (days/week, minutes/week), sitting time (minutes/week)].</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short) (Craig et al., 2003). The questionnaire includes questions regarding 1) days per week and time (minutes) spent on one of those days doing vigorous activity, 2) days per week and time (minutes) spent on one of those days doing moderate activity, 3) days per week and time (minutes) spent on one of those days walking and 4) time (minutes) spent the last week sitting on a week day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To calculate waist-to-hip ratio a measuring tape will be used to measure waist circumference (cm) and hip circumference (cm) separately. Waist circumference (cm) will be measured at the midpoint between the top of the iliac crest and the lower margin of the last palpable rib in the mid axillary line. Hip circumference (cm) will be measured at the largest circumference of the buttocks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure (mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic (mmHg) and diastolic (mmHg) blood pressure will be measured using an electronic sphygmomanometer.
