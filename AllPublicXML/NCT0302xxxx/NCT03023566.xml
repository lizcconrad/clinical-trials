    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of Dotarem enhanced MRI in
      pediatric and neonatal population who are referred for contrast enhanced MRI at Phoenix
      Children's Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phoenix Children's Hospital (PCH) performs approximately 200 contrast enhanced MRI procedures
      per month. Recently PCH changed its MRI contrast agent from the linear contrast agent
      Magnevist to the macrocyclic contrast agent Dotarem. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      safety and efficacy of Dotarem enhanced MRI in pediatric and neonatal population who are
      referred for contrast enhanced MRI at PCH.

      The study is designed as a single center, open label comparison of unenhanced MRI with
      Dotarem enhanced MRI in pediatric patient population (&lt;18years). The comparison will be
      performed intra-individually by 3 independent blinded radiologists. Overall, the study
      population will consist of 250 pediatric patients who are indicated for contrast enhanced
      MRI. The safety follow-up period will be 24 (+/- 4) hours post injection of Dotarem and
      includes the assessment of physical examinations and vital signs as well as the assessment of
      AEs.

    <description>Overall lesion visualization and characterization, based on assessment of (1) lesion border delineation, (2) internal morphology and (3) degree of contrast enhancement. All images from &quot;Pre&quot; (unenhanced MRI) and &quot;Paired&quot; (unenhanced + enhanced) MRI will be evaluated independently by the 3 independent readers and are rated on a 3-point scale as unevaluable (0), seen but imperfectly (1) or seen completely/perfectly (2). The primary statistical analysis compared unenhanced MRI to combined MRI. The efficacy of Dotarem is expected to be demonstrated for at least 2 out of 3 readers independently meeting a statistically significant positive difference between the mean &quot;Paired&quot; score and the mean &quot;Pre&quot; score at patient level for each co primary endpoints.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient under 18 years of age who is scheduled for contrast enhanced MRI
             examination as part of their standard of care.

          -  Patients who are willing to undergo contrast enhanced MRI procedure

          -  Patients who are willing to comply with the study procedures (e.g. being followed-up
             for 24 hours after MRI procedure).
