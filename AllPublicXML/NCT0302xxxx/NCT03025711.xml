  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall study objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Trastuzumab
      emtansine (T-DM1) and Pertuzumab under real-world disease conditions in the Spain, and
      specifically in patients treated under compassionate use or early access program
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional, non-comparative, observational cohort study /
      registry in the Spain. The study design will reflect real-life clinical management of
      patients with HER2-positive MBC. Type and frequency of actual patient visits and all
      evaluations will be done as for routine clinical practice.

      The analysis of the efficacy and safety results obtained in patients receiving pertuzumab or
      TDM1 in those early access systems is of utmost importance. These real-world patients with
      advanced breast cancer may have different characteristics than those enrolled in clinical
      trials and clinicians must often extrapolate into therapeutic decisions not fully supported
      by a robust evidence.

        This study will include a cohort of approximately 700 adult patients from the Spain with
        HER2-positive metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer and who are
        treated with Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) or Pertuzumab under compassionate use or early
        access program. The decision to initiate use of Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and
        Pertuzumab is made independently by the participant and their health care provider and is
        not mandated by the study design or protocol.
