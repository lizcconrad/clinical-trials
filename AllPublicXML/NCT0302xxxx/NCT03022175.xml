      This Phase 1 First in Human study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single and multiple intravenous doses of SPR741 when administered to
      healthy adult volunteers. This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose,
      multi-cohort trial. A total of ninety-six healthy volunteers will be enrolled in 12 cohorts.
      The study will be conducted in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase, followed by a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. In SAD, participants will receive one dose of SPR741 or
      placebo. In MAD, participants will receive multiple doses of SPR741 or placebo for 14
      consecutive days. In both parts, sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of
      SPR741.

    <description>SPR741 is a novel chemical entity known as a potentiator that specifically interacts with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria to increase the membrane's permeability. This increase in permeability allows Gram-positive antibiotics to enter and kill the cell.
SAD cohorts: Subjects will receive single doses of SPR741 over 60 minute IV infusion. Planned doses to be studied are 5, 15, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg.
MAD cohorts: Subjects will receive SPR741 over 60 minute IV infusion three times a day (TID). Four dose groups will be studied. Doses will be determined by assessing SAD cohort data.</description>

    <description>SAD: Double-blind dosing will occur in cohorts 1 through 8. Six participants will receive single doses of SPR741. The dose escalation steps may be altered following review of the safety data upon completion of each cohort.
MAD: The Safety Management Group will evaluate the safety and tolerability data obtained for the participants in Cohorts 1-5 to determine the appropriate dose level of intravenous q8h dosing of SPR741 to be utilized in the first cohort (Cohort 9) in the MAD. Dosing will commence on the morning of Day 1. Three doses will be administered per day at approximately 8 hours apart. Daily dosing will continue for a total of 14 consecutive days.</description>

          1. Healthy adult males and/or females (of non-child bearing potential), 18 to 55 years of
             age (inclusive) at the time of screening;

             or Day -1, including:

               1. Physical examination, vital signs. Vital signs include temperature, heart rate,
                  respiratory rate, and blood pressure;

               2. Triplicate ECGs without QTcF interval duration greater than 450 msec obtained as
                  an average from the triplicate screening and pre-dose Day 1 ECGs after at least 5
                  min in a fully supine quiet rest;

               3. Hemoglobin/hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count greater
                  than the lower limit of normal range of the reference laboratory;

                  analytes without any clinically significant abnormality.

             Discussion between the PI and the SMR is encouraged regarding any abnormal laboratory
             value that is outside of the normal range during the pre-dose period.

          4. Be non-smokers (including tobacco, e-cigarettes or marijuana) for at least 1 month
             prior to participation in the study;

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent;

          6. Be willing and able to comply with all study assessments and adhere to the protocol
             schedule;

          7. Have suitable venous access for drug administration and blood sampling;

          8. If female, be of non-childbearing potential (e.g. post-menopausal as demonstrated by
             FSH or surgical sterilization i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy). Provision of

             control (such as an intrauterine device, diaphragm, oral contraceptives, injectable
             progesterone, subdermal implants, or a tubal ligation). This criterion applies to
             males (and/or female partners) who are surgically sterile and must be followed from
             the time of first study drug administration until 30 days after the final
             administration of study drug.

             spirits, or 100 ml wine) within the previous 5 years;

          6. Use of any prescription medication or any over-the-counter medication, including
             herbal products and vitamins within 7 days prior to randomization;

             blood of more than 500 mL within 30 days prior to randomization, or receipt of a blood
             transfusion within 1 year of study enrollment;

          9. Participation in another investigational clinical trial within 30 days prior to Day 1;

         10. Any other condition or prior therapy, which, in the opinion of the PI, would make the

             requirements of the study protocol or likely to be non-compliant with any study
             requirements.
