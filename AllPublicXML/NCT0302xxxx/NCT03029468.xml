  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a
      multimedia computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) program for reducing SCD pain
      symptoms in a single-arm pilot pragmatic clinical trial. The investigators will recruit 40
      SCD patients with chronic pain and/or on chronic opioid pain treatment and randomize them 3:1
      to two groups (cCBT and e-Education respectively), randomizing unevenly in order to best
      gather feasibility data for the cCBT. Both groups will use a mobile app to track daily
      pain/mood. The cCBT group will receive sessions of the CALM-SCD program to complete via
      mobile device and will have weekly follow-up with a care coach. The Education group will
      receive online education modules to complete via mobile device and will also have weekly
      follow-up with a care coach. The primary outcomes of the trial include feasibility
      (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability (sessions
      completed) of the CALM-SCD program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide the experiences and data that will support a later,
      larger, and adequately powered effectiveness trial of the CALM-SCD, computerized cognitive
      behavioral therapy (cCBT) program. The investigators hypothesize that CALM-SCD is acceptable,
      i.e., patients will use it (90% of users will complete the first lesson within 3 months; 70%
      will completeÂ³4 sessions; 50% of users will complete all 8 sessions), and feasible, i.e., the
      investigators can recruit &gt;80% of patients approached, and &gt;90% of enrolled participants will
      complete their 6-month follow-up assessment. The investigators will also have preliminary
      data on effectiveness and hypothesize that 70% of cCBT users will achieve a &gt;50% decline in
      daily pain ratings.

      The investigators will enroll 40 SCD patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
      (UPMC) with chronic pain to either CALM-SCD or pain education (eEducation) and follow them
      for 12 months. Implementation of routine stress/pain screening in the UPMC Adult Sickle Cell
      Clinic allows investigators to identify patients with SCD who have chronic pain as indicated
      by self-report &quot;I have had pain nearly every day for at least 3 months&quot; or have been
      prescribed long-acting opioids for pain.

      Following confirmation of protocol-eligibility and informed consent, investigators will
      provide all patients with a large-screen smartphone (unless the patient owns their own
      compatible large-screen smartphone) with a symptoms diary app, and GPS tracking features
      pre-installed; this will allow investigators to track pain and mood as well as any opioid or
      non-opioid pain treatments used by patients, and steps traveled.

      Patients enrolled in the CALM-SCD group will complete at least 4 1-hour cCBT sessions over 3
      months using their study-provided smartphone. Because cCBT programs are less effective
      without a human support component, participants will also be introduced to a care coach
      (master's level student tech who will receive training in CBT) who will contact them on a
      weekly basis by phone/text for up to 3 months. The care coach will reinforce CBT materials
      and encourage engagement. Participants will have continued access to the program after first
      3 months, but care coach support will only be available on an as-needed basis.

      Patients enrolled in the eEducation group will receive pain education through online modules
      that they will be asked to complete using their study-provided smartphone. Each module
      includes learning tasks, a reading assignment, and a short quiz based on material from
      Painaction.com. The education group will receive care coach contact on the same schedule as
      the cCBT group. The care coach will provide supportive therapy and encouragement to complete
      modules and apply the lessons to their daily life.

      Partients who are not eligible or who are not randomized into one of the intervention arms of
      this study will serve as a comparison group to ensure we are treating a representative sample
      of patients. Further, patients who were eligible but were not randomized into one of the
      intervention arms will serve as a usual care control group.

    <description>Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain via an integrated smartphone and web-based skills training program: The training plan will help users learn how to recognize negative thoughts and emotions, use cognitive skills and problem-solving, and apply coping behaviors such as distraction, activity scheduling, and relaxation. The cCBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition and learning through practice; thus, the program involves regular homework assignments, and follow-up with the care coach and social network about issues faced and what skills were or could be used. This intervention is consistent with the tailored behavioral services patients would receive individually or as a group when working with a psychologist or behavioral pain specialist.</description>
