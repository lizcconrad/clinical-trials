      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multi-centre study to evaluate bone gain after
      horizontal augmentation using creos xenogain bone graft substitute. Patients included in the
      study are in need of a GBR procedure prior to implant placement in the premolar and posterior

      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multi-centre study to evaluate bone gain after
      horizontal augmentation using creos xenogain bone graft substitute.

      Patients included in the study are in need of a GBR procedure prior to implant placement in
      the premolar and posterior region of the mandible.

      Primary endpoint include the bone gain after 8 months healing period, while secondary
      endpoints includes histological analysis 8 months after performance of the augmentation
      procedure as well as Implant survival, implant success and marginal bone levels evaluated
      over a period of 1 year after definitive prosthetic delivery.
