    <textblock>
      TCR-T cell therapy experienced a breakthrough for treating tumors in recent years. Phase I /
      II trial of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and melanoma conducted by
      the Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute showed that 61% Synovial cell sarcoma and
      55% melanoma had therapeutic responses. Another report of a phase I / II clinical trial for
      multiple myeloma showed that 20 patients received high affinity anti-NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1
      specific TCR-T treatment, 16 of them (80%) had the average progression-free survival of 19.1
      months with minor side effect. These achievements indicate that TCR-T cell therapy can target
      a variety of tumors including solid tumors without any severe side effects found in CAR-T
      trials.

      This study is mainly focused on tumor testis antigen (Cancer-Testis Antigen), because it is
      not expressed in normal cells. NY-ESO-1 antigen is commonly expressed in 10-50% of melanoma,
      lung, liver, esophageal, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid and ovarian cancer cases, 60% of
      multiple myeloma cases, and 70-80% of synovial cell sarcoma. Approximately 700,000 new cases
      of lung cancer are identified each year in China, 70% of them die within one to two years
      after diagnosis due to the lack of effective treatment. To address that unmet needs, our
      TCR-T treatment targets non-small cell lung cancer with NY-ESO-1 antigen expression.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of TAEST16001 (TAEST: TCR Affinity
      Enhancing Specific T cell Therapy, autologous T cells transduced with affinity enhanced
      NY-ESO-1 TCR) cell therapy in subjects with NSCLC who have received prior therapy for their
      disease but their disease has progressed or relapsed.

      This Phase 1 study is designed as a cell dose escalation trial evaluating the safety of
      TAEST16001 T cell therapy in subjects with NSCLC who have received prior therapy for their
      disease but the disease has progressed or relapsed. Anti-tumor activity and other exploratory
      objectives will be assessed. Subjects enter from a Screening Protocol and are positive for
      HLA-A2*02:01 and have tumor that express NY-ESO-1. The subjects will be evaluated DLT and MTD
      using a modified 3+3 cell dose escalation design to determine the cell dose range. Subjects
      will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 1g/day on days -3 and -2
      followed by infusion of dose of about 5×109 TAEST16001.

      Subjects will stay in hospital for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 0) through Day 7, and then weekly until week 4 and then at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks
      and every 3 months until progression of their disease.

NYESO-1 TCR-T cell are prepared via lentiviral infection. DLT was administered in a dose escalation test according to the 3 + 3 design. Three days prior to infusion of TCR-T cell, subjects receive cyclophosphamide treatment at dose 1 g/day for 2 days and take a rest for one day before infusion.
Patients, who receive an infusion of TAEST16001, will remain in the hospital to be monitored for adverse events until they have recovered from the treatment.
Patients will have frequent follow-up visit to monitor the persistence of modified T cells and efficacy of the treatment.</intervention_model_description>
