      The goal of this project is to refine and test a novel emotion-regulation based psychosocial
      intervention designed to reduce suicide risk in middle-aged and older adults (50-90 years
      old) who have been discharged after a suicide-related hospitalization (i.e. for suicidal
      ideation or suicide attempt). Suicide rates in this group are alarmingly high, and reducing
      suicide rates in at-risk populations is a major NIMH priority.

      The goal of this project is to refine and test a novel emotion-regulation based psychosocial
      intervention designed to reduce suicide risk in middle-aged and older adults (50-90 years
      old) who have been discharged after a suicide-related hospitalization (i.e. for suicidal
      ideation or suicide attempt). Suicide rates in this group are alarmingly high, and reducing
      suicide rates in at-risk populations is a major NIMH priority.

      The Investigators developed a novel psychosocial intervention called &quot;Cognitive Reappraisal
      Intervention for Suicide Prevention (CRISP),&quot; which aims to improve cognitive reappraisal
      ability (i.e. the ability to modify the appraisal of a situation to alter its emotional
      significance) (target), and reduce suicide risk (outcome). The conceptual framework views
      suicidal ideation and behavior as failed attempts to regulate negative emotions and by
      improving cognitive reappraisal, an effective emotion regulation strategy, the investigators
      expect to reduce suicide risk. This theory is supported by studies showing that unsuccessful
      attempts to regulate negative emotions and decreased cognitive reappraisal are associated
      with increased suicidal ideation and behavior.

      The R61 phase is a proof-of-principle phase and its goals are to optimize CRISP and test its
      engagement with cognitive reappraisal. Certified social workers will administer 12 weekly
      sessions of CRISP to 40 middle-aged and older adults (50-90 years old) after a
      suicide-related hospitalization. Research assistants, unaware of the study aims, will conduct
      assessments at study entry (hospital admission), discharge, 6 and 12 weeks post-discharge.
      Target engagement will be assessed with electrocortical measures (i.e. late positive
      potential, LPP) during a standard pictured-based stimuli and our novel cognitive reappraisal
      paradigm.

      The R33 phase aims to provide further evidence of target engagement of the optimized CRISP in
      a larger sample, evaluate the relationship of cognitive reappraisal with suicide risk as
      measured with Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale-C-SSRS and estimate implementation
      parameters for a large-scale clinical trial. A different sample of 90 middle-aged and older
      adults (using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as for the R61 phase) will be randomized
      (3 to 1) to CRISP (N=60) or to Supportive Therapy (ST, a control treatment not designed to
      improve emotion regulation) (N=30). Assessments will be conducted on admission, at discharge,
      and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks post-discharge. Primary aims are: 1) CRISP participants will show
      improvement in cognitive reappraisal ability from discharge to end of treatment; and 2)
      improvement in cognitive reappraisal ability will be associated with suicide risk over 24
      weeks.

    <description>Cognitive Reappraisal Intervention for Suicide Prevention (CRISP) is a psychosocial intervention aimed to reduce suicide risk in middle-aged and older adults who have been hospitalized for suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. CRISP offers a combination of emotion regulation techniques, including changing the subject's perspective or the way he/she thinks to improve emotion reactions. Additional strategies taught include the provision of environmental adaptation tools (notes, checklists, calendars, etc), phone calls, and a tablet application called WellPATH.</description>
