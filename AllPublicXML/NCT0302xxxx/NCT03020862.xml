      The purpose is to evaluate exercise performance in patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) after supplementing with higher doses of dietary NO3-, compared to
      previous studies, as beetroot juice for seven days. The secondary purpose is to evaluate
      oxygen consumption of submaximal cycling, amendments in blood pressure, and physical activity
      level.

      The purpose is to evaluate exercise performance in patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) after supplementing with higher
      doses of dietary NO3- compared to previous studies, as beetroot juice for seven days. The
      secondary purpose is to evaluate oxygen consumption of submaximal cycling, amendments in
      blood pressure, and physical activity level.
