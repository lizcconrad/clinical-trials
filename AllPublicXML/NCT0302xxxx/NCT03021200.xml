    <textblock>
      The use of fluorescence for real-time evaluation of organ and tissue vascularization and
      lymph node anatomy is a recent technology with potential for the surgical treatment of
      cancer. The real-time analysis of tissue vascularization allows immediate identification to
      the surgeon of areas with greater or lesser blood circulation, favoring surgical decision
      making and prevention of complications related to tissue ischemia (necrosis, dehiscences and
      infections). It is a technology with potential application in the areas of Digestive Surgery,
      Repairing Plastic Surgery in Oncology, Head and Neck Surgery. In addition, fluorescence can
      be used as a method to identify lymph node structures of interest in the oncological
      treatment of patients with urologic, gynecological and digestive tumors.

      Introduced by Pestana et al. In the late 2000s, the perfusion mapping system through
      intraoperative indocyanine assisted laser angiography (SPY Elite System © LifeCell Corp.,
      Branchburg, N.J.) had its initial application in repairing surgery after breast cancer
      treatment. The method proved to be useful in the prevention of ischemic and infectious
      complications in cancer surgery. Pestana, in a prospective clinical series of 29
      microsurgical flaps used in several reconstructions, observed a single case of partial loss
      of the flap, the present technology having a relevant role in intraoperative decision making.
      In the same year, Newman et al. The first application of the system in breast reconstruction
      surgery. In an initial series of 10 consecutive cases of reconstruction with microsurgical
      flaps, in 4 cases the system allowed the intraoperative identification of areas of low
      perfusion, thus changing the surgical procedure. According to the authors, there was a 95%
      correlation between indocyanine laser assisted and subsequent development of mastectomy skin
      necrosis, with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91%. Similarly, Murray et al. Evaluated
      the intraoperative perfusion, however, of the areola-papillary complex in patients submitted
      to subcutaneous mastectomies with satisfactory results in terms of predictability of
      cutaneous circulation. Other authors in larger clinical series and evaluating other
      procedures have observed valid results in terms of prevention of complications.

      Vascular perfusion of anastomoses and fistulas following bowel surgery for cancer remain a
      serious and common complication. These fistulas can be caused by insufficient perfusion of
      the intestinal anastomosis. Intraoperative angiography with indocyanine assisted laser can be
      used to visualize the blood perfusion following intravenous injection of the indocyanine
      green contrast. Several groups reported the ability to assess blood perfusion of the
      anastomotic area after bowel surgery. Although they studied retrospectively, Kudszus and
      colleagues described a reduction in the risk of revision due to fistula in 60% of patients
      whose anastomosis was examined using laser fluorescence angiography compared to historically
      paired patients without this method. The same principle can be used to evaluate the tubulized
      stomach to be transposed to the cervical region after subtotal esophagectomy.

      Currently, fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node mapping has been studied in breast cancer
      as well as investigative character in colorectal cancer, skin cancer, cervical cancer, vulvar
      cancer, head and neck, lung cancer, penile cancer, cancer Endometrial cancer, gastric cancer
      and esophageal cancer.

      These early studies demonstrated the feasibility of this methodology during surgery.
      Comparison of laser fluorescence images on blue dyes indicate that fluorescence images can
      replace blue dyes because they exceed them due to increased tissue penetration depth and
      absence of staining in the patient and cleaning of the operative field.

      To date, there are no clinical studies involving intraoperative perfusion mapping and
      identification of lymph node structures with the SPY Elite System © system or other platforms
      (Pinpoint or Firefly) in Brazil that evaluate the Brazilian population. In an objective way
      the influence of this technology as predictive in the better or worse evolution of the
      oncologic surgery as well as in the prevention of the local ischemic complications by means
      of intraopeal change of conduct
