  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitals, doctors and caregivers, who take care of increasingly heavy patients, are faced
      with ever more complex situations, particularly in the case of severe, progressive, and
      incurable pathologies.

      Thanks to their willingness and expertise, these care providers try to guarantee the
      continuity and quality of care for both patients and patients in a palliative situation.
      Nevertheless, these same actors testify to the complexity they encounter in the care of
      patients in advanced or terminal stages, especially since the concept of &quot;palliative care&quot;,
      which was often erroneously reduced during the Any end of life and therefore death, remains a
      source of questions, contradictions, even resistances.

      In this context, how do physicians and caregivers appropriate palliative care? How do they
      react to the complexity and intensity of certain situations? Do they have specific
      expectations of help or support in the face of certain difficulties? Are there actions to be
      carried out and developed to make the aid given to these actors of the palliative approach
      more efficient?

      These are the topics that the HUS palliative care service proposes to explore through a study
      of physicians and caregivers working in HUS services for adult patients with LISP.
