  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the precision of semi-automated lumen boundary
      identification from coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) by current version of
      HeartFlow software and the impact on fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) by using optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) as reference standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of cCTA and OCT was conducted under blind in independent organizations.

      After unblinding the cCTA and OCT case identification number, the OCT image was co-registered
      to cCTA data.

      After co-registration of cCTA and OCT lesion locations, the minimal lumen area (MLA) was
      detected with both modalities. FFROCT was calculated using OCT-updated models in which
      cCTA-based lumen geometry was replaced by OCT-based lumen geometry.

      Lesions were grouped according to their severity of calcification (using Agatston score) and
      minimum lumen diameter.
