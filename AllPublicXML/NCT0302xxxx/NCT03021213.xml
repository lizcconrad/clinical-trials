  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is an outpatient coronary artery disease (CAD)
      therapy that involves the cyclical inflation/deflation of cuffs wrapped around the lower
      extremities. However, the possible benefits of EECP in patients with heart failure (HF) (New
      York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II to IV) and cardiomyopathy are unclear.
