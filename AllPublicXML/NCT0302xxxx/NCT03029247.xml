  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomized, parallel-group study in hemodialysis-dependent (HD)
      subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), designed to compare the
      effects of daprodustat to epoetin alfa on blood pressure (BP).

      After a 4-week screening and a 4-week erythropoesis-stimulating agent (ESA) washout period,
      on Day 1 subjects will be randomized 1:1 and stratified by prior ESA dose before they undergo
      Acute Challenge 1, a single dose challenge to compare the acute effects on BP of the highest
      planned once-daily maintenance dose of daprodustat (24 milligrams [mg]) to the highest
      starting dose of epoetin alfa (100 international units [IU]/kilograms [kg]). This will be
      followed by an 8-week hemoglobin (Hgb)-maintenance period, where doses of either daprodustat
      or epoetin alfa will be administered and adjusted. At the end of Hgb maintenance period, on
      Day 57 an Acute Challenge (number 2) will be repeated utilizing the same treatment as of
      Acute Challenge 1; there will be a follow-up visit within 14+/-3 days after completing
      treatment. The total duration of subject involvement is up to 18 weeks (Screening to
      Follow-up).
