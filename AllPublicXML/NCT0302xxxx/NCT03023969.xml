  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is very common problem, variable modalities have been introduced to control
      such problem. One of the emerging modalities is the ozone - oxygen (O2-O3 ) mixture that
      could reduce the herniation disk size and inflammation.

      Intervertebral disc herniation is the most common problem which induces low back pain LBP.
      The number of patients seek surgical and or alternative therapy increases. The rate of
      re-operation is between 7-9% at 2 years and increases up to 10-25% at ten years
      postoperative.

      Epidural injections with local anesthetics and steroids are one of the most commonly used
      interventions in managing chronic low back pain and lower extremity pain of various causes.
      However, despite their extensive use, debate continues on this medications effectiveness due
      to the lack of well-designed, randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness
      of epidural injections in general, and caudal epidural injections in particular.

      Ozone in mixture with oxygen has been justified in multiple studies have been done, this
      study aims to evaluate variable doses of this mix upon patient satisfaction, pain alleviation
      over 12 month follow up period .
