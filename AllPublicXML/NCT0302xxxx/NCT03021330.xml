    <textblock>
      In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, newly-diagnosed AML patients will
      be randomized into 2 groups. In the experimental arm, patients receive DA induction regimen
      with intermediate dose of cytarabine. In the control arm, patients receive DA regimen with
      standard dose of cytarabine.The efficacy of induction therapy containing intermediate dose of
      cytarabine is evaluated and adverse events associated with treatment are recorded.The primary
      end point is overall survival.

      In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, newly-diagnosed AML patients will
      be randomized into 2 groups. In the experimental arm, patients receive DA induction regimen
      with intermediate dose of cytarabine at at a dose of 100mg/㎡/d on day 1-4 and 1g/㎡/Q12h on
      day5-7. In the control arm, patients receive DA regimen with standard dose of cytarabine at a
      dose of 100mg/㎡/d on day 1-7. Patients receive consolidation therapy containing high-dose
      cytarabine after achieved complete remission. Stem-cell transplantation is permitted for
      patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. The efficacy of induction therapy
      containing intermediate dose of cytarabine is evaluated and adverse events associated with
      treatment are recorded.The primary end point is overall survival.
