  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether the behavioural/structural interventions of Stepping Stones and
      Creating Futures can reduce the incidence of intimate partner violence in urban informal
      settlements amongst young people. Half the participants will receive the interventions, while
      the other half will be in a control wait-list, only receiving the intervention after final
      data collection.
