          1. Pregnant or lactating females, or females of child-bearing potential (i.e., those who
             are not chemically or surgically sterilized or who are not post-menopause) or those
             who are not willing to use a medically accepted method of contraception that is
             considered reliable in the judgement of the investigator throughout the duration of
             the study or females who have a positive pregnancy test at screening.

          2. Weight of less than 135 lbs.

          3. Currently prescribed and taking clopidogrel (generic or Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta)
             or prasugrel (Effient) or have taken within the past 10 days.

          4. Current medications:

               1. PAR-1 antagonist (vorapaxar/Zontivity) or within the last month.

               2. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as cilostazol (Pletal).

               3. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or within the last ten days (Integrilin,
                  Aggrastat, ReoPro).

               4. Adenosine reuptake inhibitors such as dipyridamole (Aggrenox, Persantine)

               5. Coumadin.

               6. Heparin including low molecular weight heparin.

               7. Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban).

               8. Direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., hirudin, bivalirudin, dabigatran.

               9. Concomitant therapy with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as atanazavir,
                  clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazadone, nelfinavir,
                  ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconizole,

               6. Sustained uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt; 180mmHg or
                  diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt; 100mmHg

               7. History of hemorrhagic disorders that can increase the risk of bleeding (e.g.,
                  hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease)

               8. Patients that have used within 30 days of screening, any oral or parenteral
                  anti-thrombotic agent.

               9. Platelet count less than 100,000 mm3 or hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dL

          6. Contraindication or other reason that ticagrelor or prasugrel should not be
             administered (e.g., known hypersensitivity to medication or any medication component)

          7. A history of alcohol and/or substance abuse that could interfere with conduct of the
             trial.

          8. Known active or recurrent hepatic disorder (including cirrhosis, hepatitis B and
             hepatitis C, or confirmed (ALT/AST) levels &gt; 3 times ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 2 times
             ULN at screening.

          9. Scheduled for revascularization (e.g., PCI, CABG) during the study period.

         10. Any Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) event within the past 6 months.

         11. Participation in another investigational drug or device study within 30 days of
             dosing.

         12. Any acute or chronic unstable condition in the past 30 days or other condition which,
             in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk or influence
             the result of the study (e.g., active cancer, risk for non-compliance, risk for lost
             to follow-up).
