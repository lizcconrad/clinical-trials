  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop a model for return to work (RTW) for patients sick
      listed due to stress related mental disorders, which takes into account each patient's
      specific situation; includes the workplace, and is well adapted to the Swedish primary care
      setting.

      In late 2016, general practitioners (GPs) and rehabilitation coordinators at both public and
      private primary care centers will be offered a one-day training about work and workability
      for patients with stress related mental disorders. Also, the participants will be trained in
      a specific method that includes the patient's employer early in the rehabilitation process

      The project has a quasi-experimental and longitudinal design. The intervention will be
      conducted on 15 different primary care centers, which will be matched with a comparison
      group. Return to work for 500 patients will be analyzed using registry data, 6, 12 and 18
      months after sick-listing. The hypothesis is that patients who are sick-listed at primary
      care centers that completely or partially implemented the specific method on average will
      return earlier to work than patients sick-listed at primary care centers that did not
      implement the method.

      Alongside studying if the intervention has an effect on the patients' RTW over time, the
      investigators aim to investigate the mechanisms explaining the effects and the individual and
      organizational level (primary care units) circumstances necessary for these mechanisms to be
      triggered. To gain deeper knowledge about mechanisms and context, the investigators will
      conduct interviews with the treatment staff and collect registry data about the primary care
      units.
