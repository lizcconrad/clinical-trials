  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clomiphene (Clomid) is a drug FDA approved to treat female infertility, however, it is often
      used by men in an off-label setting to both treat male infertility and in a multitude of
      sports disciplines to increase performance.

      Study Objectives:

        -  Determine detection windows for clomiphene and its metabolites in urine following a
           medium-term administration

        -  Understand the effect of clomiphene administration on luteinizing hormone (LH),
           follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and serum testosterone (T) concentrations in a
           longitudinal manner

        -  Identify changes in current steroidal module of Athlete Biological Passport

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clomiphene, pharmaceutically prepared as clomiphene citrate, is a selective estrogen receptor
      modulator (SERM) with a therapeutic indication to treat female infertility. Though
      FDA-approved only for use in women, clomiphene is often prescribed off-label to males to
      treat male infertility and secondary hypogonadism due to its ability to increase serum
      testosterone levels. Numerous clinical studies have documented both the effectiveness for
      these indications and safety of clomiphene administration in males. Increasing the
      concentration of circulating testosterone can have additional effects, including the
      enhancement of performance in sports. As such, clomiphene is already abused by athletes in
      several sporting disciplines, including mixed martial arts, cycling, and bodybuilding.
      Therefore, clomiphene is a prohibited substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code .
      Though the parent compound and metabolites of clomiphene are directly detectable in routine
      anti-doping screening, the urinary detection window and the effect of clomiphene
      administration on other anti-doping markers are unknown and thus the foci of this study.

    <time_frame>Day 30 through end of study participation (minimum, Day 72)</time_frame>
    <description>A baseline for LH, FSH, and T will be established using the average of serum concentrations calculated from the pre-administration samples from each subject.The change in serum concentrations following administration will be compared against the baseline values.</description>

    <description>◦The steroidal module of the Athlete Biological Passport, a statistical model used to identify doping, will be used for data analysis in this study.As stated in the ABP Operating Guidelines, the steroidal compounds described above are considered for the ABP steroidal module in addition to the following ratios: T/E, A/T, A/Etio, 5aAdiol/5βAdiol, and 5aAdiol/E. Changes in the urinary steroid concentrations and these ratios will be assessed over the course of the study.</description>
