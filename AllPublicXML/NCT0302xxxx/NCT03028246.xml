      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, feasibility study is to develop
      data to evaluate the safety and feasibility of ExAblate 4000 treatment of benign intracranial
      tumors which require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.

      Indication of Use: Ablation of benign intracranial tumors in children and young adults which
      are ExAblate accessible.

      This is a feasibility study intended to collect data for use in the development of future
      studies. As such, no formal statistical hypothesis or hypothesis testing is proposed. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of managing benign brain
      tumor size using ExAblate 4000 treatment of progressing benign intracranial tumors which
      require clinical intervention in pediatric and young adult subjects.
