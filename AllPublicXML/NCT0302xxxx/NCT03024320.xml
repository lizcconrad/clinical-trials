  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a theory-driven eHealth platform and innovative physical activity (PA) program
      referred to as movement-to-music (M2M) to deliver a customized, home-based PA intervention
      for adults with physical disability (PWD). Participants will be recruited through a large
      physical medicine and rehabilitation network of clinics specializing in treating patients
      with physical disability. Clinicians and their patients will be cluster randomized to one of
      three groups: a) M2M; b) M2M plus social networking (M2Mplus); and c) attention control (AC).
      Participants will be followed for 48 weeks to obtain objective measures on physical activity,
      fitness and self-reported measures on health at four time points. Participant physicians will
      receive information on their patients' progress (i.e., adherence and outcomes) across the
      48-week study period. The study will compare the effectiveness of M2M and M2Mplus in
      increasing physical activity and adherence compared to the AC group, estimate the
      improvements in health of M2M and M2Mplus compared to the AC group, and examine the mediators
      and moderators of the hypothesized treatment effect to understand for whom and how the
      intervention is effective. This multi-level, scalability study will strengthen our
      understanding of the potential benefits of eHealth to eliminate barriers to PA participation
      among PWD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study contains two intervention groups and one attention control group. Participation by
      each individual will included recruitment by their physician, screening and providing
      consent, baseline assessment, randomization to one of the three groups, adoption and
      transition phase assessments and post-assessment. The intervention will be delivered in three
      phases: (1) Adoption (weeks 1 to 12); (2) Transition (weeks 13 to 24); and (3) Maintenance
      (weeks 25 to 48). This phased approach will allow us to gradually adjust the dosage of the
      intervention and be able to capture the effects of the change in dosage. The study includes
      an eHealth platform to deliver M2M content (for the M2M and M2Mplus groups).

      ALL GROUPS (attention control, M2M, M2Mplus) All groups will be involved in baseline,
      3-month, and post-testing, which will be conducted at Spain Rehabilitation Center. These
      assessments will include short forms (SFs) developed by the National Institutes of Health
      (NIH) Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) which will be used to
      measure symptoms and quality of life indicators. Cardiorespiratory endurance will be measured
      by a 6-minute walk/push test while strength is measured by a grip strength dynamometer.
      Anthropometrics assessments include height, weight, BMI and waist circumference. Other
      assessments include social support, self-efficacy, self-regulation, outcome expectancies,
      barriers, physical function, and blood pressure. Copies of all assessment forms, surveys, and
      procedures are attached to this protocol.

      Physical activity and adherence are the key outcome measures. Physical activity will be
      estimated as steps per day using the Fitbit activity monitor. FitBit Flex sensors (the most
      popular version of commercial accelerometers) will be given to all study participants to
      track their rate of physical activity. Fitbit trackers use a 3-axis accelerometer to capture
      motions, making its activity measurements more precise than older, single-axis pedometers,
      which enable us to measure physical activity in PWD. The data, including personal health
      information (PHI) such as date of birth, height and weight needed for Fitbit setup,are
      uploaded to a protected server run by FitBit. This happens automatically and does not require
      any type of manual setup by the participant. The uploaded data will only contain the sensor's
      unique identification code and no personally identifiable information. The project's eHealth
      platform will connect to the FitBit servers through an application program interface, to
      locally host the data for further analysis. The project coordinator will have access to
      participants' activity data through their respective dashboards on the eHealth platform. The
      activity data, coupled with our advanced eHealth tracking routines, will enable the
      statistician to match the minutes of videos watched (dosage) and the change in physical
      activity (from FitBit steps). Participants will wear the FitBit accelerometer at all times so
      that the investigators can also track any changes in PA across a 24-hr period. To monitor and
      ensure that the FitBit sensor is worn, a monitoring system will be included that will send an
      automated text message or voicemail when a participant fails to wear the FitBit for more than
      12 hours. Adherence rate of a participant is defined as the percentage of 48 weeks a
      participant meets the study protocol's physical activity target. This will enable a
      comparable measure of adherence across the intervention and control arms.

      Participants in all three groups of the study will receive a phone-based/GoToMeeting weekly
      group coaching session led by the research team who has expertise in motivational
      interviewing strategies. The coaching sessions will follow the framework developed by our
      consultant exercise psychologist and used in our previous research with adults with physical
      disability. The calls will focus on the topics related to social support, overcoming
      barriers, and preventing relapse. These sessions will be held weekly during the Adoption
      phase (weeks 1-12), biweekly during the Transition phase (weeks 13-24), and monthly during
      the Maintenance phase (weeks 25-48). The physician and/or designated nurse would optionally
      join the coaching sessions, as and when necessary.

      M2M/M2Mplus GROUPS Participants in the M2M and M2Mplus group will receive the telehealth
      exercise training program. Our advanced eHealth platform designed for the National Center on
      Health, Physical Activity and Disability's (NCHPAD) 14-Weeks To a Healthier You program
      includes the foundational elements required for rapid deployment of the M2M content. The
      onsite M2M program currently at Lakeshore Foundation will be converted into a home-based
      package using extensive sets of movement routines that have been adapted for people with a
      range of physical/mobility disability. The M2M movement routines and the positions used to
      perform the movement routines will be prescribed based on participants' physical function.
      Each movement routine will be available in different choices of music type- to enable
      participants exercise with the music type they prefer.

      The M2M exercise videos are created to incorporate a holistic movement routine. Each exercise
      video includes five components: warm-up/range of motion exercise, strength exercise, aerobic
      exercise, functional strength/balance exercise, and cool-down/breathing. The movements are
      choreographed and adapted to target these components by experienced dance instructors.
      Exercise equipment, such as TheraBand or hand weights, can be used but is not required. All
      M2M movement routines will be reviewed by a physical therapist/exercise physiology
      co-investigator (Brown) for clarity and safety. The duration and movement complexity of each
      M2M session will be gradually increased from 30-minute sessions (5-min range of motion
      movement routine, 10-min strength movement routine, 10-min aerobic movement routine, 5-min
      cool down/breathing) to 60-min sessions (5-min range of motion movement routine, 10-min
      strength movement routine, 30-min aerobic movement routine, 10-min functional
      strength/balance routine, and 5-min cool down/breathing) throughout the Adoption and
      Transition phases of the intervention. The duration and movement complexity of the M2M
      sessions will be kept consistent during the maintenance phase (5-min range of motion movement
      routine, 10-min strength movement routine, 30-min aerobic movement routine, 10-min functional
      strength/balance routine, and 5-min cool down/breathing). Participants will be encouraged to
      work at their self-selected pace and comfort level, meaning that they can pause the M2M video
      anytime when they need a break and resume when they are ready. Participants do not have to
      complete the entire 50 minutes if they do not feel comfortable in doing so. Participants will
      provide feedback on a brief electronic form uploaded to the project coordinator on how they
      performed each set of M2M movement routines and what they liked/disliked about the movement
      routines, preferably within two hours after completing a M2M session.

      Each M2M session will start with brief exercise reminders such as maintaining good form or
      using the 'talk test' and encouraging participants to record a rating of perceived exertion
      score (RPE, 0-10) after each M2M movement routine to ensure that the intensity level is not
      outside the individual's comfort level. The participant can stop the video to rest at any
      time by touching their tablet/electronic device and then returning to the same segment so
      that 'dosing' remains consistent across all participants, albeit some participants who are
      less fit may need longer and more frequent rest intervals during the first few weeks of
      training. The eHealth platform will be password protected to enable detailed usage tracking.
      The M2M videos will be offered through a YouTube playlist player, which offers a seamless
      experience and can quickly be played and paused with a minimum number of clicks. To monitor
      the delivery of the videos, event tracking will be used. This will help the researchers know
      precisely which of the videos were viewed and for how long. The Rate of Perceived Exertion
      score will also be collected after every M2M session by sending automated notifications to
      the tablet asking the participant to rate the overall intensity of the session from 0-10.

      The Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physicians (or their designated nurse) will have
      access to a dashboard on their computer that will provide details of the level of
      participation and progress of their patients. The purpose of physician/nurse contact is
      twofold: (1) to encourage participants to take a more active role in discussing
      exercise-related issues with their doctor during clinical appointments; and (2) to improve
      exercise adherence by having physicians aware of their patient's level of PA for
      encouragement and support. Research has demonstrated that when physicians are actively
      involved in understanding and advising their patients on exercise, participants are more
      likely to exercise. This will be entirely optional for the physicians and nurse
      practitioners.

      At week 5 of the exercise program, individuals who are not engaging in exercise by using
      their Fitbit or clicking on videos, they will be contacted by research staff for a brief
      interview. The purpose of this interview is to understand lack of participation in the
      exercise intervention and perhaps re-engage the participant. At week 12 of the exercise
      program, individuals who are not engaging in exercise since week 5 by using their Fitbit or
      clicking on videos, they will be contacted by research staff for a brief interview. No
      identifiable information will be link the interview to the participant.

      M2Mplus GROUP ONLY For the M2Mplus group, a social networking system (SNS) will be integrated
      into the eHealth platform. SNS features will allow users to engage in conversation and other
      forms of social interactions (such as posting a rating score on a certain video or movement
      sequence they liked or disliked) across the eHealth platform. The participant's physician or
      designated nurse will also have access to the SNS to build a close asynchronous relationship
      with their patient. The social networking component of the platform will include all
      essential building blocks of social media including (1) identity; (2) sharing; (3) presence;
      (4) relationships; (5) reputations; (6) groups, and; (7) conversations,105 and will be
      repurposed and enhanced from the SNS developed for the NCHPAD 14 Weeks To A Healthier You
      online program, where users expressed a strong desire to be able to closely interact with
      fellow participants (see sample quote in box to the right). The SNS features of the
      intervention are developed using the popular open source SNS framework &quot;Elgg.&quot;
