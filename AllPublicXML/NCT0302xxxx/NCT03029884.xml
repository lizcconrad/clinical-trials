  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of three types of
      chronic neuropathic pain, i) Post Stroke pain syndrome ii) Phantom Limb pain and iii) Spinal
      Cord Injury Pain. Participants will be implanted with recording / stimulation electrodes in
      pain-related circuits of the brain. Relief of pain symptoms with stimulation will be studied
      in both groups. It is hypothesized that neural signals will correlate with pain states and
      that DBS can disrupt these pain states in both groups, perhaps with differences in underlying
      neural mechanisms for pain relief.

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of DBS in a small cohort of patients with
      chronic pain refractory to conventional treatments. The study will involve the implantation
      of a neurostimulator, the Medtronic Activa PC+S device, to examine the efficacy of two modes
      of DBS. Open-loop DBS will provide stimulation based on a pre-set schedule, whereas
      closed-loop DBS will deliver stimulation based on brain activity associated with pain states.
      The goals of this study are to identify neurophysiological correlates of elevated pain states
      and find DBS parameters that disrupt pain-related brain activity and provide pain relief with
      little or no side effects. The efficacy of pain relief on subtypes of pain syndromes will
      also be studied.

          -  Pregnancy or lack of regular use of contraceptives. Patients who become pregnant after
