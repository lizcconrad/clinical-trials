  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT). Participants in the
      intervention arm will participate in a 90-day adherence promotion program based on the theory
      of behavioral economics and administered through the Wellth mobile phone application.
      Subjects will be provided a CleverCap® Lite BLE C035 smart pill bottle (electronic monitoring
      (EM), device) containing a 90-day supply of aspirin (90 pills) and those in the intervention
      arm will be offered $150 for app-based medication check-ins, which consist of uploading daily
      photos of pills at the time of administration through the Wellth app. Subjects will have $2
      deducted from total rewards for each day that a medication check-in is missed. Subjects in
      the control arm will receive usual care and be monitored with the same EM device types used
      in the intervention arm.

      Medication adherence is a quantifiable parameter detailing when and how consistently doses
      are taken. Elements of medication adherence include: 1) the proportion of prescribed drug
      taken or %PDT (primary outcome); 2) the proportion of days with the correct number of doses
      taken; 3) the proportion of doses taken on time, in relation to a prescription-defined time
      interval between successive doses; 4) the distribution of inter-dose intervals; 5) the number
      of drug holidays; and 6) the longest interval between two doses [Vrijens et al. British
      journal of clinical pharmacology. 2012;73(5):691-705]. Medication adherence will be assessed
      in all participants using EM technology manufactured by CleverCaps®. Electronic Monitoring
      (EM) is more sensitive, reliable and valid than other measurement techniques such as pill
      counts, self-reports, or clinical judgment [Vrijens et al. Expert review of clinical
      pharmacology. 2014;7(5):633-644]. In this study the investigators will monitor a single drug,
      aspirin, in MI patients prescribed aspirin on hospital discharge.

      In addition to measurement of medication adherence using an EM device, the investigators will
      measure adherence using the Wellth cell phone app in the intervention arm. Participants in
      the intervention arm will also be asked to track their medication-taking habits by uploading
      photos of their medications at the appropriate dosage times using the Wellth app.

      Readmissions will be measured using the EMR and by interview to capture events outside the
      Penn system. Events will be classified according to timing (e.g. 30-day readmission) and
      cause (e.g. cardiac, all-cause). This study is not designed to detect a statistically
      significant difference in readmissions.

    <description>Subjects receiving the Financial Incentive and Mobile Phone App will each participate in a 90-day adherence promotion program. When users first log in to the app, the screen will display an incentive of $150 that participants have earned by enrolling in the program. Participants will be told that each missed medication check-in will result in a $2 deduction from the account before it is paid out. Each $50 portion (minus any penalties) of the $150 incentive will be paid out in 30-day installments by remotely crediting a previously distributed debit card. Adherence will be measured simultaneously by app photos and CleverCap(R) electronic monitoring (EM) devices filled with a 90-day supply of aspirin. Claims data will be analyzed for a 90 day period to account for any hospital admissions.</description>
