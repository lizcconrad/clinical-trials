      This is an exploratory, single-centre, investigator blinded, randomized, controlled,
      intra-individual study, involving subjects with psoriasis vulgaris.

      The objective is to evaluate, in a modified Dumas-Scholtz psoriasis mini-zone test, the
      safety and efficacy of CD10367 solution at 1% and 3% after a 3-week treatment period of once
      daily application.

      Study drugs will be applied in each subject once daily, 5 days a week during the first 2
      weeks and for 4 days the third week on 6 mini-zones located on at least 2 psoriatic plaques
      as described below:

        -  on 2 mini-zones pretreated by a keratolytic product, will be tested:

             -  CD10367 3% solution

             -  CD10367 solution placebo

        -  on 4 mini-zones non-pretreated, will be tested:

             -  CD10367 3% solution

             -  CD10367 1% solution

             -  CD10367 solution placebo

             -  Betneval 0.1% ointment
