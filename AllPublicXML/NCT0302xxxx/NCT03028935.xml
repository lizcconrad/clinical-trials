  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well an evidence-based exercise and nutrition program
      adapted for Latinas works in improving physical activity and dietary behavior in non-active,
      overweight, or obese rural Latinas. An exercise and nutrition program may reduce the risk for
      developing certain cancers, obesity, and chronic health conditions in Latinas who are
      non-active, overweight, or obese.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Adapt an effective evidence-based exercise and nutrition program to meet the needs of
      rural Latinas.

      II. Implement the adapted program in a rural Latina population. III. Evaluate feasibility and
      potential to improve physical activity and dietary behavior of the adapted program in a rural
      Latina population.

      OUTLINE:

      Phase I: Create a community advisory board to adapt Strong Women Healthy Hearts Program
      (SWHHP) using feedback on the existing SWHHP from Latinas residing in the community.

      Phase II: Conduct a small pilot study to assess effectiveness of the adapted program (one
      group pre-post design, with data collected at three time points).

      INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants undergo instructor-led exercise and nutrition education
      classes for 60 minutes each twice a week for 12 weeks.
