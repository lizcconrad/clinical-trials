    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) and serum leptin levels at the time of
      diagnosis of ovarian, primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer as well as vitamin D
      receptor mutation status (FokI SNP genotype). The study will evaluate the impact of vitamin D
      repletion on serum vitamin D levels, serum leptin levels, and treatment-related morbidity in
      these patients.

      This study will contain 2 cohorts: those with normal serum 25(OH)D and those with low serum
      25(OH)D at enrollment. The study will take place in women with ovarian, primary peritoneal,
      and fallopian tube cancer.

      Patients who have given written consent to enroll in the study will have a serum 25(OH)D
      levels, serum leptin levels, and vitamin D receptor FokI single nucleotide polymorphism
      analyzed at the time of diagnosis. Patients with vitamin D deficiency will be prescribed
      vitamin D supplementation according to current guidelines. Treatment with cholecalciferol
      will not impact cancer therapy. Participants treatment course information will be collected
      prospectively, but will not be dictated by this study. Serum 25(OH)D and leptin levels will
      be collected again at the completion of primary therapy, 6 months after the completion of
      primary therapy, and at the time of disease recurrence. If patients remain vitamin D
      deficient at any of these follow-up time points, they will be referred to an endocrinologist
      for further work-up and treatment of their vitamin D deficiency. Data collection will
      continue for up to 1 year after enrollment.

             bowel disease, celiac disease)

          -  Ability to tolerate oral medication

          -  Patients taking vitamin D at the time of enrollment without a diagnosis of vitamin D
             deficiency

             study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception.

          -  If applicable, patients must discontinue breastfeeding prior to study entry.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old

             cancer are allowed to participate if the endometrial cancer is International
             Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage 1B or less.
