    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility pilot study to initiate a research program to assess the effects of
      exercise on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, and pain in the
      hands and feet).

    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility pilot study to help obtain external funding for a larger study to
      assess the effects of exercise on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which is
      a dose-limiting and painful side effect of chemotherapy for which there are no established
      treatments. The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial in 40 cancer
      patients receiving chemotherapy where Arm 1 is 12 weeks of exercise during chemotherapy and
      Arm 2 is 12 weeks of nutrition education (control condition) during chemotherapy. The
      investigators will acquire data on CIPN via patient reports and clinical assessments as well
      as general pain and hypothetical mechanistic factors that may help explain how exercise may
      treat CIPN; these factors include measures of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,
      neuropsychological, and immunological function. The primary outcomes are related to the
      feasibility of identifying, recruiting, and obtaining complete data from research
      participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have non-metastatic cancer

          -  Be chemotherapy naïve

          -  Be scheduled to receive CIPN-inducing chemotherapy during the study (platinums, vinca
             alkaloids, taxanes, thalidomide, or bortezomib) for the duration of the intervention
             (12 weeks)

          -  Report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy at baseline (subject-reported severity of
             numbness and tingling in hands/feet of at least 1 on a 0-10 scale)

          -  Be able to perform the exercise intervention

          -  Be able to read English

          -  Be at least 18 years old (no upper limit on age)

          -  Be consistently right-handed in daily activities for consistency in reporting any
             lateralized effects from brain imaging

          -  Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receive surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy for their cancer during the study

          -  Be in the active or maintenance stage of exercise behavior (i.e., subjects must be
             sedentary)

          -  Have contraindications for MRI scanning (pacemaker, metal implants, pregnancy, etc. -
             note that most port-a-caths are safe for MRI scanning)

          -  Have physical limitations (e.g., cardiorespiratory, orthopedic, central nervous
             system) that contraindicate participation in maximal physiological fitness testing and
             a low/moderate intensity home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise
             program.
