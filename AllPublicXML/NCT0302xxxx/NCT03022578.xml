    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have glioblastoma or anaplastic
      astrocytoma (AA) that has relapsed (come back) after treatment and the study doctor thinks
      that it is in your best interest to receive chemotherapy for the disease. Additionally, the
      study doctor thinks it may be in your best interest to also have a surgical procedure called
      laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). LITT is a minimally invasive (using small
      incisions) surgery method that uses lasers to destroy tumor cells.

      For the procedure, the study doctor uses the NeuroBlate system to perform LITT in combination
      with MRIs and software models to focus the lasers on affected brain cells.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the NeuroBlate system in combination
      with lomustine can help to control glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) that has
      returned after treatment. The safety of the combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. The NeuroBlate system is FDA approved and commercially
      available for different types of brain surgery. Lomustine is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of brain tumors. LITT using the NeuroBlate System in combination
      with lomustine for the treatment of glioblastoma is investigational.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drug and procedure are designed to work.

      Up to 34 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug/Procedure Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be scheduled to have the
      LITT procedure. An MRI will be performed the day before the procedure to produce images of
      your brain to direct the study doctor to the areas that should be treated. The LITT procedure
      will then be performed the next day. You will sign a separate consent form for the LITT
      procedure that explains this procedure and its risks in more detail.

      You will then receive standard of care hospitalization after surgery. You will have an MRI
      within 48 hours after the procedure to check the status of the disease.

      You will have 14 - 35 days for recovery from the LITT procedure. You will not take lomustine
      during this period. After the recovery period, you will take lomustine by mouth on Day 1 of
      every 42-day cycle.

      You should take lomustine by mouth on an empty stomach before bed (2 hours after or 1 hour
      before food).

      Length of Treatment:

      You will take lomustine for up to 6 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug
      if the disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation in the study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On the day of the LITT procedure:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  You will have MRI scans to help the surgeon perform LITT.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  Tumor tissue will be collected to confirm the diagnosis and for biomarker testing during
           the LITT procedure.

      Within 2 days after the LITT procedure, you will have an MRI.

      About 14 days after the LITT procedure:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you can become pregnant,
           this will also include a pregnancy test.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

        -  You will have an MRI.

      When you begin receiving lomustine, you will have study visits in 42-day cycles.

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine test. If you can become pregnant,
           this will also include a pregnancy test.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

        -  You will have an MRI.

      On Days 15 and 29 of each cycle, blood ( about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 6 or 8 weeks, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are
      needed. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 6 weeks after stopping the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

        -  You will have an MRI scan.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months after your last dose of the study drug, the study staff will call and ask how
      you are feeling. This call should take about 5-10 minutes.

      If you stop the study drug for any reason other than the disease getting worse, you will
      visit the clinic every 3 months unless the disease gets worse. At these visits:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

        -  You will have an MRI.

             of recurrence will be established by biopsy and frozen section immediately prior to
             initiating LITT procedure. If findings on frozen section are not consistent with
             recurrence (glioblastoma or recurrent IDH-wildtype anaplastic astrocytoma), decision
             to proceed with LITT procedure will be at the discretion of the neurosurgeon (only
             patients with histologically-proven recurrent tumor will be evaluable for efficacy).

          2. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
