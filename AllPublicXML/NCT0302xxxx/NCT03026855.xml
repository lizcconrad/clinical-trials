      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous PRP injection
      in combination with topical application of PRP gel in treating chronic or non-healing ulcers
      on lower extremity using a rapid, intra-operative, point-of-care technology at the patient's
      bedside.

      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy is an innovative treatment that uses body's own cells to
      relieve pain and promote accelerated healing of Non-healing Foot Ulcer /Wound. The body's
      response to any tissue injury is to deliver platelets, which play an instrumental role in the
      normal healing process by secreting growth factors and attracting stem cells—critical
      components of the healing cascade.

      Any wound or ulcer on skin that has been present for 4-5 weeks duration, without healing is
      called a non-healing ulcer. Non-healing ulcers include venous, arterial, diabetic, pressure
      and traumatic ulcers. Cellular therapies using Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma provides new
      options for wound healing. The efficacy of the treatment has been proven in surgical
      applications, in the treatment of severe burns and in transplantation of cells and tissues.

      Local application of a solution of plasma enriched in platelets derived from the patient's
      blood intends to trigger the healing process in non-responsive chronic wound, increase the
      wound repair rate and reduce pain. PRP is a good option for non-healing wounds because it
      utilizes the body's natural healing processes to jump-start wound healing. Plasma which
      contains very valuable growth factors is separated from other blood components utilizing a
      point of care technology based on density gradient centrifugation. The platelet rich plasma
      is harvested and then activated by a mixture of human thrombin and calcium chloride for
      initiating the healing cascade followed by PRP injection directly into the ulcer/wound
      periphery or spread over a wound in the form of a PRP gel.

    <description>Autologous PRP prepared using the Res-Q™ 60 PRP system from patient's whole blood, will be injected subcutaneously around the periphery of the wound/ulcer.
Based on the wound size and area, autologous platelet gel obtained by spraying simultaneously equal volumes of PRP and activator solution (thrombin with calcium chloride) will be applied topically over the ulcer or wound.
Single dose of PRP injections and application of PRP gel will be administered, only on the day of treatment.</description>
