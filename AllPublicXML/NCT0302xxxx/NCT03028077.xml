  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a 8 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Forty five
      subjects were randomly divided into GS-3K8 (Ultrafiltered red ginseng extract) or GINst15
      (Hydrolyzed ginseng extract) or placebo group. The primary clinical outcome measure was the
      incidence of ARI. The secondary clinical outcome measure was the development and duration of
      ARI symptoms.
