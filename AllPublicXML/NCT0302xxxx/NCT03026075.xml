  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is multi-center study ,planned as a single arm, open trial, aimed at evaluating the
      performance and safety of a colon cleansing device during a colonoscopy procedure in a poorly
      prepared colons.

      Total of 47 subjects are planned to be enrolled at 3 clinical sites (1 in Germany and 2 in
      the Netherlands).

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be screened for study participation at a
      baseline visit(visit 1). Subject who is eligible to the study will required to follow a
      specific preparation instruction starting 2 days prior to the colonoscopy with the Motus
      Cleansing System (MCS) procedure.

      Following the procedure a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 48 hours (± 24 hours) and
      14 days (± 3 days) post MCS procedure to assess patient well-being and capture any Adverse
      Events (AE).

    <description>The MCS enables colon cleansing during standard colonoscopy using a standard colonoscope. The cleansing device, which is attached to the tip of the colonoscope and is connected to an external workstation, generates fluid jets within the colon thus dissolving the feces into small parts. The fecal matter &amp; fluids are drained through the evacuation pipe of the cleansing device into a collecting reservoir.</description>
