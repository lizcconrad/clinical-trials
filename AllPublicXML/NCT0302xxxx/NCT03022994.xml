  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently it has been reported that a consistent percentage of the general population consider
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named Non-Celiac
      Gluten Sensitivity' (NCGS). In a previous paper the investigators suggested the term
      'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity' (NCWS), since it is not known what component of wheat causes
      the symptoms in NCGS patients, and the investigators also showed that these patients had a
      high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity. Nowadays only few data are
      available on the histological characteristic of duodenal and rectal biopsies of NCWS
      patients. The researchers have just demonstrated a significant eosinophils infiltration of
      the duodenal and colon mucosa, and a significant infiltration of CD45+/CD3-CD14- cells in the
      rectal mucosa of NCWS patients upon wheat challenge, thus configuring a diffuse
      gastrointestinal &quot;inflammatory/immunologic&quot; pattern. The aims of the present study are: 1) to
      investigate the histological characteristics in duodenal and rectal biopsies between NCWS and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, and 2) to evaluate which site (i.e. duodenal or
      rectal) shows &quot;inflammatory/allergic&quot; features useful for NCWS histological diagnosis.

      Recently it has been reported that a consistent percentage of the general population consider
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named Non-Celiac
      Gluten Sensitivity' (NCGS). In a previous paper the investigators suggested the term
      'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity' (NCWS), since it is not known what component of wheat causes
      the symptoms in NCGS patients, and the investigators also showed that these patients had a
      high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity. The clinical picture of NCWS is
      characterized by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or
      constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and
      extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestations (headache, depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,'
      tiredness, dermatitis or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      and anemia). Nowadays only few data are available on the histological characteristic of
      duodenal and rectal biopsies of NCWS patients. The researchers have just demonstrated a
      significant eosinophils infiltration of the duodenal and colon mucosa, and a significant
      infiltration of CD45+/CD3-CD14- cells in the rectal mucosa of NCWS patients upon wheat
      challenge, thus configuring a diffuse gastrointestinal &quot;inflammatory/immunologic&quot; pattern. As
      regard to rectal lymphocytes, analysis of cytokine production demonstrated dominant
      spontaneous interferon (IFN)-γ production by these cells, which were further identified as
      innate lymphoid cells belonging to the group 1 (ILC1) population, expressing T-bet and
      producing IFN-γ, compatible to an innate immunity involvement in NCWS pathogenesis.
      Therefore, the aims of the present study are: 1) to investigate the histological
      characteristics and differences in duodenal and rectal biopsies between NCWS and IBS
      patients, and 2) to search for &quot;inflammatory/allergic&quot; features (i.e. eosinophils and/or
      lymphocytes infiltration) useful for NCWS histological diagnosis.

        The study will include consecutive adult patients with IBS-like clinical presentation,
        according to Rome III criteria, and a definitive diagnosis of NCWS, referred at the
        Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital of Palermo, Italy, and at the
        Department of Internal Medicine of the Hospital of Sciacca, Agrigento, Italy, between July
        2016 to February 2017, and sex- and age-matched subjects with IBS, enrolled at the same
        centers, as controls patients. All subjects will undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
        and proctoscopy at the Gastroenterology Unit at the University Hospital of Palermo.
        Duodenal and rectal biopsies will be evaluated at 2 centers: the Pathology Unit at the
        University Hospital of Palermo, Italy, and the Institute of Pathology, Spedali Civili
        Brescia, Brescia, Italy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To diagnose NCWS the recently proposed criteria will be adopted. All the patients will meet
        the following criteria:

          -  negative serum anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysium (EmA)
             immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies

          -  absence of intestinal villous atrophy

          -  negative IgE-mediated immune-allergy tests to wheat (skin prick tests and/or serum
             specific IgE detection)

          -  resolution of the IBS symptoms on standard elimination diet, excluding wheat, cow's
             milk, egg, tomato, chocolate, and other self-reported food(s) causing symptoms

          -  symptom reappearance on double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge. As the
             investigators previously described in other studies, DBPC cow's milk protein challenge
             and other &quot;open&quot; food challenges will be performed too.

        To diagnose IBS the standard Rome II (for retrospective patients) and Rome III (for
        prospective patients) Criteria will be adopted. None of these subjects improved on an
        elimination diet without wheat, cow's milk, egg, tomato, or chocolate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        NCWS diagnosis will be excluded by:

          -  positive EmA in the culture medium of the duodenal biopsies, also in the case of
             normal villi/crypts ratio in the duodenal mucosa

          -  self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it before entering
             the study

          -  other previously diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders

          -  other previously diagnosed gynaecological disorders

          -  nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder

          -  physical impairment limiting physical activity.
