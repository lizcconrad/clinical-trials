      Background:

      Researchers want to better understand brain processes related to fear and anxiety. They want
      to find out if transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a type of brain stimulation, can
      reduce anxiety.

      Objective:

      To see how TMS affects fear and anxiety through memory and attention tasks.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18-50 who are right-handed

      Design:

      Participants will be screened through another protocol.

      Participants in the pilot study will have 1 visit. This includes:

      Urine tests

      Questionnaires about mood and thinking

      Shock and startle workup: Electrodes are taped to the wrists or fingers. Participants will be
      shocked to find out what level of shock is uncomfortable but tolerable. They will hear loud,
      sudden noises through headphones.

      TMS: A coil is held on the scalp. A magnetic field stimulates the brain. Sometimes they might
      receive fake TMS. This feels the same as real TMS. They will perform simple tasks.
      Participants in the main study will have 2 visits within 2 weeks.

      The first visit includes:

      Urine tests

      Questionnaires about mood and thinking

      MRI: Participants lie on a table that slides into a scanner. They will be in the scanner
      about 1 hour. A computer screen in the scanner will tell them to perform simple tasks.

      The second visit includes:

      Shock and startle workup

      TMS

      Objective:

      To determine the effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on anxiety and anxiety-cognition
      interactions in healthy subjects. Toward this aim we will test the effect of transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) on two outcome measures: 1) Fear and anxiety during the threat of
      predictable and unpredictable shock (NPU threat test), and 2) Working memory (WM) related
      anxiety downregulation while performing the Sternberg WM task under threat of shock.

      Study population:

      The study population will consist of up to 184 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18-50.

      Design:

      This study will consists of two outpatient visits (1 MRI, 1 TMS visit). In this protocol we
      will explore the effect of TMS in two sub-studies in the second study visit. The two
      sub-studies will contain two separate tasks (NPU or Sternberg) during the study visit. The
      first visit (MRI) will consist of the same procedures for both sub-studies. Each subject will
      be assigned to only one of the sub-studies.

      Sternberg Task: Expose subjects to active or sham TMS over the right dlPFC during the
      Sternberg WM task. Subjects will have to maintain a series of letters in WM for a brief
      interval during blocks of safety and threat of shock.

      NPU Task: Expose subjects to active or sham TMS over the right dlPFC during the NPU threat
      test. Subjects will be exposed to blocks in which they are either 1) safe from shock
      (neutral), 2) at risk of shock delivered only during a cue (predictable), or 3) at risk of
      shock presented randomly (unpredictable).

      Outcome measures:

      In both studies the primary outcome measure will be anxiety-potentiated startle (APS), which
      is the increase in startle magnitude during periods of threat compared to periods of safety.
      We expect active, but not sham TMS to increase activity in the dlPFC, and therefore reduce
      APS in both studies.
