      This is a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of cataract surgery on the
      household socioeconomic status of cataract patients in rural area of Southern China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide and surgery is the only
      effective treatment. Previous studies show that visual impairment impacts the patient's
      socioeconomic status(SES). However, how cataract surgery affects the household SES in rural
      area of China has not been determined before.

      In the investigators study, cataract patients in rural area of Southern China will be
      enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. Cataract surgery will be performed in 4 weeks
      in intervention group, while performed at 1 year later in control group. The annual personal
      income by work, annual household income, hours in paid and unpaid work in the previous month,
      real estate ownership, household expenditures and quality of life will be investigated before
      and 1 year after surgery. Then, the difference in household SES and quality of life change
      between two groups at 1 year later will be assessed.

    <description>Health-related QoL score will be measured by EuroQol 5 dimensions with 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) and self-rated health (SRH). For each dimension, participants are asked to mark between 1: &quot;no problems&quot; to 5: &quot;unable to/extreme problems&quot;. Self-rated health using a vertical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with scores ranging from 0 (representing worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).

    <description>Vision related QoL score will be measured by Catquest-9S, which is a short form of Catquest questionnaire. The Catquest-9SF questionnaire comprises 7 questions for performing daily-life activities and 2 global questions about difficulties in general and satisfaction with vision (1= very great difficulty; 2= great difficulty; 3= some difficulty; 4= no difficulty).
