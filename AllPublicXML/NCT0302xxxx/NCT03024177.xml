  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vapendavir treatment of
      laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic HRV infection of the upper respiratory tract in
      allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplant subjects. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the effect of vapendavir on laboratory-confirmed HRV upper-respiratory tract infection in
      HSCT patients, as measured by viral load changes, worsening of upper respiratory tract
      infection (URTI) to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), duration of clinical symptoms,
      the occurrence of supplemental oxygen use, duration of viral shedding, hospital admission and
      duration of hospitalization, incidence of secondary bacterial infection, and mortality rates.
      Additionally, the safety and tolerability of vapendavir, and the vapendavir plasma levels
      achieved in the HSCT population, and the profile of viral resistance development will also be
      assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Allogeneic or autologous HSC transplant within last 6 months using any conditioning
             regimen, or HSC transplant subjects with current chronic graft vs host disease
             requiring systemic treatment at any time point post-transplant;

          2. Documented HRV in the upper respiratory tract (e.g., nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab,
             nasal wash) as determined by local testing;

          3. Subject presents to clinic reporting symptoms of a cold with the presence of at least
             2 symptoms associated with HRV infection and with an onset such that they can be
             randomized and dosed preferably within 72 hours but up to a 5 day window (120 hours)
             interval from symptom onset to study treatment initiation;

          4. Capable of giving written informed consent that includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Informed consent and subject
             assent for subjects below the legal age of consent will be documented by means of a
             written, signed, and dated ICF and assent document. For subjects below the legal age
             of consent, the parent/legal guardian will provide informed consent and subjects below
             the legal age of consent will provide assent to participate in the study, in
             compliance with local regulations;

          5. Subject is able to understand and comply with the protocol requirements;

          6. Ability to maintain adequate oral intake of medication;

          7. Female subjects who are not postmenopausal for at least 2 years or surgically sterile
             with complete hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy and male subjects, who are not
             surgically sterile via vasectomy, must agree to use a double barrier method of birth
             control, such as, a condom plus spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)

             prednisone or prednisone equivalent currently or within the 7 days prior to Study Day
             1;

          5. Subjects with diagnosis of a lower respiratory infection at Study Day 1, subjects with
             O2 saturation of less than 92% in the absence of supplemental oxygen, or those
             requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or non-invasive mechanical ventilation with
             BIPAP or CPAP at the time of randomization, and/or a history or current evidence of
