  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most common risk factor for development of stroke, congestive heart
      failure chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease in Sub Saharan Africa. The
      prevalence of hypertension will increase by 2025 in most parts of the world including
      Ethiopia according to World Health Organization.

      Physical inactivity has been identified as a stronger predictor of chronic diseases such as
      hypertension. Exercise as a lifestyle modification is beneficial to a wide variety of health
      conditions, specific to hypertension; the benefits of exercise have been promoted by a number
      of organizations and agencies including World Health Organization.

      According to the knowledge of the investigator there are no research works in relation to
      aerobic and resistance exercise effects among hypertensive patients generally in Ethiopia,
      and particularly in the area selected for the present research. Therefore the aim of this
      study is to assess the effect of aerobic and resistance exercises on selected anthropometric,
      biochemical and physiological variables among hypertensive patients in Hawassa University
      Referral Hospital.

      For eligible participants the requirements of the study will be explained and agree
      voluntarily to undergo the training and testing program. During orientation for each
      participant the risks, purpose, procedures and confidentiality of the requirement of the
      experiment testing as well as training protocol will be explained thoroughly prior to their
      written informed consent in their local language, and they have a full right to refuse from
      participating in this research or they have also the full right to withdraw from this study
      at any time they wish.

      After acquisition of informed consent and exclusion criteria eligible participants will be
      randomized to one of four groups. Sequence allocation will be done by an individual who do
      not know and have no contact with the study participants .

      Statistical analyses will be done using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS Version
      20). One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess differences between initial
      values of the four groups on all the variables measured. In addition, the effect of the
      experimental treatments on the anthropometric, biochemical and physiological variables will
      be examined by using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
