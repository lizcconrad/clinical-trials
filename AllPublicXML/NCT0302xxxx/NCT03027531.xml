      This study is a randomized controlled trial to test acceptability, feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of an interactive computer-based intervention with individualized
      feedback to promote sexual health in adolescents and young adults with assessment of
      behavioral and biomarker outcomes.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial to test acceptability, feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of an interactive computer-based intervention (ICBI) with individualized
      feedback to promote sexual health in adolescents and young adults. The intervention uses
      physician avatars and uses elements of motivational interviewing to elicit sexual risk
      behaviors and motivation to change risky behavior. Feedback includes instructive video
      modules. Participants were asked to identify one behavior to change and were reassessed at
      3-month follow-up for interim sexual behavior including condom and birth control use.
      Participants were tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pregnancy(females) at baseline and
      3-month follow-up.
