      The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) on speech performance in individuals with primary progressive apraxia of speech.

      Apraxia of speech (AOS) is a motor speech disorder affecting the programming of motor speech
      production. It is characterized by the impaired ability to coordinate the sequential,
      articulatory movements necessary to produce speech sound. It can result from insult to the
      brain, such as in stroke, or as the presenting sign/symptom of another neurodegenerative
      disease.

      TMS is a neurostimulation technique which has been shown to modulate cortical excitability in
      a non-invasive manner, and has been associated with positive outcomes in a variety of
      neurological and psychological disorders.There is evidence to support the role of TMS in
      individuals with primary progressive aphasias. In addition, there is a a case report
      suggesting an improvement in speech following TMS in an individual with primary progressive
      AOS. This study is being undertaken to further examine the role of TMS in primary progressive
      AOS.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults ages 18 and above who are able to consent

          -  Diagnosis of primary progressive apraxia of speech based on neurological evaluation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any uncontrolled medical condition expected to limit life expectancy or interfere with
             participation in the trial (i.e. unstable cancer, severe depression or anxiety by
             DSM-IV criteria)

          -  Abnormal stress test, as determined by the treating physician (unless cardiology
             clearance provided)

          -  Active substance abuse or alcohol dependence

          -  Uncorrected vision or hearing deficits that would preclude administration of the
             cognitive measures

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent

          -  History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute
             seizures

          -  History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, history of abnormal (epileptiform) EEG or
             family history of treatment resistant epilepsy

          -  No medication is an absolute exclusion from TMS. Medications will be reviewed by the
             responsible MD and a decision about inclusion will be made based on the following:

               -  The subject's past medical history, drug dose, history of recent medication
                  changes or duration of treatment, and combination with other CNS active drugs.

               -  The published TMS guidelines review medications to be considered with TMS

          -  Any metal in the brain, skull or elsewhere unless approved by the responsible MD

          -  Any medical devices (i.e. Cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, medication
             infusion pump, cochlear implant, vagal nerve stimulator) unless otherwise approved by
             the responsible MD

          -  Substance abuse or dependence within the past six months

          -  Absence of corticospinal functional integrity
