    <textblock>
      The evidence regarding effects of pain modulator like gabapentin on postoperative pain after
      sleeve gastrctomy is sparse. Gabapentin has anti-hyperalgesic and postoperative
      opioid-sparing properties.This study will highlight the effectiveness of preoperative use of
      gabapentin for postoperative pain management in morbidly obese patients.

      Research Problem: Laprocopic sleeve gastrectomy is the most common surgical procedure
      performed for reducing weight in morbidly obese patients. Laparoscopic surgery is considered
      to be less invasive than open surgery. The treatment of pain in obese patients is a
      challenge. Administering opioids, can have an increasing effect of respiratory depression in
      patients already at risk of sleep apnea. The evidence regarding effects of pain modulator
      like gabapentin on postoperative pain after sleeve gastrctomy is sparse. Gabapentin has
      anti-hyperalgesic and postoperative opioid-sparing properties. The analgesic effect of
      gabapentin appears to be related to the surgical procedure undertaken, a more
      procedure-specific evaluation is needed for different types of surgeries..

      Research Significance: This study will highlight the effectiveness of preoperative use of
      gabapentin for postoperative pain management in morbidly obese patients.

      Research Objectives: To evaluate the effect of preoperative administration of gabapentin on
      postoperative pain, postoperative morphine consumption and preoperative anxiety in patients
      coming for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

      Research Methodology:

      Inclusion criteria: ASA I and II, Age 18-50 years, either sex, Planned Surgical procedure
      laparoscopic sleeve garstectomy, BMI 30-45 . Exclusion criteria: Patients taking any
      sedative, tranquillizers , history of sleep apnoea ,contraindications to gabapentin, Methods
      Patients will be randomly assigned into two groups, Group-Control and , Group- Gabapentin of
      25 each. Anesthesia and postoperative course will be standardized. VAS scale will be used for
      assessment of preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain. Post operatively pain assessment
      and morphine consumption will be performed for 24 hours in PACU and ward
