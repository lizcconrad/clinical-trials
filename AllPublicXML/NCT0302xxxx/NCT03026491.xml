      The investigators aim to evaluate chewing function in children with repaired esophageal
      atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF). Patients with repaired EA-TEF will be evaluated
      for age, sex, type of atresia. Each child will be required to bite and chew a standardized
      biscuit. Chewing function will be scored with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS).
      The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) will be used to determine
      the tolerated food texture of children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diet of children with normal feeding skills includes a combination of liquid, semisolid
      and/or solid foods. Chewing dysfunction (CD) in children may cause restrictions in solid food
      intake, thereby may result in insufficient food intake and delay in growth. It is aim to
      evaluate chewing function in children with repaired esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal
      fistula (EA-TEF). Patients with repaired EA-TEF will be evaluated for age, sex, type of
      atresia. Each child will be required to bite and chew a standardized biscuit. Chewing
      function will be scored with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). The
      International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) will be used to determine the
      tolerated food texture of children.

    <description>Descriptive characteristics including age, height, weight, transition time to additional food, meal time, number of meals, initial teething time, and number of teeth, were noted. The presence of open mouth, open bite, high palate, gag reflex, and oral hygiene were scored as absent or present as an observational oral motor assessment. Chewing evaluation was performed and scored with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS). The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) was used to determine the tolerated food texture of children.</description>
