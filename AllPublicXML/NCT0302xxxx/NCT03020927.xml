      The purpose of this study is to examine whether adding a parent education component to an
      existing intervention (Reciprocal Imitation Training) results in improved outcomes for
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT) is a behavioral
      intervention designed to improve spontaneous imitation skills in young children with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Previous research suggests that it can be effective when used by
      trained therapists, teachers, siblings, and parents of children with ASD. However, it is
      unclear to what extent training parents to use RIT strategies in the home environment may
      enhance outcomes, compared to having therapists implement RIT individually with the child.
      The study will compare two different versions of RIT for young children with ASD: (1) two
      60-minute weekly sessions of therapist-implemented RIT and (2) one weekly 60-minute session
      of therapist-implemented RIT and one weekly 60-minute session of parent education about using
      RIT in the home environment. The investigators will examine child and family outcomes between
      these two intervention types. Outcomes examined will include: (1) spontaneous and prompted
      imitation skills in the child with ASD, (2) social communication skills in the child with
      ASD, (3) parent stress, and (4) parent and child behaviors during parent-child play
      interactions.

    <description>Children in the therapist-delivered condition will receive two, 60-minute long sessions of Reciprocal Imitation Training each week for ten consecutive weeks. These sessions will be delivered by trained graduate, undergraduate, and post-graduate research staff. Parents will be permitted to observe sessions via live video, but will not be directly involved in intervention.</description>

    <description>Children in the parent + therapist-delivered condition will receive one, 60-minute long session of Reciprocal Imitation Training each week for ten consecutive weeks. These sessions will be delivered by trained graduate, undergraduate, and post-graduate research staff. During the same period of time, parents/guardians of children will receive one, 60-minute long parent education session per week with graduate and post-graduate research staff, aimed at teaching parents to implement Reciprocal Imitation Training at home with the child.</description>
