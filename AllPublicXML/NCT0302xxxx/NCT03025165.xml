      The purpose of this study is to compare the virological and clinical outcomes of patients
      participating in community models of ART delivery to the standard of care in an urban setting
      in Zambia.

      The outcomes of this study will be measured in a prospective cohort of adult patients
      enrolled into ART care in two urban communities participating in the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial.
      The two community models are: 1) adherence clubs, groups of 20-25 stable patients who receive
      ART care in the community every 3 months, and 2) home-based ART delivery in which a community
      health worker delivers ART care to an individual at home every 3 months. The standard of care
      is delivery of ART care at the local clinic.
