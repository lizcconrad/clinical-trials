  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a preferred treatment modality for mid-portion achilles tendinopathy. Despite
      this, as many as 44 % of achilles tendinopathy patients do not respond to exercise treatment.

      Surgery for midportion achilles tendinopathy has for many years been done as an open
      procedure. New knowledge resulted in a variety of minimally invasive procedures and the
      development of endoscopic surgery.

      In this study, the effect of non-open surgery and conservative treatment (physiotherapy and
      exercises) will be compared.

    <time_frame>3 months (immediately following 12 week exercising)</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of maximal strength will be conducted in the following manner; participants do a warm up routine where they perform 8-15 repetitions with a comfortable load. This is performed in a leg-press machine. The load is gradually increased, and the participant performs the exercise once per attempt. 3 minutes break are given in between each attempt. The heaviest load the participants manages to lift is their 1RM, and is planned to be achieved within 3-6 attempts.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months (immediately following 12 week exercising)</time_frame>
    <description>A time-to-exhaustion test will be performed by the participants, with the same movement as described for the 1RM-test. If there is bilateral pain, the most painful side will be tested. The plantar flexion movement will be performed with a frequency of 0.5 Hz, starting with a load of 5 kg. Each minute additional 5 kg will be added until exhaustion is achieved or pain exceeds 5 on a VAS-scale. This is a common test in studies where one wish to assess aerobic endurance capacity.</description>

    <description>Ambulatory surgery. Same surgeon for all patients. General anesthesia. Full debridement of the paratenon and crural fascia. Also the plantaris longus tendon is debrided, but no additional tenotomy executed. Postoperative rehabilitation. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 7 days postoperatively. Active ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion from day 1 postoperative. Partly weight bearing (30 kg) from day 1 postoperative. Full weight bearing allowed from week 3 postoperative. Gradually increased load, both in activity of daily living, stationary bike and stretching, with individually and pragmatic progression due to pain response. From week 6 postoperative the patients start the same exercise regimen as the conservative treatment group.</description>
