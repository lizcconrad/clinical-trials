  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to report the long term survival and incidence
      of adverse events in the patients who were implanted with HM3 in the CE Mark Study and
      continue to be ongoing with the HeartMate 3 LVAS after the CE Mark Study 2 year follow-up.

      The study will be a single arm, prospective, multi-center, non-blinded and non-randomized
      study, intended to report on the long term use of the HeartMate 3 LVAS in those patients that
      completed the 2-year follow-up in the HeartMate 3 CE Mark study.
