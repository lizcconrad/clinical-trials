    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of virtual environments presented on a head mounted display
      for the rehabilitation of those suffering with visual vertigo.

      The control group and treatment groups will be presented with two different sets of
      environments and be given the same head and eye exercises to complete within the environment.
      They will also be provided with at home exercises to complete.

      Visual vertigo occurs after the balance system suffers damage (e.g after a viral infection
      such as labyrinthitis). This causes an over-reliance on the eyes to maintain balance which
      causes disorientation in busy environments such as the supermarket. The treatment involves
      trying to desensitise the individual to visually stimulating situations. Further head and eye
      exercises are completed alongside the exposure to overcome the damage done to the balance
      system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who have been diagnosed with visual vertigo and have scored a significant level
             on the Situational Characteristic Questionnaire (over 0.74 as per Pavlou et al.,
             2006).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those with or under investigation for epilepsy.

          -  Those who have been determined to have no or limited balance function in both ears.

          -  Those with reduced visual acuity that will leave them unable to view the 3D effects of
             the head mounted display.

          -  Those with severe mental health disorders e.g. psychosis, paranoid disorders, bipolar
             disorder or a history of substance abuse.

          -  Severe neck pain/ restricted movement.

          -  Previous treatment for visual vertigo.

          -  Those with an fluctuating vestibular disorder such as Ménière's disease or vestibular
             migraine.

          -  Those with untreated Benign Paroxymal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).

          -  Those with a significant brain injury, or head injury that results in a central
             vestibular disorder.

          -  Those with an arrhythmia.
