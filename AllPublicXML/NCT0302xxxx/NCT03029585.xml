  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate NanoPac® administered intraperitoneally (IP) immediately
      post-cytoreductive surgery, followed by standard of care (SOC) intravenous (IV) chemotherapy,
      in women with ovarian cancer. The study will compare IP NanoPac® (plus IV chemotherapy) with
      SOC IV chemotherapy alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that the administration of chemotherapy directly into the peritoneal
      cavity (intraperitoneal [IP] chemotherapy) may provide a significant survival benefit to
      women with ovarian cancer when combined with cytoreductive surgery and IV chemotherapy.

      This study will include a dose-finding phase and an efficacy phase to evaluate IP NanoPac®
      administered immediately post-cytoreductive surgery in women with ovarian cancer. In the
      dose-finding phase, subjects will be enrolled in dose-escalated cohorts of three subjects and
      receive IP NanoPac® at 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/m2 plus standard of care (SOC) IV
      chemotherapy. Subjects will be followed for disease status for 12 months. The two best doses
      from the dose-finding phase will be determined. In the efficacy phase, subjects will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to one of the two best doses plus SOC IV chemotherapy or SOC alone.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will include any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination. Treatment-emergent adverse events occur when the date and time of the adverse event onset is on or after the first application of the investigational agent and any time up to when the intravenous chemotherapy commences. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized for each treatment group. The summaries will include an overall summary of the number of subjects reporting and the number of events reported, summaries of adverse events leading to termination or death, and summaries by severity and relatedness (separately and combined). Of greatest interest will be post-surgery signs of toxicity (e.g., severe abdominal pain after 5-7 days, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, bowel dehiscence, prolonged ileus).</description>

    <description>In the efficacy phase of the study, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of two best doses from the dose-finding phase (plus standard of care intravenous chemotherapy) or standard of care intravenous chemotherapy alone. Subjects in this phase will be monitored every three months for the first 12 months and then every six months thereafter until disease progression or until the last subject in the trial has been monitored for 12 months. All monitoring information, including CA-125, imaging, and cancer-related symptoms (e.g., bowel obstruction and ascites), will be summarized in tables displaying the treatment group results across time. Progression will be presented as time to progression (Kaplan-Meier) as well as percent progressed up to and including 12 months post-intravenous chemotherapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Plasma Concentration of Paclitaxel (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples will be taken on Day 1 at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-intraperitoneal administration of NanoPac® and weekly thereafter until IV chemotherapy begins. Additionally, a pharmacokinetics (PK) sample will be collected from every subject prior to each cycle of IV chemotherapy for determination of paclitaxel concentrations to assess potential NanoPac® persistence. PK levels of paclitaxel in the plasma will be summarized descriptively.</description>
