  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dermatological testing of cosmetic products which are new on the market, or existing
      products with novel formulations is common and a useful procedure, yet necessary to alleviate
      common irritants and contact allergic reactions. Cosmetic products contain a range of
      substances that may be considered as potential irritants or contact allergens. In order to
      estimate that risk, cosmetics are tested by applying patch tests.
