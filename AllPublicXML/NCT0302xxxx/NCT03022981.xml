    <textblock>
      This study will have 2 parts: Pharmacokinetics (PK) Lead-in Phase and the Treatment Phase.

      The primary objective of the PK Lead-in Phase is to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm
      the dose of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in pediatric
      participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

      The primary objective of the Treatment Phase is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      SOF/VEL for 12 weeks in pediatric participants with chronic HCV.
