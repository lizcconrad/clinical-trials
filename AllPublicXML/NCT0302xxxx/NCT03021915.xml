    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, controlled pilot safety research study. The primary
      objective of this research study is to assess the safety with the use of the OvaPrime
      procedure in women who are diagnosed with either primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or poor
      ovarian response (POR).

      A maximum of ninety-five (95) subjects will be enrolled consisting of a minimum of thirty
      (30) POI subjects and a minimum of fifty (50) POR to achieve the target sample size of 70
      Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) subjects as the primary analysis population. Each subject
      shall have one ovary exposed to the EggPC cells while the contralateral ovary is exposed to
      the EggPC vehicle as a means to have each subject serve as their own control. Results between
      the treatment and control ovary will be examined for relevant endpoints such as antral
      follicle counts.

      The duration of the research study is estimated at approximately 6 years total, for the
      period spanning enrollment (estimated at approximately six months), eight months to the last
      hyperstimulation and through completion of 5-year follow-up (main study protocol with one
      year primary endpoint and LTFU sub-study which extends to 5 additional years).

    <description>For subjects who fail to achieve pregnancy, they will be assessed for one year from the date of the OvaPrime procedure. For subjects who become pregnant, they will be followed through the pregnancy and 1-year post-partum. The safety of the off-spring will be monitored by this research study up to one-year post delivery in the main study and for up to 5 years in the long-term follow-up study.</description>

    <description>The treatment is based on identified EggPC cells in the outer-most layer of the ovary. During OvaPrime, the EggPC cells are isolated from biopsy tissue obtained from the outer layer of the ovary. OvaScience separates the EggPC cells and these isolated cells are then returned to the IVF clinic - there is no culture or expansion of the EggPC cells during this process. Upon receipt of the autologous EggPC cells, the clinic initiates the process of reintroducing the cells into the follicular development zone of the woman's own ovary using a laparoscopic procedure. Once in the ovary, the EggPC cells have the opportunity to develop and mature into fertilizable eggs naturally or with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (when stimulated by exogenous gonadotropins) using standard IVF protocols.</description>
