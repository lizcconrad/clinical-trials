      A phase I dose escalation study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate
      vaccine ChAdOx2 HAV in healthy volunteers.

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated in Oxford, England.

      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Three different doses will be tested
      (5x10^9 vp, 2.5x10^10 vp and 5x10^10vp).

      The total duration of the study will be 52 weeks from the day of enrolment for all
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label, 3+3 dose escalation trial to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of the ChAdOx2 HAV vaccine against Mycobacterium avium subspecies
      paratuberculosis (MAP) in healthy volunteers

      There will be 3 study groups with a total of 12-18 volunteers. ChAdOx2 HAV will be
      administered intramuscularly as a single vaccination at 3 different doses: 5x10^9 vp (group
      1), 2.5x10^10 (group 2) and 5x10^10 vp (group 3)

      Vaccination of groups will be sequential from Group 1 to Group 3 with interim safety reviews
      prior to dose escalation

      Volunteers will be recruited and undergo screening visits, vaccination and clinic visits
      post-vaccination at the trial site. Blood samples for safety and immunology purposes will be
      performed on the visit time points indicated in the schedule of attendances.

      Safety will be assessed by the frequency, incidence and nature of adverse events and serious
      adverse events arising during the study.
