  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is an effective therapy in HER2 positive advanced gastric
      cancer (AGC). However, the efficacy of routine trastuzumab therapy and its association with
      clinicopathologic factors remain unclear. The object of the study is to determine whether the
      addition of trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy improves efficacy compared with
      chemotherapy alone in HER2 positive AGC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 98 patients with HER2 positive AGC were enrolled in this prospective observational
      study. All patients were treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as the first line
      therapy. Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab were analyzed, clinical and pathological data
      were collected to evaluate the potential prognostic factors on progressive free survival.

        Patients diagnosed with HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma in
        Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Fu Dan University were prospectively collected. HER2
        expression was assessed by IHC first. In the cases with IHC 2+, fluorescence in situ
        hybridization (FISH) was used to detect HER2/neu amplification levels.
