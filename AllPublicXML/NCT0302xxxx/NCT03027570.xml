  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      80 children aged 5-13, BMI≥85%, will be recruited to the five-month program, at two centers
      for the treatment of overweight children. The intervention group will use the app &quot;Just Dance
      Now&quot; and part of a weekly exercise session will be dedicated to a group app activity. The
      control group will be exposed to the usual program without the app.

      Measurements of BMI, blood sugar and lipid profiles, as well as physical examination, and
      questionnaires regarding attitude and response to physical activity will be performed at the
      beginning of the program, the end and 3 months after completion of the intervention.
      Participation in the sessions will be documented and home activity recorded using a weekly
      log. ANOVA two-way repeated measures will be used to assess improvements in outcome measures.
