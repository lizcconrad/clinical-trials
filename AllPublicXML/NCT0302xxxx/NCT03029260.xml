  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of tension neural mobilization versus sliding neural
      mobilization of the peroneal nerve on the heat and cold threshold, on pressure pain threshold
      and on flexibility both in the dominant lower limb (subjected to mobilization) and the
      non-dominant lower limb (not subjected to mobilization) in healthy young participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty young and healthy participants will be randomly allocated to receive tension neural
      mobilization (n=30) or sliding neural mobilization (n=30). Data on heat threshold, cold
      threshold, pressure pain threshold and lower limb flexibility will be collected before the
      intervention, immediately after the intervention and at least 24h after the intervention.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>It is anticipated that 30 participants will be in this group. They will receive tension type neural mobilization of the peroneal nerve in the dominant limb. This will consist of positioning the lower limb with inversion and plantar flexion of the ankle, extension of the knee and maximum flexion of the hip without pain. A physiotherapists will move the hip from this maximum position of flexion in direction to extension (for example if the participants reaches 80ยบ of flexion the mobilization will be between 40ยบ and 80ยบ of flexion). Each participant will receive four series of 10 mobilizations with 1 minute rest between series.</description>

    <description>It is anticipated that 30 participants will be in this group. They will receive sliding neural mobilization of the peroneal nerve in the dominant limb. Each participant will receive four series of 10 mobilizations with 1 minute rest between series of the following combination of movement: from ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip extension to ankle plantarflexion, knee and hip flexion.</description>
