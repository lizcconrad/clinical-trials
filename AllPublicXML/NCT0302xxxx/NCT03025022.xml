    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
      excretion (ADME) of 14C-JNJ-42847922 in healthy subjects after a single oral dose of 40
      milligram (mg) 14C-JNJ-42847922 containing maximally 100 MicroCurie. Safety and tolerability
      will also be assessed.
