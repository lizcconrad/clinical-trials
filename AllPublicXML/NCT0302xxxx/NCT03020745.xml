  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3389404 is being developed for the treatment of CHB virus infection. The development goal
      for GSK3389404 is the establishment of a finite duration treatment that results in sustained
      suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and viral antigen production after
      cessation of all treatments for CHB due to the restoration of a functional immune response in
      the absence of high antigen levels. This study is a multicenter, randomized double-Blind
      (sponsor un-blinded in Part 1), Placebo-controlled Study which will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and PD profile of GSK3389404 in subjects with CHB and aim to establish
      proof-of-mechanism. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 plans to enroll subjects
      primarily from the Asia-pacific region, including Japan and will be conducted as a single
      ascending dose (SAD) study with 5 planned cohorts ranging from 30 milligram (mg) to a maximum
      of 240 mg GSK3389404. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive either
      GSK3389404 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Cohorts A, B, C, C1, and D will be conducted in a
      sequential fashion; Cohort C1 is an optional cohort and may be dosed after Cohort C or in
      parallel with Cohort D. Part 2 will be conducted as a multiple-dose, dose-ranging study.
      Subjects will be randomized to different parallel dose levels and regimens or placebo. The
      dose levels of Part 2 will be selected after a review of Part 1 safety, Pharmacokinetic (PK)
      and Pharmacodynamic (PD) data. The treatments selected are 60 mg GSK3389404 weekly, 120 mg
      GSK3389404 bi-weekly, 120 mg GSK3389404 weekly or placebo. An optional Japanese part-2
      sub-study is planned. The total study duration for part 1 including screening, treatment, and
      post-treatment follow-up, will not be expected to exceed 13 weeks for each subject and for
      part 2, including screening, treatment and post-treatment follow-up, will not be expected to
      exceed 65 weeks for each subject.

             subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. For females of
             non-reproductive potential at least one of the following conditions must apply:
             Premenopausal females without reproductive potential defined by Documented
             salpingectomy, Hysterectomy or Documented bilateral oophorectomy; Postmenopausal
             defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea; A blood sample for simultaneous
             Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels may be collected at the
             discretion of the investigator or site to confirm non-reproductive potential; Male
             subjects with a female partner of child-bearing potential must agree to meet one of
             the contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study treatment until
             Follow-up visit Day 169; Vasectomy; Male condom plus partner's use of one of the
             contraceptive options below that meets the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
             effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1 percent rate of failure per year, as stated in
             the product label: Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or
             intrauterine system, Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive, Injectable
             progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring, or Percutaneous contraceptive patches. These
             allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly
             and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring
             that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Male
             subjects must refrain from donating sperm from the time of first dose of study
             treatment until Follow-up visit Day 169.

             prior treatment with interferon (pegylated or non-pegylated) must have ended treatment

             arrhythmia, coronary heart disease and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities).
             Uncontrolled or history of difficult to control hypertension. History of, or active
             diagnosis of, primary or secondary renal disease (e.g., renal disease secondary to
             diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease, etc.). History of extrahepatic disorders

             nodosa). History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. History of or suspected
             presence of vasculitis. History of Gilbert's Syndrome. History of malignancy within
             the past 5 years with the exception of specific cancers that are cured by surgical
             resection (e.g., skin cancer), subjects under evaluation for possible malignancy are
             not eligible.

          -  History of/sensitivity to GSK3389404 or components thereof or a history of drug or

          -  Fridericia's QT correction formula (QTcF) &gt;=450 milliseconds (msec) (mean of
             triplicate measurements).

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 5 half-lives (if known) or twice the duration (if known) of the biological
             effect of the study treatment (whichever is longer) or 90 days (if half-life or
             duration is unknown).

          -  Prior treatment with any non-GSK oligonucleotide or small interfering ribonucleic acid
             (RNA) (siRNA) within 12 months prior to the first dosing day or prior treatment with
