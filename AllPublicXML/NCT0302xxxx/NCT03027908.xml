    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomised, parallel group efficacy study. A minimum of 240
      healthy female and male participants aged over 18 years will participate. The participants
      will be randomised into two groups. Participants will be randomly assigned to the test groups
      according the allocation table prepared by the Statistician.

      Participants will be enrolled on to the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      After enrollment participants will have their teeth cleaned using a professional prophylaxis
      polish by the study hygienist. The participants will then be provided with a standard
      cosmetic silica fluoride toothpaste and a toothbrush to use at home, twice a day for up to
      four weeks. After this time, they will return to the test site and have the baseline dental
      assessments. Participants will then be randomly allocated to one of the two test products
      which they will use at home, twice a day for the duration of the study. Dental assessments
      will be conducted after 13 and 26 weeks of product use at the study site.
