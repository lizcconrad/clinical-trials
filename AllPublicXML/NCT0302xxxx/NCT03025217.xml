    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot study of patients at the Revere Healthcare Center with a BMI
      greater than 25. The intervention consists of a single in-person assessment with a dietician
      followed by telephone coaching sessions addressing nutrition, sleep, stress-reduction skills,
      and physical activity over the course of 6 months. Study team assessed anthropomorphic,
      demographic, and behavioral measures prior to the initial dietician assessment and at study
      completion (6 months following enrollment). Semi-structured exit interviews assessing
      participants' experiences in the program were also conducted following program completion.
