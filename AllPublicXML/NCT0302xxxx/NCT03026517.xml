  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether it is safe to give phenformin with the standard
      drug combination of dabrafenib + trametinib. The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib is
      a standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma whose melanoma has a mutation in a
      gene called BRAF.

    <description>This is a multi-institution single-arm phase I trial with an expansion cohort at the MTD of Phenformin, in patients with metastatic BRAFV600E/K mutated melanoma. In the dose escalation phase, cohorts of patients will be treated with standard dose Dabrafenib (150 mg PO BID) plus Trametinib (2 mg PO QD) and increasing doses of Phenformin. In the dose-escalation phase of the trial, both patients who have already been treated with a BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor, and treatment-naïve patients will be eligible. The dose-expansion cohort will enroll up to 10 patients who are treatment- naïve for BRAF inhibitor.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AJCC (2009) stage IV melanoma, or stage III melanoma not curable by surgery and which
             is progressing. Patients must have at least 1 target lesion measurable by RECIST 1.1
             criteria.

          -  The melanoma must harbor an activating BRAF V600 mutation. Prior therapy with a BRAF
             and/or MEK inhibitor is allowed in the dose-escalation phase only. However, patients
             who discontinued previous RAF inhibitor due to intolerance of the drug rather than due
             to progression will not be eligible.

          -  Histologic proof of melanoma reviewed and confirmed by the treating institution. The
             melanoma must have a documented BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K mutation by genotyping or IHC12
             performed by a CLIA certified laboratory. At MSK, the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology
             laboratory has developed and implemented a targeted capture-based next-generation DNA
             sequencing assay, MSK-IMPACTTM, to profile all protein-coding exons and selected
             introns from 410 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in formalin-fixed paraffin
             embedded tissues (Cheng, D.T., et al., J Mol Diagn, 2015. 17(3): p. 251-64).
             MSK-IMPACTTM has been approved by the NY State Department of Health to be run as a
             clinical assay in the CLIA-compliant Diagnostic Molecular Pathology laboratory.
             MSK-IMPACTTM is capable of detecting mutations, copy number alterations, and
             structural variations. BRAF Exon15 was captured by the MSK-IMPACTTM panel and the
             c.1799T&gt;A (p.V600E) mutation was fully validated as per NYS requirements. Detailed
             results of the validation of this mutation were included in the validation package
             submitted to NY State Department of Health.

          -  At MGH, samples will be tested using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
             technology called Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) for single nucleotide variant (SNV) and
             insertion/deletion (indel) detection in genomic DNA using next generation sequencing
             (NGS). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor
             specimen is sheared with the Covaris M220 instrument, followed by end-repair,
             adenylation, and ligation with an adapter. A sequencing library targeting hotspots and
             exons in 39 genes (including BRAF, exons 11 and 15) is generated using two hemi-nested
             PCR reactions. Illumina MiSeq 2 x 147 base paired-end sequencing results are aligned
             to the hg19 human genome reference using BWA-MEM (Li H and Durbin R. Bioinformatics
             2009;25(14):1754-60). MuTect (Cibulskis K, et al. Nat Biotechnol 2013;31(3):213-9) and
             a laboratory-developed insertion/deletion analysis algorithm are used for SNV and
             indel variant detection, respectively. This assay has been validated to detect SNV and
             indel variants at 5% allelic frequency or higher in target regions with sufficient
             read coverage. This test was developed, and its performance characteristics were
             determined by the MGH Center for Integrated Diagnostics.
