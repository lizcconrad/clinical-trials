    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of premedication on cognitive functions in patients
      undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor under spinal anesthesia. The aims of
      premedication are anxiolysis, analgesia and the reduction of perioperative risk among the
      patients with comorbidities. The patients will be randomly allocated to receive premedication
      either with opioid solely or with benzodiazepine combined with opioid. The anesthetic
      technique is standardized.

    <textblock>
      Trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the basic endoscopic procedure for
      management of bladder cancer and if there are no contraindications, it is performed under
      spinal anesthesia. The condition usually occurs among elderly patients, every 9 of 10 is
      older than 55 years. At this age the postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common
      complication as the risk increases with age. There are some studies indicating that using
      benzodiazepines during the perioperative period can also increase the number of registered
      POCD in patients undergoing anesthesia. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) occurs
      after operations under regional and general anesthesia as well. The study was planed to
      evaluate the risk of POCD among urological patients and to asses whether combining
      benzodiazepines with opioids for premedication increases this risk.

      The participants after giving the informed consent can participate in the study. The Beck
      Depression Inventory is performed to rule out the patients with depression. The cognitive
      functions are tested with Montreal Cognitive Assessment before the surgery and subsequently
      in the first 24 hours after surgery, three weeks later (while patients come back to receive
      histopathological examination), and finally six months after surgery (during control
      cystoscopy).

      During anesthesia, the patients will be randomly allocated to receive premedication either
      with opioid solely or with benzodiazepine combined with opioid. The anesthetic technique is
      standardized. If the premedication is needed before the surgery the hydroxyzine will be
      administrated.
