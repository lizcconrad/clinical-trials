        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 1

          -  Pathologically confirmed RCC with a component of either clear cell histology or
             sarcomatoid histology that has not been previously treated in the adjuvant or
             neoadjuvant setting and classified as being at high risk of RCC recurrence

          -  Radical or partial nephrectomy with lymphadenectomy in select participants

          -  Absence of residual disease and absence of metastasis, as confirmed by a negative
             baseline computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest no more than 4
             weeks prior to randomization. Confirmation of disease-free status will be assessed by
             an independent central radiologic review of imaging data.

          -  Absence of brain metastasis, as confirmed by a negative CT with contrast or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, no more than 4 weeks prior to
             randomization. Applicable only to metastasectomy participants

          -  Full recovery from nephrectomy or metastasectomy within 12 weeks from randomization
             following surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral synchronous tumors with inheritable forms of RCC including von Hippel-Lindau

             study with therapeutic intent within 28 days or five half-lives of the investigational
             agent, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment

          -  Malignancies other than RCC within 5 years prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

             pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic
             organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan

          -  Positive test for HIV

          -  Participants with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C

          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the participant at high risk from treatment
             complications

          -  Prior treatment with cluster of differentiation (CD)137 agonists, anti-cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (anti-CTLA-4), anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD−1),
             or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapeutic antibody or
             pathway-targeting agents

          -  Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to
             interferons or interleukin-2) within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the drug, whichever
             is shorter, prior to randomization

          -  Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to
             corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and
