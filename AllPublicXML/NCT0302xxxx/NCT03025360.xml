  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Larotrectinib (LOXO-101) expanded access is for patients with cancer with a NTRK1, NTRK2, or
      NTRK3 gene fusion who are ineligible for an ongoing larotrectinib (LOXO-101) clinical trial
      or have other considerations that prevent access to larotrectinib (LOXO-101) through an
      existing clinical trial. Expanded access is intended to treat individual patients with
      different types of cancers with a NTRK gene fusion.
