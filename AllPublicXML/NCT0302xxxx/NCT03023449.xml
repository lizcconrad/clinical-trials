      This study is a non-randomized, Phase 2 clinical trial designed to measure the cerebral blood
      flow (CBF) response to inhaled nitric oxide in acute ischemic stroke patients and healthy
      subjects. The monitoring is a 35 minute session during which cerebral hemodynamics will be
      monitored with both diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and transcranial doppler
      ultrasonography (TCD) while blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, respiratory rate, end
      oxygen saturation, and inhaled nitric oxide (NO)/nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration, are
      continuously monitored.

    <description>The protocol will be a 35-minute monitoring session, during which cerebral hemodynamics will be monitored with both DCS and TCD, while blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, respiratory rate, end oxygen saturation, and inhaled nitric oxide concentration, are continuously monitored. 5 minutes of baseline hemodynamics will be assessed, after which the subject will breath iNO for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of room air. This iNO/room air cycle will be repeated with a total of 3 different iNO concentrations. The full protocol will require 35 minutes. Subjects will be called at 24 hours after the monitoring session to determine any tolerability issues or adverse events.</description>
