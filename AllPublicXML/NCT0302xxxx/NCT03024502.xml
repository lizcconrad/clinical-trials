  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the safety of two mucoadhesive gels containing a propolis
      standardized extract identified as EPP-AF, with 1 and 2% of propolis. The efficacy studies
      with both propolis gels will be performed in comparison with clotrimazole cream in patients
      presenting vulvovaginal candidiasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal candidiasis is the second infection of the genital tract after bacterial vaginosis.
      Up to 75% of women will have at least one episode in their lives, but the clinical
      manifestations can be very variable. Around 10 to 20% will be asymptomatic and 5 to 10% will
      have the recurrent candidiasis that means 4 or more episodes in a year. The predominant
      symptoms are pruritus in 89% and burning during urination and sexual intercourse in 66%. The
      therapeutic regimen for acute fungal infections by C. albicans should consider the intensity
      of the clinical symptoms, recurrence, patient preference for the route of administration and
      consequent adherence to treatment, presence of pregnancy and the possibility of side effects.
      In general, the schemes include anti-fungal substances of the azoles type. Intravaginal
      administration of drugs requires the development of formulations suited to the area and
      adherence to the treatment can be increased if mucoadhesive formulations are obtained which
      avoid discomfort and provide adequate release of the active compounds. In this sense, the
      present project had the objective of developing a mucoadhesive gel containing Propolis
      Standardized (EPP-AFÂ®) for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis, especially since preclinical
      efficacy and safety data demonstrated the clinical potential of the product. So the present
      proposal aims at the clinical study evaluate the efficacy of two formulations with 1 and 2%
      of propolis in comparison with clotrimazole cream treatment (patients affected by
      Candidiasis) and also evaluate the safety of both propolis gels in healthy volunteers. The
      efficacy protocol of the test product in patients with vaginal candidiasis will be performed
      in an open-label, randomized, three-arm, clinical trial with active clotrimazole-based
      control. Patients will be recruited (T0) and evaluated at 10 and 30 days after initiation of
      treatment, and the primary outcome will be the clinical cure rate.

    <description>Participants will be evaluated on the tenth day after insertion in the study (on the third day after the termination of the vaginal cream). The clinical cure will be evaluated by means of a questionnaire and specular examination. The possibilities will be:
Candidacy Resolution
No resolution of candidiasis
The questionnaire will be:
Pruritus: yes or no Burning: yes or no Dysuria: yes or no Edema of the genital area: yes or no Running: yes or no
The specular examination will evaluate:
Presence of hyperemia: yes or no Edema of the genital area: yes or no Presence of cracks: yes or no Pathological vaginal contents: yes or no The positive response to any of the questions or signs / symptoms will be considered as clinical failure</description>

    <description>Participants will be evaluated on the tenth day after insertion in the study (on the third day after the termination of the vaginal cream). The patient's clinical complaint will be evaluated and the specular examination will be performed. In this evaluation will be collected the following exams:
Vaginal pH measurement:
Normal 3.5 to 4.5 Abnormal&gt; 4.5
Bacterioscopy with KOH10%:
Normal: absence of pseudohifas or other pathogenic elements Abnormal: presence of pseudohifas
Culture for candida albicans:
Normal: Negative Abnormal: positive
PCR for candida:
Normal negative Abnormal: positive
The possibilities will be:
Candidacy Resolution
No resolution of candidiasis It will be considered microbiological cure when all laboratory tests are considered normal</description>
