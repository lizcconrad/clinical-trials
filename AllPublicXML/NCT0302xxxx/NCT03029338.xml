    <textblock>
      In this single-center, open-label, no control, prospective clinical trial, a total of 10
      relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients will be
      enrolled.CD19 CAR T cells(total dose of 2×10^6/kg-1×10^7/kg) will be intravenously infused to
      patient in a three-day split-dose regimen: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2. The
      purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19 CAR T cells
      in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell lymphoma.

      In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, a
      total of 10 relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients will be
      enrolled. CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv
      TCRζ:4-1BB, will be administered by i.v. injection in a three-day split-dose regimen: 10% on
      day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2. Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be
      monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell
      lymphoma.
