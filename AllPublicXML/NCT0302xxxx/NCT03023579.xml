      PURPOSE: The investigators estimated the reliability, standard error of measurement (SEM),
      and minimum detectable change (MDC) of the star excursion balance test (SEBT) in children
      with cerebral palsy (CP).

      METHODS: Eight children with CP (four boys and four girls, sixteen legs) participated in this
      study. Each child carried out the SEBT and was assessed by two examiners. To determine
      intra-rater reliability, the investigators calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient
      (ICC) model (3,3). The investigators also calculated the ICC model (2,3) to determine the
      inter-rater reliability.
