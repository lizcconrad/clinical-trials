  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is known to be significantly associated with high myopia. This study
      investigated the vitamin D status in patients with high myopia and primary open-angle
      glaucoma, in order to understand the relationship between high myopia and the development of
      primary open-angle glaucoma.110 primary open-angle glaucoma patients, 110 high myopia
      patients and 110 age-matched people in the Han population were enrolled. Serum levels of 1a,
      25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 were measured by an enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay.Vitamin D
      receptor polymorphic analysis was studied by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
      length polymorphism technique.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -primary open-angle glaucoma (1) intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg or more in each eye
        without therapy; (2) wide anterior chamber angle; (3)glaucomatous optic neuropathy
        (Glaucomatous optic nerve damage was defined as cup-to-disc ratio higher than 0.7 or focal
        loss of the nerve fiber layer (notch) associated with a consistent glaucomatous visual
        field defect in at least one eye;(4) visual field loss consistent with optic nerve damage
        and visual fields were performed by using standard automated perimetry in at least one eye.

        c(with refractive error &gt;6D) were recruited.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of any secondary glaucoma with an exfoliation syndrome or a history of
             ocular trauma, high myopia, macular degeneration, other ocular diseases, and also a
             known history of systemic diseases and administration of vitamin D3 or other analog.

        High myopia patients with ocular disease such as glaucoma, a history of administration of
        vitamin D3 or other analog or a history of retinopathy or connective tissue disorders
        associated with myopia, such as Stickler or Marfan syndromes, were not included.
