          -  Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours

          -  In subjects without detectable serum or urine M-protein, SFLC &gt; 100 mg/L (involved
             light chain) and an abnormal κ/λ ratio

             at least one of their prior treatment regimens

          -  Refractory to the most recently received therapy. Refractory disease defined as ≤ 25%

             therapy

          -  Subjects must have received ≥ 2 prior regimens. Induction therapy and stem cell
             transplant (± maintenance) will be considered as 1 regimen

          -  Subjects must have received prior treatment with bortezomib and an IMiD

          -  Subjects must have received an alkylating agent or anthracycline alone or in
             combination with other myeloma treatments (this may include high dose melphalan as
             part of the conditioning regimen prior to a stem cell transplant)

          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years of age

             the ULN

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count

                  to obtaining the screening platelet count

               -  Screening ANC should be independent of granulocyte colony stimulating factor
                  (G-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) support for

                  not have been done within 7 days prior to obtaining screening hemoglobin

          -  Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 30 mL/min. Calculated CrCl

             0.85 if the subject is female.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%; 2-dimensional transthoracic
             echocardiogram (ECHO) is the preferred method of evaluation; multiple gated
             acquisition scan (MUGA) is acceptable if ECHO is not available

          -  Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional
             guidelines

             test within 21 days prior to enrollment and agree to use an effective method of
             contraception during and for 30 days following last dose of carfilzomib. This protocol
             defines a FCBP as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy,

             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in
             the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  Male subjects must use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study
             and for 3 months following the last dose of carfilzomib if sexually active with a
             FCBP. Male subjects must not donate sperm during treatment and for an additional 90
             days after last dose of carfilzomib. Male subjects with pregnant partners must
             practice sexual abstinence or use a condom during vaginal sex
