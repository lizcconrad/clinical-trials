  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The altered biomechanical properties of the skin entail limitation of movement, it have been
      important the statement of resources aimed at increasing skin suppleness. The objective of
      the study is to evaluate the effect of therapeutic paraffin in biophysical characteristics of
      the burned skin with or without scar hypertrophic. For this, 60 volunteers will be evaluated
      in the age group of 18-60 years, of both sexes, with deep second degree and third degree
      burns and evaluated areas submitted to therapeutic procedures, divided evenly into scar areas
      and normal skin. Applications will be set randomly by lot, with cross design (cross-over),
      and a minimum interval of seven days (wash-out) of the activities. The biophysical and
      biomechanical parameters of the skin will be assessed noninvasively by Cutometer of the model
      (MPA) 580, device to measure elasticity of the upper skin layer using negative pressure, and
      the durometer, measure hardness of the skin, before, immediately after 0, 10, 20 and 30
      minutes of intervention with therapeutic paraffin in different procedures (number of layers
      and thermal insulation). Sociodemographic, clinical and surgical data of the volunteers will
      be evaluated by SPSS 15 (Statistical Analysis Software). The normality of the data will be
      verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the effect of therapeutic procedures over time
      evaluated by the Friedman test (intragroup) and the test Kruskal-Wallis post hoc Dunn for
      comparisons between different funds (intergroup), p &lt;0.05, will evaluated by software SPSS.

    <description>Will be evaluated through the CutometerÂ®-MPA 580 of the intervention with therapeutic paraffin, being constituted by a small probe with diameter of 4 mm coupled in the equipment. The mechanism of action consists of deformation of the skin caused by suction, ie negative pressure giving a measured value. Once applied to the skin, an infrared light and a sensor located inside the probe perform the measurement of the distension of the skin during the period of continuous suction, followed by the phase of off where there is no suction.</description>

    <description>The instrument was used immediately after 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes of therapeutic paraffin intervention, always in a position perpendicular to the surface of the skin to minimize errors due to the inclination of the device and repeated three times , To obtain an average of values, intervals for 10 seconds between evaluations (Klinger, et al., 2013)</description>
