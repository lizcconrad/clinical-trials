    <description>Adverse events are defined as unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of relationship to the medicinal product. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geometric Mean Fold Increase in HI Antibody Titer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HI Antibody Titer at 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Geometric mean fold increase in HI antibody titer for each of the three strains (A/H1N1 strain, A/H3N2 strain, B strain), 21 days after vaccination, as compared with Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seroconversion Rate of Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HI Antibody Titer at 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion rate was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer for each of the three strains (A/H1N1 strain, A/H3N2 strain, B strain), 21 days after vaccination. Seroconversion rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving a minimal 4-fold increase from the Baseline HI antibody titer in participants with a Baseline titer ≥10, or achieving an HI antibody titer of ≥40 in participants with a Baseline titer &lt;10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seroprotection Rate of HI Antibody Titer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HI Antibody Titer at 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Seroprotection rate, defined as the percentage of participants with HI antibody titer of ≥40, was measured by HI antibody titer for each of the three strains (A/H1N1 strain, A/H3N2 strain, B strain), 21 days after vaccination. Day 1 data is reported for reference.</description>
