  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first in human, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, sequential
      group Phase 1 study in healthy subjects will be conducted to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Pharmacodynamics (PD) following the escalation of
      single and multiple doses of KM-819.

      The study will consist of 2 parts. In Part A, up to 5 cohorts of young adult male subjects,
      and 1 single dose cohort of elderly male or post menopausal female subjects will receive
      escalating single doses of KM-819. The food effect will be investigated in one of the single
      dose cohorts of young adult male subjects, who will be crossed-over to the fed condition.
      Once the dose level is selected for the crossed-over to the fed condition and elderly
      subjects, the protocol will be amended to specify the dose level. In Part B, up to 4 cohorts
      of healthy young adult male subjects and 1 multiple dose cohort of elderly male or post
      menopausal female subjects will receive escalating multiple doses of KM-819. Part B will be
      conducted after completion of all cohorts of young adult male subjects in Part A.

      Dose escalation to the next level will be determined using safety, tolerability, and PK data
      of the previous cohort.

      Part A, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Up to 40 healthy young adult male subjects and 8 healthy
      elderly male or post menopausal female subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      either KM-819 or placebo.

      Each of the 5 dose escalation cohorts consists of 8 healthy young adult male subjects; 6
      subjects will receive 10, 30, 100, 200, or 400 mg of KM-819 and 2 subjects will receive
      placebo. In each single dose cohort, dosing of subjects will be sentinel, i.e., 2 subjects
      will be dosed on the first day (1 subject will receive active treatment and 1 subject will
      receive placebo) and the remaining 6 subjects will be dosed at least 24 hours after the first
      2 subjects.

      Cohorts will be dosed sequentially with escalating doses. One of the cohorts will be
      crossed-over to the fed condition to assess the effect of food as decided by Investigator and
      Sponsor during the study after completion of the 2nd dose cohort (30 mg).

      Eight elderly male or post-menopausal female subjects will be enrolled into an additional
      cohort; 6 subjects will receive KM-819 at a dose level not exceeding the highest dose tested
      in the young adult male cohorts and 2 subjects will receive placebo.

      Part A consists of a Screening period of up to 28 days, and a 3 day Confinement period when
      subjects are hospitalized for study activities. Subjects are required to return for
      outpatient visits on Day 4, 7 and for the Follow up Visit on Day 14. The cohort that
      crossed-over to the fed condition will undergo the same procedure up to the Outpatient Visit
      on Day 4. Subjects will be confined for 3 days for the second time, and are required to
      return for outpatient Visit 5 (Day 4), Visit 6 (Day 7), and for a Follow up Visit 7 (Day 14).

      Part B, Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Up to 32 healthy young adult male subjects and 8
      healthy elderly male or post menopausal female subjects will be enrolled and randomized to
      receive either KM-819 or placebo.

      Each of the 4 dose escalation cohorts consists of 8 healthy young adult male subjects; 6
      subjects will receive 30, 100, 200, or 400 mg of KM-819 once a day (QD) for 7 days and 2
      subjects will receive placebo. Cohorts will be dosed sequentially with escalating doses.

      Eight elderly male or post-menopausal female subjects will be enrolled into an additional
      cohort; 6 subjects will receive KM-819 at a dose level not exceeding the highest dose tested
      in the young adult male cohorts and 2 subjects will receive placebo.

    <description>Concomitant medication will be coded using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD) (Version WHO-DD March 2016) and will be classified by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) categories.
Any medication that the subject takes other than the study drug, including herbal and other non-traditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication. Prior concomitant medications are defined as those taken from Screening until the time of the first study drug administration. Concomitant medications are defined as those taken at the time of or after the first study drug administration.</description>

             position for 5 minutes; pulse will be measured automatically) at Screening or

             check-in. If the mean QTcF exceeds the limits above, 1 additional triplicate ECG can
             be taken. If this triplicate also gives an abnormal result, the subject should be
             excluded.

         10. Subject has a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained cardiac
             arrhythmias or torsade de pointes, structural heart disease, or a family history of
