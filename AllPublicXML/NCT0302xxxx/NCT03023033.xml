    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed intervention study is to increase the proportion of HIV positive
      and HIV negative pregnant women who deliver in a facility, the proportion of HIV exposed
      infants (HEI) who receive nevirapine (NVP) within 48 hours of delivery, and the proportion of
      HEI who are bled for HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing
      within 8 weeks of age.

      Following a formative phase I, we propose in phase II to implement a three-group
      cluster-randomized study to test the effectiveness of short message service (SMS) reminders
      and notifications, [mobile health or mhealth] (group 1) and the combined effectiveness of SMS
      reminders/notifications and cash transfers (group 2) compared to the standard prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission (of HIV)/maternal, neonatal and child health, (PMTCT/MNCH)
      practices (group 3).
