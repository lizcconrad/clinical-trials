  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weakness is a major cause of disability in stroke survivors. Rehabilitation techniques are
      often not effective in restoring full function of the upper limb. Specifically, many
      individuals remain with weakness in the hand, preventing its return to full use.

      Robotic therapies have been developed as exercise tools for stroke survivors. Devices, such
      as the InMotion2, have been shown to be useful in restoring some motor function in the upper
      limb. However, most existing devices designed to be used with the upper limb have primarily
      been developed to treat the shoulder, elbow and wrist. They have not specifically addressed
      hand function.

      Tyromotion, Inc. has developed the Amadeo, which is primarily intended to provide
      rehabilitation for patients with neurological or orthopedic deficits in hand function.
      Initial clinical testing has demonstrated the practicality of using this device in a
      population of stroke survivors, although further research is needed to better understand the
      usefulness of the Amadeo device as compared with conventional rehabilitation methods. The
      purpose of this study was to compare results of training with the Amadeo device or training
      with conventional therapies.

      A total of 28 subjects from two separate sites participated in the study and underwent
      baseline testing of upper limb motor and sensory performance and function. Subjects were then
      assigned to one of two treatment groups with a 50:50 chance of being in either group. One
      group underwent training with the Amadeo device and the other group underwent training with
      conventional therapy. All training sessions were 60 minutes in duration, three days/week for
      eight weeks (24 total sessions). Subjects were reassessed on completion of the training
      program.

          <title>Conventional Group</title>
          <description>The purpose of this group is to provide training that is matched to the robotic group in duration and intensity. Participants randomized to this group receive therapy to the affected/paretic upper limb. This therapy is aimed at improving range of motion, strength and functionality. Similar to the robotic group, treatment sessions occurred three times weekly for eight weeks, and sessions were 60 minutes in duration.</description>

          <title>Robotic Group</title>
          <description>The purpose of this group was to provide robotic based training using the Amadeo Hand Robotic Device (Tyromotion, GmbH, Graz, Austria) as a tool to improve range of motion, strength and functionality of the hand in a population of individuals post stroke. Treatment sessions were conducted three times weekly over eight weeks. Each session was 60 minutes in duration.</description>
