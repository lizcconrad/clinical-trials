  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic heterotopic gastric mucosa also known as cervical inlet patch (CIP) may be
      present in varying shapes and causes symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux like globus
      sensations, hoarseness and chronic cough. Unfortunately, argon plasma coagulation, standard
      treatment of small symptomatic CIP, is limited for large heterotopic gastric mucosa due to
      concerns of stricture formation. Therefore, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect
      of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a novel minimal-invasive ablation method, in the treatment
      of large symptomatic CIP.
