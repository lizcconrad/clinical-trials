  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guideline directed use of pharmacologic Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis emphasizes
      mobility evaluation. Mobility is a key component of risk stratification. Poor mobility
      evaluation by providers may be a significant barrier to appropriate use of VTE prophylaxis.
      The investigators aim is to propose to determine whether level of mobility during
      hospitalization is being used to influence use and duration of VTE prophylaxis among
      medically ill hospitalized elders. To achieve this aim, the investigator will collect
      prospective observational data to objectively measure inpatient mobility using patient
      mounted accelerometers during patient hospital stays.

      The investigator's goal is to improve the appropriateness of use of VTE prophylaxis among
      those in which the risks of harm may outweigh the benefit. Results from this study will
      provide important insights about use of risk assessment, and the relationship between patient
      mobility and VTE prophylaxis. These results are critical to understanding how to take the
      next steps toward improving the appropriate use and safety of anticoagulants in hospitalized
      older adults. Information from this study could be used in future proposals to study
      interventions to ultimately improve hospital practice in the care of older adults.

    <description>A sample of 120 patients aged 60 years or older admitted to General Medicine at Duke University Hospital will be enrolled in the prospective cohort study. A convenience sample will be derived from a randomized daily list of general medicine admissions; weekend admissions will be excluded as these patients will not be captured within 24 hours of hospital admission.</description>
