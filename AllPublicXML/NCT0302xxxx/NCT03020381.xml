    <textblock>
      Motor slowing and cognitive slowing are more prevalent as we age. Importantly, the presence
      of both in an older person increases their risk of having dementia by ten times. Currently,
      there are no clinically meaningful predictors of progression to dementia in people with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI). The main hypothesis is that subtle variations in gait while
      performing a simple cognitive task is a reliable, easy to perform, and feasible methodology
      to detect those older adults at higher risk of progression to dementia and also, at higher
      risk of further mobility decline and falls.

      Rationale. The Canadian population is aging. According to recent estimates, the proportion of
      the population aged 65 and older will increase rapidly from 13% in 2005 to 25% by 2031. This
      increase in proportion is accompanied by a considerable amount of disability and subsequent
      dependency which has major effects on both the quality of life of older adults and their
      caregivers, and on the Canadian health care system. An important goal of geriatric medicine
      is to reduce the gap between life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy by reducing
      disability and dependency in the later years of life. A substantial portion of this
      disability stems from two major geriatric syndromes: cognitive impairment and mobility
      limitation. The ultimate manifestations of these syndromes are dementia and falls.
      Interestingly, these manifestations often coexist in elderly people: falling is a common
      geriatric syndrome affecting about a third of older adults each year, and dementia affects
      about a third of Canadians aged 80 and over. Together, dementia and falls are responsible for
      much of the discomfort, disability, and health care utilization in older adults and each will
      become more prevalent as older Canadians are expected to number approximately $9 million by
      2031. The combined direct cost of dementia and falls for the Canadian Health System is over
      $4.9 billion per year.

      Establishing reliable and easy to obtain predictors to accurately identify MCI patients at
      highest risk of progressing to dementia is essential first, to determine who will benefit
      from additional and/or invasive testing and second, to implement preventative strategies,
      including cognitive training, physical exercises, and aggressive vascular risk factors
      correction to delay progression. Even a modest one-year delay in dementia incidence could
      save Canada $109 billion over 30 years.

      This longitudinal cohort study started in 2007 and is aiming to assess 400 older persons (65
      y/o to 85 y/o) at risk of development cognitive impairment and dementia, during a 10 year of
      follow-up. The follow-up period was selected in order to cover the potential progression to
      dementia of at least two-third of the participants. For the first three years of follow up,
      assessments are conducted at baseline and every 6 months; after the visit at 36 months,
      participants will then be followed once a year for 7 years (total follow-up of 120 months).
      The six months period between assessments during the first 3 years was selected since it is
      the minimum time required for detecting significant changes between assessments in cognitive
      measurements and for avoiding testing learning effects. If changes are not noted within the
      first three years, then the annual follow-up period will provide sufficient time periods to
      detect significant changes in cognition, gait, and balance measures.

      Blood test for genotyping (ApoE4 carrier) is being performed only at baseline assessments.
      Cognitive, gait and balance assessments are being performed in all the visits. 3Tesla
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (structural and functional -resting state-) and MRI spectroscopy
      are being performed at three different time points: at baseline, month 18 and month 36,
      following the Canadian Dementia Imaging protocol (http://www.cdip-pcid.ca.) Blood and brain
      imaging were adedd after the second wave of the study, in 2010.

      APOEε4 carrier status will be determined by PCR of genomic DNA extracted from anticoagulated
      blood. Carrier status is determined by dichotomizing into ε4- (ε2/ε3 heterozygote or ε2/ε3
      homozygote) and ε4+ (ε4 homozygote or ε4 heterozygote) for consistency with previous studies.
