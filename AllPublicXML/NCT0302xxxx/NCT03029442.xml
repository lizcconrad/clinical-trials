  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of a drug, denosumab, to prevent the
      loss of bone in participants legs due to SCI. This drug is FDA approved to treat osteoporosis
      in women after menopause who have an increased risk for fractures, to treat women receiving
      certain treatments for breast cancer who have an increased risk of fractures, and to treat
      bone loss in men receiving certain treatments for prostate cancer who have increased risk for
      fractures. This drug is considered experimental for the purpose of this study. Study
      participation will last for approximately 12 months (6 study visits total), visits will range
      from1-4.5 hours depending on the number of tests that need to be completed. The study is a
      double-blinded placebo trail in which the participant will be randomly assigned to on of two
      groups, Denosumab injections or placebo - inactive salt solution injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a potent anti-resorptive
      agent, denosumab [receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) antibody; Amgen
      Inc.] to preserve bone mass at the hip and knee and trabecular connectivity at the knee after
      subacute motor-incomplete SCI [American Spinal Injury Association (AIS) neurological
      classification scale C and D] at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (JJPVAMC) and Kessler
      Institute for Rehabilitation (KIR). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group trial will be performed in thirty-two subjects with acute, motor-incomplete SCI (≤6
      months) who have been admitted to JJPVAMC or the KIR. Denosumab (60 mg SC) will be
      administered at baseline, 6, and 12 months; the placebo group will receive normal saline
      subcutaneously. Denosumab will be administered as soon as possible, but up to 24 weeks, after
      SCI. The last dose of denosumab and placebo will be administered at 6 months, with the
      anticipated effect of the drug to persist and inhibit bone resorption at least until the 12
      month time point.
