  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 30,000 people in the United States suffer an intra-cranial
      hemorrhage due to aneurysmal rupture. Of those surviving the initial event, up to 40% will go
      on to have further neurological injury secondary to stroke (delayed cerebral ischemia) caused
      by constriction of blood vessels (i.e. vasospasm). Previous studies have shown that the
      medication sildenafil, given intravenously, improves vasospasm, but has an associated degree
      of hypotension. The degree of hypotension was well within safety thresholds for these
      patients.

      Sildenafil is a medication that strongly inhibits the protein phosphodiesterase-V (PDE-V).
      The hypothesis for this study is that oral sildenafil will also improve vasospasm, but does
      not result in as much hypotension. Specifically, the investigators look to show that
      comparable doses of oral sildenafil produces the same degree of PDE-V inhibition as an
      intravenous dose while the degree of hypotension is reduced. Additionally, using measurements
      of cerebral blood flow regulation acquired using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, the
      investigators look to show that oral sildenafil produces the same degree of improvement in
      vasospasm and blood flow regulation.
