  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent presbyopic correction with bilateral bifocal intraocular lenses
      implantation are supposed to have sufficient uncorrected vision capacity for activities of
      daily living (ADLs) that require near vision acuity (NV), (ie. book reading). However, it is
      known that light intensity and temperature has a great impact on near vision capacity.
      Primary objective of this study is to identify the optimal task lighting conditions (in terms
      of light intensity and temperature) for ADLs that demand near vision acuity for a sample oa
      patients who underwent presbyopic correction with bilateral bifocal intraocular lenses
      implantation
