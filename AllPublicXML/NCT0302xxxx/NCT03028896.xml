  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 90° rotation technique is known to improve the success rate of conventional LMA but its
      effect in LMA FlexibleTM is not known. We tried to find if 90° rotation technique could
      increase the first attempt success rate of the insertion of LMA FlexibleTM compared to
      standard technique.

    <textblock>
      One hundred and sixteen adult patients undergoing breast surgery were randomized to the two
      insertion techniques. The ease of insertion was assessed by the success rate at the first
      attempt. Heart rate and mean blood pressure were recorded 1 min before and 1 min after
      insertion. Postoperative complications were checked.
