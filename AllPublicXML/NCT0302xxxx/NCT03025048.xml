      People with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for overweight and obesity, type 2
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease and decreased quality of life compared With able bodied.

      This pilot aims to assess the impact of a nutrition intervention that combines several
      methods to help people change their lifestyle.

      The pilot project combines individual interviews and personal lifestyle goals (diet) with
      group classes for people with long-standing spinal cord injury.

      In addition to nutrition theory and practical exercises for diet-planning, motivational
      interviewing and mindfullness are incorporated into the course. The course is
      interdisciplinary, but is led primarily by a dietitian. Data is collected before the course
      starts and right after the 9-week course ends. The measurements involves self-perceived
      quality of life, food diary, weight, waist circumference and body composition (measured by
      BIA and DXA).
