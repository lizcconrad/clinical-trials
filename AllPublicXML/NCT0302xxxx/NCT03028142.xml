  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, complete block, three way
      crossover study to investigate treatment with nebulised RPL554 and tiotropium together in
      patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of
      this study is to assess the bronchodilator effect (opening of the airways) of RPL554 when
      used in combination with a long acting anti-muscarinic receptor antagonist (tiotropium)
      whilst dosing the RPL554 to steady state blood levels. It is planned to randomise up to 30
      patients to have 24 evaluable patients at one study centre. In each treatment period,
      patients will receive an open label dose of tiotropium from a dry power inhaler (DPI)
      followed immediately by a double blind dose of either RPL554 6mg, 1.5mg or placebo (depending
      on treatment sequence) from a nebuliser in the morning on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3. The dose of
      RPL554 or placebo will be repeated in the evening on Day 1 and Day 2; there will not be an
      evening dose on Day 3.
