  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives and endpoints of this study will be analyzed in the study population of adults
      legally authorized to buy tobacco products. The study will describe the patterns of use of
      tobacco and nicotine containing products and self-reported health outcomes and health related
      events in CC (Cigarette) smokers and IQOS users in Japan.

      Note: The initial study record (posted to ClinicalTrials.gov) included a clinical sub-study
      designed to estimate population level differences in the biomarkers of exposure and clinical
      risk endpoints between iQOS users, CC smokers and never-smokers. However, due to low
      recruitment and retention of subjects, the clinical sub-study was terminated in May 2017 and
      the main study was terminated in March 2018. The study protocol was updated to remove the
      clinical sub-study objectives. This version of the study reflects the latest version of the
      updated study protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, open cohort study of adults, legally authorized to
      purchase tobacco products in Japan. The study will describe the patterns of use of tobacco
      and nicotine containing products and self-reported health outcomes in CC smokers and IQOS
      users.

      For IQOS users, the date of initiation of IQOS use is the trigger for all study assessments
      in the study. However the process will be different for CC smokers for whom assessment timing
      will be based on the date of enrollment. IQOS users will be enrolled into the study at least
      two months after initiating use of IQOS (to ensure adoption of IQOS), but less than 12 months
      after initiating use of IQOS. The study assessments will start at the next appropriate study
      time point after enrollment.

      As this study is observational by design and is conducted in a post-market setting, adverse
      event (AE) reporting will follow the Sponsor's established post-market Safety Surveillance
      Procedures for spontaneously reported events. IQOS users will be reminded of the product
      quality complaints (including AEs) hotline that is available for all IQOS consumers in Japan.
