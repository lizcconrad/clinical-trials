    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pUMVC3-IGFBP2 plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      vaccine (IGFBP-2 vaccine) and combination chemotherapy work in treating patients with stage
      III-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer undergoing surgery. IGFBP-2 is a
      protein found in the blood and tumor cells of most who have been diagnosed with ovarian
      cancer. Too much IGFBP-2 has been associated with more invasive disease. Vaccines made from
      DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express
      IGFBP-2. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving IGFBP-2 vaccine and combination
      chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with stage III-IV ovarian, fallopian tube,
      or primary peritoneal cancer undergoing surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of an IGFBP-2 vaccine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases
      the rate of complete pathologic response (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of an IGFBP-2 vaccine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases
      progression free survival at 12 months.

      II. Determine whether the addition of an IGFBP-2 vaccine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves
      overall survival.

      III. To determine whether IGFBP-2 vaccination in combination with chemotherapy increases the
      level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in the tumor.

      IV. To assess the level of IGFBP-2 type 1 helper cells (Th1) elicited with vaccination
      concurrent with chemotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether there is a predictive genomic signature for CR induction when IGFBP-2
      vaccination is used in combination with chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour
      followed by IGFBP-2 vaccine intradermally (ID) 2 weeks later. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of 3 courses, patients then undergo cytoreductive surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then once a
      year for 5 years.
