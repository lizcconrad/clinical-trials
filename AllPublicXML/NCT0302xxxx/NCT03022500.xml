          5. A patient with at least one measurable lesion of which the diameter is confirmed to be
             ≥ 10mm in spiral CT or multi-detector CT (MD CT), or ≥ 20 mm in conventional CT (it
             should be used by a consistent method during the study period).

          6. If patients have brain metastasis with neurological symptom, they should be stabilized
             neurologically with prior radiotherapy or surgery for the brain metastasis (no
             neurologic symptom in progress and without further steroid treatment)

          7. Adequate hematologic (neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000
             cells/mm3), hepatic (transaminase ≤ upper normal limit(UNL)x2.5, bilirubin level ≤
             UNLx1.5), and renal (creatinine ≤ UNL) function

          8. A patient with the willingness to comply with the study protocol during the study
             period and capable of complying with it.

          9. A patient who signed the informed consent prior to the participation of the study and
             who understands that he/she has a right to withdrawal from participation in the study
             at any time without any disadvantages - Absolute neutrophil count 1,500 cells/mm3,
             platelets 100,000 cells/mm3

         10. Expected survival ≥ 3 months

         11. Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential (ie, post-menopausal by
             history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause;
             or history of hysterectomy, or history of bilateral tubal ligation, or history of
             bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A patient with no measurable disease

          2. chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication

          3. has received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start

             years- are not excluded) or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents

             at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an
             equivalent corticosteroid

         17. Receipt of the last dose of anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal
