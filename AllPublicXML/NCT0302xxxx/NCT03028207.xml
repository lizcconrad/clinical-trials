  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide and hence, estimating its prevalence is important. Since 2007, there are few data
      on the prevalence of COPD in the general population in Spain. The main objective of this
      epidemiological observational study is to estimate the prevalence of COPD in residents of
      Spain among the population over 40 years of age. The subjects will be distributed in two
      groups depending on the presence and absence of COPD. The study will have a single visit in
      which a brief interview will take place and subjects will need to complete the medical tests
      the case report form with a series of questionnaires. No drugs will be administered in this
      study.

    <measure>Number of subjects with COPD in Spain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of COPD in the subjects will be calculated according to the spirometric criteria, considering that a subject has COPD when the Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second/ Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/FVC) obtained in post-bronchodilator spirometry is less than 0.7. The prevalence of COPD according to the Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria will also be evaluated.</description>

It is a rapid screening test for dementia and its evolutionary staging. The test consists of 30 items and will explore five cognitive areas: orientation, fixation, concentration and calculation, memory and language. The total score will range from 0 to 30 points. If the score falls between 0-22, the subject will be considered to have a cognitive deficit and those achieving score from 23-30 will be concluded as subjects without a cognitive deficit.</description>
