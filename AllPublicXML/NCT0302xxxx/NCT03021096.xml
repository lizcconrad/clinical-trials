  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the timeline of pain following total shoulder replacement with
      the goal of developing data for a subsequent randomized trial. The investigators believe that
      with using HSS's current protocol, many patients have postoperative pain that is no worse
      than their preoperative pain. Previous HSS anesthesia protocols for total shoulder
      arthroplasty patients have not formally followed patients past their hospital discharge, and
      the investigators believe that some patients do experience moderate to severe subacute
      postoperative pain. Therefore, this study's primary outcome is to look at the numeric pain
      scores at 14 days after surgery. Future studies will look at measures of preventing bruising
      and subsequent pain after shoulder replacement.

      This is a pilot study, with the goals of

        1. developing data for a subsequent randomized trials

        2. describing the pain trajectory after total shoulder arthroplasty given comprehensive
           multimodal perioperative analgesia

        3. gathering preliminary data about which shoulder arthroplasty patients are at high risk
           for moderate or severe postoperative pain (NRS with movement, POD14, moderate &gt;= 4- 6;
           Gerbershagen 2011; severe &gt;= 7-10, Krebs 2007) Potential factors include fibromyalgia
           score, catastrophizing score, anxiety/depression score, gender, preoperative opioid use

        4. gathering preliminary data on the potential association between the predictors listed in
           (c) and NRS pain score with movement on POD 14.

        5. estimating incidence and severity of postoperative bruising on POD 14
