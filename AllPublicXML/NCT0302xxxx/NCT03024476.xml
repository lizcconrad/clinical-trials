      BOSS-Trial I is a phase 2 clinical trial with the following objectives;

        1. to prove the feasibility of a Bluetooth-equipped sphygmomanometer system in real-world
           clinical practice and wireless connection to the main server;

        2. to prove the feasibility of the BP management strategy, including the pre-specified BP
           range, BP management algorithm, and behavioral; and

        3. to gather information for the phase 3 trial including BP variability indices and their
           potentials as a treatment guidance.

      -  Elevated blood pressure is an established risk factor for recurrent stroke and vascular
           events in ischemic stroke survivors, but

        -  Current guideline (JNC VIII) has omitted or only partially covered a number of practical
           and important issues as follow;

             -  When and how we measure blood pressure?

             -  Is it justifiable to apply the same blood pressure threshold for office BP and home
                BP?

             -  Should stroke survivors be treated by the same BP goal for non-stroke subjects?

             -  Is it justifiable to apply the universal BP threshold for different mechanisms of
                ischemic stroke?

             -  Is it really about only blood pressure or might it really be &quot;beyond blood
                pressure?&quot;

        -  Lifestyle modification should accompany all the pharmacological intervention but is
           usually in adequate to initiate behavioral changes.

        -  Frequent BP measurement at home will provide more detailed and reliable information than
           occasional office BP's.

    <description>Description:
Interventions in the intensive management arm consist of 1) behavioral intensification and 2) pharmacological intensification based on olmesartan
Participants will be given a wireless Bluetooth-equipped sphygmomanometer system, which is connected to the main server through the participants' own smartphone. Every blood pressure and heart rate measured will be encrypted and stored in the main server (Identical for both intervention and control groups).
Regarding behavioral intensification, an automated texting and call for breakthrough visit will be sent from the main server to encourage regular measurements of BP and maintain a desirable goad of BP.
Regarding pharmacological intensification, a specific algorithm for BP-lowering medication prescription will be provided to the responsible physicians by the steering committee.</description>

    <description>Description:
Other than a bluetooth-equipped sphygmomanometer, standard managements abiding by the most current guideline will be provided from the responsible physicians.

Every blood pressure and heart rate measured will be encrypted and stored in the main server (Identical for both intervention and control groups).</description>

    <intervention_name>Behavioral intensification</intervention_name>
    <description>Suggested algorithm for behavioral intensification:
If frequency of BP measurement ≤5 in a week, send a texting message
If frequency of BP measurement ≤3 in a week, make a telephone contact by research nurse
Target range of home-systolic blood pressure: 110 - 135
If rate of outlier exceeds 50% in a week (based on ≥5 measurements in a week), make a telephone contact by research nurse (applied at least 2 weeks after randomization). A call for breakthrough visit may be issued when clinically required (decided by the institutional investigator)
If frequency of BP measurement ≥ 10 in a week and frequency of outlier = 0 in a week, send a texting message to encourage and compliment on excellent BP management</description>

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Pharmacological intensification based on olmesartan</intervention_name>
    <description>Study drug will be provided from the roll-in period.
Step I:
Use olmesartan 20 mg only if mean systolic blood pressure ≤150 mm Hg during the immediate past 2 days
Use olmesartan 40 mg if mean systolic blood pressure &gt;150 during the immediate past 2 days
Step II: olmesartan 20 mg or 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg
Step III: olmesartan 20 mg or 40 mg + amlodipine 10 mg
Step IV: olmesartan 20 mg or 40 mg + amlodipine 10 mg + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg
If blood pressure profile showed high degree variability to evoke clinical concern, consider discontinuation of hydrochlorothiazide or reduction of olmesartan dose.
Use of beta-blockers is permitted if clinically indicated.
At each clinic visit regardless of regular or breakthrough visit, follow the pharmacological intensification rule.</description>
