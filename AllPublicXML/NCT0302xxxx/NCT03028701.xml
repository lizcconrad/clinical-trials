      The overall objective is to asses the bronchodilator effect of single dose of
      Formoterol/Budesonide 12/400 mcg fixed combination delivered via Discair® in patients with
      COPD.

      Spirometric measurements (FEV1, FVC) will be performed for a period of 12 h at 12 different
      times: pretreatment (prior to the first dose) and posttreatment (15. min, 30. min, 1 hr, 2
      hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 10 hr ve 12 hr).

      The overall objective is to asses the bronchodilator effect of single dose of
      Formoterol/Budesonide 12/400 mcg fixed dose combination delivered via Discair® in patients
      with COPD.

      Patients will be assigned to receive single dose of Formoterol/Budesonide 12/400 mcg fixed
      dose combination delivered via Discair® (test product, n = 33). Patients will be evaluated at
      4 consecutive visits: baseline (enrollment), screening, treatment, and end of treatment (24h
      after treatment).

      For newly diagnosed and formerly diagnosed patients who are not on COPD medication, the
      screening visit will be performed on the day of enrollment. For formerly diagnosed patients
      receiving COPD treatment, the day of the screening visit will be based on the completion of a
      run-in period, with the length determined by the specific medication. During the run-in
      period, salbutamol (100 μg inhaler) will be prescribed as a rescue medication.

      Spirometric measurements (FEV1, FVC) will be performed for a period of 12 h at 12 different
      times: pretreatment (prior to the first dose) and posttreatment (15. min, 30. min, 1 hr, 2
      hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 10 hr ve 12 hr).
