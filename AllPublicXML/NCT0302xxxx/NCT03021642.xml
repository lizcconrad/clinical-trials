  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, randomized, crossover trial to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of tepotinib in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four volunteers will be randomized
      to one of the two treatment sequences: Sequence A: test, reference, Sequence B: reference,
      test. The reference treatment refers to the current Phase II film-coated tablet (5 * 100
      milligram (mg) tepotinib film-coated tablets) and the test treatment to the new Phase III
      film-coated tablet (1 * 500 mg film-coated tepotinib tablet).
