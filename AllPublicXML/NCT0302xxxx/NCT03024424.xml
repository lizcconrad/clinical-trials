    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are:

      To assess the impact of genetic testing based on how it alters behaviors, to assess the
      utility of serum biomarker measurement in combination with genetic testing, to assess the
      utility of genetic counseling in personal analysis of risk for age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD), and to assess the impact of presymptomatic genetic testing for choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV).
