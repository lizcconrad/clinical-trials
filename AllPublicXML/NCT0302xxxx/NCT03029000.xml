  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A, multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study to assess effects of a 5-day regimen
      of 10 μg/kg of tbo-filgrastim administered sc daily on the mobilization of CD34+ cells in at
      least 60 healthy male and female donors. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of tbo-filgrastim will be assessed .
