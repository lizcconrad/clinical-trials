  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was reported that satisfactory postoperative outcome was difficult to obtain for the
      pelvic or acetabular fracture in old people. The less invasive surgical method was conducted
      in this study. Then, the clinical results were compared with the patients treated using
      traditional methods to assess the less invasive method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic or acetabular fractures were caused by high energy trauma, which may lead to poor
      prognosis for the old. The patients over 60 years were included in this study. The surgical
      procedure was conducted in two weeks. The less invasive methods involved Stoppa approach and
      novel plate. The data including surgical time, blood loss and results of follow-up were
      recorded. The clinical results were compared with the patients treated using traditional
      methods. Thus, the clinical outcome of Pelvic or acetabular fractures in old man was
      assessed.
