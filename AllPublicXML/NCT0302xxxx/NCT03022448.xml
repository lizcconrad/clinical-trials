    <textblock>
      The aim of the non-interventional study is to prospectively collect and analyze data on the
      geriatric assessment of patients undergoing systemic 1st line therapy with trabectedin with
      focus on patients who have been assessed by the treating physician as being unsuited to
      receive standard chemotherapy with anthracyclines and / or ifosfamide.

      Trabectedin will be used according to the local SmPC. Modification of the treatment schedule
      should follow the standard medical practice at the discretion of the treating physician and
      is not part of this Observational Plan.
