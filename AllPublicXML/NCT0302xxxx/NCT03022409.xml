  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This biomarker window basket study has been designed with the intent of assessing the effects
      of different agents in both tumour tissue and peripheral samples to further inform optimal
      combinations of DDR agents with immuno-oncology (IO) therapies and the suitable sequencing
      and relative timing of these therapies.

      In the first instance 2 DDR agents will be assessed as monotherapy. Based on emerging data
      additional arms may be incorporated to evaluate other DDR agents and/or DDR and immunotherapy
      agents in combination or in series.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate immune activation due to DDR inhibition
      by monitoring the induction of TH1/IFNg response in tumours of patients treated with study
      investigational agent(s)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are dosed for a minimum of 10 days with the investigational agent. Surgery can then
      be scheduled at any time between day 11 and day 21 (with a margin of + 3 days to allow for
      any unexpected event) but must occur within 0 to 3 days following three consecutive
      investigational drug product administration days. During the treatment period, safety
      assessments must be completed at least weekly.

      The Follow Up visit will be completed after surgical resection has been completed and can be
      aligned with the standard post-surgery follow up visit. If this follow up visit occurs prior
      to 30 days after the final dose, a further visit or telephone call must be conducted to
      follow up on AE resolution or any late emerging AEs.

      Patients will receive investigational agent(s) for a minimum of 10 days and a maximum of 3
      weeks. The duration of dosing with any investigational agent will be dependent on the timing
      of their planned surgery.
