      A retrospective data review of 243 pregnant women (â‰¤32 wks gestational age), dtat collected
      prior to 5/18/2014, with GDM, or T2DM, and their infants (until discharge from the hospital,
      typically up to 1 week after deliver) will be conducted. These women are of any age and all
      ethnic backgrounds delivering at St. Mary's Health Center.

      Maternal glucose control is considered to be a major determinant of neonatal outcome in
      pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Studies have examined the link between neonatal
      mortality and morbidity using specific mean preprandial or postprandial plasma glucose
      levels, however, have not taken into account the daily wide excursions that occur in maternal
      glucose levels. Limited data are available on glucose variability (GV) in pregnancy and
      affect on maternal or neonatal outcomes. A recent study amongst diabetics showed that glucose
      variability between two data points, a morning fasting blood glucose and an afternoon blood
      glucose, increased the rate of adverse neonatal outcomes1. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c),
      which has been considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diabetes control since the Diabetes Control
      and Complication Trial (DCCT)2, lacks the specificity to predict pregnancy outcomes. Through
      review of data, we propose to examine other methods of evaluating daily maternal glucose
      variations to determine the correlation to maternal and neonatal outcomes.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of glucose variability and/ or other
      elements on maternal and neonatal outcomes in the obese diabetic patient. We hypothesize that
      glucose variability will be a stronger indicator of neonatal outcome than A1c or any single
      given blood glucose value. Glucose variability, including the magnitude of hyperglycemia or
      the incidence of acute maternal hypo- or hyperglycemic events, will be explored. We
      hypothesise that obese pregnant women with higher magnitude of glucose fluctuations have more
      maternal and fetal co morbidities.
