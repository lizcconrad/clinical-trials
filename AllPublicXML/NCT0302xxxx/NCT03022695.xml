        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients 18 years or older with at least one diagnosed breast fibroadenoma.
             Diagnosis of fibroadenoma must be based on:

          -  clinical examination,

          -  women ≤ 40 years of age: ultrasound image alone; women &gt; 40 years of age: ultrasound
             image and mammogram,

          -  histological confirmation of fibroadenoma of the breast. Patient's fibroadenoma size
             as determined by ultrasound imaging: the longest diameter is limited to 25 mm. Women
             of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours
             prior to HIFU treatment. Patient must be able to understand the nature and the extent
             of the study and the procedures required and be willing and able to complete the
             screening and study procedures. Patient must give written informed consent (personally
             signed and dated) before completing any study-related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient with history of ipsilateral breast cancer within 5 years prior to study
             inclusion or radio therapy to the target breast within 5 years prior to study
             inclusion.

          -  Patient with implant on the treated breast.

          -  Patient with target fibroadenoma pre-treated by cryoablation or interstitial laser
             therapy within 12 month before recruiting for HIFU.

          -  Patient's fibroadenoma not clearly visible on the ultrasound images (in B mode) at the
             inclusion visit. Patient participating in other studies using drugs or medical devices
             within 3 months prior to study inclusion or during study participation including the
             follow-up period.
