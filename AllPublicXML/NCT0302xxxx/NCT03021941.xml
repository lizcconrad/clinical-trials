    <textblock>
      In August of 2014, the FDA approved ELELYSO for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
      for pediatric subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease. The recommended
      dosage for treatment-naïve adult and pediatric subjects 4 years of age and older is 60 units
      per kg of body weight administered every other week as a 60 to 120 minute intravenous
      infusion. As a postmarketing commitment, the Sponsor agreed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) in pediatric subjects
      with Type 1 Gaucher Disease. in at least 5 subjects with body weight less than 15 kg; at
      least 5 subjects with body weight 15 to less than 20 kg; and at least 5 subjects with body
      weight of 20-25 kg with Type 1 Gaucher disease dosed at 60 units/kg every other week.

      When applicable, PD measurements for children enrolled in the PK study may be obtained
      through the taliglucerase alfa registry (PMR 1895-5) and will include organ volumes (spleen
      and liver), hematological values (hemoglobin and platelets) as well as growth (height and
      weight) data. Safety data, including any serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as
      anaphylaxis, as well as changes in antibody status (ie, detection and titers of binding and
      neutralizing antibodies, and detection of IgE antibodies), will also be collected through the
      taliglucerase alfa registry.

    <textblock>
      This study (B3031003) is an open-label study in pediatric subjects with Type 1 Gaucher
      Disease to characterize PK, PD and safety following an infusion of taliglucerase alfa in at
      least 5 subjects with body weight less than 15 kg; at least 5 subjects with body weight 15 to
      less than 20 kg; and at least 5 subjects with body weight of 20-25 kg. The PK sample
      collection will take approximately 4 hours to complete and will be performed one month or up
      to 6 months after the subject's first taliglucerase infusion in the registry study. The
      subject will be contacted the day after the PK samples are collected to assess any continuing
      or new adverse events and to review the subject's concomitant medications. Body weight at the
      time of the PK blood draw will determine the weight category for each subject. Subjects
      enrolled into the study will be assigned the same unique subject number assigned to them in
      the registry study (B3031002). This will allow linkage to relevant data from the registry
      study for analysis in this study.

      For the purposes of this study, baseline evaluations will be obtained from the registry study
      and must be performed prior to the subject's first dose of taliglucerase alfa. The Month 6
      and Month 12 evaluations will be performed 6 months and 12 months after the start of
      taliglucerase alfa treatment, respectively.

      Subjects will be eligible for the PK study (B3031003) only if the PD assessments (spleen
      volume/size, hemoglobin/platelet counts and height/weight measurements) immunogenicity data
      and Gaucher disease diagnostic history are available from the registry study baseline visit
      and prior to the start of taliglucerase alfa treatment. If liver volume/size is available, it
      will also be analyzed but is not necessary for eligibility for the PK study.

      Pediatric subjects prescribed 60 units/kg of taliglucerase alfa every other week by their
      physician will be recruited from the registry study. Subjects can be screened for the PK
      study at the same time as they are enrolled into the registry study (ERT treatment-naïve
      subjects) or up to 6 months after they are enrolled into the registry study (previously ERT
      naïve subjects) if PD assessments (spleen volume/size, hemoglobin/platelet counts and
      height/weight measurements), immunogenicity data and Gaucher disease diagnostic history
      (residual enzyme activity and genotype data) were performed at baseline of the registry study
      and prior to the start of taliglucerase alfa treatment.

      Baseline data from the registry study for PD and immunogenicity testing are defined as PD
      measurements (spleen volume/size, liver volume/size (if available), hemoglobin and platelet
      counts and growth measures), Gaucher disease diagnostic history and immunogenicity samples
      that were collected at entry into the registry study and prior to the start of taliglucerase
      alfa treatment.

      For the secondary PD endpoints, spleen volume/size and liver volume/size (if available) will
      be measured using MRI, CT or ultrasound, whichever is the standard of care according to the
      investigator. The method used to measure spleen and liver volume/size at Baseline will be the
      same one used at Month 12. Change from Baseline and percent change from Baseline at Month 12
      of registry study will be calculated for spleen volume, liver volume (if available),
      hemoglobin and platelet counts, and growth measures (height, weight and Z-scores).

      For each subject enrolled in this study, safety data while on taliglucerase alfa, starting
      from the baseline visit (entry into the registry study) and continuing until 28 days after
      the Month 12 PD data collection visit, will be obtained for reporting.

      Safety assessments for the study will include collection of all adverse event and serious
      adverse event data, including serious hypersensitivity reactions, procedures for
      immunogenicity testing (ie, detection and titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies and
      detection of IgE antibodies) as well as vital signs taken as standard of care during
      infusions. A pre-dose blood sample for testing of antidrug antibodies (ADA) on the day of PK
      Sample Visit will be collected in an effort to assess the impact of immunogenicity on PK.

          3. Have had baseline (ie, prior to the first dose of study medication) PD measurements
             (spleen volume/size measured by MRI, CT or ultrasound, hemoglobin/platelet counts and
             growth measures including height and weight), immunogenicity sample collection and
             Gaucher disease diagnosis history documented in advance of treatment start.

          4. Presence of splenomegaly at baseline defined as spleen volume/size measurement of 5
             MN.

          5. Subjects prescribed the nominal dose of 60 units/kg every two weeks and can tolerate
             an infusion rate of 1 mL/min.

          6. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document from parent/legal
             guardian (or adult caregiver) capable of providing informed consent indicating that
             the subject's parent(s)/legal guardian has been informed of all pertinent aspects of
             the study before any screening procedures are performed. When age appropriate, written
             assent must also be obtained.

          7. Have parent/legal guardian (or adult caregiver) capable and willing to comply with
             scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant issue or the presence of a medical,
             emotional, behavioral or psychological condition that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would interfere with the subject's participation in the study, cause
             harm to the subject or decrease compliance with the study requirements.

          2. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the PK sample collection visit, whichever is
             longer.

          3. A diagnosis of Type 2 or 3 Gaucher disease, or the presence of neurological signs and
             symptoms characteristic of Type 2 or 3 Gaucher disease.

          4. Any change during the registry study to the subjects dose of taliglucerase alfa
             infusion (ie, change from 60 units/kg every two weeks to a different dose of
             taliglucerase alfa) or a change in infusion duration or rate or a change of ERT
             medication (ie, switch from taliglucerase alfa to a different ERT).

          5. In the judgment of the Investigator, the subject's vital signs (eg, blood pressure,
             pulse) prior to infusion on the day of the PK visit indicate that participation in the
             study would not be in the study candidate's best interest.

          6. A hemoglobin level of &lt;10 g/dL within 30 days of the PK sample visit or on the day of
             the PK sample visit.
