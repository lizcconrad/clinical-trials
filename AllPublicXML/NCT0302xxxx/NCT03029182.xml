  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the utility of hypoxic exercise training to improve cardiovascular
      and metabolic health among obese breast cancer survivors. While participants exercise, a
      lower fraction of inspired oxygen will be used to simulate a higher altitude. This approach
      removes the mechanical strain needed to sustain moderate-to-vigorous exercise intensity which
      is believed to support exercise tolerance. Participants are randomized to either the
      treatment (walking+simulated-altitude) or control (walking under normoxic conditions).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors have a two-fold greater risk of having one or more functional limitations
      compared to those without a history of cancer. Though exercise interventions in breast cancer
      survivors exist, a large portion of women (61%) exhibit some form of lower-body dysfunction
      that severely restricts participation in physical activity and exercise. Both physical and
      emotional well-being are negatively affected by the combination of increased adiposity,
      orthopedic problems and muscle weakness, thus reinforcing a cycle of physical inactivity.

      For these reasons, obese breast cancer survivors with walking limitations are faced with a
      barrier that greatly increases the difficulty of meeting prescribed exercise guidelines (≥150
      weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise). Though previous investigations
      have demonstrated the safety and benefits of exercise+simulated altitude to improve body fat,
      physical endurance and insulin sensitivity, results have been limited to non-cancer
      participants only. Given the comorbidities common to breast cancer survivors, specifically,
      heart disease risk, lower body joint problems, low aerobic capacity, and fatigue, further
      research is needed.
