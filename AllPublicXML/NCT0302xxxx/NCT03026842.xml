  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common hematological malignancies in adult patients
      with leukemia, and t(8;21) AML accounts for a substantial proportion of AML. AML patients
      with t(8;21) possess a favorable outcome and 3 - 4 course high dose cytarabine (3 g/m2) is
      the standard consolidation therapy for these patients with a 5-year overall survival
      approximately 60%. In China, intermediate dose cytarabine (1 - 2 g/m2) is used for
      consolidation therapy due to toxicities. After 3 - 4 course cytarabine consolidation,
      maintenance therapy is performed with conventional chemotherapy with a 5-year overall
      survival approximately 60% as well. However, continuous chemotherapy may cause toxicities and
      inhibit patients' immune response. Exploring new drug for maintenance therapy is urgently
      needed. Decitabine has a potent ability to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of
      AML1-ETO positive leukemia cell line. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effect of decitabine
      was also reported by several studies. In this study, the investigators plan to carry out a
      prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trail to compare decitabine versus
      conventional chemotherapy for maintenance therapy of patients with AML with t(8;21). Results
      of this trial may optimize the treatment for AML patients with t(8;21) in the setting of
      intermediate dose cytarabine consolidation.
