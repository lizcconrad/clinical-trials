  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation approaches introduce a stimulus to a motor system, with the goal to enhance
      motor function to patients. For example, exposure to brief and intermittent episodes of mild
      hypoxia has shown to strengthen synaptic pathways to respiratory and skeletal muscle motor
      neurons. In humans with spinal cord injury, exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH) alone or in
      combination with rehabilitative strategies has shown enhanced motor function. Another
      strategy known as inspiratory threshold loading, which involves breathing against pressure
      threshold loads, results in improved inspiratory muscle strength. Although there is evidence
      supporting the use of IH alone or in combination with other rehabilitative strategies in
      improving motor function in humans, the impact of exposure to IH or IH with inspiratory
      threshold loading on inspiratory muscle function and ventilation in humans is unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test whether exposure to IH alone and in combination with inspiratory
      threshold loading (ITL) will result in increased inspiratory muscle strength and ventilation.

      Investigators will use a Latin square, repeated measures design which will consist of 12
      subjects participating in four experimental conditions.There will be an interval of 1 week
      between each of the four conditions, which will serve as a washout period.

      At the end of each of the 5 sessions, the subjects will rest in a reclining chair for 15
      minutes while their heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and breathing are
      monitored. Subjects that have a blood systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 or diastolic pressure &gt;
      90 or SPO2 &lt; 92% will be asked to remain in the laboratory for 15 additional minutes and the
      vital signs will be repeated. If the blood pressure and/or peripheral capillary oxygen
      saturation (SPO2) remain outside of the criteria mentioned above, the subject will be
      instructed to seek assessment by their health provider and the incident will be reported to
      the Institutional Review Board. Subjects will also be asked to report any discomfort.

    <masking_description>We will use a Latin square, repeated measures design which will consist of 12 subjects participating in the following four experimental conditions: There will be an interval of 1 week between each of the four conditions, which will serve as a washout period.
IH+ITL: Subjects will be exposed to a session of IH (45 minutes, 2 minutes of hypoxia alternating with 1 minute of hyperoxia) followed by 5 sets of ITL at 80%MIP (10 breaths per set).
IH: Subjects will only be exposed to a session of intermittent hypoxia.
Sham IH +ITL: Subjects will be exposed to a single 45-minute session of sham IH (normoxia). This will consist of the subject breathing room air (FiO2=21%) through a 4 way valve connected to the hypoxicator. Exposure to normoxia will be followed by 5 sets of ITL at 80%MIP (10 breaths per set).
Sham IH: Subjects will be exposed to a single 45-minute session of sham IH (normoxia) alone.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Inspiratory Pressure will be measured across all groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between 15, 30, and 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal Inspiratory Pressure(MIP) which is a measure of inspiratory muscle strength will be measured as the MIP recorded at the mouth by a pressure manometer. Subjects will be seated upright in a comfortable chair and the nose occluded with clips. After exhaling to residual volume (RV), subjects place their lips around the mouthpiece and inspire as forcefully as possible for at least three seconds. Repeated measurements will be taken, with a 1- to 2-min rest between trials, until three measurements are obtained within 5% variability. Of these three values, the best MIP will be recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilatory responses to inspiratory loading will be measured across all groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between 15, 30, and 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to breathe as forcefully as possible against a inspiratory load( 2-4 sets of 5 repetitions) of either 40% of their maximal inspiratory pressure(MIP) or at 41CmH2O (lowest of the two as the maximum resistance offered by the device is 41CmH2O) using a inspiratory muscle training (IMT) device. During this task, a respiratory monitor will be connected to the IMT device. Parameters such as the inspiratory flow, volume and pressure generated by the subjects while breathing against the load will be recorded. Imposed work of breathing (WOBi) will be calculated as a product of the pressure generated and the inspired tidal volume when breathing against a fixed load (40%MIP).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) will be measured across all groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between 15, 30, and 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To record P0.1, the subjects will breathe through a mouth piece connected to a 2 way respiratory valve in a closed circuit. As the subjects breathe through the circuit, the inspiratory valve will be manually occluded during the expiratory phase and the occlusion will be maintained till the end of next inspiration. Occlusion will be random in order to prevent the subjects from getting conscious about the occlusions. The circuit is connected to the respiratory monitor and the negative pressure recorded in the first 100 milliseconds of the occluded breath will be recorded as the subject's P0.1.
3 such recordings will be obtained and the highest pressure amongst the 3 trials will be considered for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) will be measured across all groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between 15, 30, and 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate Variability (HRV): HRV will be assessed to determine the autonomic response to intermittent hypoxia. HRV will be measured using a 3 lead ECG and HRV recording kit.</description>
