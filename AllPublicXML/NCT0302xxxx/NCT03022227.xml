  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants (CIs) are medical devices now widely used in persons with severe to
      profound hearing loss. After a six month to one-year period following implantation, adults
      typically reach optimal fitting parameters, which lead to a stabilized hearing performance
      with their CI. At this stage, they usually enter a routine clinical after-care program, which
      involves regular appointmentsattheir CI center. Such visits aim at identifying any
      complication, which can be medical (abnormal cutaneous healing evolution) and/or device
      related, as well as any declinein performance (possibly related to the former). In France,
      the HAS (French Health Authority) recommends CI users tobe seen around threetimes a year
      during the second and third years after implantation, and then annually. While the schedule
      of appointments remains dependent on centers' practices, there is some kind of consensus
      about the minimal content of a long-term follow-up session:medical consultation, CI external
      parts checking, free field aided tonal audiometry, fitting adjustments if necessary,speech
      understanding assessments.

      Our center (CRIC) is one of the biggest French CI implant centers approved by the HAS,
      providing after-care for no less than 750 CI users, most of whomhave entered their long-term
      follow-up period. For some, attending follow-up appointments may need several hours, require
      taking a half-day off work, and entail travel expenses. Some patients may also have
      associated disabilities making it difficultto reach the center.Moreover, although the cohort
      of patients has increased over the years, the number of trained professionals and the
      clinical care infrastructures have not evolved proportionally. As a consequence, there is a
      need to reduce the number of routine visits, to allow more scope for complex cases andto
      efficiently identify issues.

      Remote consultation seems to address all the points listed above. However, it appears that
      little has been doneto develop remote after-care for cochlear implant recipients. Published
      studies mainly focus on the fitting aspects.

      The development of telemedicine has become one of the key priorities of the French government
      over the past few years, and it is now feasible thanks to the development of high speed
      connections (ADSL, mobile internet, high definition transmissions). Promoting telemedicine
      has several goals, the main one being to extend health care services to underserved patients
      in remote locations; it also allows some medical units to be freed upand to reserve
      infrastructures and professionals for patients requesting critical care. Of course,
      telemedicine is also meant to save costs.

      The objectif of this protocole is to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine applied to
      adult cochlear implant users' follow-up by comparing the data of the medical consultation and
      speech therapy assessment, carried out in the CRIC service and videoconferencing when the
      patient is home, using his computer equipment to communicate with the CRIC.
