  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study measuring physiologic and behavioral correlates of symptom severity in
      adult patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete questionnaires regarding their GERD-related symptoms and have a visit
      with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. We will measure heart rate variability and
      galvanic skin response in patients during the visits and video record the visits. Subjects
      will complete a daily GERD symptom diary for 2 weeks and then return to the study center to
      complete additional questionnaires and an exit interview.
