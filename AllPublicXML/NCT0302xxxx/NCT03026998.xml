    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of MR screening for asymptomatic head &amp;
      neck (or CNS) second primary cancers occurring in hereditary retinoblastoma patients
      previously treated by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hereditary retinoblastoma treated during infancy by external beam radiation
      therapy (EBRT) the risk of second primary cancer occurring within radiation fields is high.
      The aim of this study is to depict by MRI secondary tumors as early as possible, before the
      occurrence of clinical symptoms. Affected patients will be further managed in a national
      expert center with dedicated diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, the benefit of
      such management has to be assessed in terms of prognosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Personal history of hereditary retinoblastoma (i.e., familial history of
             retinoblastoma, or bilateral retinoblastoma, or unilateral multifocal retinoblastoma,
             or identified germline RB1 mutation or 13q deletion)

          -  External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) used for retinoblastoma treatment

          -  Age at inclusion between 7 and 35 years

          -  Time period between the end of EBRT and inclusion date of 5 years or more

          -  Written informed consent signed by patient (or legal representative)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Personal history of non-familial unilateral unifocal retinoblastoma without RB1
             germline mutation.

          -  Personal history of second primary neoplasm occurring within radiation fields

          -  Contraindication for MRI (pacemaker, intraocular metallic foreign body, defibrillators
             or other implanted electronic devices, intracranial ferro-magnetic clips) or
             associated conditions preventing from MR examination (intraocular prostheses and
             implants are not a contraindication for MRI; orthodontic metallic devices are not a
             contraindication but might decrease the image quality and should be removed, if
             possible)
