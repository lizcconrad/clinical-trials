  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser therapy has been proposed as a novel treatment option in controlling subgingival
      microorganisms. This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluates the effect of 980nm diode
      laser as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the management of chronic
      periodontitis (CP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional mechanical debridement can achieve a temporary decrease in the subgingival
      levels of Pg along with other pathogens. However, mechanical therapy alone may fail to
      eliminate pathogenic bacterial niches in inaccessible areas like deep pockets, root
      concavities, furcation areas etc. In search of more efficient and less traumatic techniques
      to improve periodontal healing, researchers proposed the use of lasers in periodontal
      therapy.

      The adjunctive use of lasers with conventional tools may facilitate treatment and have the
      potential to improve healing. The diode laser is highly absorbed in hemoglobin and other
      pigments and is excellent for use in soft tissue surgical procedures.Laser application in
      improving clinical outcome in periodontal therapy, needs to be further investigated with well
      designed clinical trials. The investigators attempted to evaluate the efficacy of diode laser
      as an adjunct to SRP in the management of CP by evaluating clinical parameters coupled with
      quantitative estimation of P.gingivalis using Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
      assay.
