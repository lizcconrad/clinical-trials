  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex
      neurosurgical lesions that are very challenging to manage. Spinal vascular malformations
      account for 3%-4% of all intradural spinal cord mass lesions. Over the last few decades our
      understanding of these lesions has dramatically increased thanks to neuroimaging technology
      (e.g. spinal angiography and indocyanine green angiography). Various treatment modalities
      including conservative observation, endovascular embolization, microsurgical resection,
      radiation therapy, and combined therapies have been reported. The treatment for these AVMs
      and AVFs depends on their location, the type of malformation, the area of the spine involved,
      and the condition of the patient at the time of treatment. Due to the rarity of these spinal
      vascular lesions, reports of their management and outcomes have been limited to small series
      and case reports. And the rates of obliteration and outcomes are not satisfactory, especially
      the spinal AVMs. Spinal vascular lesions are rare but represent a formidable challenge for
      the treating neurosurgeon.The purpose of this study is to establish multimodality treatment
      mode and evaluate the anatomical cure rate and functional preservation rate.

      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational, registration study. There are nine centers
      involved in the study. The investigators set up a more detailed classification system for
      spinal vascular malformations. In accordance with inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria,
      this cohort study will include 380 samples in the study period of three years. According to
      the spinal angiography, the correct diagnosis and treatment strategy will be made. The
      minimally invasive surgical treatment methods and new techniques will be adopted such as
      spinal superselective angiography, preoperative embolization, intraoperative
      electrophysiological monitoring, intraoperative angiography, etc. All the enrolled patients
      will be visited a total of four times, postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7, followed
      up postoperative 3 months and 12 months. The anatomical cure rate and spinal cord function
      will be assessed objectively. All data will be recorded in the network database platform.
