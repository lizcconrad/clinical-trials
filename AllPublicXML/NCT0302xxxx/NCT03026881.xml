  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor; Apatinib is an oral
      selective VEGFR inhibitor. This open-label, dose finding phase I trial studies the
      tolerability and the best dose of Fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and paclitaxel and
      to see how well this three drugs work together in the treatment of patients with recurrent
      and metastatic gastric cancer who progress following first-line therapy. The safety and
      efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and paclitaxel will be explored.
