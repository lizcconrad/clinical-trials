      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of printing layer thickness on accuracy
      of computer aided surgical guide

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Computer aided surgical guide has many variables that affect its accuracy , in this study one
      variable is considered that may affect the accuracy of surgical guide which is printing of
      layer thickness of surgical guide whether 50 micron or 100 micron.

      computer aided surgical guide is constructed by imaging the patient pre-operative cone beam
      CT wearing scan appliance , then virtual implant placement on special soft ware ( Blue sky
      Bio ) and optical scanning of patient casts , afterword superimposition of the virtual
      implants on the scanned casts to design the surgical guide and printing on 3D printer (
      Zenith 3D printer , Dentis , Korea ) with printing layer thickness 50 micron in first group
      and 100 micron in second group . Fixation of surgical guide in patient mouth and drilling of
      implant osteotomy through the guiding sleeves , post-operative Cone Beam CT with the same
      apparatus and setting as pre-operative scan .

      Finally, the pre-operative and post operative scans were then overlapped to measure linear
      and angular deviation of the virtually planned and actual implants position.
