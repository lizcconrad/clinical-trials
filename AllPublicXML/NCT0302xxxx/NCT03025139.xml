  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well mindfulness meditation or survivorship
      education work in improving behavioral symptoms in younger stage 0-III breast cancer
      survivors. Behavioral interventions, such as mindfulness meditation, use techniques to help
      patients change the way they react to environmental triggers that may cause a negative
      reaction. Survivorship education after treatment may reduce stress and improve the well-being
      and quality of life of patients with breast cancer. Mindfulness meditation or survivorship
      education may help improve the health behaviors of younger breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of two different types of group interventions (mindfulness and
      survivorship education), specifically tailored to the needs of younger female breast cancer
      survivors, in reducing depressive symptoms, compared to a usual care control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of the two interventions relative to a usual care control group on
      fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms.

      II. To examine the efficacy of the two interventions relative to a usual care control group
      on circulating and genomic markers of inflammation.

      III. To explore potential moderators and mediators of intervention efficacy in the two
      intervention groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A (MINDFULNESS AWARENESS PRACTICES [MAPs]): Patients attend a mindfulness meditation
      class over 2 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients then attend in person booster sessions
      that include guided meditation, questions, and discussion of how to maintain a mindfulness
      practice over 1 hour once monthly for 3 months.

      ARM B (SURVIVORSHIP EDUCATION INTERVENTION [SE]): Patients attend a survivorship education
      class over 2 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also receive monthly electronic
      newsletters with tailored information about topics of interest to younger survivors,
      including cancer-related events in the community and tips about following through on
      recommendations for healthy living.

      ARM C (USUAL CARE/DELAYED TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP): Patients receive usual care for 9 months.
      Patients are then offered a choice of participating in Arm A or Arm B.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The data will be analyzed using linear mixed effects models, with fixed effects for time and condition and random effects for individuals. Differences between conditions in change over time will be examined by testing condition-by-time interaction terms. All tests will be two-sided. The Hochberg procedure will be applied to the two p-values for each intervention to control the familywise error rate at 0.05.</description>
