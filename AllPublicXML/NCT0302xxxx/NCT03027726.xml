      Background: The global pandemic obesity has led to increased risk for prediabetes and type 2
      diabetes (T2D).

      Objectives: (i) To evaluate the effect of a 22 weeks multidisciplinary intervention program
      including exercise on T2D risk in pre-adolescents with high risk to develop T2D, and (ii) To
      identify the profile of microRNA in circulating exosomes and in blood peripheral mononuclear
      cells in pre-adolescents with high risk to develop T2D and its response to a
      multidisciplinary intervention program including exercise.

      Background: The global pandemic obesity has led to increased risk for prediabetes and type 2
      diabetes (T2D).

      Objectives: (i) To evaluate the effect of a 22 weeks multidisciplinary intervention program
      including exercise on T2D risk in pre-adolescents with high risk to develop T2D, and (ii) To
      identify the profile of microRNA in circulating exosomes and in blood peripheral mononuclear
      cells in pre-adolescents with high risk to develop T2D and its response to a
      multidisciplinary intervention program including exercise.

      Design, participants and methods: A total of 84 children with high risk of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus aged 8-12 years will be included and randomly assigned to control (N=42) or
      intervention (N=42) groups. The control group will receive a family-based lifestyle education
      and psycho-educational program (2 days/month), while the intervention group will attend the
      same lifestyle education and psycho-educational program plus the exercise program (3
      days/week). The duration of training sessions will be 90 min of exercise, including warm-up,
      moderate to vigorous aerobic activities, and strength exercises. The following measurements
      will be evaluated at baseline prior to randomization and after the intervention: fasting,
      insulin glucose, and hemoglobin A1c; total and abdominal fat (dual X-ray absorptiometry);
      pancreatic, hepatic and visceral fat (magnetic resonance imaging); systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure; fasting leptin, adiponectin, fibroblast growth factor-21, fetuin-A,
      hs-C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alfa, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 and lipid
      profile; carotid intima-media thickness (ultrasonography), microRNA expression in circulating
      exosomes and in blood peripheral mononuclear cells (MiSeq-Illumina); functional peak aerobic
      capacity (cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 20m shuttle run test). Changes in dietary
      habits (food frequency questionnaire and two non-consecutive 24h recalls), physical activity
      and sleep (accelerometry); sex, age, socioeconomic status and pubertal status will be used as
      potential confounders.

      Discussion/Conclusions: Early prevention and identification of children with high risk to
      develop T2D could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.
