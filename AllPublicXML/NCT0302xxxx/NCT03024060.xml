    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prove the safety and efficacy of Levulan Kerastick
      (aminolevulinic acid HCl) for Topical Solution 20% followed by 10 J/cm2 of blue light
      delivered at 10 mW/cm2 or 20 mW/cm2 in the treatment of multiple actinic keratosis on the
      face or balding scalp (the Treatment Area), utilizing a 14-18 hour incubation period.
