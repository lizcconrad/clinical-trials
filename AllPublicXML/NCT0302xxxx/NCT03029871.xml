  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 1 trial is to determine the dose-dependent toxicity and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic gene therapy in
      combination with SBRT in medically inoperable stage I/IIA (T1A - T2B) NSCLC. To accomplish
      this objective, 9 subjects will be enrolled in the study. We hypothesize that the combined
      treatment will demonstrate acceptable toxicity, and that it will be feasible to quantify
      adenovirus-mediated HSV-1 TK gene expression in the lung by PET. This phase 1 trial will lay
      the foundation for a follow-up phase 2 trial designed to examine efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine subjects (3 cohorts, 3 subjects/cohort) with medically inoperable stage I/IIA (T1a -
      T2b) NSCLC with tumors measuring &gt; 2 to ≤ 5 cm will receive a single intratumoral injection
      of the oncolytic Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenovirus at one of three dose levels (1 x 1011
      vp, 3 x 1011 vp, 1 x 1012 vp). Depending on the location of the target lesion, the adenovirus
      will be injected either transbronchially (central tumors) or percutaneously under computed
      tomography (CT)-guidance (peripheral tumors). Two days later, subjects will be administered
      (orally) a 10 day course of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and valganciclovir (vGCV) prodrug therapy
      along with 48 Gy (4 fractions of 12 Gy) of SBRT. Prior to and following the adenovirus
      injection, subjects will be administered [18F]-FHBG, a HSV-1 TK substrate, and will undergo
      PET imaging to quantify HSV-1 TK gene expression. Toxicity assessments will occur twice a
      week for the first 2 weeks and then at scheduled follow-up visits through 60 months. The
      primary endpoint is toxicity. Secondary endpoints include 1) tumor (radiological) response,
      2) local, regional, and distal tumor control, 3) progression-free and overall survival, and
      4) quality of life. Exploratory endpoints include 1) intensity, persistence, and
      biodistribution of HSV-1 TK gene expression, and 2) association of select serum biomarkers
      with toxicity and tumor response.

             effective means of birth control throughout and for 60 days beyond the treatment phase
             of the study.

          -  Subjects must possess the ability to give informed consent and express a willingness
             to meet all of the expected requirements of the protocol for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free
             for a minimum of 2 years (e.g., carcinomas in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or
             cervix are permissible). Subjects with previous lung cancer are permitted if the
             subject is disease-free for a minimum of 2 years or if this is a solitary recurrence
             in the lung measuring &gt; 2 cm and ≤ 5 cm after surgery.

          -  Any known metastatic disease. Subjects may have MX status (e.g., lung nodules that are
             being observed).

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation therapy fields.

          -  Prior chemotherapy for the study cancer.

          -  Plans for the subject to receive other local therapy (including standard fractionated
             radiotherapy and/or surgery and/or other local ablative therapies) while on this
             study, except in the case of disease progression.
