      The assessor is responsible for all clinical procedure that will be conducted in this study
      during all the visits:

      Panoramic radiograph and periapical radiographs will be made on the prospected abutment teeth
      to evaluate the crown-root ratio, the apical condition of the abutment and their alveolar
      bone support.

      The preliminary impression will be performed with irreversible hydro-colloid impression
      material (alginate), The impressions will be poured with type IV dental stone to obtain
      diagnostic casts. Maxillary Face-bow will be recorded. The diagnostic casts will be mounted
      on semi adjustable articulator in centric occluding relation to evaluate the interarch
      distance and occlusal plane.

      Special trays will be constructed and Mouth preparation will be performed by preparing
      guiding planes and rests seats will be prepared opposing to the edentulous area.

      Final impression will be taken by elastomeric impression material. The impression will be
      poured into type IV dental stone in order to obtain master cast. The master cast will be
      surveyed. The proposed design will be as follows: metal framework base saddle for edentulous
      areas on both sides connected with palatal strap. Aker's clasp on all abutments with buccal
      retention. The denture base will be tried in with acrylic teeth in patient's mouth. After
      that, the denture base of the partial denture will be processed incorporation with the metal
      framework into the two different materials to be evaluated. The first group will receive the
      partial denture in which the metal framework incorporated with the denture base fabricated
      from PEEK material. The second group will receive the partial denture in which the metal
      framework incorporated with the denture base material fabricated from BRE-FLEX

    <description>PEEK (poly-ether-ether-ketone) has been successfully used over the last years in the medical ﬁeld, and orthopedics, speciﬁcally. which presents high biocompatibility, good mechanical properties, high temperature resistance, and chemical stability due to a 4 GPa modulus of elasticity, it is as elastic as bone and can reduce stresses transferred to the abutment teeth. Additional advantages of this polymer material are elimination of allergic reactions and metallic taste, high polishing qualities, low plaque afﬁnity, and good wear resistance, it has only recently been used in dentistry.</description>

    <description>In the recent time thermoplastic materials (breflex) become quite popular in clinical practice such as nylon and acetal resins. since the 1950, polyamide resin (nylons) provide improved esthetics and reduction of rotational forces on the abutment teeth due to their low elastic modulus.</description>
