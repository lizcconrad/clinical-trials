      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance of StatSeal Advanced
      used in conjunction with the TR Band (SSA) as compared to the TR Band without SSA (TRB)
      relative to: the incidence of peri-procedural radial artery occlusion (RAO) at discharge or
      24 hours, whichever occurs first, and the Time to Hemostasis (TTH).

      This study is a physician initiated, prospective, observational, two arm, randomized study to
      be performed at up to four experienced 'Radial First' centers (UCSD, UCLA. Arkansas Heart
      Hospital and LBVA). A maximum of 180 patients having undergone successful radial
      catheterization will be enrolled in the study, 60 in each arm. 60 patients will be enrolled
      at the LBVA. Enrollment will continue at each site on discretion of the investigators until
      each center enrolls a minimum of 30 patients, or a maximum of 180 patients are enrolled.
      Clinicians will perform the catheterization in accordance with local standard practice, with
      a minimum of 5,000 units of unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation. At the start of the
      TRA procedure, prior to radial artery cannulation, a baseline Pleth-ox exam will be performed
      for all patients and recorded on the CRF. Ulnar compression will be applied to confirm that
      the radial artery is patent. Patients with a type D pattern exam will be excluded from the
      study. At the conclusion of a successful transradial procedure, the patient will be
      randomized to either SSA or TRB, each device applied per protocol &amp; IFU. It is hypothesized
      that if radial artery compression time can be shortened to 40 minutes or less, the following
      could result: improved catheterization lab efficiency, greater patient satisfaction and lower
      complication rates, including RAO, may be improved.

    <description>TR Band: Patients randomly assigned to the control group will have a TR band applied over the arteriotomy site and inflated with 15-18ml of air. After aspirating and clearing the contents of the sheath, the radial sheath will be removed. The TR band will be deflated until bleeding occurs, and 2 ml of air will be reintroduced to provide hemostasis. Patent hemostasis will be documented with plethysmography and oximetry as described below within 5 minutes after band application and removal, and within 30 min of discharge or after 24 hours. The TR band will be left inflated and in place for 2 hours following the procedure for all patients (regardless of diagnostic or PCI procedure), after which deflation attempts will commence.</description>

    <description>StatSeal: Patients randomly assigned to the experimental group will have a Statseal Advance (SSA) disc applied after withdrawing the radial sheath 2-4 cm. A Tegaderm dressing will be applied to secure the disc position. The TR band will be applied over the SSA disc with the center of the balloon (the green dot) over the center of the SSA disc. The TR band will be inflated with 8cc of air (which is typically occlusive pressure), and the sheath removed. No deflation will occur immediately. After 20 minutes of pressure, 3 cc of air will be removed from the TR band. After an additional 20 minutes (40 minutes after procedure), the TR band will be completely deflated, and the TR band left in place. After an additional 20 minutes (60 minutes after procedure) the TR band will be removed.</description>

          <title>Barbeau Class A</title>
          <description>A Barbeau test is performed to evaluate the patency of the radiopalmar arch. This is performed by compressing the radial artery for up to 2 minutes and observing the resulting waveform changes. The procedure can be performed in patients with Barbeau classification waveform A, B, or C. All patients received baseline assessment of the hand circulation using the Barbeauâs test on a scale A-D, A being patent radial artery. Patients who exhibit a type D waveform indicates an incomplete palmar arch.</description>
