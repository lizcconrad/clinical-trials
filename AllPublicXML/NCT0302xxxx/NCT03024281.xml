      Primary objectives:

        1. To investigate the prevalence of azole resistance in Aspergillus clinical isolates
           collected in participating hospitals in Taiwan

        2. To investigate the prevalence of azole resistance in Aspergillus environmental isolates
           in Taiwan

        3. To characterize the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in Aspergillus isolates in
           Taiwan

        4. To investigate the clonality of Aspergillus clinical and environmental isolates in
           Taiwan

        5. To describe the genetic relationships between local resistant strains with global
           strains

      Secondary objective:

        1. To describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of patients with proven
           or probable invasive aspergillosis

        2. To evaluate the clinical impact of azole resistance in patients with proven or probable
           invasive aspergillosis in a case-control study

      Cumulative evidence described the emergence and geographical expansion of azole-resistant
      Aspergillus fumigatus associated with azole treatment failure. Multiple amino acid
      substitutions in the cyp51A gene have been described to be associated with azole resistance
      that emerges during azole treatment, while a resistance mechanism, TR34/L98H mutation in
      cyp51A, has been linked to the agricultural use of azole fungicides in Europe, which have
      also been widely used in Taiwan for years. The current prevalence of azole-resistant
      Aspergillus isolates and mechanisms of azole resistance in Taiwan is not clear. Considering
      the potential of geographic migration of resistant isolates from neighboring countries and
      the possibility of emergence of locally revolved resistant strains, this 2-year multi-center
      project aims to investigate the prevalence rate of azole resistance in Aspergillus clinical
      and environmental isolates, to determine the molecular mechanisms of azole resistance, and to
      describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of Aspergillus diseases in
      Taiwan. Clinical and environmental Aspergillus isolates will be collected and examined, and
      clinical data from patients with Aspergillus diseases or colonization will be retrieved and
      analyzed. Through this study the investigators anticipate increase in awareness of prevalence
      and impact of azole resistance in patient safety in participating hospitals. In addition, the
      investigators may update Taiwan treatment guideline for aspergillosis on the basis of these
      evidence and knowledge.

        A total of 10 hospitals located in different geographic location of Taiwan will be invited
        to participate this project. These hospitals are selected based on three criteria: better
        quality of routine microbiology laboratory (not reference laboratory), one or more
        physicians or microbiologists who are interested in medical mycology, and geographic
        location of the hospitals.
