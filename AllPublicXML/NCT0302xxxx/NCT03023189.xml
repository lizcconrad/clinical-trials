    <textblock>
      Upper digestive bleeding. Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a common cause of
      decompensated cirrhosis and is associated with a high mortality rate among cirrhotic
      patients. Its leading cause is the rupture of gastro-esophageal varices due to portal
      hypertension. In cirrhotic patients, the management of acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage is
      challenging as they often present with coagulation (or haemostasis abnormalities)
      abnormalities such as hyperfibrinolysis, especially when the cirrhosis is decompensated.
      Beyond life support measures, therapeutic modalities of upper gastrointestinal bleeding rely
      on both endoscopic and pharmacological interventions. Tranexamic acid (TA) is an
      antifibrinolytic that may help control the bleeding in this setting, as it showed an
      unquestionable benefit in other indications. TA has previously been studied in both upper
      gastrointestinal haemorrhage from any causes and in liver transplantation of cirrhotic
      patients. However, there is a lack of data to conclude on its effectiveness (or efficiency)
      in the early treatment of acute bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

      Investigators hypothesize that, when given early, TA would be beneficial for cirrhotic
      patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage , by controlling the
      haemorrhage, avoiding rebleeding episodes and reducing mortality within 5 days after its
      administration. Moreover, TA could prevent early cirrhosis complications (such as hepatic
      encephalopathy, sepsis and ascites liquid infection, hepatorenal syndrome), could reduce
      indications to transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS), shorten the length of stay in
      intensive care unit and the length of hospitalization, and decrease late relapses and
      one-year mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGIH) is frequent, with an estimated annual
      incidence of 150/100 000 in France. Its second etiology is the rupture of portal
      hypertension-related gastro-esophageal varices, accounting for 20 % of the patients and
      responsible for more than 50 % of the hospitalizations in intensive care unit (ICU) for UGIH.

      In cirrhotic patients, variceal bleeding is the main cause of UGIH (over 70 %) and death (30
      %), which occurs in the most severe patients (Child-Pugh score B or C and/or high MELD score,
      and high levels of portal hypertension).

      Acute UGIH is directly responsible for 50 % of the deaths, either because it remains
      uncontrolled during the acute phase (within 5 days), or because of early relapses (within 6
      weeks). Every episode of acute UGIH worsens the middle and long-term vital prognosis: about
      60 % of the patients present with UGIH recurrence within one year and the survival rate is
      only 30 % 3 years after the first episode.

      Moreover, acute UGIH is a triggering factor for several severe cirrhosis-specific
      complications (such as hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis and ascites liquid infection,
      hepatorenal syndrome), which themselves lead to high mortality rates. Despite the improvement
      of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, UGIH remains stable in France.

      The haemostasis of cirrhotic patients is often abnormal at baseline : thrombopenia, decrease
      of factors II, V, VII, IX, X and XI, decrease of fibrinolytic proteins, increase of factor
      VIII and spontaneous fibrinolysis. When compensated, the cirrhotic's haemostasis remains
      globally preserved, due to the balance of pro and anticoagulant alterations.

      Every cause of cirrhosis decompensation, such as acute PHT-UGIH, can increase hemostatic
      disorders, leading to hyperfibrinolysis. This could slow down or inhibit the clotting, thus
      disrupting pharmacological control of acute UGIH.

      TA could be efficient in acute UGIH of cirrhotic patients. It is a simple antifibrinolytic
      which showed clinical benefits on haemorrhage and/or mortality in several other indications
      (surgical, obstetrical and traumatic). It is now widely used according to recommendations.

      Early administration of TA seems to be beneficial in UGIH haemorrhage. Despite theoretical
      efficiency, 4 recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded to the lack of significant data (poor
      overall trials quality). The benefit of the use of TA in acute UGIH (and acute PHT-UGIH)
      remains uncertain.

      At this day, TA has still not been studied in acute UGIH of cirrhotic patients, although it
      showed benefits on blood transfusion's requirements and on haemorrhagic complications during
      liver transplantation (for which cirrhosis most frequent cause).
