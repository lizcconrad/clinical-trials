  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and feasibility of an integrated,
      prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention combining five wellness elements including
      exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition in Beloit College students.
      This program is called &quot;WILD 5 Wellness: A 30-Day Intervention&quot;. Results for this study will
      be quantified through the use of standardized self-report questionnaires administered prior
      to and after students complete the WILD 5 program (Group 1) or 30 days of inactive
      participation (Group 2), and again approximately 30 days later when the initially inactive
      group (Group 2) will have just completed their active participation in the WILD 5 program and
      the first WILD 5 group (Group 1) will be approximately 30 days out from completion of their
      WILD 5 active portion. Data will be collected to evaluate participants' adherence and
      response to each element of WILD 5, a 5-pronged 30-day wellness intervention. It is expected
      that this 30-day integrated, prescriptive, and trackable program will be found to be an
      efficacious wellness intervention for Beloit College students as compared to the control
      (inactive) group of students not participating in the Active program.
