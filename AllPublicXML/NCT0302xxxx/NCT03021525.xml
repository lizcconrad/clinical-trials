  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the impact of perioperative, algorithm driven, hemodynamic therapy based on
      individualized fluid and cardiac output optimization on postoperative moderate and severe
      complications in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery including visceral, urological,
      and gynecological operations.

      In the proposed study, hemodynamic therapy is tailored individually to each patient, based on
      individual preload optimization by the functional parameter &quot;pulse pressure variation (PPV)&quot;
      and based on an individually titrated goal of cardiac index. The proposed study therefore
      further develops the concept of hemodynamic goal-directed therapy to individually set goals
      and is designed to assess its impact on morbidity and mortality.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative mortality in patients undergoing surgery is on average still 4% in Europe as
      evaluated recently in a cohort study across 28 European countries and is considered to be
      even higher in high risk surgery. But besides this significant risk of death, in particular
      moderate and severe postoperative complications, affecting up to 40% of patients after major
      surgery, frequently lead to severe reductions of quality of life and cause high healthcare
      costs in western nations. Perioperative hemodynamic goal-directed optimization is believed to
      be an integral part to reduce in particular postoperative morbidity significantly and
      possibly also mortality. Algorithm driven optimization of macrocirculation aiming on best
      possible oxygen and substrate delivery to end organs and tissues is thought to be the
      theoretical mechanism of this therapy. A recent large multi-center trial based on such a
      pragmatic, non-individualized protocol failed to reduce composite morbidity underlining this
      weak point of this approach. The reason for failing statistically significant improvement of
      clinical outcome first of all has to be seen in not taking into account individual
      hemodynamic needs of each single patient. Every patient was hemodynamically treated according
      to a &quot;one size fits all of maximizing stroke volume&quot; approach. In contrast, a first
      mono-center trial gave evidence that individualized early goal-directed therapy based on an
      individually optimized volumetric cardiac preload parameter (global end-diastolic volume)
      reduces complications and ICU length of stay after cardiac surgery. Further, and even more
      important, a first multi-center pilot study using a goal-directed algorithm aiming to
      optimize blood flow oriented on individual cardiac capacities (individualized optimal cardiac
      index) in major abdominal surgery demonstrated feasibility and a reduction in postoperative
      complications. This finding needs to be confirmed in a multi-center study that is adequately
      powered to detect changes in specific complications and in mortality before clinical practice
      can be changed accordingly. Therefore, the hypothesis of this proposed prospective two arm
      randomized study is that algorithm driven individualized hemodynamic goal-directed therapy
      reduces moderate and severe postoperative complications being a massive burden on quality of
      life and health care costs. The proposed study develops the concept of hemodynamic
      goal-directed therapy to individually set goals and is designed to assess its impact on
      morbidity and mortality.

    <description>Considering the high relevance for the individual patient and the society, postoperative outcome is most appropriately reflected by a combination of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the primary endpoint is a composite comprising rate of patients with one or more moderate or severe postoperative complications or death within 28 days post surgery. Moderate and severe postoperative complications are defined on the basis of a consensus statement of an ESA (European Society of Anesthesiology)- ESICM (European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) joint task force on perioperative outcome measures.</description>

The additional secondary endpoints including days alive and free of mechanical ventilation at 7 days and 28 days, days alive and free of vasopressor therapy at 7 days and 28 days, days alive and free of renal replacement therapy at 7 days and 28 days, length of ICU and hospital stay further characterize perioperative morbidity and its socioeconomic impacts.</description>

    <description>The trial intervention period will commence from the induction of anesthesia until 8 hours after surgery, or until discharging from the postoperative intensive or intermediate care unit. All patients in the intervention group receive basic vital sign monitoring. For inotropic support dobutamine, and as vasopressor norepinephrine are drugs of choice. Hemodynamic management is performed according to standard treatment until an arterial line is placed. The signal of the arterial line is then processed either by calibrated or non-calibrated pulse contour analysis for pulse pressure variation (PPV) and cardiac index (CI) measurement. Fluid challenge will be performed by infusion of 500 ml in &lt;15 minute. Choice of fluid in case of indicated fluid loading is determined on basis of the recent guideline for intravasal volume therapy. Patients receive fluids and vasoactive agents following a protocol of individualized parameters regularly achieved by extended hemodynamic monitoring.</description>

    <ipd_description>To enter a patient into the iPEGASUS trial, research staff at site will log on to a secure web-based randomization system via a link to the respective website and complete the patient's details without individual participant data (name, date of birth etc.) to obtain a unique patient number and allocation to a treatment group. The local main investigator (LMI) will then be informed about patient's enrollment. For correct patient's data follow up only the LMI will set up a list with the possibility to retrace the patient's history. Personalized data will be handled by the LMI according to GCP (good clinical practice) requirements and will be stored separately from the obtained study data. Thereby, data in the eCRF (electronic case report form) itself will not be re-traceable anymore and visible only for the Principal Coordinators (PCs) for data analysis. Data management of the eCRF will be performed by a company specialized in full service study data management.</ipd_description>
