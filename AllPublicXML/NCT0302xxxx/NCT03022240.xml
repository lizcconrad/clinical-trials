  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pediatric patients is increasing due to
      its use in medical diagnosis and surveillance. Pediatric patients often require general
      anesthesia (GA) for MRI due to the need for prolonged immobility during the scanning process
      to obtain high quality images. Two widely used anesthetic techniques for pediatric MRIs are
      volatile-based anesthesia using sevoflurane and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using
      propofol. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential neurotoxic effects of anesthetics
      on the developing brain. Within the animal literature, there is emerging evidence to suggest
      that both sevoflurane and propofol may cause inflammation, impacting brain cell survival and
      connections, thereby contributing to possible cognitive dysfunction. However, given the
      challenges in extrapolating the animal data to humans, and the relatively limited human
      cohort studies examining the long-term effects of anesthesia exposure, there is inadequate
      information available to make informed clinical decisions regarding the choice of optimal
      anesthetic agents for MRI in children. Therefore, this study will uniquely examine the
      mechanisms of two widely used anesthetics and their short and long-term impact on
      developmental outcomes in healthy children.
