  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent publication using cadaver nails suggests that Jublia application has a negative
      effect on nail polish texture.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that investigating the affect of Jublia is an important question with regards
      to how it affects how various nail polished and top coats will be used.
