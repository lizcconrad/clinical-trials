      Subjects will be asked to give one blood sample and up to two tissue samples (one at
      diagnossi &amp; one at progression of treatment, which are both standard clinical procedures).

        -  Drawing 8 tsp of blood at the first clinic visit, DNA extraction from this blood,
           additional testing on this blood.

        -  Retention of residual tumor tissue for future research.

        -  Collection of residual fresh tumor tissue [that was biopsied for clinical reasons], and
           performing of genetic analyses/retention for future research.

        -  Banking of data, blood, and biopsy tissue for future research.

        -  Distribution of banked data/blood/biopsied tissue for research projects.
