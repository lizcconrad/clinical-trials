      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral stimulation program are effective to
      improve oral feeding efficiency. The sample size estimated in 74 preterm, randomized
      classification of the subjects into to experimental and a control group.

      Recent studies have suggested that an oral stimulation program applied to preterm infants
      facilitates their oral feeding progress, improve breastfeeding rates in preterm infants and
      decreases the length of hospital stay. The objective of this study will evaluate the effect
      an oral stimulation program on the performance feeding, the length of the transition oral
      feeding, length of hospital stay and breastfeeding rates upon discharge.

      Primarily, will be evaluated the effect an oral stimulation program on the performance
      feeding. All infants will be assessed by a speech pathologist blinded as to the group
      randomization.

      Secondarily, will be observed the length of the transition oral feeding of the preterm
      infants, conducted by medical team and will be observed length of hospital stay. Both groups
      will be monitored from when they were assigned to participate in the study until hospital
      discharge.

      All statistical will be conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences® version
      18.0. The data will be analyzed for treatment group differences with chi-square or Fisher's
      exact tests for the categorical variables and with non-parametric tests for the continuous
      variables.
