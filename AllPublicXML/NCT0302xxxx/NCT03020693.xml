  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of an electrostimulation treatment with TENS using a
      needle and a surface electrode combined with an exercise program to fasciitis plantar. Half
      participants will receive invasive electrostimulation (TENS using a needle) and exercises
      while the other half will receive electrostimulation placebo and exercises.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a lot of treatments to fasciitis plantar. Exercises are the treatments more
      recommended to fasciitis plantar but not all patients improve only with exercises. Dry
      needling is recommended to relieve the pain in the heel. TENS is used to decrease the pain in
      the fasciitis plantar. Investigators will apply to half participants a treatment that
      combines TENS + Dry needling (invasive electrostimulation ) with exercises while the other
      half receive electrostimulation placebo (TENS using surface electrodes with non-therapeutic
      intensity) + exercises.
