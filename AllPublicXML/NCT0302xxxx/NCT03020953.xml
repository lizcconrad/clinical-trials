      Purpose: to study the effect of estrogen replacement on muscle hypertrophy in response to 12
      weeks resistance training in postmenopausal women Hypothesis: Transdermal administration of
      17-β estradiol enhance the anabolic effect of resistance training on muscle mass, strength in
      postmenopausal women Primary outcome: Muscle hypertrophy (muscle CSA, muscle fiber type
      specific CSA) Secondary outcome: Messenger RiboNucleic Acid (mRNA)(real-time PCR), protein
      (western blotting), satellite cell proliferation and activation, Strength, functional test,
      muscle protein synthese.

      Design: Two groups of healthy postmenopausal women (½-5 years after menopause) who have not
      performed regular resistance exercise (&lt;1 times per week) the last two years. Randomized,
      controlled intervention study +/- transdermal administration of estrogen (17-β estradiol).
      Both groups perform 12 weeks of supervised progressive resistance training (3/week) aiming to
      induce muscle hypertrophy in the legs.
