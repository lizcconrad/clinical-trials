      Radiotherapy uses high doses of x-rays directed at tumours to kill them, an unfortunate side
      effect is healthy surrounding tissue will receive some of the x-ray dose and is damaged.
      Approximately 22% of radiotherapy patients receive treatment to cure prostate cancer. The
      technique used requires patients to maintain full bladder and empty bowel because they are
      next to the prostate, the aim of radiotherapy planning is to minimise the radiation dose
      received to healthy organs and tissues as this will reduce side effects. PEARL is commercial
      interactive PC software that shows realistic and functional 3D models of Linac's (machines
      that deliver radiotherapy treatment). Using PEARL it's possible to display realistic patient
      treatments including how an individual would be laid on a treatment couch and how the machine
      will move and sound during treatment. Additionally PEARL provides the opportunity to look
      inside the body to view internal anatomy and show where the radiotherapy treatment is
      directed.

      Information prior to treatment in radiotherapy is normally given verbally one to one. The
      investigators believe this information can be more easily understood if PEARL is used in
      conjunction with this verbal exchange. PEARL gives visual and audio representation of the
      treatment experience, and demonstrates the reasons behind required preparations.

      Research aim is to demonstrate patients who receive information using PEARL have greater
      understanding, reduced anxiety and reduced radiation dose. This will be tested using two
      groups of patients receiving radiotherapy to the prostate. Group A - Verbal information,
      Group B - Verbal information and PEARL demonstration. Data collection is via patient
      questionnaires and review of Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) images that are taken prior
      to each radiotherapy treatment as standard practice. CBCT's are used to locate the treatment
      area and assess bladder and bowel status and ensure all of these are suitable to deliver
      treatment accurately.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with cancer of the prostate of the following staging: T1-3b, N0-1,
             M0.

          -  Clinical intention to treat using external radiotherapy based on three local
             departmental protocols: TP-CP-97, TP-CP-98 and TP-CP-99. These protocols dictate that
             the patients receive VMAT planned treatment, require a full bladder and empty rectum
             and require daily localisation using kV cone beam CT (CBCT).

          -  Patients consented to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria.

          -  Patients diagnosed with depression.

          -  Blind patients or patients with severe visual impairment.

          -  Patients with reduced understanding due to mental impairment.

          -  Patients not willing to consent to the study.

          -  Prisoners and young offenders.

          -  Patients who are unable to understand verbal explanations given in English.
