  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States is currently experiencing an explosive opioid epidemic. In 2014 alone,
      28,647 Americans died from an opioid associated overdose; the annual death toll has increased
      by over 300% since 2000. The epidemic poses a complex scenario for physicians administering
      treatment for postoperative pain, as opioids are key analgesic agents in treating moderate to
      severe pain. In order to reduce the patients risk for long term opioid use and the associated
      side effects, physicians have begun shifting to multimodal analgesic approaches to treat
      postoperative pain. These approaches have been found to be similarly efficacious, while also
      reducing opioid usage and associated side effects, such as: nausea, vomiting, and ileus.

      This study proposes a multimodal analgesic approach, which the investigators believe will
      reduce short and long term opioid usage, the associated side effects, and the financial
      burden. Intravenous acetaminophen is an effective medication for both primary and adjunctive
      pain management, however its use is limited by a high cost to perceived benefit ratio. Oral
      acetaminophen is a relatively inexpensive option, although perhaps less effective than the IV
      option, and also often not feasible to utilize in the immediate post-operative period when
      patients are unable to safely swallow pills. The hypothesis of this investigation is to
      understand if adding intravenous acetaminophen to the perioperative care regimen after lumbar
      spinal surgery will result in improved pain management in the perioperative period while
      decreasing opioid usage and related complications.

    <description>Preop:
Eligible patients will receive oral acetaminophen within 3 hours of OR start time.
Postop:
Eligible patients will be administered oral acetaminophen following 1 and 2 level LLIFs supplemented with instrumented posterior fusion to evaluate pain management outcomes. Dosing for the group will be the following:
• Oral Acetaminophen 1,000 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours postoperative. Medication will be given at least 6 hours following initial preoperative dose of oral acetaminophen.
Postop supplemental pain medications:
All patients will receive a standardized hydromorphone IV-PCA order set for 24 hours postoperatively. The use of tramadol and tapentadol will specifically be discouraged due to challenges in determining morphine-equivalent dosing with these specific agents. Similarly, acetaminophen containing combination products (e.g. oxycodone/acetaminophen or hydrocodone/acetaminophen) will not be allowed due to overlap with the primary study medications.</description>
