  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We previously performed a study to create formula for the optimal insertion depth of left
      internal jugular vein catheter in infant, which was registered at cris.nih.go.kr. We found
      that two calculation methods using height and the distance between landmarks (0.11 × height
      (cm) + 0.19 and 1.02 × I-A-B (cm) + 1.55, where I was insertion point of needle, A was the
      most prominent point of the sternal head of the left clavicle, and B was the midpoint of the
      perpendicular line drawn between the sternal head of the right clavicle and an imaginary line
      between the nipples) were clinically feasible to determine the insertion depth of left
      internal jugular vein catheter. In this study, we will compare the actual insertion depth
      with the insertion depth determined from above two calculation methods in other 46 infants.

The tip of central venous catheter will be confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography. The actual insertion depth of central venous catheter will be compared to the predicted insertion depth derived from two calculation methods using height and the distance between the anatomical landmarks.</description>
