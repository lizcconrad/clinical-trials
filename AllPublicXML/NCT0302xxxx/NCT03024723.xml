  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of Upper airway obstruction (UAO) during anesthesia shares many similarities
      with the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway
      patent with near 100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for
      obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia.
      The investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients
      under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the
      efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general
      anesthesia compared with CPAP administering face mask.

    <textblock>
      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is an unpredictable and frequently occurring complication
      during induction of general anesthesia. Since obese patients are more vulnerable to develop
      airway obstruction either during sleep1 or under anesthesia, and the segment of obese
      individuals in the entire population keep growing, difficult airway management under
      anesthesia becomes even more challenging than ever. The most serious event related to
      difficult airway management under anesthesia is &quot;cannot intubate, cannot ventilate&quot;.

      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Obese patients are a
      high-risk group for perioperative airway catastrophe and prone to develop progressively
      narrower pharyngeal airways due to an increase of soft tissue volume surrounding the
      pharyngeal airway. The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the
      upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near
      100% success in patients with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep
      apnea and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the
      investigators hypotheses that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients
      under anesthesia. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the
      efficacy of nCPAP on maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general
      anesthesia.

    <description>This group of the subjects will start with nasal mask or face mask CPAP ventilation. The anesthesia care team does whatever they routinely do, including adjusting the patient's position (as to reverse Trendelenburg position), pre-oxygenation, pre-medication, as usual with intravenous anesthetics and analgesics. When the patient is apneic, CPAP ventilation will be initiated with pressure support mode at PIP 25 cmH2O, ventilation rate 10 BPM, PEEP 10 cmH2O and slope 1 second for 1 min. If ventilation is effective in one of the first three breaths, the ventilation will continue for 1 min. If effective ventilation cannot be produced in any of the first three breaths, the study will be terminated and routine care will be provided.</description>

    <description>The area under the airway pressure curve (AUC) defined as the area from the baseline pressure to the peak pressure during inspiration was calculated for evaluating pressure applied during inspiration. The AUC is a reflection of the change in mean airway pressure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Body Mass Index:30 to 50 kg/ m2, Age: 18-65 years old ASA physical status classification:
        I-III Requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with major cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cerebral vascular
             disease or American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class IV or greater.

          2. Abnormal vital signs on the day of admission for surgery [heart rate (HR, &gt;100 bpm or
             &lt;40 bpm), blood pressure (BP, &gt;180/100 mmHg or &lt;90/60 mmHg), room air transcutaneous
             oxyhemoglobin saturation (SPO2) &lt;96%] that are not correctable with his or her routine
             medication or commonly used pre-operative medication.

          4. Any person with an anticipated difficult airway or those with a history of difficult
             airway. This will include subjects who require or may require either a fiberoptic
             intubation or intubation while awake.

          5. Gastric-esophageal reflex disease that is refractory to treatment or a full stomach.

             previous stroke or spinal cord injury, a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack
             (TIA) within 2 weeks.

          8. Pregnant women and women less than one month post-partum. Ruling out pregnancy will be
             conducted by careful history and physical examination as performed routinely prior to
