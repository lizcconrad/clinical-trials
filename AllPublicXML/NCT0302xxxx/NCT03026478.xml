  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) is an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease
      characterized by pain and burning sensation. The major types of OLP are the following:
      reticular, atrophic, erosive-ulcerative, bullous and pigmentous form.Its etiology remains
      unclear. The presence of auto-cytotoxic T cell clones in the lesions suggests the role of
      autoimmunity. Numerous treatment options of OLP include topical and systemic agents depending
      on severity of lesions . Topical corticosteroids abide the mainstay of therapy,and are widely
      accepted as the primary treatment of choice.Hence this study is designed to evaluate and
      compare the clinical efficacy of topical Clobetasol 0.05% in orabase and Betamethasone 0.05%
      in orabase in combination with Clotrimazole 1% in the management of symptomatic Oral Lichen
      Planus.

      30 patients who are diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus by clinical and histopathological
      examination will be randomly assigned into 2 drug groups and burning sensation will be
      assessed by VAS Scale and also clinical improvement will be assessed at interval of 1 week
      till 4 weeks.

      GROUP A: This group of patients will receive topical Clobetasol 0.05% in orabase and
      Clotrimazole 1%.

      GROUP B: This group of patients will receive topical Betamethasone 0.05% in orabase and
      Clotrimazole 1%.

        1. Patients with Oral Lichen Planus, who are willing to participate in the study.

        2. Patients who are physically healthy and well oriented in time, space and as a person.

        3. Patients clinically and histopathologically diagnosed with Oral Lichen Planus.

        4. Patients with symptoms i.e. pain and burning sensation due to oral lichen planus.

      Exclusion Criteria :

        1. Patients with Oral Lichen Planus, who are not willing to participate in the study.

        2. Patients with any other mucosal disease or any other skin disease which may be
           associated with oral lesions.

        3. Patients with a known allergy or contraindication to study medications.
