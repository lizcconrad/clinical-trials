  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticholinergic and sedative drugs are frequently prescribed to older people, despite their
      negative impact on older people's physical and cognitive function. To estimate the cumulative
      exposure to anticholinergic and sedative drugs, Hilmer et al. published the Drug Burden Index
      (DBI) in 2007. The present study aims to complement previous study findings showing higher
      DBI values to be associated with physical and cognitive impairment. Most previously conducted
      studies of the DBI were either cross-sectional or were longitudinal but with short
      follow-ups. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether higher DBI values carry extra risks for
      patients with dementia. Finally, relatively little is known about the stability of DBI values
      over time. The current project therefore aims to examine (1) longitudinal relationships
      between long-term cumulative exposure to anticholinergic and sedative drugs as measured with
      the DBI and cognitive and physical function, (2) to examine interaction effects between DBI
      exposure and dementia, and (3) to examine trajectories of DBI exposure, i.e. DBI exposure
      remaining stable, declining, increasing or fluctuating over time. These project aims will be
      studied with longitudinal data from eligible participants &gt; 60 years from the LASA study with
      participants being followed-up during two decades, and the longitudinal data from the
      InterRAI consortium. Various clinical outcomes regarding cognitive and physical function will
      be studied. Data will be analysed with generalised linear mixed models and Latent Class
      Growth Analysis.
