  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Healthy Life Center (HLC, 'Frisklivssentrale') is a public community-based health service
      providing lifestyle support programs for physical activity, smoking cessation and diet, to
      inhabitants with increased risk for development of non-communicable diseases. HLCs intention
      is to reach physically inactive people who need guidance to get more physically active, and
      offer them a lifestyle program for three months or more.

      The main aim of this study is to study whether the HLCs, organized according to the Norwegian
      Directorate of Health`s guidelines for municipal healthy life centers, affects the
      participants short term (3 months) and long term (15 months) physical activity level. Also
      changes in diet, tobacco use, health related quality of life, physical fitness,
      anthropometry, self-efficacy, motivation, drug use, use of health services and work
      participation will be assessed. Secondary aim is to study whether there are any moderators,
      such as HLCs capacity, expertise, and collaboration with other services, that have
      significance for participants' change. Also it will be studied whether the HLCs result in
      larger changes in some subgroups (e.g. socioeconomic) of participants than in others.
