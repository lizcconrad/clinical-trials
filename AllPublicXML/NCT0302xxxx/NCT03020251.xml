      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of a preoperative rehabilitation
      program at home in patients resected for lung cancer, comparing a control group (C group)
      receiving only chest physiotherapy and a rehabilitation group (R group) receiving both a
      training program at home and chest physiotherapy
