    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the rate and extent of absorption of JNJ63623872
      following administration of a single oral dose of 2*300 milligram (mg) given as 2 concept
      single agent tablet formulations compared to the administration of 2*300 mg JNJ63623872
      reference tablets, under fasted conditions in healthy adult participants and to assess the
      rate and extent of absorption of JNJ63623872 and oseltamivir following administration of a
      single oral dose of 2*300 mg/37.5 mg JNJ63623872/ oseltamivir given as a concept fixed dose
      combination (FDC) tablet formulation compared to the coadministration of 2*300 mg JNJ63623872
      tablets (reference formulation) and 1*75 mg oseltamivir capsule, under fasted conditions in
      healthy adult participants.
