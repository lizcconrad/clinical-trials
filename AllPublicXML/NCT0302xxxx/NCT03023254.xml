      -  To assess the benefit of the Avène hydrotherapy in subjects with pruritic plaque
           psoriasis in the:

             -  Improvement of pruritus

             -  Improvement of psoriasis severity

             -  Improvement of quality of life

             -  Change of pruritus and psoriasis biological markers

             -  Intake/application of treatments and skin care products for psoriasis and pruritus
                management, evaluated during a follow-up period

        -  To assess the time to pruritus relapse evaluated in subjects with pruritic plaque
           psoriasis, during the period following the Avène hydrotherapy (for the hydrotherapy
           group only)

        -  To assess the global efficacy of the Avène hydrotherapy in pruritic plaque psoriasis,
           according to subjects' and investigators' opinion (for the hydrotherapy group only)

        -  To assess the global cutaneous tolerance of the Avène hydrotherapy in subjects with
           pruritic plaque psoriasis (for the hydrotherapy group only)

          -  Pruritus intensity: subject must have the same pruritus intensity level as his/her
             matched hydrotherapy group subject (at the time of inclusion visit):

          -  either moderate pruritus (NRS score, evaluated on average over the 3 days, between 4
             and 6 included on a scale ranged from 0 to 10)

          -  or severe to very severe pruritus (NRS score, evaluated on average over the 3 days,
             between 7 and 10 included on a scale ranged from 0 to 10)
