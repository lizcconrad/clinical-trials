    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ubidecarenone injectable
      nanosuspension (BPM31510) in treating patients with high-grade glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma
      or glioblastoma) that has come back and have been previously treated with bevacizumab.
      BPM31510 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      Primary Objective:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of BPM31510 plus vitamin K in subjects with
           high-grade glioma(HGG), defined as anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma (GB) that
           has recurred on a BEV containing regimen.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to
           subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  Estimate the overall survival in subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen
           from the 1st day of infusion of BPM31510 plus vitamin K to death.

        -  To evaluate the effects of BPM31510 plus vitamin K on shifting HGG metabolism to aerobic
           respiration by PET imaging.

        -  To evaluate the effects of BPM1510 plus vitamin K on MRI imaging by Response Assessment
           in Neuro Oncology (RANO) criteria [specifically progression free survival (PFS) and
           response rate (RR)].

        -  To evaluate plasma pharmacodynamics (PD) when BPM31510 plus vitamin K is given to
           subjects with HGG recurrent on a BEV containing regimen.
