    <textblock>
      The study population will comprise of 90 women age varying between 15-55 years, those are
      candidate for laparoscopic surgery due to definition of &gt;4 cm endometrioma or any other
      benign ovarian cysts such as mature teratoma or simple serous cysts on ultrasound
      examination, chronic pelvic pain, infertility. The blood samples will be drawn for analysis
      of serum biomarkers.

      The participants will be accepted for the study between 1st of August 2016 to 30th June 2017.
      2 cc blood samples will be drawn from the antecubital vein for serum analysis of caspase 3,
      annexin a2 and soluble fas levels before the operations. The patients will divide into three
      groups. The group 1 will comprise of 30 patients with benign ovarian cysts such as mature
      teratoma or simple serous cysts on ultrasound examination. The group 2 will comprise of 30
      patients with diagnosis of stage 1-2 endometriosis in guidance with the revised American
      Society for Reproductive Medicine classification. The group 3 will comprise of 30 patients
      with diagnosis of stage 3-4 endometriosis in guidance with the revised American Society for
      Reproductive Medicine classification. The blood samples will be kept in -80 C degree after
      centrifuge till at the end of the study.The relation between serum caspase 3, annexin a2 and
      soluble fas levels and severity of endometriosis will be analysed.
