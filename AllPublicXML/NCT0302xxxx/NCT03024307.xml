      This is a randomised trial on the efficacy of an Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical Services
      Program (OPCSP) on adherence and clinical outcomes among patients with rheumatic diseases.The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate:

        1. rates of medication adherence in the OPCSP program compared with usual care in an
           integrated health care system.

        2. total direct costs and clinical outcomes in the OPCSP program compared with usual care
           in an integrated health care system.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomised trial on the efficacy of an Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical Services
      Program (OPCSP) on adherence and clinical outcomes among patients with rheumatic
      diseases.Three types of rheumatic diseases were included in the study, Systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA). The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate:

        1. rates of medication adherence in the OPCSP program compared with usual care in an
           integrated health care system.

        2. total direct costs and clinical outcomes in the OPCSP program compared with usual care
           in an integrated health care system.

    <description>This was an open labelled randomised study. Rheumatic diseases patients were recruited and arbitrarily divided into the intervention group (usual care plus OPCSP) and the non-intervention group (usual care only). Those enrolled in the research were scheduled for follow-up for eight consecutive visits. Improvements in lab results and direct costs were compared longitudinally (pre and post analysis) between the groups.</description>
