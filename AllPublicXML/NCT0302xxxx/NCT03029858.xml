      The study will investigate whether PD-L1 and other immuno-markers will be influenced by
      osimertinib treatment in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor （EGFR）T790M positive
      advanced NSCLC patients. In addition, we will explore whether PD-L1 and other immuno-markers
      can predict the safety and efficacy of subsequent use of immune checkpoint inhibitors at the
      time of PD due to osimertinib resistance.

      Tumor Formaldehyde Fixed-Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue specimen collection • Tumor FFPE
      tissue specimen will be at least collected at baseline, disease progression and Response
      (optional) in sufficient amount (10 FFPE slices, thickness 4um, tumor cells≥25% and the area
      of necrotic tissues＜10%).

      Blood specimen collection(optional)

      • The plasma specimen requirements for 10 ml blood will be collected at least at baseline,
      disease progression, and every 6 weeks, which is for detecting tumor mutation burden by
      QIAGEN Mix-561-Match Panel (561genes).

      <textblock>
        Adult patients (≥18 years old) with locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV)
        NSCLC with confirmed T790M mutation, who have received prior EGFR-TKI therapy，These
        patients are those who were enrolled in ASTRIS（Real World Treatment Study of AZD9291 for
        Advanced/Metastatic EGFR T790M Mutation NSCLC） or patients who were eligible for the ASTRIS
        study.

        The study is a post observational study for ASTRIS study，and the patients would not take
        Osimertinib in this study any more.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient enrolled in ASTRIS or patient who are eligible for the ASTRIS study.

          2. The patient is willing to provide informed consent form to provide specimen before
             osimertinib treatment and at the time of PD.

          3. Patients must be able to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy during screening or to provide
             an available tumor sample taken &lt;2 months prior to screening.

          4. Fine needle aspirate specimens are not acceptable.

          5. Specimens from metastatic bone lesions are typically unacceptable unless there is
             confirmed soft tissue component.

          6. The tumor specimen submitted to establish eligibility should be of sufficient quantity
             to allow for PD-L1 IHC and other biomarker analyses (if applicable) and is preferred
             in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient does not have sufficient tumor tissue specimen available for detection.

          2. The Patient who is unwilling to use the existing data from medical practice for
             scientific research.

          3. The patient who received immunotherapy therapy before.
