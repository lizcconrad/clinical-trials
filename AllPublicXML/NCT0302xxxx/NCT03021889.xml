      Introduction: Prolonged use of antiretroviral therapy is associated with metabolic and bodily
      changes such as lipodystrophy, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia latter
      being associated with a higher chance of cardiovascular events and death.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of nutritional therapy in dyslipidemic adolescents living
      with HIV / AIDS in antiretroviral therapy.

      Method: This is a randomized clinical trial with young people 13-19 years in outpatient
      treatment in a general hospital to present dyslipidemia. The intervention group received
      nutritional counseling for 12 weeks and weekly flights to nutritional counseling. The control
      group received standard care consisting of medical care. Demographic, clinical, nutritional
      variables, food surveys and lipid profiles were collected at baseline and at the end of the
      study for both groups.

      This is a open randomized clinical trial. The participants were adolescents (13 to 19 years
      old) diagnosed with HIV / AIDS from the Pediatric Infectious Disease Outpatient Clinic - zone
      4, from a tertiary care university hospital in the South Region in Brazil, along with their
      caregivers. Present Dyslipidemia, characterized by Total Cholesterol&gt; 200mg / dL associated
      with:Triglycerides ≥ 150mg HDL cholesterol (male &lt;40 mg / dL and female &lt;50 mg / dL) LDL
      cholesterol ≥ 160 mg / dL. The clinical profile, immunological, virological, the biochemical
      parameters will be accessed by the patient's chart and the dietary parameters will be
      evaluated by means of 24-hour reminder instrument. The sample was calculated, using a
      software, from an alpha error of 5%, reliability power of 80%, to obtain detection difference
      and standard deviation for each of the group of 40, totaling 36 patients.

      The randomization will be performed through simple randomization in blocks of 2 patients
      generated by computer program, available at www.randomization.com.

      The intervention group received nutritional counseling for 12 weeks and weekly flights to
      nutritional counseling. The control group received standard care consisting of medical care.
      Demographic, clinical, nutritional variables, food surveys and lipid profiles were collected
      at baseline and at the end of the study for both groups.
