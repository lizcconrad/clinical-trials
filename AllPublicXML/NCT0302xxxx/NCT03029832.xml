  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of MOXR0916 in combination with atezolizumab versus placebo
      and atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma
      (UC) who have not received prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced/metastatic setting
      and who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design has been amended after the decision to prematurely stop patient accrual due
      to enrollment challenges. As only 5 participants were enrolled, the study blinding will not
      be maintained, and placebo infusions will not be administered. Patients assigned to the
      MOXR0916 arm may continue study treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and MOXR0916
      or with atezolizumab alone based on a discussion of benefit and risk with the treating
      investigator.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 45 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST v1.1, progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline); and an absolute increase of &gt;= 5 millimeter (mm) in the sum of diameters.</description>

    <description>OR is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions &gt;= 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Objective Response (DOR) According to RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 45 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. Objective response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR.</description>
