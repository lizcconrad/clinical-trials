      on the reduction of Anterior Uveitis (AU) flares in subjects with active axial
      Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and a documented history of AU

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a documented diagnosis of adult-onset axial Spondyloarthritis
             (axSpA) with at least 3 months' symptom duration and meet the Assessment of
             SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria

          2. Subjects must have active disease at Screening as defined by

               -  Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score &gt;= 4

               -  Spinal pain &gt;= 4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; from BASDAI item 2)

               -  Nonradiographic (Nr)-axSpA subjects must either have C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt;
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) and /or current evidence of sacroiliitis on magnetic
                  resonance imaging (MRI) (no confirmation by central reading) as defined by ASAS
                  criteria

               -  Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) subjects must have evidence of sacroiliitis on x-ray
                  meeting the modified New York (mNY) criteria according to the Investigator

          3. Subjects must have a documented history of Anterior Uveitis (AU) diagnosed by an
             ophthalmologist and have at least 2 AU flares in the past, of which at least 1 AU
             flare was in the last 12 months prior to Baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other inflammatory arthritis

          -  Secondary, noninflammatory condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, is
             symptomatic enough to interfere with evaluation of the effect of study drug on the
             subject's primary diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)

          -  Any history of uveitis except for Anterior Uveitis (AU) associated with axSpA

          -  Any condition or complicating factor that may interfere with the AU assessment

          -  Retisert® or Iluvien® (glucocorticosteroid implant) within 3 years prior to the
             Baseline Visit or has had complications related to the device

          -  Subject has had Retisert or Iluvien (glucocorticosteroid implant) removed within 90
             days prior to the Baseline Visit

          -  Intraocular or periocular corticosteroids within 90 days prior to the Baseline visit

          -  Ozurdex® (dexamethasone implant) within 6 months prior to the Baseline Visit

          -  Cyclophosphamide within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit
