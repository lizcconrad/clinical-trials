    <textblock>
      This study investigates stress-related signaling of glutamate and dopamine within the
      reward-processing circuit in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and whether they can be used to
      predict depressive symptoms in the future. This will be achieved through various neuroimaging
      tools (MRS, fMRI, PET), behavioral tasks, and a naturalistic follow-up design.

      The overarching goals of this research are to investigate: (1) stress-induced glutamatergic
      abnormalities and their relation to disruption within the corticostriatal valuation circuit
      in MDD; (2) stress-induced DA signaling disruptions in MDD; and (3) the predictive validity
      of these two pathophysiological mechanisms. This will be achieved through an innovative
      integration of (1) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based assessments of
      glutamatergic metabolites in the mPFC; (2) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      probes of the corticostriatal valuation circuit with well-established stress manipulations
      (MAST) and assessments (cortisol and inflammatory markers); (3) positron emission tomography
      (PET)-based measurement of striatal DA release with well-established stress manipulations and
      assessments (cortisol and inflammatory markers); and (4) a naturalistic follow-up design.
