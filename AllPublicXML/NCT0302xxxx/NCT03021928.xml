      Title:

      Optimal Delay Time to Initiate Anticoagulation after Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
      (START): a pragmatic, adaptive randomized clinical trial.

      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the optimal time to initiate anticoagulation with a Non-Vitamin K Oral
      Anticoagulant (NOAC) after ischemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the rates of primary adverse outcomes in a per protocol analysis

        -  To compare 30 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the
           time-to-treatment groups

        -  To compare 90 day clinical outcomes by the modified Rankin scale among the
           time-to-treatment groups

        -  To explore the optimal timing in subgroups of age, sex, outcome category, and NOAC
           choice

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term oral anticoagulation is standard for secondary stroke prevention in patients with
      atrial fibrillation (AFib). However, there is limited data and no consensus on the timing of
      when to initiate anticoagulation therapy, and concern that starting too soon risks
      symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. These data are derived almost exclusively from
      heparins and Vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,warfarin). Now that NOACs have become the mainstay
      of stroke prophylaxis in AFib and have more rapid and consistent anticoagulation and fewer
      strokes (hemorrhagic especially), the question of optimal timing of NOAC initiation is of
      increasing importance.

      The primary aim is to determine the time-to-treatment interval with the lowest associated
      risk for adverse events in the context of anticoagulation therapy with NOACs for acute stroke
      patients with non-valvular AFib. The question will be investigated with a prospective,
      adaptive, randomized, controlled &quot;dose-exploration&quot; trial with the time to treatment with
      NOAC therapy treated as the incremental &quot;dose&quot;.

      An adaptive, pragmatic trial will be performed that will not deviate from the treating
      physicians' usual practice except for randomizing the time to start the NOAC. Data collection
      will be limited to those fields necessary for the planned primary and secondary analyses.

      The composite primary outcome event will be any of the following within 30 days of the index
      stroke: Ischemic Events (symptomatic ischemic stroke or systemic embolism), Hemorrhagic
      Events (symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of index ischemic stroke, other symptomatic
      intracranial hemorrhage, or major extracranial hemorrhage), or all-cause mortality.

      Four time-to-treatment intervals, i.e. study arms, between 2 and 14 days will be
      investigated: 60 hours, 132 hours, 228 hours, and 324 hours. An innovative adaptive design
      will be used which includes response adaptive randomization and modeling of ischemic and
      hemorrhagic outcome events. The ischemic and hemorrhagic events within the composite primary
      endpoint are modeled separately using their known monotonic property that the risk of an
      event increases (ischemic) or decreases (hemorrhage) as the time-to-treatment interval
      lengthens. Interim analyses will occur after every 50 subjects are randomized, where the
      primary outcome will be analyzed and new randomization probabilities will be calculated to
      favor the arms that have a better risk-profile.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. New ischemic stroke with disabling neurological deficit or lesion diameter on brain
             imaging &gt; 1.5 cm.

          2. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent).

          3. Not currently anticoagulated (except for DVT prophylaxis).

          4. Treating physician plans to anticoagulate with a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC):
             apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, or other NOAC.

          5. Qualifying brain CT or MRI scan &lt; 48hr from stroke onset (time last known well). If
             patient has been treated with thrombolytic or endovascular therapy for this stroke,
             then the qualifying scan is performed 18-36 hours after therapy to rule out clinically
             significant hemorrhagic transformation. This group of patients must have their
             qualifying NIHSS assessment performed at the time of this scan.

          6. Ability to randomize within 60 hours of symptom onset.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary intracerebral hemorrhage on qualifying neuroimaging. Note: Hemorrhagic
             transformation of a primarily ischemic stroke may be included as per Investigator`s
             judgment. Sporadic microbleeds may be included as per Investigator`s judgment. As a
             general recommendation, a cerebral microbleed is considered to be ≤ 5mm, but sometimes
             up to 10mm, in greatest diameter on gradient recalled echo (GRE), or T2*, MRI
             sequences. Any blood visualized on a CT will be classified as a macrobleed

          2. Infarct volume (estimated) is greater than 50% of middle cerebral artery territory on
             qualifying scan.

          3. NIHSS &lt; 4 or &gt; 23 prior to enrollment. Note: For patients that had thrombolytic or
             endovascular therapy, the qualifying NIHSS assessment is that which is obtained
             concurrently with their qualifying scan 18 -36 hours following therapy.

          4. Anticipated need for major surgery over the next 30 days that would require delay,
             discontinuation, or extended suspension of anticoagulant.

          5. Symptomatic edema expected from size and location of ischemic stroke.

          6. Decreased level of consciousness present or expected.

          7. Any intracranial hemorrhage within the previous 6 months.

          8. Life expectancy less than 90 days.

          9. Follow-up in person or by telephone for 90 days is not feasible.
