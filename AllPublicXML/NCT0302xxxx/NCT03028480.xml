    <textblock>
      This study is a special drug use investigation program of NUCALA (a brand name for
      Mepolizumab) administered subcutaneously (SC). In this study the information regarding the
      safety and effectiveness of long term use of NUCALA after subcutaneous injection will be
      collected from Asthma subjects in daily clinical practice. The observation period per subject
      will be 52 weeks from the initiation of NUCALA treatment with follow-up investigation for 2
      years after the observation period. NUCALA is a registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline
      [GSK] group of companies
