  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects over one third of US adults (&gt;72 million, with BMI ≥30 kg/m2), and the
      proportion of US adults with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 has doubled in the last 20 years. Obesity is
      associated with increased mortality through its linkage to comorbidities including diabetes,
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and psychosocial disturbances. Given
      its prevalence, impact on morbidity and mortality, and economic cost, limiting the spread of
      obesity and its consequences is one of the most important problems of our time.

      The Inflammation, Diabetes, Ethnicity and Obesity (IDEO) cohort is recruiting 145 lean and
      obese individuals from three ethnicities, covering a spectrum of obesity and T2DM risk.
      Specifically, the cohort will include: 1) 45 obese subjects, including individuals each from
      three ethnic groups; Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, and Chinese; 2) 45 subjects who are slated
      to undergo any type of bariatric surgery for obesity (20 individuals each from the three
      ethnic groups above); and 3) 55 lean controls, including individuals from each ethnicity.

    <description>IDEO is recruiting 145 lean and obese individuals from three ethnicities, covering a spectrum of obesity and T2DM risk. The cohort will include three ethnic groups; Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, and Chinese and also include subjects slated to undergo bariatric surgery. Adipose tissue samples are collected from all subjects, including aspirational subcutaneous biopsies from nonsurgical subjects and excisional biopsies, performed intra-operatively by surgical collaborators as required. Participants also undergo anthropometric measurements, stool collection, blood sample collection for circulating blood cells, serum, and plasma. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for amount and distribution of body fat as well as bone density is performed. Study subjects complete validated questionnaire inventories to measure bio-behavioral issues such as depression, stress, health locus of control, and dietary habits.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects defined (lean and obese) from three defined ethnic groups; Caucasian,
             Hispanic/Latino, and Chinese.

          -  Subjects will be between the ages of 25-65 years. These cutoffs are designed to allow
             inclusion of postmenopausal women, and younger/more active patients who are
             increasingly undergoing bariatric surgery.

          -  BMI criteria for both surgical and nonsurgical obese patients and lean &quot;controls&quot; are
             as follows: Obese patients: BMI &gt; 30 with standard comorbidities. For Chinese
             individual BMI cutoff for obesity is &gt;27. Lean controls: BMI &lt; 30 but BMI &gt;18.5

          -  Patients with either diabetes type 2 or the metabolic syndrome will be included in the
             cohort.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with chronic kidney disease (&gt; stage 3), chronic infections, autoimmune
             diseases.

          -  Subjects with symptomatic heart failure or CAD, cirrhosis or liver failure.

          -  Tobacco abuse

          -  Subjects on glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants [ tacrolimus, cellcept] and PPAR-gamma
             agonist will be excluded from the study.
