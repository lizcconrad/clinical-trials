  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, 2x2 cross-over study to assess the effects of cocoa solids
      on gastrointestinal transit, post-prandial sensation and well-being. Additionally functional
      brain imaging will be applied to identify regions of brain that are activated or inactivated
      by cocoa ingestion. Healthy subjects will be recruited and randomized to receive either dark
      chocolate (70% cocoa solids) or white chocolate (0% cocoa solids) in addition to their normal
      diet in randomized order. Reference standard methodology will be applied to measure gastric
      emptying, oro-caecal and colonic transit time. Dark and white chocolate (100g, ~500kcal, ~50%
      fat) will be consumed with radio-opaque markers on three consecutive days. On the third day
      chocolate ingestion will be followed by measurements of postprandial brain activity using
      FDG-Positron Emission Tomography. Additionally colonic transit will be assessed based on the
      number and distribution of radio-opaque markers in the colon. On the fourth day gastric
      emptying and oro-caecal transit time will be assessed by scintigraphy after ingestion of a
      dark or white chocolate mousse test meal (both 150g, ~500kcal, ~50% fat). During both
      interventional studies pre- and post-prandial satiety and dyspeptic symptoms, well-being and
      mood will be recorded. Additionally, validated questionnaires will assess digestive comfort
      and well-bring at the end of each study day. These results will deliver comprehensive
      information about the effects of cocoa on gastrointestinal transit and sensation.
