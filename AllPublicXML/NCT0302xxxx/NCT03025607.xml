  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be prevented through weight loss and increased physical
      activity, yet its prevalence continues to rise. This trend may be due in part to low rates of
      participation in evidence-based lifestyle change programs such as the Diabetes Prevention
      Program (DPP). New strategies are needed to promote healthy behaviors among individuals at
      risk for T2DM, and mobile health technologies may be an effective and scalable approach to
      achieve this. One promising tool is JOOL Health, a mobile phone-based application that
      leverages principles from Self-Determination Theory to help individuals understand how
      certain behaviors (e.g. sleep, diet, physical activity) influence their ability to pursue
      their core values and purpose in life. Through personalized messaging and feedback, JOOL
      Health aims to increase autonomous motivation, a form of motivation closely associated with
      the initiation and maintenance of healthy behaviors.

      In this mixed methods pilot randomized controlled trial, the investigators will test whether
      the JOOL Health mobile phone-based application -- used alone and in conjunction with other
      mobile health technologies to track weight and physical activity -- can increase autonomous
      motivation to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among individuals with prediabetes who
      previously declined participation in a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 156 individuals with
      prediabetes who declined participation in a formal DPP despite invitation to participate at
      no out-of-pocket cost by their health plan. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 study
      arms: (1) a group that receives information on prediabetes, evidence-based strategies to
      decrease progression to diabetes, and a list of resources for mHealth tools for monitoring
      diet, physical activity, and weight (control group); (2) a group that receives the JOOL
      Health mobile phone application; and (3) a group that receives the JOOL Health mobile phone
      application and other mHealth tools (e.g. Fitbit activity tracker and wireless-enabled scale)
      whose results can be uploaded into JOOL.

      The investigators will use a mixed methods approach with a sequential explanatory design,
      which is to say that quantitative data and qualitative data will be collected in 2
      consecutive phases within the study. Specifically, in the first phase, investigators will
      collect and analyze qualitative data (e.g. focus groups) from a purposive sample of
      participants with differing levels of engagement and success. The rationale for this approach
      is that the quantitative data will provide a general overview of the intervention's efficacy
      and limitations, and the qualitative data will help to explain these findings by exploring
      participants' experiences and perspectives in more depth.

    <description>JOOL Health is a mobile phone-based application that aims to increase autonomous motivation to prevent T2DM by helping individuals make connections between certain health behaviors and the energy and willpower needed to achieve personal goals. On a daily basis, JOOL Health users chart the following health behaviors: Sleep, Presence, Activity, Creativity, and Eating. On a weekly basis, JOOL Health users are asked to record how well they lived according to their purpose and values. Through the integration of user-entered information with contextual data, JOOL Health provides tailored messaging and daily predictions of individuals' energy and willpower.</description>
