  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      Certain stomach cancers are rare, but they have high mortality rates. Researchers want to
      learn more about gastric (stomach) tumors. In this study, they want to collect data from
      people who have stomach cancer or are at risk to get it. This data will be used to see if the
      people can be in other studies.

      Objective:

      To study tissue from stomach tumors and find people eligible for more studies on gastric
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old who have or may have stomach cancer, lesions that may be related
      to stomach cancer, or an inherited disorder that leads to stomach cancer.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Heart tests

      Scans or ultrasound.

      For the scans, participants lie in a machine that takes pictures. For some scans, they will
      swallow or be injected with a small amount of radioactive material. Special cameras will show
      the material in the body.

      Tumor sample taken with a needle or surgery

      Some participants will have an endoscopy. A long, flexible tube with a camera will be
      inserted through the mouth into the stomach. The tube will collect tissue from the stomach.

      Some participants may have follow-up visits. Some may be invited to join other studies.
      Others will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing.

      Background:

        -  Greater than 90% of gastric tumors are of epithelial origin and are classified as
           adenocarcinomas; the remainders include GIST, carcinoid and lymphoma

        -  Gastric adenocarcinoma is rare in the United States (incidence 7.4 per 100,000)

        -  Mortality rates are high with an estimated 5-year overall survival of 25% - 30%

        -  Up to 3% of gastric adenocarcinomas occur as part of a heritable cancer syndrome

        -  Molecular sub-classification of gastric adenocarcinomas has been reported, however
           translation of these findings into clinical management of patients has yet to occur

      Objectives:

        -  To permit clinical and laboratory evaluation and molecular profiling of tumor tissue
           from patients with gastric malignancies or non-invasive (neoplastic) conditions

        -  Assess eligibility for enrollment in studies of gastric cancer conducted in the CCR

        -  To allow long-term follow up of patients with gastric tumors, or heritable gastric
           malignancy syndromes, to support clinical and preclinical research particularly related
           to molecular alterations in gastric tumors and their response to therapy

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant lesions or
           non-invasive (neoplastic) conditions of the stomach

        -  Patients with a suspicious lesion not yet confirmed, but considered likely related to
           the stomach pending further evaluation

        -  Patients with confirmation of, or suspicion of, a heritable gastric malignancy disorder

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

      Design:

        -  This protocol is designed to facilitate clinical evaluation, molecular tumor profiling,
           and long-term follow up of patients with gastric tumors

        -  Patients will be screened and clinical evaluation performed to determine eligibility for
           other CCR trials for gastric tumors

        -  No investigational treatment will be administered and no procedures will be done for
           only research purposes on this protocol.

        -  It is anticipated that the protocol will enroll a maximum of 250 patients.
