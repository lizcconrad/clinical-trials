      Background:

      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is often overlooked and underdiagnosed. At present the
      diagnosis of PHPT remains challenging and is based on serum calcium (Ca) and PTH.

      As serum Ca and phosphorous (P) are inversely related in PHPT, the Ca/P ratio might be
      considered a good candidate tool in the diagnosis of PHPT.

      AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of the Ca/P ratio in the
      diagnosis of PHPT.

      Study design: Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional, case-control clinical trial will
      be carried out.

      Biochemical measurements will include PTH, Vitamin D, serum Ca, P, albumin, and creatinine.
