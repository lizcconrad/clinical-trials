      There was not any randomize trial to show what is the best type of incision in open
      rhinoplasty. So, we use both self-rating by patients ,independent physician observers Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) and also a validated scar analysis to compare inverted V and stair step
      incisions.

      Approaches to rhinoplasty can be separated into two broad categories: external and endonasal,
      which each of them their own proponent. However, the external approach provide better
      exposure, critics against this technique is often due to cosmetic deformity regarding the
      incision. Hence, over the recent years surgeons have modified the trans-columellar incision
      into two big categories: gull wing and stair steps. While each of them has its own
      proponents, there is no randomized trial, comparing their cosmetic results.
