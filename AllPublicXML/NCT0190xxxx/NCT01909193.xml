  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with Social Anxiety Disorder will be pseudo randomly assigned to either an individual
      cognitive behavior therapy, attention bias modification treatment (allocation ratio - 1.5:1).

      Outcome measures will be social anxiety symptoms and severity as measured by gold standard
      questionnaires as well as diagnosis of social anxiety disorder derived from structured
      clinical interviews based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV criteria.

      The investigators expect to find significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms in all of
      the groups, with the cognitive behavior therapy group showing greater reduction in symptoms
      than the other groups. Mechanisms of change in all of the groups will be examined via
      measures of cognitive biases, affect, and other common and specific factors.

    <measure>Liebovitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) - diagnostic interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Expected time frame of up to 32 weeks per participant. Participants will be assessed before and after the administration of the treatment, every 4 weeks during treatment and at 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>LSAS is a 24-items clinician-administered scale developed for the assessment of fear and avoidance associated with social situations. The LSAS assesses a wide range of both social interaction and performance/observation situations, which are rated for degree of fear/anxiety and frequency of avoidance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) - self-report questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 32 weeks per participant. The SPIN will be administered before and after each treatment session and at 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SPIN is a widely used 17-item self-report questionnaire that assesses fear, avoidance and physiological symptoms of social anxiety.</description>
