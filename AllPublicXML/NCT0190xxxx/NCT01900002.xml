      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of combining sorafenib
      with TheraSphere in the treatment of patients with advanced liver cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TheraSphere is a medical device that has radioactive material called yttrium-90 (Y-90) in it.
      When Y-90 is put into microscopic glass beads called microspheres, it can be injected through
      an artery directly into the liver. This allows a large dose of radiation to be delivered
      directly to the tumor, which lowers the risk of side effects from the radiation to other
      parts of the body or to healthy liver tissue. The radiation from TheraSphere stays in the
      body and begins to lose its energy and break down within 12 days. The glass microspheres will
      not break down and will stay in the body from that point on.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will start taking sorafenib 2
      times a day starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 4 weeks before starting TheraSphere treatment.

      You will need to take the sorafenib tablets 12 hours apart, at about the same time each
      morning and evening. The sorafenib tablets should be taken without food, at least 1 hour
      before or 2 hours after a meal, and with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.

      While taking sorafenib, you should avoid having any grapefruit, Seville (sour) oranges, star
      fruit, pomegranate, and any products containing juices of these fruits.

      TheraSphere Treatment:

      After 4 weeks of taking sorafenib (+/- 1 week), the TheraSphere treatment will be performed.
      The procedure should take about 1½ to 3 hours to complete.

      After starting sorafenib treatment, an angiogram will be scheduled to occur at least 2 weeks
      before TheraSphere treatment. The angiogram is an imaging test that uses radiologic contrast
      dye that allows doctors to view your body's blood vessels or arteries. It should take about
      1½ to 3 hours to complete. You will be given drugs through a vein in your arm or hand to help
      you relax, but you will be awake during the procedure. During the procedure, an area in your
      groin will be numbed with local anesthetic and the doctor will insert a catheter (a sterile
      plastic tube) into a blood vessel in your groin that leads to the blood flow in your liver.
      The contrast dye will then be injected into the catheter and a series of X-rays will be taken
      to allow the doctor to see the blood vessels in your liver. At the end of the procedure, the
      catheter will be removed. The X-rays will be used by your doctor to plan your TheraSphere
      treatment. You will be required to sign a separate consent form for the angiogram that
      explains the procedure and associated risks in more detail.

      You will also have an albumin scan, which is part of the angiogram. Imaging spheres similar
      in size to the TheraSphere microspheres will be injected into your liver to test how well the
      TheraSphere microspheres may stay in your liver and not travel to other organs.

      During the TheraSphere treatment, you will again be given drugs through an IV in your arm or
      hand to help you relax, but you will stay awake during the procedure. An area in your groin
      will be numbed with local anesthetic. The doctor will insert a catheter into a blood vessel
      in your groin that leads to the blood flow in your liver. Based on the planning from the
      results of your angiogram procedure, the doctor will guide the catheter to the target blood
      vessel. Once the doctor thinks the catheter is in the proper blood vessel, TheraSphere
      microspheres containing Y-90 will be injected into the catheter to block the blood supply to
      the blood vessel and to inject the microspheres filled with Y-90 to the tumor in the liver.
      After the TheraSphere microspheres are injected, the catheter will be removed from your
      groin.

      After the TheraSphere treatment procedure is over, you will stay at the Interventional
      Radiology recovery area for several hours so that the staff can monitor you for possible side
      effects. If you experience any serious side effects or complications after receiving the
      TheraSphere treatment and the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be
      admitted to the hospital to be monitored and for additional treatment.

      Study Visits:

      If you are receiving warfarin, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be collected every
      week to check your blood's ability to clot. If your doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you may be switched to enoxaparin instead of warfarin.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your blood's ability to clot, for
           liver function tests, and to measure levels of alpha-feto protein.

      At the end of every 2 Cycles (Cycles 3, 5, 7 and so on):

        -  Urine will be collected for routine testing and to measure general protein levels.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      The TheraSphere treatment will only be performed one time. You may continue taking sorafenib
      for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up phone calls.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you have completed the TheraSphere treatment and taken your last dose of study drug,
      the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine be collected for routine tests. The urine sample
           will also be used to measure general protein levels.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your blood's ability to clot, for
           liver function tests, and to measure levels of alpha-feto protein.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up Phone Calls:

      After you have completed the End-of-Treatment visit, the study staff will contact you by
      phone every 3 months to learn how you are doing since the treatment ended. During these phone
      calls, you will be asked if you have started any additional anti-tumor or anti-cancer
      therapy, and the name of any anti-cancer drug(s) you may be taking. You will also be asked
      about any side effects you may still be experiencing. Each follow-up phone call should last
      about 15-30 minutes. If you have a standard of care visit around the time this phone call is
      scheduled, you may be asked these questions in person at the clinic.

      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib is commercially available and FDA approved to
      treat advanced liver cancer. TheraSphere is commercially available and FDA approved for use
      in the radiation treatment or as neoadjuvant therapy before surgery and/or transplantation
      for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
