  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a multi-site, cluster design to determine the effectiveness of an intervention
      based on a Trauma Collaborative Care (TCC) model in improving patient outcomes for persons
      with severe orthopedic trauma and enhancing both patient and provider satisfaction with
      overall care. The study will also determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of the
      intervention.

      Primary Hypothesis: Compared to standard treatment alone, access to the TCC Program plus
      standard treatment will result in lower rates of the composite outcome (i.e. positive for
      poor function, depression, and/or PTSD).

      Secondary Hypotheses: Compared to standard treatment alone, access to the TCC Program plus
      standard treatment will result in lower levels of pain and higher rates of return to usual
      major activity and higher levels of health related quality of life. In addition, both primary
      and secondary outcomes will correlate strongly with the intermediate outcome of
      self-efficacy.
