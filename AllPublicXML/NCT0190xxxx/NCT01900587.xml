    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate bio-equivalence of tapentadol extended-release (ER)
      tamper-resistant formulation (TRF) tablet, to the current tapentadol ER, prolonged-release
      formulation 2 (PR2) tablet, in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, open-label (a medical research study in which participants and
      researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving, &quot;unblinded&quot;),
      single-centre, randomized (like the flip of a coin; 50/50 chance of receiving a study
      treatment), and 2-way crossover (groups of participants receive two or more interventions in
      a particular order) study of a single-dose tapentadol in healthy participants under fasted
      conditions. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (2 to 21 days before the study
      commences), Open-label Treatment (single-dose treatment on Day 1 of each period separated
      with wash-out period of 7 to 14 days) and End of study (Day 3 of treatment Period 2). The
      duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 5.5 weeks
      (including Screening). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment
      sequence groups. Participants assigned to the first treatment sequence will receive
      tapentadol TRF 50 milligram (mg) tablet, and after a washout period, participants will
      receive tapentadol PR2 50-mg tablet. Participants assigned to the second treatment sequence
      will receive tapentadol PR2 50-mg tablet, and after washout period, participants will receive
      tapentadol TRF 50-mg tablet. Bio-equivalence will be primarily evaluated by pharmacokinetics
      parameters. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.
