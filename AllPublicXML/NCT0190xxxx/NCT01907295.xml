  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or high blood pressure in the lungs, is a rare
      condition that can shorten life. Although the cause of this disease is usually unknown, in
      about 70% of heritable and 15-20% of idiopathic cases there is a change in a gene (a
      mutation) that controls how blood vessels grow and function. The gene is called bone
      morphogenetic protein type receptor 2 (BMPR2). Although mutations in BMPR2 are a risk factor
      for PAH, not everyone with a mutation gets the disease. Additional genetic and environmental
      factors are likely to contribute. The investigators suspect that mutations in other genes are
      responsible for some cases of PAH. In this study the investigators aim to recruit all
      patients with PAH and some of their relatives and follow them up for several years. The
      investigators hope to discover new mutations for this disease and to determine what factors
      lead to poor outcome, and to understand what triggers disease in patients with mutations.

      Who can participate? Adults with PAH, their relatives and controls (one off blood sample)

      What does the study involve?

      PAH patients will be seen at their local centre by their service team but they will have
      additional bloods and urine samples taken. Relatives of PAH patients will be seen every 6
      months at their nearest PAH centre. Tests will include:

        -  Epidemiology Questionnaire to assess factors affecting health

        -  An echocardiogram (ECHO) to assess the size, shape, pumping action and the extent of any
           damage to the heart.

        -  Lung function tests which include blowing measurements to assess gas volumes within the
           lungs as well as assessment of how the lungs exchange gases.

        -  Optional right heart catheterisation (RHC) to determine how much blood your heart is
           pumping while you are resting and on exercise. Optional Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
           tests. To measure heart function. ( to be done only once)

        -  6 minute walk test. To measure exercise capacity

        -  Cardiopulmonary exercise test. A bicycle exercise test, which will indicate how much
           blood your heart pumps while resting and with different levels of exercise.

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG), a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart

        -  Blood tests

        -  Urine

      Controls:Blood sample and medical data collected once

    <description>The purpose of this study is to set up a national cohort of heritable and idiopathic PAH cases and their relatives, to study the genetic and environmental contributions to disease. Setting up of this cohort of patients and relatives will provide the best resource for understanding what causes or triggers the disease, how to predict risk of death and response to therapy in individual patients, and to provide new ways of preventing and treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. The study will enable a better understanding for the first time the natural history of PAH, whether inherited or not. National outcomes to be measured will include survival, progression of the disease, changes in 6 minute walk distance, admissions to hospital for PAH and cause of death. Incidence of new cases of PAH will be measured in relatives as well.</description>

    <description>To establish a Biorepository for serum/plasma, urine, tissues and cells from heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH) patients and their relatives, and patients with idiopathic PAH.

    <description>To characterise the natural history of disease onset and progression in the UK national cohort of PAH patients, coupled with longitudinal clinical evaluation and sampling of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension family members. Longitudinal clinical data will be collated on subjects including haemodynamic data, clinical and research bloods, echocardiographic data, 6 minute walk distance, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, nt-proBNP and safety data ( admissions to hospital PAH related and cause and date of death) and medications.</description>
