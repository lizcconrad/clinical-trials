    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 separate stages, the first in adolescents and the second in
      children. Both Stages 1 and 2 will use an adaptive, single or multiple cohort open-label,
      single-treatment, fasting design examining the pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of up to 2
      separate modified release (MR) formulations (B and C) of HLD200 (54 mg).

      Both stages of this study will be divided into two phases: Screen and Active Period. During
      Screen, subjects will be screened over the course of 14 days, and washed off their existing
      ADHD medication during the final 5 days of outpatient screening. During the active period,
      subjects will receive a single treatment of B-HLD200 and plasma samples for PK will be
      collected during the night and through the next 48 hours. In addition, pediatric subjects
      will undergo math testing using the pen-and-paper PERMP both prior to and post dosing. This
      study procedure will be carried out across three sequential groups of 6 subjects until the
      full B-HLD200 formulation cohort of 18 subjects have completed all study procedures.
      Following the first cohort of 18 subjects, the entire sequence may be repeated in second
      subject cohort tested with C-HLD200.
