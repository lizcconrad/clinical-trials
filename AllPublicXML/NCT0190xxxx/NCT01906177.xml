      This study is a prospective, single cohort, multi-center study of Vanguard PS system and will
      be conducted in Korea with 2 institutions. The study will be conducted over a period of 10
      years. Patients will be followed at immediate post-op, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year, 3 years.

      Total of 2 sites will be involved in this study. 50 cases on each sites and total of 100
      subjects will be enrolled in the study.

      Primary end-point will be KSS at 1 year post op and secondary end-points are Survivorship of
      the product, KSS, EQ5D, High-Flexion Knee Score, Radiographic Assessment, and any kind of
      complication including lost to follow up.
