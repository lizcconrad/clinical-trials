  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the benefit of a chemotherapy drug called romidepsin in
      patients with T Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (T NHL) who have undergone autologous
      transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine a preliminary estimate of the progression-free survival of
      patients with T NHL who receive maintenance romidepsin at 2 years post-transplant for
      patients transplanted in CR1 or PR1 with standard risk histologies.

      Secondary aims include:

        -  Determine PFS at 2 yrs for patients transplanted in ≥CR/PR2 or for patients with high
           risk histologies.

        -  Determine the toxicities associated with romidepsin following autologous transplantation

        -  Determine the probability of OS at 2 years post transplant for all patients undergoing
           transplant

        -  Characterize the effect of romidepsin on immune recovery post HDT-ASCT

        -  OS and PFS 1 year after Romidespin completion

      Patients who receive romidepsin after transplant will be evaluable for the primary endpoint,
      and will be counted towards the accrual total. Any patient who does not receive romidepsin
      after transplant, regardless of reason, will be replaced. We will also accrue a second cohort
      of 8 patients who are transplanted in &gt;CR/PR2 and for high risk histologies to be analyzed
      for secondary endpoints only. This cohort will not be part of the primary endpoint and will
      be analyzed for summary statistics only. Patients who receive romidepsin after transplant
      will be counted towards the accrual total for Cohort 2. Any patient who does not receive
      romidepsin after transplant, regardless of reason, will be replaced.
