  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose mass balance study in healthy adult male volunteers to investigate the
      metabolism and excretion of [14C]-ONO-4053.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, non-randomised study in healthy adult male subjects. Six
      subjects will receive a single dose of 14C ONO-4053 administered orally as a suspension.
      Safety measurements (ECG, vital signs, biochemistry and haematology) and adverse events will
      be monitored throughout the study. After administration of 14C ONO-4053 subjects will remain
      in the clinical facility for collection of blood, urine and faecessamples. Samples will be
      analysed for recovery of radioactivity and characterisation of metabolites of ONO-4053.

          2. The subject has, or has a history of, any significant disease or disorder (including
             any clinically significant laboratory findings) that would increase the risk for the
             subject if they were enrolled in the study

          3. The subject has a history of acute gastrointestinal illness

          4. The subject has used prescription medicine, non-prescription medicine, vitamins,
