  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving a kind of
      immune cells called &quot;natural killer&quot; (NK) cells with standard chemotherapy and an allogeneic
      stem cell transplant (using cells from a donor). Researchers also want to learn the highest
      tolerable dose of NK cells that can be given.

      Immune system cells (such as NK cells) are made by the body to attack foreign or cancerous
      cells. Researchers believe that the NK cells you receive from the donor may react against the
      leukemia cells in your body, help eliminate leukemia, and prevent disease relapse.

      Dose Levels:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of NK cells
      based on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest
      dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue for up to 6 dose levels, until the
      highest tolerable dose of NK cells is found.

      The day you receive the stem cell transplant is called Day 0. The days before you receive
      your stem cell transplant are named with a minus sign (-). The days after you receive the
      stem cell transplant are named with a plus sign (+).

      You will receive 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatments that will be chosen by your doctor. The
      treatment will be selected based on your age and health. The types include a high-dose
      regimen and a reduced-intensity regimen.

      Study Drug Administration (High Dose Regimen):

      On Day -8, you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein.

      On Day -7, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.

      On Days -7 through -4, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour. Fludarabine and
      melphalan are given to treat the cancer and lower the immune system in order to lower the
      risk of the body rejecting the NK cells.

      On Day -3, you will receive total body irradiation (TBI). TBI involves the delivery of high
      doses of radiation designed to destroy cancer cells and/or lower the immune system in order
      to lower the risk of the body rejecting the new stem cells.

      On Day -2 or Day -1, you will receive NK cells by vein over 30 minutes.

      On Day -1, you will &quot;rest&quot; (not receive chemotherapy).

      On Day 0, you will receive the donor's stem cells by vein. The infusion will last anywhere
      from about 30 minutes to several hours.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. Cyclophosphamide
      is given to lower the immune system in order to lower the risk of graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as donor NK and stem cells, attacks the
      tissues of the recipient's body). You will also receive mesna by vein over 30 minutes every 4
      hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to lower the risk of
      side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to help lower
      the risk of GVHD. Tacrolimus will be given by vein non-stop for about 2 weeks. After the 2
      weeks of taking tacrolimus by vein, you will take tacrolimus by mouth as a pill for at least
      4 months after the transplant. MMF will be given by mouth, 3 times a day, usually for about
      6-7 months.

      Starting on Day +7, you will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day,
      until your blood cell levels are high enough. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth
      of a type of healthy white blood cells that fight infection.

      On Day +7 (+/- 1 day) and once about 3-12 weeks later, you will receive NK cells by vein over
      30 minutes.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Drug Administration (Reduced Intensity Regimen):

      If your study doctor thinks it is needed due to illness or your age, you will receive a
      reduced intensity regimen.

      On Day -9, you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein.

      On Day -8, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.

      On Days -7 through -4, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour.

      On Day -3, you will receive total body irradiation (TBI). TBI involves the delivery of high
      doses of radiation designed to destroy cancer cells and/or lower the immune system in order
      to lower the risk of the body rejecting the new stem cells.

      On Day -2 or Day -1, you will receive NK cells by vein over 30 minutes.

      On Day -1, you will &quot;rest&quot; (not receive chemotherapy).

      On Day 0, you will receive the donor's stem cells by vein. The infusion will last anywhere
      from about 30 minutes to several hours.

      On Days +3 and +4, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. You will also
      receive mesna by vein over 30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna doses on Days +3
      and +4. Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus and MMF to help lower the risk of GVHD.
      Tacrolimus will be given by vein non-stop for about 2 weeks. After the 2 weeks of taking
      tacrolimus by vein, you will take tacrolimus by mouth as a pill for at least 4 months after
      the transplant. MMF will be given by mouth, 3 times a day, usually for about 6-7 months.

      Starting on Day +7, you will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day,
      until your blood cell levels are high enough. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth
      of white blood cells.

      On Day +7 (+/- 1 day) and once about 3-12 weeks later, you will receive NK cells by vein over
      30 minutes.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Testing:

      Before you are sent home from the hospital and/or clinic, you will receive additional written
      instructions. These instructions will include how often you will come to the hospital/clinic,
      which standard drugs you will take at home, and what side effects you may have and what to do
      for them.

      After finishing the chemotherapy and cell infusion, your follow-up care will be routine
      standard of care follow-up that all patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      receive. At each visit, you will have a physical exam. You will be asked about any side
      effects you may have had. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. If the
      doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the
      disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with
      anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

      Blood (up to about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to test the genetic makeup and function of
      the infused NK cells and to check the status of the disease about once a week for the first 4
      weeks after the transplant, before the 3rd NK cell infusion and about 1 week later, and then
      about 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant, if possible. This may be repeated, if your
      doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      Your active participation in this study will be over 12 months after the transplant. You will
      be off study 2 years after the transplant. Between Years 1 and 2 after the transplant, the
      study staff may check your medical record to see how you are doing. You may be taken off
      study early if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse or
      comes back requiring further treatment, if intolerable side effects occur, if not enough NK
      cells can be collected, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If for any reason you want to leave the study early, you must talk to the study doctor. It
      may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have started to receive the study drugs
      but before you receive the stem cell transplant because your blood cell counts will be
      dangerously low.

      This is an investigational study. The study drugs are FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of blood cancers and/or stem cell transplant. The way the researchers
      process the NK cells and the infusion of them is investigational and is not FDA approved.

      Up to 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
