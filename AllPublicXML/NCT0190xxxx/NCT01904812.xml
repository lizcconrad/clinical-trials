  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex disease whose evaluation in everyday practice and
      in clinical research requires several aspects to be taken into account, in particular the
      impact of disease activity on quality of life. To date, the effect of systemic lupus on
      quality of life has only been described using generic questionnaires. Among the specific
      questionnaires for systemic lupus, the LupusQol, which has been validated in French, shows
      interesting psychometric properties. The determinants of quality of life specifically related
      to the disease are still unknown and could be studied using a longitudinal cohort thanks to
      the French version of the LupusQol.
