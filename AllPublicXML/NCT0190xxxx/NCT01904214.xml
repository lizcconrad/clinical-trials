      to quantify the effect of different degrees of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
      BAF312 (and selected metabolites) and to assess safety and tolerability in order to develop
      dosing recommendations for subjects with renal impairment

    <description>The pharmacokineticsof BAF312 will be studied in plasma up to 312 (+/-24) hours post-dose at the following time points: pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 216, and 312 (+/-24) hours post dose. Selected metabolites will also be quantified using the same samples as described above. Free plasma circulating fraction of BAF312 will also be investigated to assess whether protein binding is affected by renal impairment. For this purpose a separate blood sample will be taken at the following time point: 4 hours post-dose.</description>

        All subjects

          -  Use of other investigational drugs within certain timelines

          -  Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood or plasma within eight (8) weeks prior to

             waking hours and/or arrhythmic episodes; subjects with history or presence of
             ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extra-systoles &gt;100/24h, or higher
             grade), or supraventricular arrhythmias (other than occasional supraventricular

             significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs,
             or which may jeopardize the safety of the study subject in case of participation in
             the study.

          -  Treatment with certain drugs
