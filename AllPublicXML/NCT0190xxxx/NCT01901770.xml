      This clinical trial studies an educational intervention for parents and providers in
      increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in younger girls in Ohio Appalachia.
      Educational interventions may be effective in increasing the number of participants whose
      daughters receive HPV vaccination.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Implement a multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention directed at 3 levels within
      participating 12 Ohio Appalachia counties that includes information about cervical cancer,
      cervical cancer screening, HPV, the HPV vaccine, communication skills training to improve
      parent-health care provider conversations about the HPV vaccine, and organizational level
      components.

      II. Evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention in a
      group randomized controlled trial in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about HPV vaccination
      by mail or in-person review with project staff including a culturally tailored HPV and
      cervical cancer educational video and brochures, a question and answer (Q &amp; A) fact sheet,
      and a HPV and cervical cancer resource list. Clinics receive waiting and exam room posters
      and brochures, tabletop cards, reminder cards to mail to participants, an information
      resource list, newsletter, vaccine tracking system, and &quot;invitation to be vaccinated&quot; letter
      to mail to parents.

      Arm II: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about influenza
      vaccination by mail or in-person review with project staff.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
