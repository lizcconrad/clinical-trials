    <textblock>
      The results of this study will make it possible, thanks to better understanding of the
      natural history of colorectal cancer, to define new treatment and surveillance strategies for
      colorectal cancers resected with curative intent, so as to improve management and thus
      improve patient survival.

      These data will also make it possible to calculate the prevalence of patients who require
      treatment or surveillance because of their disease.
