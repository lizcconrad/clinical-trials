      The main objective of this study is to describe for the first time the expansion reserve of
      the pelvic area (measurements using the EOS system) for each of the four morphotypes
      (Roussouly classification) commonly found in a population of healthy volunteers.

      Secondary objectives:

      A. The intra-judge reproducibility and the interrater reliability for the different tools
      used to measure hip extension will be evaluated. Intra-judge reproducibility (photography)
      and interrater reliability (goniometry and photography) for the different tools used for
      measuring hip extension will be evaluated.

      B. The concordance between EOS measurements and measurements acquired via goniometry and
      photography will be evaluated.

      C. Describe certain radiographic measurements via the EOS system for the four morphotypes

    <description>The pelvic extension reserve (°) is measured via goniometry.
The goniometric measurements will be taken once by an investigator on all subjects and once by a different investigator on half of the subjects (with balanced distribution of morphotypes).</description>

    <description>The pelvic extension reserve (°) is measured using photography.
Photographic measurements will be performed twice one investigator and 1 time by a different investigator (total of three measurements).</description>

    <intervention_name>EOS measure of pelvic extension reserve.</intervention_name>
    <description>The pelvic extension reserve (°) is measured using the imaging system EOS.
Five X-rays will be made for each volunteer on the EOS system. The first is a frontal shot in a bipedal position, reference snapshot for verifying the absence of spinal deformity or hip pathology. The second and third are profile shots, one on the left and one on the right, whole body, bipedal position; serving as a reference picture. The fourth is profile shot, whole body, with the left hip in hyperextension. For maximum left hip hyperextension, the right leg rests on a step of varying height, and the hip is maximally flexed. The fifth is a profile shot, full body, with the right hip in hyperextension. For a maximum right hip hyperextension, the left leg rests on a step of varying height, and the hip is maximally flexed.</description>
