  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection testing in Africa, many
      patients never enroll in subsequent HIV care after testing or remain in care after an initial
      enrollment. This study's aim is to improve linkage to HIV care and retention in HIV care
      through the use of feasible, evidence-based, and practical interventions. The study takes
      place in Swaziland, the country with the highest HIV prevalence (24%) in sub-Saharan Africa.
      The study will randomize groups of HIV testing sites and affiliated clinics to either
      standard of care or a combined intervention strategy (CIS) which consists of point-of care
      CD4 (cluster differentiation 4 (CD4)) testing at time of HIV testing, fast-track HIV
      medications for those who are eligible for treatment,mobile phone appointment reminders, care
      bags filled with health prevention materials, and financial incentives. The study outcomes
      are linkage to and retention in care as well as cost effectiveness, feasibility of
      interventions, and patient acceptability of interventions.

      Linkage of patients from HIV testing to HIV care programs and their retention once enrolled
      in care are essential to HIV program effectiveness in terms of prevention of HIV;related
      morbidity and mortality and prevention of HIV transmission. Linkage and retention rates in
      HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are suboptimal, with less than half of patients who
      test positive successfully linking and remaining in care at 1 year. This study is a two-arm
      cluster site;randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel combination package of
      evidence;based interventions, the combination intervention strategy (CIS), compared to
      standard of care (SOC) on linkage and retention of HIV;positive patients from point of
      testing to retention in care. CIS will include 1) point of care CD4+ count assays at HIV
      testing sites; 2) accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for eligible patients;
      3) provision of a basic care and prevention package (BCPP); 4) short message service (SMS)
      reminders for clinic appointments; and 5) financial incentives for linkage and retention. The
      primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of CIS as compared to SOC on the combined
      outcome of rapid linkage to HIV care within 1 month and retention in care at 12 months among
      adults testing positive for HIV. Secondary aims include evaluation of the effectiveness of
      CIS compared to SOC on each of linkage to HIV; retention in care; time to ART initiation; HIV
      disease progression and mortality; patient acceptability; association between baseline
      characteristics and outcomes, and comparison of cost effectiveness.

    <description>Each HIV testing and counseling (HTC) site will be equipped with POC CD4+ testing using PIMA™ Analyser (Inverness), test strips, and reagents. Study staff will obtain 25 microliters of blood via finger prick and process the POC (point-of-care) CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) Count' test immediately following the baseline interview. Test results will be recorded on study forms including a referral form that has multiple copies, one copy to be given to the participant, the second sent to the affiliated HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus)care clinic in the study unit, and the third kept by study staff in a locked cabinet with other confidential material. All participants, regardless of the CD4+ result, will be encouraged to enroll in HIV care as soon as they can.</description>
