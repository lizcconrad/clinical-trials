  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously developed a cigarette cue extinction treatment (CET) procedure
      in non-treatment seeking volunteer smokers in our nicotine laboratory. The goal of Cue
      Extinction Treatment is to un-pair a behavioral or autonomic response from the stimulus that
      triggers it. This is accomplished through repeated exposure to that trigger, while removing
      the patient's ability to act out the conditioned response. In the present study, the trigger
      is a lit cigarette, and the response the investigators seek to un-pair is cigarette craving.
      In the procedure the investigators have previously developed and intend to use again, the
      participant is shown a pack of his brand of choice cigarettes. The researcher removes a
      cigarette from the pack, lights it, and asks the participant to hold the cigarette without
      smoking it for 90 seconds. This procedure is repeated seven times over the course of a
      six-hour lab session. The investigators hope to boost the clinical response to smoking cue
      exposure therapy in quitters on NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) pretreatment by
      pharmacological augmentation with the partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine (DCS).
      Behavioral extinction training is a form of learning that may be modulated by NMDA receptor
      mediated glutamate transmission. The study's main hypothesis is that the partial NMDA
      receptor agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) facilitates cue exposure training and may prevent
      relapse to smoking. The aim of the proposed study is to assess whether DCS-facilitation of
      cue-exposure therapy improves abstinence among smokers on the nicotine patch seeking
      treatment. Development of an effective treatment strategy to enhance the effectiveness of
      NRTs would have a direct and significant positive impact on public health.
