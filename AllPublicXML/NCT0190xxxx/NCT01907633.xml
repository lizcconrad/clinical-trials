  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the risk of out-of-hospital Sudden
      Cardiac (heart) Death (SCD) associated with current use of domperidone compared to current
      use of a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), current use of metoclopramide, or non-use of any of
      these medications.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a population-based, retrospective (a study in which the exposures and outcomes
      occurred before the study began), and nested case-control study (a study in which the
      patients with the study outcome [cases] and comparison patients without that outcome
      [controls] are observed to assess their exposure to the medication being studied
      [domperidone, PPI's and metoclopramide]). The data will come from the United Kingdom's
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The study will estimate the rate of SCD during periods
      of exposure to each of the study medications, and during periods of exposure to none of them;
      and the ratios of these rates. It will also use a &quot;case-crossover&quot; analysis (in which each
      case serves as his/her own control) to re-estimate these rate ratios in a manner that takes
      account of personal characteristics such as obesity or smoking that may affect the study
      findings and are incompletely recorded in the database.

    <description>This will be evaluated for the number of study participants (who had SCD) exposed to domperidone, proton pump inhibitor, metoclopramide, and none of these medications.

    <description>This will be evaluated for the number of study participants who had SCD in relation to domperidone exposure period and domperidone non-exposure period. SCD is defined as a natural death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).
