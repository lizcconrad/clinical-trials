  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low testosterone is a common male problem. The diagnosis of low testosterone often requires
      blood sampling and expensive testing. We want to know if measuring saliva testosterone can be
      used in place of blood sampling. Study participants will be asked to provide samples of blood
      and saliva for the measurement of testosterone. These results may lead to the development of
      a saliva test for testosterone.

      Testosterone is required for normal male health that is known to decline in aging or other
      conditions. Physiologically active testosterone, also known as &quot;free&quot; testosterone, is
      present as a small percentage of the total blood level, mostly bound to sex hormone binding
      globulin and albumin. Estimation of serum free testosterone is difficult and costly,
      requiring equilibrium dialysis of a serum sample. These binding proteins are not normally
      present in saliva. It is hypothesized that the free fraction of testosterone in blood is in
      equilibrium with the extravascular space, notably saliva. The sponsor proposes to test this
      hypothesis by sampling saliva and serum and measuring testosterone. Serum free testosterone
      will be measured following equilibrium dialysis. To perform this study approximately 40
      eugonadal and 20 hypogonadal males will be recruited.
