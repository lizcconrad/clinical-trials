    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of arthrocentesis in the treatment of internal
      derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This work was designed as a prospective case series clinical study. Patients imaging was
      evaluated with Cone-Beam Computed Tomography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance at the beginning
      of the treatment and after the last arthrocentesis.

    <description>The mean maximum mouth opening(MMO) pre-operatively was 15,8 mm and increased to 34 mm immediately following arthrocentesis which increased by 0.5-1 mm at every month followup with mean MMO of 39,4 mm at 6 months.

        A total of 30 patients with TMJ internal derangement and pain with history of failed
        conservative management were selected. 70% had anteriorly displaced discs (AD), and 30
        complained of other disorders (osteophytes, signs of soft tissues inflammmation, TMJ
        structure alterations).
