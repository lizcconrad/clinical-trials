      This study will test the potential of two techniques using light properties of adipose tissue
      to diagnose crown-like structures and inflammation to be compared with pathologic examination
      of adipose tissue biopsies from ongoing clinical studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue (fat) inflammation is emerging as an important harbinger of disease
      development including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and potentially cancer. The hallmark
      feature of adipose tissue inflammation is the crown-like structure, a dying fat cell
      surrounded by immune cells attempting to clear the damage. Current methods for detecting
      adipose tissue inflammation rely on invasive procedures such as fat biopsies. We propose
      developing methods that use the light reflection properties of inflamed adipose tissue as a
      potential non-invasive method to detect adipose tissue inflammation.
