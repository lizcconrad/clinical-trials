      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a group intervention for primary health
      care dyads (two interacting people, in this case: mother-infant or caregiver-infant), which
      have been screened during pregnancy to be at psychosocial risk, has an impact on parental
      sensitivity.

    <textblock>
      The first three years of life of every child is fundamental for their development, these
      years offer a unique window of opportunity for future health promotion, and different
      investigations have proved that investing in this period of life not only has great economic
      benefits, but social ones too.

      In Chile the political decision to invest in these valuable years was translated into the
      creation of a national social program called &quot;Chile Crece Contigo&quot;. This Program seeks to
      intervene in the physical, cognitive and socioemotional areas of development of every Chilean
      child since they are conceived until they are 4 years old to promote the best development
      outcome possible. The program identifies families at psychosocial vulnerability and offers
      them specific interventions according to the risk detected.

      In this context different health and social services are provided to pregnant women during
      their health care visits, such as screening for different psychosocial risks (eg. Low social
      support, poverty, tobacco or drug use) and according to this screening various interventions
      are offered by Primary Health Care centers (eg. home visits).

      It has been described that in groups at psychosocial risk the prevalence of interactional
      problems, specifically alterations in the attachment style between the child and the
      caregiver, is higher than in populations without these risks. This is relevant given that the
      quality and style of attachment established in infancy predicts subsequent social, emotional
      and cognitive development. Attachment styles, other than secure, have been associated with
      behavioural problems in pre-school and school ages, psychopathology during adolescence, later
      anxiety disorders and higher rates of using emergency health care services.

      One of the factors shown to predict the attachment style established between the child and
      the caregiver is the parental sensitivity (also called maternal sensitivity)- defined as
      every caregiver's pattern of conduct toward the child that soothes, and increases his comfort
      and at the same time reduces his stress and disinterest. It also considers the capacity of
      the adult to pay attention, interpret and respond to the child´s needs. The literature
      suggests that having an adequate parental sensitivity is associated with a secure attachment
      style at the end of the first year of life, and having low parental sensitivity detected
      early in life (even as early as 6-8 weeks) predicts an insecure style of attachment at age 2.

      Preliminary Chilean data has shown that 25% of biparental families and up to 52.5% of
      monoparental families with low income are have low parental sensitivity and are catalogued as
      having &quot;Interactional risk&quot; (defined as a score of 6 or less points in the CARE-Index scale),
      indicating the need of offering an intervention specifically aiming to work on the
      caregiver-child relationship.

      Since the creation of the Program &quot;Chile Crece Contigo&quot; there have been great achievements
      toward the promotion of adequate infant development, especially in the cognitive and physical
      areas of development, however the initiatives in the socio emotional area are lacking. Issues
      in caregiver and child relationships are not addressed systematically, which is why counting
      with interventions that promote parental sensitivity and the development of secure attachment
      relationships that can be offered to families at psychosocial risk responds to a social
      necessity and contributes to the promotion of adequate infant mental health and family
      health.

      Considering that up to date an intervention for the means described above and available to be
      used in Primary Health Care did not exist, during the years 2008-2010 such intervention was
      designed. The intervention was elaborated according to the method described by the UK Medical
      Research Council. The intervention was then piloted in two Family Primary Health centers
      showing an improvement in caregiver-child interactions. Analysis indicate that after 4 months
      of the intervention: caregivers valued positively having participated, there were no losses
      to participating, there was an increase of 33% of secure attachment styles (according to the
      Massie-Campbell Scale) which was not statistically significant, but could result significant
      in a larger sample size.

      The intervention proposed aims to improve caregiver-child relationships, specifically by
      focusing on parental sensitivity, and is easily applicable and replicable in Primary Health
      Care considering that it requires little personnel training, the materials used are easily
      available and are cheap for Primary Health Care. However, the question of &quot;has the
      intervention proposed any impact on parental sensitivity in dyads at psychosocial risk?&quot;
      still has to be addressed.

      We define the term &quot;dyad&quot; as two interacting people, in this case: mother-infant.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a group intervention on the parental
      sensitivity of primary health care dyads that have been screened positive for psychosocial
      risk during pregnancy.

      Specific objectives:

        -  Evaluate the percentage of dyads catalogued as having &quot;Interactional risk&quot; in the
           intervention group compared to the control group

        -  Evaluate the change in the score of parental sensitivity of the dyads in the
           intervention group compared to the control group

        -  Evaluate the change in the number of depressive symptoms of the mother of the dyads in
           the intervention group compared to the control group

      Methods: randomized clinical trial. Dyads (mother-infants from 4 to 12 months of age) which
      have been screened during pregnancy to be at psychosocial risk in 2 Family Health Care
      Centers in the La Pintana district in Metropolitan Santiago, will be randomized to:

        -  Receive usual care (&quot;control group&quot;) consisting in: home visits, evaluation by social
           worker and planning interventions according to multidisciplinary team

        -  Participate in a group intervention besides receiving usual care The randomization will
           be done with a computer program and sealed in dark envelopes so the sequence remains
           occult until the dyad enters the study.

      Parental sensitivity and interactional risk will be measured with the CARE-Index scale during
      3 timings: at enrollment (when the interview is done), immediately after participating in the
      group workshop (from 1 to 2 weeks after the workshop is finished) and 4 months after
      (measuring times are also for control group). The scoring of the CARE-Index scale will be
      done by expert external coders that are blind to the randomization group.

      Symptoms for postpartum depression will also be measured with the Edinburgh postnatal
      depression scale (EPDS).

      Statistical analysis: the primary outcome is the change in the category of &quot;Interactional
      risk&quot; in the CARE-Index scale. Secondary outcomes are the changes in the scores in parental
      sensitivity and number of depressive symptoms. We will describe the data using averages,
      percentiles and standard deviations for quantitative variables and proportions for nominal
      variables. The bivariate analysis includes χ2 test statistics and t tests for independent
      samples using the SPSS 17.0 Software. The sample size was determined to detect significant
      differences in the percentage of dyads that change their interactional risk category in the
      CARE-index scale between the intervention and control groups. Each group should have 90
      dyads, assuming a change in 5% due only to the pass of time, a change in 20% of the
      intervened dyads, a power of at least 80% with a 5% significance level, and estimating a 20%
      loss of the dyads during the execution of the investigation.

      The intervention consists in a group workshop (for up to 7 dyads with children aged between 6
      and 12 months and two health care professional monitors) of four sessions of two hours each,
      held weekly. One of the sessions is characterized as including the fathers or other
      caregivers relevant to the upbringing of the children. Each session is structured around
      various activities that specifically deal with the skills associated with parental
      sensitivity and address relevant issues to child rearing, considering the development of the
      child.

      The intervention was designed through the methodology proposed by the UK Medical Research
      Council and has been tested in a pilot study of 11 dyads in two primary health care centers
      and showed an improvement of 33 per cent in the secure attachment style in the dyads (not
      statistically significant).

      Recruiting, enrollment and procedures: mothers that have been previously screened positive
      during pregnancy to be at psychosocial risk will be contacted for an interview if their child
      is between 4 and 12 months old. In the interview they will be asked if they would like to
      participate in the study and sign an informed consent form. Once they have done this an
      interview will take place to collect socio demographic data regarding the family, record a 3
      minute video of the dyads playing (to be coded with the CARE-index scale) and an Edinburgh
      postnatal depression scale applied. The interviewer will then assign the dyad to the
      intervention or control group (through the use of closed numbered envelopes to which the
      interviewer is blind).

      If the dyad is recruited for the intervention group they will be invited to participate in
      the group workshop mentioned above, besides receiving the usual interventions the center does
      for dyads of psychosocial risk. And asked to come to the centers for the measurements of the
      following CARE-Index and Edinburgh postnatal depression scales.

      If the dyad is recruited for the control group they will receive the usual interventions the
      center offers dyads at psychosocial risk and asked to come for the following measurements (as
      in the intervention group).

      The recruiting will be done by trained interviewers (different health care professionals that
      work at the primary health care centers) that will follow a strict protocol to avoid missing
      entering data and maintain confidentiality at all times. The data will also be managed with
      strict confidential rules.

      If the group intervention should prove to have a positive impact on maternal sensitivity it
      could be used in other primary health care centers, constituting an effective form for
      promoting adequate socio emotional development the first years of life.

    <description>The CARE-Index Scale is a validated method for the evaluation of dyadic interaction through observation and microanalysis (using a video of 3 minute play between the child and caregiver) scored by a trained expert coder. It generates a score in terms of parental sensitivity (or maternal sensitivity) on a scale of 1 to 14 (supposing better sensitivity with higher scores) and another cut off punctuation score for the classification of 2 categories:
&quot;Interactional risk&quot;: 6 or less points on the parental sensitivity scale, which suggests that the dyad should be intervened

    <description>The presence of depressive symptoms in the mother or caregiver will be measured given the effect of postpartum depression on the emotional availability of the mother and her capacity to respond sensibly to the child's needs. This will be done through the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, which is an instrument used widely in Primary Health Care for screening for postpartum depression. It consists in an auto-administered questionnaire, with 10 multiple choice questions (the higher the score, more depressive symptoms). It has been validated in Chile, and using a cutoff point of 9/10 it has proven to have a 100% sensibility and 80% specificity.</description>
