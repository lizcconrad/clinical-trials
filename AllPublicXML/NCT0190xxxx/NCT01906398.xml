      The purpose of the study is to obtain pilot data on safety and efficacy of ketogenic diet
      (KD) as adjunctive treatment of adults with refractory epilepsy. This will be an open label
      study comparing seizure frequency during 4 months of prospective baseline observation period
      with seizure frequency during 4 months of add-on KD treatment. 18-65 year old men and women
      with refractory epilepsy, defined as seizures persisting in spite of past/present treatments
      with ≥ 3 AEDs, with seizure frequency of ≥ 0.5/month, will be evaluated. Subjects with both
      primary generalized and localization-related epilepsy (PGE, LRE) will be recruited. Subjects
      will have had epilepsy for at least 2 years prior to enrollment. Following initial screening,
      subjects will be observed for 4 months, with no change in AEDs except when deemed necessary
      by the patient's neurologist according to standard clinical care. Patients will then start
      ketogenic diet. Evaluations will include seizure frequency using a seizure diary, adverse
      events, treatment compliance using urine and plasma ketone levels. Quality of life will be
      evaluated with a standardized questionnaire of Quality Of Life In patients with Epilepsy,
      QOLIE-31-P. Level of alertness will be evaluated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These
      questionnaires will be administered at each visit.

      The goal of the present open label study is to obtain pilot data to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of KD in adults with intractable epilepsy. Investigators will evaluate the effect of
      KD on seizure frequency and on adverse events. Investigators will also evaluate serum levels
      of the ketone body, βhydroxybutyrate (BOH) and of glucose in order to determine whether
      changes in serum levels of these substances correlate with KD-associated changes in seizure
      frequency. The data from the present study will be used to design a large randomized study.

      Laboratory evaluations will include complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes, including
      calcium, phosphate and magnesium, renal and liver functions, including total protein and
      albumin, uric acid, fasting serum lipid profile, glucose and b- hydroxybutyrate (BOH) levels,
      serum carnitine level, serum a.m. trough antiepilepsy drugs levels, and urine calcium and
      creatinine level. They will be obtained twice at baseline a month apart and monthly during KD
      treatment.

      Primary outcome measures will include average monthly seizure frequency and adverse events.
      Secondary outcome measures will include treatment compliance, quality of life questionnaire
      (QOLIE-31-P) scores, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores.

    <description>Seizure frequency, adverse events and treatment compliance will be reviewed. The diet will be reviewed with the subject by the nutritionist before treatment initiation. Seizure frequency will be counted using a daily seizure diary. Subject's neurological and other clinical progress since the last visit will be reviewed. Concurrent medications will be documented. Vital signs and weight will be obtained, and a complete physical and neurological examination will be performed. Body mass index will be calculated. Subjects seizure/urine ketone diary will be reviewed at each visit.
Treatment compliance will be evaluated with urine ketone levels using the diaries and with serum b-hydroxy-butyrate (b-OH-butyrate, BOH) levels.</description>

The diet will be supplemented with vitamins, calcium and phosphorus supplements to meet the requirements of US Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) standard.
