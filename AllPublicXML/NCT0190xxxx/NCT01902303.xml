  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new drug treatment is effective to block the
      development of a cold sore lesion following Ultra Violet (UV) exposure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, randomized, evaluator and subject-blind, placebo controlled study
      design

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the test articles to block the
      development of a cold sore lesion from progressing beyond the prodromal stage following a
      UV-induced process.

      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was to determine if a recurrent oral herpes
      episode initiated with prodromal symptoms was aborted before progressing to a lesion
      (vesicle) via assessing lesion stages by a trained evaluator.

      The secondary efficacy endpoints included: a) subject self-assessments and b) test article
      weights and diaries to track treatment compliance.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to determine if a recurrent oral herpes episode initiated with prodromal symptoms is aborted before progressing to a lesion (vesicle stage) via assessing lesion stages by the trained evaluator. Any episode of oral herpes that did not reach a vesicle stage or higher by Day 7 (based on evaluator and self-assessments of legion stage) was considered &quot;aborted&quot; or &quot;blocked&quot;. Any episode of oral herpes that reached a vesicle stage or higher by Day 7 was considered a treatment failure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment occurred from 29Jul2013 through 09Sep2014. Subjects were recruited through three research clinics located in the US who had been trained in UVr application used to trigger recurrent oral Herpes Simplex Labialis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects who did not meet inclusion/exclusion or withdrew consent prior to enrollment were not enrolled in the study. Eligible subjects underwent minimum erythema dose (MED) UVr determination and if MED criteria was met were randomized. Those enrolled who did not develop prodrome following the UVr induced process were not treated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants for Whom a Recurrent Oral Herpes Episode Initiated With Prodromal Symptoms Were Aborted Before Progressing to a Lesion as Assessed by a Trained Evaluator</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to determine if a recurrent oral herpes episode initiated with prodromal symptoms is aborted before progressing to a lesion (vesicle stage) via assessing lesion stages by the trained evaluator. Any episode of oral herpes that did not reach a vesicle stage or higher by Day 7 (based on evaluator and self-assessments of legion stage) was considered “aborted” or “blocked”. Any episode of oral herpes that reached a vesicle stage or higher by Day 7 was considered a treatment failure.</description>

        <population>Participants that did not experience prodrome stage as assessed by the evaluator or met major protocol violations were not included in the PP analysis.</population>
