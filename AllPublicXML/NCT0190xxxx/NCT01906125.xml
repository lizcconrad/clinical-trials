  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to establish the equivalence of 2 formulations to the intended final
      market product. The formulations to compare are the capsule given to patients in the phase I
      and II studies and the capsule that is being administered to the patients in the phase III
      trials. Both capsules will be compared to the intended final market capsule. The comparison
      will be performed looking at the pharmacokinetic parameters that define the rate and extent
      of absorption, those are Cmax and AUC. A statistical analysis will be performed comparing
      these parameters calculated after a single 125 mg dose of the 3 capsules identifying like
      that if there are significant differences between these 3 formulations.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - 8)]</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
