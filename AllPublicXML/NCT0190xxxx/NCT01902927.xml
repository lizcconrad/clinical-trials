  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem whose prevalence is
      increasing rapidly. The gradual decrease in exercise tolerance is one of the usual
      consequences of COPD that affects the functional independence and quality of life of
      patients.

      In COPD patients, breathlessness and muscle fatigue are the main symptoms limiting exercise.
      Recent studies have shown that most of the physiological mechanisms of psychological factors
      such as emotions, motivation, memory, personality, expectations, or prior experience can
      greatly influence and modulate the perception of breathlessness. It has been proposed that
      the attentional distraction (visual or auditory) during exercise may be associated with a
      decrease in anxiety and shortness of breath and could improve exercise tolerance in COPD. We
      therefore propose to study the impact of attentional strategies of distraction on the
      perception of dyspnea and walking tolerance in patients with COPD.

      The research hypotheses are:

      i) Compared with exposure to a strategy of negative attentional distraction during exercise,
      exposure to a strategy of positive attentional distraction will improve walking exercise
      tolerance in patients with COPD;

      ii) For a given level of effort, sensory perception and emotional perception will be enhanced
      by exposure to a strategy of positive attentional distraction.

      Ten subjects with moderate to severe COPD will be recruited at the Research Center of the
      Institut Universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (CRIUCPQ). During an
      assessment visit, we will measure complete pulmonary function, body composition and maximal
      functional capacity during a maximal incremental test work performed on a treadmill.

      During two subsequent experimental visits, and after spirometry control, participants will
      perform a walking test performed on a treadmill at an intensity corresponding to 75% of
      maximum effort during maximal incremental test. The test will be carried out in combination
      with a strategy of either positive attentional distraction, neutral attentional distraction
      or negative attentional distraction . The order of the condition will be randomized.
