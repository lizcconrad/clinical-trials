      To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib versus trans-arterial
      chemoembolization plus external beam radiation therapy in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma invading major intrahepatic vessels
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current practice guidelines recommend only sorafenib for patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma invading major intrahepatic vessels. However, recent data from observational
      studies suggest that the combination of transarterial chemoembolization and external beam
      radiotherapy would be as effective as sorafenib.
