  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer patients with bone involvement who are at high-risk of subsequent
      skeletal related event (SRE), defined as radiotherapy or surgery to the bone, pathological
      fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia (as reflected through: elevated sCTX or
      bone pain or a prior SRE despite receiving standard bisphosphonate therapy) should experience
      a decrease in the surrogate marker, sCTX, at week 12 if switched to zoledronic acid compared
      with those patients who continue on intravenous pamidronate (i.e. current standard of care).
      The investigators propose that a drop in sCTX will correlate with improved pain, quality of
      life and a reduced incidence of further SREs.

      This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase IV
      study of pamidronate vs. zoledronic acid in women with breast cancer and bone metastases.
      Patients who are at high-risk of subsequent SREs will be screened for entry into this study.
      High-risk will be defined as fulfilling one or more of the following criteria: elevated sCTX
      (&gt;400ng/L) and/or bone pain and/or a prior SRE and/or progression of bone disease (by
      imaging) despite at least 3 months of pamidronate therapy. Patients who meet the eligibility
      criteria, will be randomized to receive 3 cycles of intravenous zoledronic acid (4mg
      intravenously over 15 minutes) or to continue their standard dose of pamidronate. Both
      treatments will be given at 4 week intervals. Patients will be stratified according to
      whether or not they have had a SRE prior to study entry, progressive bone disease or bone
      pain. In order for the study to be double-blind, patients will receive two infusions
      simultaneously, at each study visit, one of the active drug and another of the placebo. After
      completing 3 cycles of study treatment, patients will resume their monthly intravenous
      pamidronate infusions as per current standard of care.

    <description>To determine the proportion of high-risk metastatic breast cancer patients that will achieve a significant improvement in palliative response (18) (defined as a two unit drop in their worst pain score, based on a brief pain inventory questionnaire for two consecutive measurements at least one month apart) in the zoledronic and pamidronate treatment arms.</description>

    <description>To assess whether a drop in sCTX one week post infusion of zoledronic acid is a predictor of pain benefit at week 12. We will test the strength of the association in sCTX drop (any drop from baseline level) at week 1 and palliative response when measured at week 12, using the validated BPI and FACT-BP questionnaires</description>
