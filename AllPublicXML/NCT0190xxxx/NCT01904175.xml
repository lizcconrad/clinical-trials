  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplantation is used to treat many malignant and non-malignant diseases. The
      investigators and others have shown that less toxic preparative regimens (reduced intensity
      or 'mini' transplants) allow reliable allogeneic engraftment and durable remissions,
      significantly broadening the population of patients who may be offered this therapy to those
      who are older and more infirmed. The field is now focusing on the period post transplant for
      approaches to immune recovery leading to improved outcomes.

      The primary objective of this registry is to catalogue data from patients who undergo
      standard of care reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation.

      Subjects will have toxicity monitored and reported per the Center for International Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) program standard and as required by law for bone marrow
      transplant (BMT) reporting in the USA. Data will be collected from physical exam, laboratory
      studies, radiographs that are performed for clinical purposes. The tests and procedures are
      not in addition or in excess of our standards for allogeneic transplant outside of this
      registry. Data about donors will also be collected.
