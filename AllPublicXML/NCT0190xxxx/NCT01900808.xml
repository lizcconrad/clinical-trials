  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient elastography (TE)is the reference method to identify liver stiffness (LSM) but
      fails to obtain a measurement in 3% of cases and results are considered unreliable in 16%.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability and diagnostic accuracy of TE
      performed by trained operators (&lt;500 explorations), after a second evaluation by experienced
      explorers (&gt;500 explorations) and after a third exploration using XL probe. Inadequate LSM
      will be re-evaluated by experienced operators with the M (standard size) probe. A third
      register will be performed with XL (obese size) probe in those patients with inadequate M
      probe determination. Diagnostic accuracy will be estimated in patients with liver biopsy to
      identify significant fibrosis with a TE cut-off value of 7.6 kPa (kilo pascal).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Applicability of transient elastography (TE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be calculated after evaluation of all included patients with M probe by trained operators (at baseline and after 48 weeks), M probe by experienced operators after 72 weeks and XL probe after 72 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Applicability will be calculated as the proportion of reliable liver stiffness measurements (LSM). TE will be considered ADEQUATE when it included at least 10 valid measurements with a success rate ≥60% and interquartile range/median of LSM (IQR/M) ≤30% OR INADEQUATE.</description>

    <time_frame>Will be calculated after evaluation of all included patients with M probe by trained operators after 48 weeks, M probe by experienced operators after 72 weeks and XL probe after 72 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic accuracy will be calculated with the number of correctly classified patients (wuth significant fibrosis) considering a cut-off value of 7.6 kPa.</description>
