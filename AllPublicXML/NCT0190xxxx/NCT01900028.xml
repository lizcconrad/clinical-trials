  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours: Part A will assess the effect
      of itraconazole on the PK parameters of olaparib and will determine the effect of olaparib on
      the QT interval following single oral dosing; Part B will determine the effect of olaparib on
      the QT Interval following multiple oral dosing; Part C will allow patients continued access
      to olaparib after the PK and QT phases and will provide for additional safety data
      collection. A total of 48 patients are planned to be enrolled; at least 42 evaluable patients
      will be required to complete the study. Patients will participate as a single cohort in all
      parts of the study.

             uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled
             ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled
             major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome,
             extensive bilateral interstitial lung disease on high resolution computer tomography
             (HRCT) scan, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

         12. Patients with a history of poorly controlled hypertension with resting blood pressure
             (BP) greater than150/100 mm Hg in the presence or absence of a stable regimen of
             hypertensive therapy. Measurements will be made after the patient has been resting
             supine for a minimum of 5 minutes. Two or more readings should be taken at 2 minute
             intervals and averaged. If the first 2 diastolic readings differ by more than 5 mm Hg,
             an additional reading should be obtained and averaged.

         13. Patients with a history of heart failure, or left ventricular dysfunction, and
             patients who require calcium channel blockers.

         14. Patients who have gastric, gastro-oesophageal or oesophageal cancer.

         15. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders or significant gastrointestinal resection likely to
             interfere with the absorption of Olaparib.

         16. Breastfeeding women.

         17. Immunocompromised patients, eg, patients who are known to be serologically positive
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         18. Patients with known active hepatic disease (ie, hepatitis B or C).

         19. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to itraconazole or any of the excipients of the
             product.

         20. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the
             product.

         21. Mean QTc with Fridericia's correction (QTcF) greater than 470 ms in screening ECG or
             history of familial long QT syndrome:

             A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (eg, repeated demonstration of a QTc
             interval greater than 470 ms).

             A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de pointes (eg, heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, family history of long QT syndrome).

         22. The use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval.

         23. Concomitant medication contraindicated for use with itraconazole (including, but not
             limited to): cisapride, oral midazolam, nisoldipine, pimozide, quinidine, dofetilide,
             triazolam, levacetylmethadol (levomethadyl), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A
             (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitors metabolized by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and
             simvastatin, ergot alkaloids metabolized by CYP3A4, such as dihydroergotamine,
             ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine and methylergometrine (methylergonovine).

         24. Clinical judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the
             study
