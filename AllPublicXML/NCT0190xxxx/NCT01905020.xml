  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and pump therapy to regulate overnight glucose
      levels in a out-patient study in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy is more effective in
      regulating overnight glucose levels in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes compared
      to single-hormone closed-loop strategy, which in turn is more effective than the conventional
      pump therapy.

      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      We aim to conduct a multicenter study to compare the efficacy of conventional pump therapy,
      single-hormone closed-loop strategy and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate
      overnight glucose levels, at home, in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes. Each
      intervention will be tested on two nights: 1) After a carbohydrate-rich dinner meal (to
      exaggerate hyperglycemic risk and; 2) After an evening exercise (to exaggerate hypoglycemic
      risk).

    <description>Variable subcutaneous insulin infusion rate will be used to regulate glucose levels. Insulin Aspart (Novorapid) will be infused using a subcutaneous infusion pump. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The pump's infusion rate will then be changed manually based on the computer-generated recommendations of infusion rates.</description>
