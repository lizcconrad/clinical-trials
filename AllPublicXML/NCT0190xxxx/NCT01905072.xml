  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of structured CHW- provided home
      visits, using an intervention created through community-based participatory research, to
      standard care received through WIC office visits in preventing the development of overweight
      (weight/length &gt;85th percentile) and obesity (weight/length &gt;95th percentile) in infants
      during their first 2 years of life.

      Hypothesis 1: Children in the intervention group will remain within their growth centiles in
      height/weight and weight for age, while children in the control group will increase in
      height/weight percentiles and weight percentiles more rapidly (&gt; .67 SD) during the first
      year of life.

      Hypothesis 2: Fewer children who receive the intervention will have BMI &gt;95th percentile at
      ages 2 and 3 than the children in the control group.

      Hypothesis 3: Children who receive the intervention will exclusively breastfeed for a longer
      period of time than will children in the control group.

      Hypothesis 4: Children who receive the intervention will have a higher percentage of fruits
      and vegetables and a lower percentage of sweetened beverages, desserts, and candy in their
      diets at ages 1, 2, and 3, than will children in the control group.

      Hypothesis 5: Parents in the intervention group will be more responsive to infant feeding
      cues (hunger, satiety)than parents in the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Along with birth weight and parental body size, infant feeding is recognized as one of the
      most influential biological and environmental factors that affect weight gain during infancy.
      Parental feeding practices have a strong impact on children's food availability, eating
      behaviors, and weight. The Institute of Medicine's(IOM) recent report (2011) on early
      childhood obesity prevention policies recommends five approaches to preventing obesity:
      assess, monitor, and track growth from birth to age 5; increase physical activity and
      decrease sedentary behavior in young children; support breastfeeding and be responsive to
      children's feeding cues; limit screen time; and promote age-appropriate sleep for young
      children. Based on the previous work by this research team, and in collaboration with a major
      urban health department, we propose to test an intervention that incorporates all the IOM's
      recommendations to prevent the development of obesity in at-risk infants. The intervention
      will be guided by health professionals and delivered through home visits by community health
      workers (CHWs), supervised by public health nurses (PHN), to Mexican American women and
      children who are clients of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
      and Children (WIC) Program in Houston, TX. The intervention will occur for 2 years with 1
      year of follow-up, for a total of 3 years of measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        MATERNAL - Self-described as Mexican American, pre-pregnant BMI of 25 or greater, speaks
        English or Spanish, is between the ages of 18 and 40, lives in a home where she can receive
        home visitors, has no diagnosed chronic diseases that can affect the growth of a fetus
        (cardiac, respiratory, etc.), have a telephone contact, and is not intending to move from
        the area. Gestational diabetes will be noted but is not an exclusion criterion; however,
        Type 1 diabetics will be excluded. Exposure to tobacco smoke (either maternal or household
        smoking) will be noted as it is associated with infant obesity, but will not be an
        inclusion or exclusion criteria.

        INFANT - We will enroll the full-term singleton infants of enrolled mothers. The infants
        will be enrolled if they are &gt; 38 weeks gestation, have a birth weight &gt; 2500 gm, and are
        without endocrine/chromosomal/genetic abnormality that could interfere with growth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        MATERNAL - Not enrolled in WIC clinic or does not plan to continue with WIC clinic after
        delivery, high-risk pregnancy, hospitalized after discharge of infant, separated from
        infant, or experiencing significant postpartum complications. If these criteria develop in
        an enrolled mother, she will remain in the study per CONSORT guidelines, but her infant
        will not be followed for study outcomes. We have sufficient power with our sample size to
        allow for these events.

        INFANT - Not discharged home with the mother or who are otherwise separated from their
        mothers or who has a severe illness that can affect growth. CONSORT guidelines will apply
        in these cases as well as in maternal cases.
