    <textblock>
      This study was done to look at a method of hormonal birth control, called the NuvaRing, and
      specific anti-HIV medications, called antiretrovirals (ARVs). Some studies of women who use a
      hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills, patches, and injections) and take
      ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control
      medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at preventing
      pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV spreading to
      others, but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The investigators did not
      know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used together, so this study looked
      to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones
      released by NuvaRing. This will help us to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for
      women with HIV infection who are taking ARVs. The study also included HIV-infected women who
      were not on ARVs but used the NuvaRing to show us what the hormone levels are like in a
      similar group of women not on ARVs.

      Vaginal rings are also currently being studied to deliver anti-HIV medications that may
      prevent HIV acquisition, and to provide birth control over a longer period of time (more than
      1 month). Since vaginal rings will become more commonly used to administer medications, the
      investigators wanted to better understand the potential for drug interactions with drugs
      given vaginally. This study will also help us understand the potential for drug interactions
      between ARVs given orally, and other drugs given through vaginal rings, like the NuvaRing.
      Additionally, this study will help us understand how hormones released from a vaginal ring
      affect the amount of HIV virus in the genital tract, the bacterial make-up (microbiome) of
      the female genital tract, and the immune system within the genital tract, all of which may
      affect the chances of spreading HIV.

      This was a 28 day study from study entry through the final clinic visit. Post-entry visits
      were scheduled at Days 7, 14, 21 and 28. The Nuvaring was put in place at study entry and
      removed on day 21. A single PK blood sample was collected for assay of ENG and EE at entry
      (day 0, prior to NuvaRing placement), and on days 7, 14, and 21 after placement of the
      NuvaRing. For participants on the ARV arms, intensive, 8-hour PK sampling, for assay of EFV
      (efavirenz) and ATV/RTV (atazanavir/ritonavir) respectively, was performed at study entry
      (day 0, prior to NuvaRing placement) and 21 days later. ARV sampling was performed at
      pre-dose (hour 0), and 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 hours post-dose. Safety was assessed at each study
      visit.

    <time_frame>Intensive EFV PK samples at pre-dose, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 hours post-dose on study day 0 (before vaginal ring placement) and on study day 21 (3 weeks after vaginal ring placement).</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-24h) defines area under the concentration-time curve over the doing period of 24 hours; Cmin defines minimum concentration in the dosing period of 24 hours; Cmax defines maximum concentration in the dosing interval of 24 hours; Tmax defines time to maximum concentration since dose is initiated; CL/F defines apparent oral clearance.
Pharmacokinetics data are not available as of November 2017. To minimize variability, pharmacokinetics assays were batched. Due to batching, sample shipment could not begin until after the study follow-up completion. Given that this was a multi-center international study, shipment of samples took several months to complete. Therefore, samples are in the process of being tested. Upon completion of the testing, the results will be reviewed for data completeness and quality. After resolution of any issues and finalization of the database, the analysis can be conducted and the results will then be posted to ClinicalTrials.gov.</description>

             available at the local sites and documented in source documentation and case report
             forms (CRFs). Testing for bacterial vaginosis, performed using techniques available at
             the local sites, was only necessary if the participant was symptomatic and the
             provider felt treatment might be necessary. Women with genital herpes lesions waited
             to be screened until the herpetic lesions had healed.

        <description>AUC(0-24h) defines area under the concentration-time curve over the doing period of 24 hours; Cmin defines minimum concentration in the dosing period of 24 hours; Cmax defines maximum concentration in the dosing interval of 24 hours; Tmax defines time to maximum concentration since dose is initiated; CL/F defines apparent oral clearance.
Pharmacokinetics data are not available as of November 2017. To minimize variability, pharmacokinetics assays were batched. Due to batching, sample shipment could not begin until after the study follow-up completion. Given that this was a multi-center international study, shipment of samples took several months to complete. Therefore, samples are in the process of being tested. Upon completion of the testing, the results will be reviewed for data completeness and quality. After resolution of any issues and finalization of the database, the analysis can be conducted and the results will then be posted to ClinicalTrials.gov.</description>
