  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Susceptibility to breast cancer is related to the combination of genetic, hormonal and
      multiple other environmental risk factors, such as mutations in the BRCA gene and excess
      exposure to exogenous estrogen, respectively. BRCA is a nuclear protein that maintains genome
      stability, by acting as a key player in the DNA repair complex. Recently, evidence has
      emerged that BRCA mutation heterozygosis itself enhances aborted DNA repair and can
      contribute to breast cancer initiation after exposure to irradiation. In our preliminary
      results on short-term lymphocyte cultures, we found additional evidence that healthy
      heterozygous BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have a different response to DNA damage than
      do non-carriers.

      The main aim of our ongoing project is to identify the transcriptional modulation and
      transformation potential of normal BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation heterozygous epithelial breast
      cells following irradiation and to examine how it is affected by exposure to estrogen. Our
      hypotheses will be investigated by RNA-seq and microRNA-seq in order to identify a unique
      molecular expression profile of the estrogen exposed cells following ionizing irradiation.

      Understanding the role of BRCA heterozygosity in cell response to exposure to estrogen and to
      irradiation may facilitate the development of more appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic
      strategies for these individuals.

      To study the different cell lineages, we plan to isolate and propagate luminal progenitors
      from a normal human breast tissue. To this end, 10 human breast tissue samples will be
      obtained from risk-reducing mastectomy in healthy premenopausal women with BRCA1 mutations.
      Tissues from 10 premenopausal women undergoing esthetic breast surgery with no family history
      of breast or ovarian cancers will serve as a control group. In order to isolate primary
      epithelial cells, human mammary tissue will be minced and enzymatically digested overnight in
      collagenase and hyaluronidase to yield suspension of epithelial organoids. These organoids
      will be collected and further digested with trypsin, dispase and deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNAse),
      will be filtered to generate a single cell suspension, resuspended in Hank's + 2% fetal
      bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1 mg/mL DNAse, and also incubated with a blocking antibody for 15
      minutes on ice.

      Cells will be treated with estrogen (E2) (10 nM) for 48 h and then will be irradiated for
      inducing double-strand break. Cells will be irradiated with 8 Gray (Gy) using a Co60 source.

      To accomplish our study, estrogen exposed and unexposed BRCA mutation heterozygous epithelial
      breast cells will be irradiated and 1 h later RNA will be extracted from the cells using
      Tri-reagent (Sigma). The RNA will be converted to a library of cDNA (complementary DNA)
      fragments and will be sent for deep sequencing in the illumina Hi-Seq platform.
