          5. The subject has skin type I to IV (very light to olive).

          6. The subject is in a good health as determined by medical history, ECG, vital signs,
             physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) test (at screening) and check-in and be willing and able to use one
             of the protocol-specified double-barrier methods of birth control.

          8. The subject is able to complete the screening process within 4 weeks prior to study
             drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a cognitive performance outside of reference values at screening.

          2. The subject smokes, is a tobacco user, currently uses nicotine products.

          3. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to donepezil, modafinil, irdabisant, or one
             of the excipients, or has any significant food or drug allergies.

          4. The subject is a female who is pregnant or lactating.

          5. The subject has an intraocular pressure greater than 22 mm Hg.

          6. The subject is suffering from, or has a clinically significant history of one or more
             of the following: cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, neurological, immunological, or psychiatric disorder(s), or a history of
             any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose additional risk to
             the subject by participation in the study or confound the results of the study.

          7. The subject has a laboratory abnormality judged by the investigator as clinically
             significant, or measurements outside of the defined range

               -  Other exclusion criteria apply; please contact the investigator for more
