  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical studies have indicated that finafloxacin is well-tolerated with few
      treatment-related adverse events. As a part of the clinical development of finafloxacin,
      other PK studies are required to determine the effect of other variables on the PK profile of
      finafloxacin. This study aims to determine the effect of age and gender on the
      pharmacokinetic profile of finafloxacin.

             results during screening.

          -  Negative screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, C and/or positive

             days prior to the first dose and throughout the study or were using one of the
             following acceptable birth control methods:

               1. Surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy) for a minimum of 6 months.

               2. Intrauterine device (IUD) in place for at least 3 months.

               3. Barrier methods (condom and diaphragm) plus spermicide for at least 14 days prior
                  to the first dose and throughout the study.

             consecutive years prior to Day 1, with a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 40
             IU/mL or had undergone one of the following sterilization procedures at least 6 months
