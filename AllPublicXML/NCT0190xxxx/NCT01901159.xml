             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 or less than 50 mm Hg at screening

          -  Any major illness within the 4 weeks prior to dosing or any acute disease state within
             7 days of study start

          -  Any confirmed allergic reaction against any drug or multiple allergies
