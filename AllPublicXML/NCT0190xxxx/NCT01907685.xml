  <brief_title>Dose Escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of AVE8062 Combined With Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum administered dose (MAD) and the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AVE8062 and docetaxel in combination administered
      sequentially on D1 &amp; D2 respectively every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To define the overall safety profile of the combination.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AVE8062 and docetaxel when
           administered in combination.

        -  To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination.

        -  To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers.

      The study includes a tumoral pharmacogenomic sub-study conducted in a subset of sites. The
      objective to analyse a set of biological biomarkers in order to identify a potential
      predictive signature of efficacy for AVE8062 in combination with docetaxel.

      The duration of study for each patient will include 4-week screening phase prior to first
      inclusion of study drug, 21-day study treatment cycles, end of treatment visit and follow-up
      phase. Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other
      study discontinuation criteria.
