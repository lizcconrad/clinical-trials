    <textblock>
      The MDLAP (MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas)system is as an automatic system to regulate glucose
      levels by delivery of insulin operable in clinical trial settings. The safety of the system
      was proved in previous inpatient and outpatient trials in large number of patients. In the
      current study we aim to optimize post-prandial closed-loop glycemic control by developing an
      automated MD-bolus calculator and to evaluate its safety and efficacy in controlling
      postprandial blood glucose when used together with the MD-Logic artificial pancreas system in
      type 1 diabetes patients.

      The study will consist of a pilot study with two segments and a main study segment. The aim
      of each segment is detailed below:

        1. Pilot Study - Segment 1 - Hybrid meal bolus ratio The aim of this segment is to evaluate
           the efficacy and safety of different pre-meal bolus dosing compared to full closed-loop
           operation with no meal announcement.

        2. Pilot Study - Segment 2 - Insulin dosing during meal In this segment we would like to
           test the optimal distribution of insulin delivery during the meal.

        3. Main study - Segment 3 - Automatic bolus calculator In this main segment of the study we
           will use the results and conclusions from the previous two pilot segments to develop the
           MD-Bolus Calculator for closed-loop control use. The safety and efficacy of this
           automated insulin bolus calculator will be tested in a randomized cross-over study that
           will compare postprandial glycemic control under MDLAP with and without the use of the
           MD-Bolus Calculator.
