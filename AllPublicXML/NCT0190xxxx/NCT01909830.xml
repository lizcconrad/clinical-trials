      Study Design:

      Multicenter, non randomized, open label phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Gemcitabine/Pemetrexed combination.

      Enrollment period: 18 months. Treatment period: maximum for 24 weeks for each patient (12
      cycles lasting 2 weeks).

      Total duration of the study: 24 months.

      Number of Subjects:

      Approximately 38 subjects will be enrolled on study:

      - First stage:12 patients enrolled

      If 1 or 0 responses were observed, the trial had to be terminated:

      - Second stage: an additional of 23 patients were to be enrolled. If 5 or less responses were
      observed in 35 patients, the combination would not be considered worthy of further study,
      while if 6 or more responses were observed, the combination would be considered sufficiently
      active to warrant further testing. Taking into account an invalidity rate of 5%, 38 patients
      will be needed for this step.

      A Phase II Study to evaluate activity and toxicity of Gemcitabine in Combination with
      Pemetrexed long term infusion in the Treatment of pretreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
      Patients

      Study Design:

      Multicenter, non randomized, open label phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Gemcitabine/Pemetrexed combination.

      Study Duration

      Enrollment period: 18 months. Treatment period: maximum for 24 weeks for each patient (12
      cycles lasting 2 weeks).

      Total duration of the study: 24 months.

      Primary objective:

      - objective response rate (ORR: CR+PR+SD)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  safety profile of the drugs combination;

        -  time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS)

      Number of Subjects:

      Approximately 38 subjects will be enrolled on study:

      - First stage:12 patients enrolled

      If 1 or 0 responses were observed, the trial had to be terminated:

      - Second stage: an additional of 23 patients were to be enrolled. If 5 or less responses were
      observed in 35 patients, the combination would not be considered worthy of further study,
      while if 6 or more responses were observed, the combination would be considered sufficiently
      active to warrant further testing. Taking into account an invalidity rate of 5%, 38 patients
      will be needed for this step.

      Statistical Methodology:

      A minimax two-stage Simon design will be employed. A 10% response will preclude further
      study, whereas a 30% response rate will indicate that further study would be warranted. Using
      α and β errors of 0.10 and 0.10, respectively, 12 patients will be enrolled in the first
      stage, and if 1 or 0 responses were observed, the trial had to be terminated. Otherwise, an
      additional of 23 patients were to be enrolled, and if 5 or less responses were observed in 35
      patients, the combination would not be considered worthy of further study, while if 6 or more
      responses were observed, the combination would be considered sufficiently active to warrant
      further testing. Taking into account an invalidity rate of 5%, 38 patients will be needed for
      this step.

      The first 6 enrolled patients will be closely controlled for safety and further patients will
      be enrolled only in absence of severe toxicity resulting in discontinuation 1 month after the
      first cycle of the six patients.

      The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT (Intention To Treat) population. PFS and OS
      will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The HR for PFS and OS will be estimated
      according to the Cox model, with its relative 95% confidence.

      A secondary analysis will be performed on the PP (per-protocol) population. The Overall
      Response Rate to study treatment will be reported on the ITT and PP population with 95%
      confidence interval. Results will be tabulated and not evaluable patients will be included as
      additional category.

          3. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease is required; prior regimens (in adjuvant
             oral advanced stage setting) must include 5fluorouracile, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan
             if not contraindicated.

          4. At least a 4-week interval between the last dose of chemotherapy and study
             registration.

          7. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          8. ECOG performance status &lt;= 2

          9. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;=3,000/microL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,500/microL

               -  hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dl

               -  platelets &gt;=100,000/microL

               -  serum total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;= 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (&lt;= 5 times the

               -  Creatinine Clearance &gt; 45 ml/min

         10. The effects of Gemcitabine and Pemetrexed on the developing human fetus at the
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because therapeutic
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, female participants of child
             bearing potential and male participants whose partner is of child bearing potential
             must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during the study and for 3
             months thereafter. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         11. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study. Voluntary signed and dated written informed consent form in accordance with
             regulatory and institutional guidelines obtained before the performance of any
             protocol-related procedures not part of normal patient care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational agents within 30 days
             prior to study screening.

          3. Previous treatment with Gemcitabine or Pemetrexed.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Gemcitabine and/or Pemetrexed or other agents used in the study

          5. Patients with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          6. Past or current history of neoplasm other than colorectal carcinoma with a
             disease-free interval of less than 5 years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer or
             curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          8. Inability to interrupt aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents 2 days
             before, the day of, and 2 days after the dose of pemetrexed single agent or pemetrexed
             plus carboplatin.

          9. HIV-positivity, whether or not symptomatic.
