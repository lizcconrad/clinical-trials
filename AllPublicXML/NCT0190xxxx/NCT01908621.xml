      The purpose of the study is to compare safety and efficacy of stem cell mobilization using
      G-CSF (filgrastim) alone vs. intermediate-dose cytosine arabinoside plus G-CSF in multiple
      myeloma patients.

    <textblock>
      Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) is a standard treatment of
      eligible patients suffering from multiple myeloma (MM). Tandem autoHSCT allows to further
      improve results of the therapy. Nowadays, 99% of the procedures are performed using
      peripheral blood as a source of stem cells. Hence, the crucial point is to harvest adequate
      number of stem cells allowing hematopoietic recovery. The number of 5 × 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg
      is considered the optimal level, as far as double autoHSCT is concerned. There are two main
      mobilization strategies being used: based on G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy
      (cyclophosphamide (CY) at dose range 1.5-7 g/m2 is mainly used in MM setting). However, a
      proportion of patients (5-40%) fail to collect the minimum number of cells required. Novel
      agents, like plerixafor, CXCR4 inhibitor, may enable effective CD34+ cell harvest in &quot;poor
      mobilizers&quot;. Nevertheless, the optimal first-line and cost-effective protocol for
      mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells has not been determined so far.

      Randomized trials comparing chemomobilization with use of CY + G-CSF to G-CSF alone, which
      had been conducted so far, did not demonstrate clear advantage of addition of CY to growth
      factor. Intermediate-dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC), 1.6 g/m2 plus filgrastim, has been
      shown to produce very high efficacy as a first or second-line mobilization regimen in
      patients with lymphoid malignancies, including MM. In a retrospective comparison, this
      strategy was significantly more effective than CY + filgrastim. This suggest that the type of
      chemotherapy agent added to G-CSF may play role in mobilization efficacy and that the
      combination of AraC and G-CSF may be more effective than G-CSF used alone. The goal of
      current study is to verify this hypothesis in randomized controlled trial.

    <description>Patients will receive G-CSF(filgrastim) at 10 μg/kg per day (divided into two doses every 12 hours) subcutaneously for up to 7 days. On day 5, circulating CD34+ level will be determined. Leukapheresis will be started when the CD34+ blood level will reach at least 10/µl. If the level will be not achieved, G-CSF administration will be continued until CD34+ level will decrease compared to the preceding day. Leukaphereses will be performed using Spectra-Optia Apheresis System (TherumoBCT Inc, Lakewood, CO, USA) according to the manufacturers protocols for mononuclear cell harvesting, processing 2 total blood volumes. In case of failing to harvest targeted number of stem cells (5 × 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg), next leukapheresis can be performed on following two days (maximum 3 leukaphereses) if circulating CD34+ cell level will remain as described above.</description>

    <description>Cytosine arabinoside will be administered as a 2-hour i.v. infusion at a dose of 0.4 g/m2 twice daily on days 1 and 2 (total dose 1.6 g/m2). G-CSF (filgrastim) 5-10 ug/kg will be started on day 5 and continued until last leukapheresis. The number of circulating CD34+ cells will be first evaluated after neutrophil recovery from nadir. Leukapheresis will be started when the CD34+ blood level will reach at least 10/µl. If the level will be not achieved, G-CSF administration will be continued until CD34+ level will decrease. Leukaphereses will be performed using Spectra-Optia Apheresis System (TherumoBCT Inc, Lakewood, CO, USA) according to the manufacturers protocols for mononuclear cell harvesting, processing 2 total blood volumes.
