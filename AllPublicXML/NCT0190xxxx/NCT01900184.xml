  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1QG2 is a Phase 1 study aiming to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending
      single/multiple oral doses (SAD &amp; MAD) in healthy young subjects, the preliminary food
      interaction and the effect of QGC001 on blood pressure and heart rate, but also to determine
      pharmacokinetic preliminary profiles of QGC001 and its metabolite EC33 and pharmacodynamic
      preliminary profiles of QGC001 and its metabolite EC33 especially effects on the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and copeptin systems.
