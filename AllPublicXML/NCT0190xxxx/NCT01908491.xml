  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management is a major problem after repair of pectus excavatum.Various
      methods of pain management have been introduced. However, the effects of continuous wound
      infusion of local anesthetics through ON-Q catheters were not well evaluated in pectus
      surgery. Therefore, we conducted prospective randomized controlled study to compare the
      effects of IV PCA and continuous wound infusion after repair of pectus excavatum.

    <textblock>
      Pain control is an important issue after correction of pectus excavatum. Insufficient pain
      control leads to develop postoperative pulmonary complications, such as hypoxia, atelectasis
      and pneumonia. Additionally, hospital length of stay could be prolonged. Therefore,
      successful pain management is mandatory to improve clinical outcome, to decrease
      postoperative morbidity and to shorten the duration of hospital stay. Various methods of pain
      management have been introduced. Current typical methods for pain management include thoracic
      epidural analgesia and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA). Epidural analgesia
      has shown superior pain control effects. However, there may be rare but serious
      complications, such as spinal cord and nerve root lesions, epidural hematoma, or infections.
      IV PCA is a well-established method of postoperative pain management. However, the systemic
      side effects of opioid, such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, or respiratory depression may
      occur. Continuous wound infusion of local anesthetics through ON-Q catheters is another
      method for pain management. It has been used for various surgical procedures. However, the
      effect is not well evaluated in pectus surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effects of opioid-based IV PCA and continuous wound infusion using a catheter.

    <description>Pain score was measured by the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale at 1, 2, 6, 24, 48 hours after surgery. Pain scale consists of 6 faces with word descriptors and numbers from 0 to 10. The child look at the faces, the nurse or parent uses the words to describe the expression, and the child is asked to point to the face that describes how he/she feels. The number is used to record a pain score. This simple and quick scale can be easily reproduced for use at the bed-side with children as young as 3 years of age.</description>

    <description>On arrival in the postanesthetic care unit, a patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) was connected to the iv catheter. The PCA regimen consisted of hydromorphone (2 mcg/kg/hr) and ketorolac (0.02 mg/kg/hr) with normal saline (total volume 100ml). PCA was programmed to deliver 1 ml/hr as background infusion and 1 ml per demand with a 10 min lockout during 48 hr period.</description>

    <description>Patients underwent insertion of wound catheters by the surgeon just before the closure of incision site. The wound catheters, consisting of double branch and connected to elastomeric pump filled with ropivacaine (0.15~0.25%) and administered at a constant flow rate of 2 ml/hr in each branch of the catheter for 48 hr.</description>
