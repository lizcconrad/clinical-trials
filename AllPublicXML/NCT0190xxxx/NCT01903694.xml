  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Principal objective: to evaluate the effect of the combination pravastatin - sorafenib versus
      sorafenib alone on overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma developing on
      Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who are unsuitable for curative treatment.

      Secondary objectives: evaluate the effect of this treatment on progression-free survival, the
      time to progression, the time to treatment failure and quality of life (QLQ-C30 et FACT HEP)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by:

          -  either a histological examination

          -  or if histological evidence cannot be obtained (ascites, coagulation disorders) the
             diagnosis can be made in cases of cirrhosis according to EASL/AASLD 2005 criteria, by
             revealing a hepatic focal lesion of more than 10 mm

          -  on two dynamic imaging techniques (helical CT-scan, MRI, contrast-enhanced ultrasound)
             for tumours measuring less than 2 cm. The lesion must be characterised by hyperdensity
             during the arterial phase and wash-out during the delayed portal phase Patients who
             are not suitable for treatment with a curative intent (transplantation, resection,
             percutaneous destruction) or by chemo-embolisation or with progressive hepatocellular
             carcinoma after the failure of specific treatment Prognostic CLIP score 0 to 4
             Child-Pugh Class A Transaminases ≤ 5 N and Creatininemia ≤ 1.5 N WHO: 0, 1 or 2 Age
             more than 18 years Foreseeable survival &gt; 12 weeks Possibility of regular follow-up
             Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Extra-hepatic disease that could be life-threatening in the short or medium term
             Another progressive cancer with the exception of in situ cervical cancer, a
             superficial bladder tumour and treated basocellular carcinoma.

        Any other cancer treated with a curative intent in the previous 3 years can be included in
        the study Heart failure (≥New York Heart Association class 2), uncontrolled AHT or
        arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months Digestive haemorrhage in the
        previous month Patients who are receiving or have already received treatment with statins
        or sorafenib Pregnancy and breast-feeding. Women of child-bearing age must use an effective
        method of contraception throughout the trial and for 3 months after the end of the
        treatment.
