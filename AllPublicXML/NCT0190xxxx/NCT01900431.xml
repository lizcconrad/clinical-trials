    <textblock>
      The total duration per participant was up to 58 weeks, which included a 2 week screening
      period, 16 weeks principal treatment period (Part A), 34 weeks extension treatment period
      (Part B) or open label treatment period (Part C), and 6 weeks after last treatment
      administration.

      Participants with decrease in vitreous haze (VH) ≥2; or corticosteroids dose &lt;10 mg/day at
      Week 16 were considered as responders. Participants who did not complete the principal
      treatment period (Part A) due to lack of efficacy; or no decrease in VH ≥2 and
      corticosteroids dose ≥10 mg/day at Week 16; or no decrease in VH ≥2 and corticosteroids dose
      missing at Week 16; or non-responder according to medical review, were considered as
      non-responders.

      Responder participants, observed at Week 16 (at the end of Part A), were invited to continue
      in the extension treatment period (Part B).

      Non-responder participants, observed within the first 16 weeks, were offered to be treated by
      open-label sarilumab (Part C).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 2-step Reduction in Vitreous Haze (VH) or Prednisone Dose &lt;10 mg/Day at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>At least 2-step reduction in VH per central review from baseline was evaluated on Miami 9-step scale. VH is the obscuration of fundus by vitreous cells and protein exudation. Each of the 9-step scale (from grade 0 [low opacity] to 8 [more opacity]) images (in increasing order of opacity) are equivalent to approximately 0.3 log units of degradation in visual acuity based on the Bangerter calibration. Participants with prednisone dose &lt;10 mg/day (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) were also evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in VH Scale at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in VH scale was evaluated on Miami 9-step scale. VH is the obscuration of fundus by vitreous cells and protein exudation. Each of the 9-step scale (from grade 0 [low opacity] to 8 [more opacity]) images (in increasing order of opacity) were equivalent to approximately 0.3 log units of degradation in visual acuity based on the Bangerter calibration. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) model with treatment groups, visits and visit-by-treatment groups interaction as fixed categorical effects as well as fixed continuous covariate of baseline adjudicated VH.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Anterior Chamber (AC) Cell Score = 0 or At Least 2-step Reduction in Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with AC cell score = 0 or with ≥2 step reduction from baseline at Week 16 were evaluated. Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria: grade 0 = no cells; grade +0.5 = 1 - 5 cells; grade +1 = 6 - 25 cells; grade +2= 26 - 50 cells; grade +3 = too many to count.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA score is based on the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart assessed at a starting distance of 4 meters, and then at 1 meter. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model with treatment groups, randomization strata of VH level (&lt;4, &gt;=4), visits and visit-by-treatment groups interaction as fixed categorical effects, as well as, fixed continuous covariate of baseline BCVA.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) At Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>CRT was measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), a non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina. All images were transmitted to the central reading center. SD-OCT was performed in the study eye after pupil dilation. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model with treatment groups, randomization strata of VH level (&lt;4, &gt;=4), visits and visit-by-treatment groups interaction as fixed categorical effects, as well as, fixed continuous covariate of baseline CRT.</description>

    <description>Serum functional (unbound) sarilumab concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 294 ng/mL. Concentrations below LLOQ were set to zero for samples at predose. Post-treatment concentrations below LLOQ were replaced by LLOQ/2. The samples were considered non-eligible for the analysis if the previous dosing time was &lt;11 days or &gt;17 days before the sampling time for every other week regimens.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least 2-step Reduction in Vitreous Haze (VH) or Prednisone Dose &lt;10 mg/Day at Week 16</title>
        <description>At least 2-step reduction in VH per central review from baseline was evaluated on Miami 9-step scale. VH is the obscuration of fundus by vitreous cells and protein exudation. Each of the 9-step scale (from grade 0 [low opacity] to 8 [more opacity]) images (in increasing order of opacity) are equivalent to approximately 0.3 log units of degradation in visual acuity based on the Bangerter calibration. Participants with prednisone dose &lt;10 mg/day (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) were also evaluated.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>Modified intent-to-treat population (mITT) included all randomized participants who received at least 1 injection analyzed according to the group to which the participant was allocated by the randomization schedule. Modified multiple imputation approach was used on VH missing adjudicated scores.</population>

          <description>At least 2-step reduction in VH per central review from baseline was evaluated on Miami 9-step scale. VH is the obscuration of fundus by vitreous cells and protein exudation. Each of the 9-step scale (from grade 0 [low opacity] to 8 [more opacity]) images (in increasing order of opacity) are equivalent to approximately 0.3 log units of degradation in visual acuity based on the Bangerter calibration. Participants with prednisone dose &lt;10 mg/day (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) were also evaluated.</description>
          <population>Modified intent-to-treat population (mITT) included all randomized participants who received at least 1 injection analyzed according to the group to which the participant was allocated by the randomization schedule.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) At Week 16</title>
          <description>CRT was measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), a non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina. All images were transmitted to the central reading center. SD-OCT was performed in the study eye after pupil dilation. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model with treatment groups, randomization strata of VH level (&lt;4, &gt;=4), visits and visit-by-treatment groups interaction as fixed categorical effects, as well as, fixed continuous covariate of baseline CRT.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on mITT population. Number of participants analyzed = participants with CRT assessment at baseline and post-baseline visits.</population>
