  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DC vaccine manufactured and partially matured using our standard operating procedures,
      developed in collaboration with the HGG Immuno Group, then administered through imiquimod
      treated skin will be safe and feasible in children with refractory brain tumors. This will
      result in anti-tumor immunity that will prolong survival of subjects treated and results will
      be consistent with the outcomes found for subjects treated by HGG Immuno Group investigators.
      Study treatment will correlate with laboratory evidence of immune activation. Correlative
      studies will also reveal targets in the immune system which can be exploited to improve
      response for patients on successor trials.
