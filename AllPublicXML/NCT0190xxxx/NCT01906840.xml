  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the incidence of accelerated
      atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) patients has still remained high. Oxidative stress is
      considered as a major player in uremia associated morbidity and mortality in HD patients. The
      aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of turmeric on oxidative stress markers in HD
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a state of oxidative stress, due to uremic oxidant
      mediator's accumulation, the activation of phagocytic oxidative metabolism by the dialysis
      membrane, intravenous iron therapy and the antioxidant depletion caused by hemodialysis (HD).
      Some trials showed a significant benefit from antioxidant therapy on cardiovascular outcome
      in HD patients.

      Extensive research focused on direct exogenous antioxidants including vitamin C, and vitamin
      E, in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Some clinical trials showed no more beneficial
      effect of exogenous antioxidant supplementation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
      recommended the necessity for a new approach to regulating cellular redox status.

      Turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn) is an herb used as a dietary spice and in traditional medicine
      for centuries. Curcumin, the most active and non-toxic component of turmeric, is a
      polyphenol, which has been extensively studied for its therapeutic benefits, such as
      antioxidant. Besides, turmeric has also been effective in attenuation of proteinurea in
      diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis patients.

      Curcumin restored the activities of mitochondrial enzymes complexes and thereby attenuated
      the release of reactive oxygen species. Turmeric appears to be non-toxic to humans even at
      high doses. However, there is a paucity of information on the effect of turmeric in HD
      population. We have, therefore, followed up this study to determine the beneficial effect of
      turmeric on oxidative stress in HD patients.
