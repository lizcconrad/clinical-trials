  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of muscle strengthening and balance
      exercise interventions on muscle strength, running mechanics and postural control in novice
      recreational runners. Participants will be assessed before and after they engage in an 8-week
      exercise intervention program.
