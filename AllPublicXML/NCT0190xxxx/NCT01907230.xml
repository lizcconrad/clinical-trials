      Antiviral prophylaxis can prevent the risk of biologic agents-associated HBV reactivation in
      hepatitis B inactive carriers and patients with past HBV infection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of HBV reactivation is associated with the intensity of immunosuppression.
      Biological therapies block the action of biological products involved in immune-inflammatory
      pathogenesis of many diseases. However, these biologic agents induce a profound
      immunosuppression, and their use has been reported to be associated with HBV reactivation.
      Currently, the actual incidence of HBV reactivation in inflammatory arthritis patients who
      underwent biologic treatments (TNF-α blockades) is unclear, especially in inflammatory
      arthritis (IA) patients with past hepatitis B infection. In this study, we plan to enroll IA
      patients who are inactive HBV carriers (HBsAg-positive/ HBV viral loads &lt;2000 IU/ml; subgroup
      1), or have past HBV infection (HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive/ HBV viral loads &lt; 2000
      IU/ml; subgroup 2); and first line biologic treatment (Humira or Enbrel or Simponi or Orencia
      or Mabthera or Actemra) is indicated. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either prophylactic or therapeutic entecavir treatment for each subgroup. In the prophylactic
      group, participants will initiate entecavir 0.5 mg/day orally one week before biologic
      treatment. Entecavir treatment will be continued normally for 12 months. In the therapeutic
      group, patients will start entecavir therapy, 0.5 mg/day orally, when reactivation of HBV
      (pre-emptive treatment). HBV reactivation is defined as detectable HBV viral loads for 2
      consecutive visits of one month apart. The main goal of the study is to delineate the
      incidence of HBV reactivation during and after biologic treatment in IA patients who are
      inactive HBV carriers or have past HBV infection, and tries to define the optimal HBV
      monitoring and antiviral prophylactic strategy in IA patients.
