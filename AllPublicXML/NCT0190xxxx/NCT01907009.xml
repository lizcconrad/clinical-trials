  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of (castration-resistant) prostate cancer (CRPC) is becoming increasingly
      complex. The use of peripheral anti-androgens with gonadorelin analogues (maximum androgen
      blockade) is common place. Following the failure of such an approach, several strategies may
      be employed. Both corticosteroids and estrogens have a role and increasingly chemotherapy is
      being used. The demonstration of enhanced survival using 3 weekly docetaxel has meant that
      this is viewed by many as the standard of care for fit patients.

      Melphalan is an established alkylating drug that has demonstrated some activity in CRPC, but
      to date, myelosuppression has prevented adequate dosing. We have recently conducted a phase I
      dose escalation study using melphalan and whole blood stem cell re-infusion and it shows that
      median overall survival is 22 months, which is higher than the median survival rate of 19
      months for Docetaxel

      Data from a previous phase I study has proved the successful administration of higher doses
      of IV Melphalan in combination with autologous blood infusion in patients with
      Castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      Rapid falls in circulating tumour cells were seen within 2 weeks of starting Melphalan,
      however slow platelet recovery meant longer periods of platelet transfusion. For this study
      we intend to assess the efficacy of an intensified intravenous melphalan with autologous
      whole blood stem cell transplantation over three treatment cycles.

      39 patients will be enrolled over a 3 year period and at least 17 patients need to survive
      progression free at least 6-months for this study to be considered positive.

      Mel-CAP is a combination chemotherapy consisting of two chemotherapy drugs:

      MELPHALAN and LENOGRASTIM for 3 cycles alternately.

    <description>MELCAP study has only one arm. All suitable patients will receive 3 cycles of melphalan and lenograstim alternately.
Patient will start with a 3 day lenograstim (at 10mcg/kg/day) to boost up the blood cell count.
Upon reaching sufficient blood cell count, patients will undergo a venesection and roughly a pint of blood is taken. After this patients will receive first cycle of Melphalan (60mg/m2). The following day patient will receive back the previously given whole blood. A treament break of 6 days between the cycles is given. After the break the patient will be given Lenograstim (10mcg/kg/day)for 6 days (until sufficient).
The above regimen is repeated for cycle 2 and cycle 3 with only exception of Melphalan is given at 40mg/m2. After the cycle 3, Lenograstrim is given at 263 mcg/day for 10 days.
Upon treatment completion, patients will be followed for 2 years. If the patients show disease progression, they will start hormone therapy.</description>
