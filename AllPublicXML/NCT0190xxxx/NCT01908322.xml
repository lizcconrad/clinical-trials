  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Characteristics of patients with intermediate stage HCC (BCLC-B) treated with Nexavar will be determined by evaluating demographic data, medical history, previous treatment of HCC, specific concomitant conditions (amongst others).</measure>

        The study population will consist of patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular
        carcinoma (BCLC-B) treated with Nexavar according to the local summary of product
        characteristics. Participants will be recruited from oncological and gastroenterological
        clinics and practices throughout Germany.

        In this non-interventional observational study, the decision on the duration and dosage of
        treatment is solely at the discretion of the attending physician.

        The medication is prescribed at regular visits to the investigator's office. Commercially
        available product will be used to treat the patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of unresectable intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma
             (BCLC-B) for whom the decision has been taken by the investigator to prescribe Nexavar
             (the BCLC intermediate stage (BCLC-B) consists of Child-Pugh A and B patients with
             large/multifocal HCC who do not have cancer related symptoms, macrovascular invasion
             or extrahepatic spread).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Prior targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
