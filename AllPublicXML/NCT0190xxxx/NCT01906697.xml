  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of middle turbinate in treatment of nasal polyposis is still an interesting
      debatable topic. The surgical access and its possible role in pathophysiology of sinusitis
      are two important points about its treatment. On the one hand, middle turbinate resection can
      improve surgical access and possibly reduce the nasal polyposis recurrence. On the other
      hand, there are some reports of anosmia, empty nose syndrome, synechia, and difficulties in
      revision surgery. Also, synechia, lateralization, and possibly recurrence can be the possible
      outcome after middle turbinate preservation.

      Among different modalities, radiofrequency (RF) gradually increase its popularity as surgical
      tools, which can treat mucosal hypertrophy without any tissue removal. Inferior turbinate is
      a famous place for its usage, especially for decreasing of the nasal obstruction. Also, some
      authors have showed its effect on refractory allergic rhinitis, which is not only related to
      reducing of nasal obstruction, but also it is related to changing of the allergic mediators.
      [5, 6] Comparing to other treatments for turbinates is sparing its overlaid mucosa, which can
      reduce the possible future morbidities.

      Probably considering of the above mention points, RF has a possible impact on the polypoid
      changes of middle turbinates and possibly does not have the same deleterious effect of the
      resection on cilia of mucosal layer. Therefore, we performed a randomized clinical trial to
      compare its outcome with two famous methods of the middle turbinate management: partial
      resection and medialization.
