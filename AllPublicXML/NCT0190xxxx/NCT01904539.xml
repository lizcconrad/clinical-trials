             premenopausal, be prepared to use ≥ 1 effective method of contraception during the
             trial and until at least 30 days after administration of OCA.

          -  Subjects must provide written informed consent and agree to comply with the trial
             protocol.

        Subjects with Hepatic Impairment:

          -  Evidence of hepatic disease

               1. Score ≥ 2 on one of the Child-Pugh parameters, or

               2. Histological diagnosis of cirrhosis or presence of esophageal varices, or

               3. Abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or
                  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels

          -  Subjects will satisfy the criteria of the modified Child-Pugh classification for
             hepatic impairment during Screening:

               1. Mild hepatic impairment: Class A (Child-Pugh Scores 5-6 points)

               2. Moderate hepatic impairment: Class B (Child-Pugh Scores 7-9 points)

               3. Severe hepatic impairment: Class C (Child Pugh Scores 10-15 points)

        Healthy volunteers:

          -  Absence of clinically-relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history,
             full physical examination, 12-lead ECG

          -  Clinical laboratory tests within the normal reference range

          -  Subjects must be within ± 10 years of the mean age and within 20% of the mean BMI of
             the hepatic impaired subjects (Child-Pugh category A, B, and C)

             drugs via the gut

          -  Evidence of chronic or acute liver disease as documented by medical history, physical
             examination or diagnostic tests that it likely to affect the conduct of the trial or
             interpretation of the data
