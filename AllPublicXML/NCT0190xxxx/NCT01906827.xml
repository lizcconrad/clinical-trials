      The bile acids has been demonstrated to cause arrhythmia and abnormal calcium dynamics in
      cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Bile acids may alter maternal cardiomyocyte function
      like fetus.Increased P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion have been reported in various
      clinical settings. The investigators hypothesized that PWD and p wave duration may affect in
      pregnancy with ICP.

    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a pregnancy-specific liver disease. The most
      frequent laboratory abnormality is elevation of serum bile acid levels in ICP.

      Bile acids increases both maternal and fetal circulation in ICP. The bile acids has been
      demonstrated to cause arrhythmia and abnormal calcium dynamics in cultured neonatal rat
      cardiomyocytes. Raised maternal bile acid levels have been associated with fetal distress and
      arrhytmia in fetus.

      P-wave dispersion (PWD) is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum
      P-wave durations measured on a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Increased P-wave
      duration and PWD have been reported in various clinical settings, including atrial flutter,
      coronary artery disease, hypertension, rheumatic mitral stenosis, mitral annular
      calcification, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity.

      So the investigators think that bile acids may alter maternal cardiomyocyte function as
      fetus. The investigators hypothesized that PWD and p wave duration may affect in pregnancy
      with ICP.

      The aim of this study is to investigate maternal P-wave duration and dispersion changes in
      pregnant women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy .

    <description>A 12-lead surface ECG will obtain for all pregnants with icp in the supine position after a rest period of 10 minutes. Two consecutive cycles will record at a speed of 50 mm/sec and with an amplitude of 10mm/mV. All ECGs will examine by a designated cardiologist blinded to patient details. To improve accuracy, measurements will made using calipers and magnifying lens. Only participants with normal sinus rhythm on ECG will include in the final analysis</description>
