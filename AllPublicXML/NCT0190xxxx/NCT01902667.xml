  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study in which patients with untreated retroperitoneal
      sarcoma will have Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) prior to surgery. In addition, patients
      who will be undergoing pre-operative radiotherapy will have an additional MRI scan at two
      weeks post radiotherapy. For both groups, the magnetic resonance images will be correlated
      with tumour pathology.

      The study hypothesis is that Magnetic Resonance Imaging will provide a more accurate
      assessment of tumour volume and local staging than CT and will identify areas of altered
      oxygenation, cellularity and perfusion which change in response to radiotherapy before tumour
      shrinkage occurs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prediction, by MRI, of early response to radiotherapy prior to tumour shrinkage</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in volume, maximum axial diameter, ADC, F, D, D*, T2, R2* and enhancing fraction from baseline to post radiotherapy will be presented. A paired T-test (or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) may be used to test the difference between baseline and post radiotherapy. Differences in these values will be presented for responders and non-responders, which will be tested by independent T-test. Response will be determined by tumour size, enhancing fraction and histopathological evidence of response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the reproducibility of multi-parametric MRI measurements within tumour regions of interest in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma.</measure>
    <time_frame>1-7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reproducibility of the parameter ADC-Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (also F, D, D*, T2 and R2* values)between the two scans at baseline (within 7 days of each other)will be assessed using the Bland Altman method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of imaging features with histopathological assessment of tumour size, local staging, cellularity, necrosis and viable tumour.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between the ADC (and D) and %ki 67 uptake, % necrosis, %fat content, % of viable tumour, % hyalinization/fibrosis, % dedifferentiated component, cellularity and stroma morphology will be assessed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient or the Spearman's (whichever is appropriate).</description>
