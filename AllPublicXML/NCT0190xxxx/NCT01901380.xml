  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy in early childhood, with an
      estimated incidence ranging between 2% and 3% in infants and marginally lower in older
      children. It has been demonstrated that it could be a risk factor for the development of the
      functional gastrointestinal disorders in children. Intestinal microflora has been indicated
      as potential target for the management of CMA and FGDIs through the use of probiotics.
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is the most studied probiotic. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula remains hypoallergenic following
      the addition of LGG, satisfying both the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.
      Lactobacillus GG exerts several benefits when added to an extensively hydrolyzed casein
      formula (Nutramigen LGG), including decreased severity of atopic dermatitis, improved
      recovery of intestinal symptoms in infants with CMA-induced allergic colitis, and faster
      induction of tolerance in infants with CMA. The mechanisms of these effects are multiple and
      exerted at different levels: epithelium, immune system and enteric nervous system. Studies
      and meta-analyses showed that LGG increases treatment success in children with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders.

        The study population will be enrolled from a cohort of about 300 children (aged from 4 to 6
        yrs) with a history of sure diagnosis of CMA obtained in the first year of life treated
        with hypoallergenic formula for at least 6 months and who are already in follow-up at the
        Department of Pediatrics of University of Naples &quot;Federico II&quot;.
