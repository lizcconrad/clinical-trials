      To investigate gene expression profile and immunological associated analysis relating to
      immunotherapy response of patients with malignant tumor after DC-CIK immunotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      1. The patients with malignant tumor are treated with dendritic cells (DC) plus cytokine
           induced killer cells (CIK) .

        2. Venous blood (4 ml) is collected from each subject and placed into tubes containing
           Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid(EDTA) before and after each treatment. Lymphocytes are
           sorted by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting(FACS) and stored at -80°C until
           processing.

        3. The T-Cell Receptor/B-Cell Receptor gene expression is detected by micro-array。

        4. Estimate Immunotherapy response, time to disease progression, survival rates and
           clinical benefit response on patients. Response is assessed using Response Evaluation
           Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines. Degree of response is used to divide
           the cancers into two groups: sensitive and non-sensitive to immunotherapy.

        5. Compare the gene expression profile between different immunotherapy response groups to
           explore the mechanism that predict the DC-CIK immunotherapy response.
