      The primary objective is to assess the speed of absorption of BIOD-123 and BIOD-125 and
      compare them to Humalog.

      The secondary objectives are to assess other pharmacokinetic characteristics of BIOD-123 and
      BIOD-125 and compare those to Humalog®, to assess pharmacodynamic characteristics of BIOD-123
      and BIOD-125 and compare those to Humalog®, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      BIOD-123 and BIOD-125 compared to Humalog®
