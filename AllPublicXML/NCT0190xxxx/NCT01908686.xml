      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of an evidence-based, manualized
      treatment for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Pivotal Response Treatment, PRT)
      to children ages four through six years of age with ASD. Specifically, children will be
      randomly assigned to receive either (1) 10 hours per week of intervention services, including
      two hours per week of parent education, and eight hours per week of direct
      clinician-delivered services, or (2) a treatment as usual control. Intervention will focus on
      enhancing the following developmental skills: expressive and receptive language, play, and
      social interaction. Outcome measures will address changes in the aforementioned domains
      during structured observation and standardized assessment.
