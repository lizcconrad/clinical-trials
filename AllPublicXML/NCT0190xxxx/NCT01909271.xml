  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and costs U.S. taxpayers &gt;$60 billion
      annually. Interventions designed to educate patients to seek treatment sooner when a stroke
      occurs may increase low rates of treatment with thrombolysis (current rates 3% national
      average). Thrombolysis can increase the odds of minimal to zero disability from stroke if
      emergency medical system response times and in-hospital response times are optimized (maximum
      time from symptom onset to intravenous thrombolysis is 4.5 hours). Black and Hispanic
      Americans have higher stroke incidence compared to Whites and are less likely to receive
      thrombolysis for acute stroke. The latency to hospital arrival is largely dependent on
      patients'recognition of stroke symptoms, and immediate presentation to the emergency
      department. Our group has found very low stroke literacy rates among Blacks and Hispanics
      compared to Whites, which may, in part, be responsible for disparities in acute stroke
      treatment. Building on our previous work, in which the investigators have identified barriers
      to increasing stroke literacy and behavioral intent to call 911, the investigators will
      develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, culturally tailored intervention using
      storytelling (narrative persuasion) in the form of two professionally produced 12-min films
      (in English and Spanish), in minority populations in New York City. The investigators
      hypothesize that participants in the intervention arm (who view the stroke education film)
      will demonstrate greater behavioral intent to call 911 for suspected stroke compared to those
      in the usual care arm, who will receive written stroke education materials. Behavioral intent
      to call 911 will be assessed immediately after viewing the film, 6 months later, and one year
      later.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. No prior history of stroke;

          2. High risk (defined as a history of one or more stroke risk factor (HTN, diabetes,
             tobacco, abdominal obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol);

          3. Over age 34 years at onset of intervention (we have selected this age cut off due to
             the large increase in stroke incidence among minority groups at age 34 );

          4. Self-identified as Black or Hispanic; and

          5. Member of a church congregation who lives in a household with a telephone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is unable to give consent;
