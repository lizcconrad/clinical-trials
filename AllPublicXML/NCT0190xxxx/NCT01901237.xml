  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults who are living with cancer are not benefiting from the same
      age-appropriate physical and psychosocial care, as are children and older adults. As a
      result, their unique needs often go unmet or unaddressed. Studies have demonstrated that a
      lack of age-appropriate care may be responsible for a deceased quality of life. Studies have
      also shown that physical activity is able to reduce many of the negative side-effects linked
      to cancer and its treatment (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fatigue). A light form of physical
      activity that is both safe and manageable for cancer patients is yoga. The purpose of this
      study is to examine the achievability and safety of a light 7-week home/hospice-based Hatha
      yoga program (available on DVD) in the adolescent and young adult non-curative cancer
      population. This study will also examine the ability of yoga to reduce cancer related side
      effects.

    <description>This is a 7-week home/hospice-based instructive Hatha yoga program (available on DVD) for adolescent and young adults diagnosed with a non-curative cancer. Participants will be asked to complete a minimum of one, 75-minute yoga session per week. The DVD package includes four discs that increase in difficulty over the course of the 7-week program. The DVD focuses on postures and breathing exercises. Participants will be asked to keep track of the number and duration of yoga sessions completed over the 7-week period.</description>
