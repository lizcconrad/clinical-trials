  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study aims to conduct a randomized pilot trial in a sample of 40 incarcerated women
      with lifetime interpersonal violence who are 6-10 weeks away from release to demonstrate the
      feasibility and acceptability of the proposed recruitment methods and research design, of the
      intervention training methods, of delivering the enhanced Women's Coop and nutrition control
      interventions. Per recent guidance from NIMH, the investigators will also examine 95%
      confidence intervals around differences between the proposed intervention and a dose-matched
      control condition (Nutrition Program), for the following outcomes through 8 months post
      prison release: reduced unprotected vaginal or anal sex occasions and fewer cases of vaginal
      trichomoniasis (primary); reduced interpersonal violence episodes, symptoms of PTSD and
      depression, and drug using/heavy drinking days (secondary); and increased affect management
      and social support (including effectiveness in obtaining substance use, mental health
      treatment and other resources) (tertiary).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interpersonal violence (IPV) episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>Episodes of interpersonal violence (physical or sexual abuse or assault) as measured by the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ) and the Conflict Tactic Scale (CTS2). The investigators will calculate the effect size and 95% confidence intervals for number of interpersonal violence episodes during the follow-up period using Trauma History Q data. For women who have been in at least one romantic relationship during the follow-up period, the investigators will also explore differences in IPV severity using CTS2 scores. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), with baseline scores as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, Pre-release, 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD Symptom Severity as measured by the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). The investigators will calculate effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for reduction in PTSD symptoms using the DTS total scores. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with baseline scores as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, Pre-release, 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive Symptom Severity as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (QIDS-SR). The investigators will calculate effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for reduction in depressive symptoms using the QIDS-SR total scores. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with baseline scores as covariates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Release Drug Using/Heavy Drinking Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of days that women used drugs or had 4+ drinks as measured by the Timeline Followback (TLFB). Self-report data will be compared to significant other report, urine drug screens, and breath alcohol tests. The investigators will calculate effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for number of drug using/heavy drinking days using TLFB data. Exploratory tests for differences bet-ween conditions will use HLM with using/heavy drinking days in the 90 prior to incarceration as a covariate</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Affect Management</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, Pre-release, 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>Affect management is measured by the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS). It is a 15-item self report measure that assesses perceived ability to tolerate emotional distress, including ability to regulate negative affect. The investigators will calculate effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for improvement in affect modulation measured by the DTS. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM with the baseline score as a covariate.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, Pre-release, 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) will be used to measure general social support. The investigators will calculate effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for improvement in social support measured by the MSPSS using HLM with baseline score as a covariate.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness in Obtaining Resources (EOR) and Treatment Received</measure>
    <time_frame>Slope over time: Baseline, Pre-release, 2 months after release, 5 months after release, 8 months after release</time_frame>
    <description>The Effectiveness in Obtaining Resources Scale assesses respondents' effectiveness in obtaining resources in 13 areas: housing, material, goods and services, education, employment, health care for themselves and their children, child care, transportation, social support, legal assistance, financial issues, and other issues regarding themselves and their children. For this study, the investigators also ask questions assessing a woman's ability to access mental health treatment, substance use, and partner violence resources. The Treatment Services Review (TSR) assesses receipt of mental health and substance use services.
The investigators will also calculate effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for effectiveness in obtaining resources measured by the EOR total score and for total days of treatment received measured by the TSR. Exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM.</description>
