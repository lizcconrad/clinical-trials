  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to compare the effectiveness of community health worker (CHW)
      support vs. usual primary care for helping chronically-ill, low-SES patients to improve
      control of chronic conditions. Upon enrollment each patient will select one of their multiple
      chronic conditions as a focus for the trial and work with his/her PCP to set a chronic
      disease management goal. Patients are then randomized to receive usual primary care vs. CHW
      support for moving towards that goal.

    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after enrollment,</time_frame>
    <description>Six months after enrollment, patients in the IMPaCT group will greater improvements in their self-rated health (as measured by mean change in MCS and PCS of the SF-12) than patients receiving usual care.</description>

    <measure>CAHPS PCMH (Communication, Self-Management Support, Comprehensiveness of Care)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Six months after enrollment, the IMPaCT arm will have higher perceived quality of patient-centered medical care (as measured by the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Patient-Centered Medical Home (CAHPS PCMH) survey) than the usual care arm. Specifically, we will measure the CAHPS PCMH domains pertaining to Self-Management Support and Comprehensiveness of Care.</description>

    <time_frame>Six months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Six months after enrollment, patients in the IMPaCT arm will have greater improvements in their activation (as measured by mean change in PAM score) compared with patients in the usual care arm.</description>

    <description>IMPaCT CHWs will perform the following functions, depending on the needs of the participants: 1) Deconstructing Distal Goals into Proximal Goals: IMPaCT CHWs will help patients to deconstruct collaborative distal clinical goals into patient driven proximal goals and develop strategies for achieving each proximal goal.2) Creating Roadmaps: Roadmaps are individualized strategies for achieving each proximal goal identified by patients. 3) IMPaCT CHWs conduct weekly follow-up with patients through either telephone or home visit in order to support the achievement of proximal goals. As part of these followup encounters, CHWs ask patients to measure their chronic disease control during their weekly followup calls/visits. 4) Group: CHWs and their Project Manager run a group session for patients in the IMPaCT arm. This group meets weekly and is a forum for patients to discuss common issues around chronic disease management and form a social support network.</description>

    <description>Patients will be encouraged to make follow-up appointments as needed with their primary care clinic for support towards their health goals. During these appointments, clinicians will help patients determine progress made on existing proximal goals, adjust goals based on self-efficacy, and help patients to create new proximal goals as needed. They will also work with PCPs to adjust medications when appropriate, provide health behavior education and make referrals to community-based services based on patient need.</description>
