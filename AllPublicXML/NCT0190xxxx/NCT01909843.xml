  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-centre, open label study to evaluate the occurrence and subsequent
      reversibility and prevention, of bronchoconstriction following single and repeated oral
      inhalations of ALX-0171 in adults with hyperresponsive airways.

      This phase I study is an exploratory study and serves to evaluate the occurrence and
      reversibility of bronchoconstriction upon inhalation of ALX-0171. The study is an open label
      trial with a sequential administration regimen of placebo and verum in all planned study
      subjects. Each subject will start the treatment with a single dose of ALX-0171 placebo (=
      formulation buffer) followed by escalating doses of ALX-0171 verum.

      Eventually a second administration of ALX-0171 placebo may take place at the end of the study
      (as defined per protocol).

          2. Subjects must demonstrate a PC20 (concentration of the agonist in the inhaled
             substance leading to a fall in FEV1 of ≥20.0% of personal best at same visit) response
             to methacholine (MCh) concentrations of &gt; 1 mg/mL and ≤ 8 mg/mL at screening.

          3. Subjects not on concomitant treatments except for

               1. medication that has no effect on hyperresponsiveness, bronchoconstriction or on
                  lung function parameters

               2. respiratory medication for which subjects are able to discontinue their current
                  treatment during the study period taking into account the respective wash-out
                  periods as listed in the protocol.

               3. short-acting bronchodilators under certain conditions as specified in the
                  protocol.

          4. Screening forced expiratory volume (FEV1) value of &gt; 60.0% of the predicted normal
             value after a wash-out of respiratory medication as listed in the protocol.

          5. Subject has been informed both verbally and in writing about the objectives of the
             clinical trial, the methods, the anticipated benefits and potential risks and the
             discomfort to which he may be exposed, and has given written consent to participation
             in the trial prior to trial start and any trial-related procedure.

             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the trial, or diseases which may influence the results of the study
             or the subject's ability to take part in it.
