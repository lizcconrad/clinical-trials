    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and North America. The aim of the trial is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide in subjects
      with type 2 diabetes not achieving adequate glycaemic control on sitagliptin and metformin.

    <time_frame>After 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects who achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0% were analysed after 26 weeks of treatment. Missing values were imputed using MMRM.</description>

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During 26 weeks of treatment plus one week follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an event that had an onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than seven days after the last day of randomised treatment. The number of TEAEs was recorded during 26 weeks of treatment plus one week follow-up period.</description>
