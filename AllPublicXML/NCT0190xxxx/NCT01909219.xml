    <textblock>
      This is an endoscopist-blinded, prospective, multicenter study involving adult outpatients
      aiming at evaluating whether sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate split dosing is associated
      to higher efficacy and acceptability in comparison to the standard dose regimen in bowel
      cleansing before colonoscopy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Picosulphate/magnesium citrate is a very effective, safe and tolerated low-volume preparation
      for colon cleansing. This study evaluates whether split dosing is associated to a further
      increase in efficacy and acceptability in comparison to the standard dose regimen. This is a
      multicenter, randomized, single-blind study performed in 15 endoscopic services in Italy.

      Adult outpatients undergoing colonoscopy will receive picosulphate/magnesium citrate either
      in the standard dosing (group A, two sachets the day before endoscopy), or in the split
      dosing (group B, the second dose in the morning of colonoscopy). Bowel cleansing will be
      assessed using the Boston Scale (BBPS) and rated as adequate if &gt;2 in each segment. Patient
      acceptance, satisfaction, and related symptoms will be also recorded.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was the quality of overall colon cleansing, assessed by the endoscopist. Colon cleansing quality was dichotomized as &quot;adequate&quot; (score &gt; 2 in each colon segment) or &quot;inadequate&quot; (score &lt; 2 in one or more colon segments</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' acceptance, tolerability and compliance to the cleansing regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>The overall tolerance of the preparation and the severity of symptoms during the preparation period will be rated on a scale ranging from 0 (no discomfort) to 3 (severe discomfort). Patient acceptance of the preparation will be evaluated by a questionnaire with a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (worse) to 5 (best), assessing interference with daily activity, palatability, easiness in taking the product and the adjunctive clear fluid, and taste of product. Moreover, a nurse will ask the patient whether s/he have completed the prescribed regimen: compliance will be defined as poor for patients who consume less than 75% of product. Willingness to repeat the same preparation in the future will be also recorded.</description>
