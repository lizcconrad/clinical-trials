  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international (France, Austria and Germany), randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in
      patients with histologically proven metastatic and/or unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)
      after failure or intolerance to doxorubicin (or other anthracycline).

      Five cohorts will be defined:

      Cohort A: Liposarcoma Cohort B: Leiomyosarcoma Cohort C: Synovial sarcoma Cohort D: other
      sarcomas (see Appendix C) Cohort E: Leiomyosarcoma, Synovial sarcoma and other sarcomas
      listed in Appendix C previously treated with pazopanib Approximately 226 patients who meet
      the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the treatment
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is doxorubicin +/- ifosfamide. After
      failure or intolerance to doxorubicin, there is no standard of care. In Europe, two are
      currently approved for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma after failure/intolerance to
      doxorubicin: trabectedin (Yondelis®) for all histological subtype and pazopanib (Votrient ®)
      for all subtypes excluding liposarcomas. Nevertheless, none of these drugs improve the
      overall survival over placebo.

      The study is composed of 3 periods:

        1. A Screening Period,

        2. A Treatment Period,

        3. And a Survival Follow-up Period. Patients randomized to be treated with regorafenib will
           receive the treatment orally for 3 weeks of every 4 week (28 days) cycle (ie, 3 weeks
           on/1 week off).

      Patients randomized to the placebo arm will be treated for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks cycle
      (ie, 3 weeks on/1 week off).

      In addition to the regorafenib and placebo treatments, patients will receive best supportive
      care. Best supportive care includes any method to preserve the comfort and dignity of the
      patients and excludes any disease-specific anti-neoplastic therapy such as any kinase
      inhibitor,chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical intervention.

      Patients receiving placebo, who experience disease progression may be offered open-label
      regorafenib(cross-over option).
