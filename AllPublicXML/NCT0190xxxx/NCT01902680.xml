    <textblock>
      This is a pilot prospective biomedical study of interventional type which includes 17
      patients on 24 months (12 months of inclusion and 12 months of follow-up).

      The objective of this study is to verify that the focal therapy technique used (with the help
      of Koelis® system) allows to obtain optimal dosimetric coverage of the prostate target (ie
      dose of 160 Gy +-5% delivered on the envelope isodose) evaluated by CT scan performed 30 days
      after implantation.
