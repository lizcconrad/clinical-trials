  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A gravity admission largest resuscitation and a poorer prognosis are expected for patients
      experiencing socio-economic vulnerability. This is the first study in France and
      investigating the field of resuscitation which will allow us to have a vision of the French
      health system and its consequences. The frequency of PTSD is expected to be more important in
      this vulnerable population itself with quality of life at discharge worse. The results of
      this study are a prerequisite for the implementation of preventive measures targeted and more
      suitable for those patients experiencing socio-economic vulnerability remediation.
