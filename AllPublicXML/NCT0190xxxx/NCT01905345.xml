      Randomised training intervention.

      Influence of consecutive training regime on the impact of the myonuclear domain and satellite
      cell

      Sarcopenia

      Despite that the muscle mass can be positively influenced by training, the loading with high
      weights and/or to the total exhaustion is for many old persons not possible.

      Therefore we aim to enhance the myonuclei in the muscle fiber of old male subjects in a first
      phase by endurance training, in order to promote a more effective muscle growth in a second
      phase by resistance exercise.
