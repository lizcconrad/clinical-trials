      To evaluate whether beclomethasone dipropionate / formoterol (BDP/FOR; Fostair® 100/6) is at
      least equivalent in terms of exacerbation prevention to fluticasone dipropionate / salmeterol
      (FP/SAL; Seretide® 125) in matched asthma patients switching to BDP/FOR following treatment
      with FP/SAL in normal clinical practice compared with patients not switched.

        All patients are diagnosed with asthma or COPD and aged between 18-80 years with all 61-80

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged: 18-80 years 61-80 years to be non-smokers only

          -  Evidence of asthma: a diagnostic code for asthma or two scripts for asthma..

          -  Baseline FP/SAL therapy: ≥2 prescription for ICS/LABA therapy as FP/SAL

          -  Evidence of Continuing Therapy: Include only patients who receive ≥2 prescriptions for
             the therapy under study during the outcome year (i.e. ≥1 prescription at the index
             date and ≥1 other). UK average is 3-4 prescriptions refilled per year, so ≥2 ensures
             capture of &quot;real-life&quot; data.

          -  Evidence of Switching for economic reasons: FP/SAL patients from practices with ≥5
             switches to Fostair in a 3 month period to minimise data taken from switching of
             anomalous patients; optimal practices for inclusion are those switching &quot;wholesale&quot;
             for economic reasons.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any chronic respiratory disease other than asthma

          -  Are receiving maintenance oral steroid therapy during baseline period
