  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that providing low-intensity
      opportunities for interactive play can improve the waiting and overall clinic experiences of
      children. This study evaluates an innovative, interactive system called ScreenPlay designed
      to realize the intentions of the &quot;Healing Environment&quot; in the waiting space of a paediatric
      hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing entertainment and distraction options (e.g. toys, video games) meet neither
      organizational standards nor families' needs with respect to accessibility and infection
      control. Additionally, they do not provide the types of positive experiences (e.g. calm, low
      intensity) that are most desirable for children awaiting treatment.

      The goal of this research is to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of ScreenPlay, a
      technology that enables users to create or manipulate animations on a screen/projection, and
      to provide an evidence-informed model for the design of optimal paediatric waiting spaces. A
      blinded, clustered, parallel randomized controlled trial applying objective outcome measures
      and qualitative methods will be used to compare children allocated to one of three waiting
      conditions at a large urban rehabilitation hospital: (a) no media (standard care), (b)
      passive media (a silent nature video), or (c) interactive media (ScreenPlay). This study will
      answer the questions:

      Can Interactive Media (i.e. ScreenPlay):

        1. reduce state anxiety in children/youth attending an outpatient clinic? and,

        2. improve child, parent, and staff satisfaction with the clinic experience?

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Decreases in state anxiety will be greater for children exposed to ScreenPlay for 10
           minutes than for those exposed to passive (i.e. a nature video) or no media (i.e.
           standard care/control). The decrease in state anxiety associated with ScreenPlay will be
           &gt;5 points on the normalized 100 point State Anxiety Scale.

        2. ScreenPlay will generate more movement/activity on the floor (i.e. an indicator of
           active engagement with the system) than the passive media or control conditions as
           measured via contact floor sensors.

        3. The waiting and overall clinic experience of children with diverse mobility, parents,
           and staff will be perceived more positively when exposed to ScreenPlay as compared to
           passive media or control conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 10 minutes of exposure to intervention, and immediately following appointment.</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is used to capture apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, mYPAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 10 minutes of exposure to intervention, and immediately following appointment.</time_frame>
    <description>The mYPAS observes activity, vocalizations, emotion expressivity, state of arousal, and use of parents, to ascertain children's anxiety state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Faces Pain Scale Revised, Faces-R</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following medical/therapeutic intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Faces-R is used to capture self-reported pain. The scale is composed of 6 gender neutral faces showing increasing levels pain/hurt from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;most pain possible&quot;</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Behaviour Mapping</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered during the participant's 10 minute exposure to the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>An unobtrusive, observational technique used to systematically define/record distinct behaviours including: mobility, activities, social interactions, emotion expressivity, attention/engagement, and description of challenges encountered.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Contact sensors</measure>
    <time_frame>Data from sensors is continuously collected from 7am to 5pm from beginning of data collection (June 2012) to end of data collection (April 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>ScreenPlay incorporates a 'pressure' floor composed of 100 contact sensors arranged in a 10 foot by 10 foot grid. Activity metrics (e.g. number, duration, and frequency of activations) are extracted for each contact sensor and for the amalgamated grid.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feedback questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Child and parent surveys are administered post-exposure. Staff surveys will be administered nearing the end of the recruitment deadline.</time_frame>
    <description>The surveys inquire into child, parent, and staff perceptions of the waiting space and their overall clinic experience through a mixture of open- and close-ended (e.g. Likert scale) questions.</description>
