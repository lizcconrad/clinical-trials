             screening

             classification

          -  Rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive pJIA

          -  RF-negative pJIA

          -  Extended oligoarticular JIA with a polyarticular course

          -  History of inadequate clinical response (in the opinion of the treating physician) to
             or inability to tolerate methotrexate (MTX)

          -  Participants currently receiving TCZ by the intravenous (IV) route of administration
             and with well-controlled disease do not require a period of discontinuation of IV TCZ
             and should have their first dose of SC TCZ administered on the date that their next IV
             TCZ infusion would be due. Participants participating in the study may be either naive
             to TCZ therapy or may be switching from IV to SC. The total number of participants
             switching from IV TCZ must account for no more than 50 percent (%) of the total
             participant number. To account for the baseline TCZ concentrations in these
             participants, information on the last 4 IV TCZ infusions prior to baseline will be
             collected

          -  Concurrent treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (including
             MTX), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and oral corticosteroids are
             permitted at the discretion of the investigator

          -  Females of childbearing potential and non-sterile males with female partner of

             compromise or inborn conditions characterized by a compromised immune system

             during screening or treatment with IV antibiotics completed within 4 weeks of the
             screening visit or oral antibiotics completed within 2 weeks of the screening visit

          -  History of atypical tuberculosis (TB) or active TB requiring treatment within 2 years
             prior to screening visit

          -  Positive purified protein derivative (PPD) at screen, unless treated with anti-TB
             therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to receiving study drug and chest radiograph is
             negative for active TB within 6 months of screening visit according to local practice

          -  History of reactivation or new onset of a systemic infection such as herpes zoster or
             Epstein-Barr virus within 2 months of the screening visit

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positivity or chronic viral or
             autoimmune hepatitis

          -  History of concurrent serious gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcer or inflammatory

          -  History of or current cancer or lymphoma

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin
