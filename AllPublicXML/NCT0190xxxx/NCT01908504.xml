      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit of using positron emission tomography
      (PET) in addition to the standard (computed tomography) CT to plan radiation therapy for
      cancer treatment. The information from the PET-CT may allow the investigators to change the
      radiation plan or the delivery of the radiation to the tumor/tumor site such as the total
      dose of radiation or the size of the area to receive further radiation. Presently the use of
      PET scans to adjust radiation therapy during radiation treatment is not standard of care and
      is being investigated in this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of subjects with benefit from an intra-treatment PET-CT</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This benefit lies in the potential to adapt the treatment plan based on an intratreatment PET-CT. This may also be of significant prognostic utility, at an early enough time point to potentially alter treatment accordingly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Locoregional control.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of intra treatment PET-CT/ approx 2-4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This study will evaluate the prognostic value of intra-treatment functional imaging on clinical relevant tumor endpoints (i.e. locoregional control, freedom from distant metastases, and overall survival).Comparison of intra-treatment FDG-PET indices will identify two groups of responses: PET responses and PET non-responses, which will correlate with prognosis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freedom from distant metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be evaluated in regular follow up with repeat imaging as per the standard of care, or at the treating investigator's discretion. Frequency of follow up will be determined by the standard practice for the disease site and stage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be evaluated in regular follow up with the investigators according to the standard of care for each disease site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure acute toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>During radiation therapy and within 30 days of the last radiation treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Acute toxicity will be assessed weekly as per the standard practice of the treating investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure late toxicities</measure>

    <description>At radiation planning subjects will have a PET-CT. The CT scan — also called computerized tomography or just CT — combines a series of X-ray views taken from many different angles to produce cross-sectional images of the bones and soft tissues inside the body. A PET is a highly specialized imaging technique that uses short-lived radioactive substances (such as FDG a simple sugar labeled with a radioactive atom) to produce three-dimensional colored images of those substances functioning within the body. These images are called PET scans and the technique is termed PET scanning. PET scanning provides information about the body's chemistry not available through other procedures. Unlike CT or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), techniques that look at anatomy or body form, PET studies metabolic activity or body function.</description>
