  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal intercourse to promote labour onset is biologically plausible. Oxytocin release
      during female orgasm, cervix mechanical stimulation and the effect of semen's prostaglandins
      are possible involved mechanisms. The investigators propose to evaluate the effect of vaginal
      intercourse on spontaneous labour at term.
