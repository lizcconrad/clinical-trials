      This pilot clinical trial studies 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid (CPI-613) in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who failed previous therapy. Sometimes when
      chemotherapy or biological therapy is given, it does not stop the growth of tumor cells. The
      tumor is said to be resistant to treatment. 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid may interfere
      with the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic
      syndromes that did not respond to previous therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities of CPI-613 in myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) patients who have failed previous agents (such as decitabine [Dacogen], azacitidine
      [Vidaza], growth factors or lenalidomide).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days
      1 and 4 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

             previous therapy (therapy failure is defined as patients who have been sufficiently
             treated with previous agents without response in the opinion of the treating
             physician, or whose disease has progressed or relapsed while on a hypomethylating
             agent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery disease,
             myocardial infarction within the past 3 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia,
             pericardial disease or New York Heart Association class III or IV), or severe
             debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase patients' risk for
             toxicity

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding or bleeding diathesis (e.g., active peptic ulcer

          -  Patients with any amount of clinically significant pericardial effusion

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; (Note: patients with
             known HIV infection are excluded because patients with an immune deficiency are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, and
             because there may be unknown or dangerous drug interactions between CPI-613 and
             anti-retroviral agents used to treat HIV infections)

          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy, surgery, treatment with cytotoxic agents
