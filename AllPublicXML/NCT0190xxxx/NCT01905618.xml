  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two methods of teaching the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange)
      for tobacco dependence treatment to medical students: 1) traditional medical education (TE),
      and 2) multi-modal education (MME). The MME arm builds upon the traditional curriculum at the
      medical school by providing a web-based instructional program, a role play, preceptor
      training, and a booster session. The hypotheses are that MME will outperform TE on observed
      5As counseling skills on the Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE); and MME will
      outperform TE on self-reported 5As counseling skills.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten medical schools are matched and then randomized, with 5 schools being randomized to MME
      and 5 schools to TE.

      The primary aim of the study is to refine, implement, and evaluate whether a multi-modal
      educational (MME) approach is more effective than traditional educational (TE) approach for
      developing skill in the use of the 5As counseling steps for tobacco dependence treatment.

      Multi-Modal Education(MME)Approach:

      The MME approach includes: 1) a web-based course during the first-year of medical school; 2)
      a tobacco counseling role-play exercise; 3) training preceptors in the use of the 5As,
      preceptor observation of students in the use of 5As and providing instruction and feedback to
      students during a designated third-year clerkship rotation; and 4) a booster session provided
      during the third-year clerkship experience. These components are designed to enhance the
      interpersonal (e.g. 5As self-reported skill, tobacco treatment knowledge), intrapersonal
      (e.g. experiences observing 5As, experiences receiving 5As instruction), and organizational
      factors (e.g. clinic/system reminders) associated with optimal learning. This combination,
      primarily due to the web-based course/role play and preceptor facilitated teaching methods,
      is hypothesized to enhance medical students' 5As tobacco dependence treatment skills,
      compared to the TE approach.

      Traditional Education (TE) Approach:

      The TE approach represents &quot;usual care&quot; and includes the current content and method for
      tobacco teaching among medical schools. TE content typically includes knowledge in the basic
      science of tobacco use (e.g. health consequences of tobacco use and passive smoking), and the
      knowledge and practice of tobacco dependence treatment. All schools prior to randomization
      met the inclusion criteria that the curriculum devoted no more than four hours to tobacco.

      The RCT's secondary aims address the potential impact of the interpersonal, intrapersonal,
      and organizational factors on tobacco dependence treatment counseling skills. The hypothesis
      is that these factors mediate the relationship between the MME curriculum approach and the
      primary outcome, observed 5As counseling skill, and that the MME approach will outperform the
      TE approach in each of these areas. This study also will assess the feasibility of
      implementing the MME across medical schools.

    <description>Medical students in the medical schools randomized to the MME will receive four interventions during the course of their medical education. The four interventions/components are: 1) web-based curriculum on tobacco dependence treatment; 2)tobacco counseling role play; 3) preceptor training and teaching medical students, preceptor modeling the 5As, student observation, and student feedback; and 4)booster session.</description>

    <description>The University of Massachusetts Medical School's web-based course, &quot;Basic Skills for Working with Smokers&quot; was adapted for this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The goal is to provide standardized information in the following core tobacco content areas: epidemiology of tobacco use, health consequences of tobacco use, nicotine dependence and withdrawal assessment, and provision of behavioral and pharmacotherapy tobacco treatment. The course is 3 hours in length and can be completed at the student's convenience. The dean and the course director at each medical school required that the first year medical students complete the web-based curriculum prior to the next component of the study, the role play.</description>

    <description>The goal of the role play is to provide each student with the opportunity to apply what he/she learned in the web-based curriculum (the 5 As and the physician delivered intervention approach). The one hour session begins with a video of a patient-centered counseling approach which incorporates the 5A intervention presented in the web-based course. This is followed by a 30 minute role play session including various scenarios with physician/patient interaction. Students role play either as physician, patient or observer for each scenario.</description>

    <description>The goal of this intervention is to train preceptors in the use of the 5As with their patients and to teach and motivate their medical students to use the 5As. The academic detailing approach is used to provide a standardized 30 to 45 minute group training session during the third year clerkship. All preceptors and medical students are encouraged to intervene with patients who smoke. Preceptors are encouraged to model the 5As, observe and give feedback to the medical student in its use. Study-tailored handouts are available for preceptors and students. This component is implemented with the study cohort in their third year of medical school.</description>
