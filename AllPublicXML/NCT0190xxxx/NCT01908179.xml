      This registry study will evaluate patients with metastatic brain tumors undergoing, or having
      undergone, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) at Swedish Medical Center. Clinical outcomes will
      be evaluated at the 3, 6 and 12-month time points. Clinical data, SRS treatment data, and
      imaging data (including anatomic and advanced imaging sequences obtained prior to and
      serially following SRS) will be archived in an online informatics platform, specifically a
      metastatic brain tumor registry known as the Comprehensive Neuro-oncology Data Repository for
      Metastatic Tumors (CONDR - Mets).
