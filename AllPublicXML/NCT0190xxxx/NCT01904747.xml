  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to quantify the effect of food on the extent of absorption of
      palbociclib.

      The caloric content of the food and the time of the meals with respect to palbociclib
      administration may influence the capacity of the body to absorb the drug.

      High and low calorie meals will be given to the subjects 30 minutes before palbociclib
      administration as 2 of the 3 conditions to compare with completely absence of food in the
      body when dosing (fasted).The third condition to test and compare with fasted stage will be
      the administration of food before and after palbociclib administration.

      This information will help the program to decide wether or not the presence of food when
      dosing palbociclib help with its absorption and to what extent it does help. Based on the
      collected information, a recommendation about the administration of palbociclib with food
      will be provided to patients.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - 8)]</measure>
    <time_frame>144 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Area under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) from 0 to 72 hrs</measure>
    <time_frame>144 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is a measure of the serum concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>144 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>144 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
