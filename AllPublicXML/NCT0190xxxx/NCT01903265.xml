  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TNX-102 capsules [formerly known as very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine] at bedtime have
      shown promise as a treatment of fibromyalgia, but the drug required new formulation
      technology for bedtime use. The present trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy
      of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets, taken daily at bedtime over 12 weeks to treat fibromyalgia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Pain Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Daily pain scores were assessed using a 24-hour recall response provided by each patient via an interactive voice response system (IVRS) daily telephone diary. Average daily pain was measured using an 11-point (0-10) numerical rating scale (NRS), with higher scores representing worse pain. Jump to control was used to replace missing data in each treatment arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30% Responder Analysis of IVRS NRS Pain Assessments at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly averages of daily pain scores were calculated using the daily, 24-hour-recall, IVRS NRS pain assessments.
Patients who had at least a 30% improvement from baseline to week 12 in weekly average of daily pain scores were considered responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in PROMIS T-score for Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance instrument consists of 8 items in which responses are scored 1 to 5 for each item. A higher score on 5 of the 8 items reflects a worse outcome, whereas a higher score on 3 items reflects an improved outcome; therefore, the directionality of the 8 item scores are first synchronized prior to calculation of the total raw score. PROMIS scores are presented as T-scores in which the raw score has been rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher T-scores represent more of the concept being measured (in this case, sleep disturbance).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Responder Status (&quot;Very Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Much Improved&quot; vs All Other Categories) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a 7-point scale (1=very much improved; 7=very much worse) that assesses the patient's perception of the overall change in his/her fibromyalgia symptoms since entering the study. Scores of 1 and 2 were considered responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in FIQ-R Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (revised) FIQ-R is made up of 3 domains: functional (9 questions), overall (2 questions) and symptoms (10 questions). All questions are based on an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10, with 10 being &quot;worst.&quot; Total FIQ-R scores can range from 0-100, with higher scores reflecting worsening status. The patient's total score on the FIQ-R was assessed at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Week 12). Jump to control was used to replace missing data in each treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in PROMIS T-score for Sleep Disturbance</title>
        <description>The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance instrument consists of 8 items in which responses are scored 1 to 5 for each item. A higher score on 5 of the 8 items reflects a worse outcome, whereas a higher score on 3 items reflects an improved outcome; therefore, the directionality of the 8 item scores are first synchronized prior to calculation of the total raw score. PROMIS scores are presented as T-scores in which the raw score has been rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher T-scores represent more of the concept being measured (in this case, sleep disturbance).</description>
