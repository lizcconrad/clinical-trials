  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of study is to investigate the impact of two different training modalities (high
      intensity interval training (HIIT) versus moderate intensity continuous exercise training
      (MICET) on cognitive performance, cerebral oxygenation, cardiac output and physical fitness
      in older healthy adults, patients with metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease and heart
      failure. The investigators hypothesized that HIIT modality will lead to a larger improvement
      in physical fitness (i.e. VO2peak), cardiovascular parameters (cardiac output and stroke
      volume) and cognitive performance at rest and during submaximal exercise. The primary
      endpoint will be the improvement in cognitive performance.

    <description>High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) session This HIIE session will be based on a previous study conducted in our laboratory that compared physiological, psychological and electrocardiological tolerance of four different single bouts of HIIE in coronary patients (Guiraud et al. 2010). The selected HIIE session represented the best compromise between safety, time spent at a high level of VO2peak and psychological adherence. This HIIE session consists of a 10-min warm-up at 50% of MAP, followed by two sets of 10 min composed of repeated bouts of 15 s at 100% of MAP interspersed by 15 s of passive recovery. Four minutes of passive recovery were allowed between the two sets, as well as a 5-min cool-down after the last 15-s exercise bout. A total duration of 35 minutes will be employed for this session for coronary artery disease patients, and 22 minutes for chronic heart failure patients (Guiraut et al. 2010 b).</description>

    <description>Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise (MICE) session This exercise session will be based on the recommendations of the American Heart Association on exercise prescription in cardiac rehabilitation (Balady et al. 2007), suggesting that exercise intensity should lie between 50% and 80% of maximal aerobic power (MAP). We opted for an intensity of 70% of MAP. Duration will be adjusted to match total energy expenditure of the HIIE, according to the previous methodology method (Guiraud et al. 2010 b). A total duration of 28.7 minutes will be employed in healthy elderly patients, coronary artery disease patients and patients with metabolic syndrom; and 16 minutes in chronic heart failure patients.</description>
