  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the changes in pain and self-perceived function
      between two different treatments for Achilles tendinopathy: the Astym速 protocol (a form of
      soft tissue mobilization using instruments) and a specific exercise protocol that involves
      strengthening the calf and Achilles tendon. Astym速 (A-stim) is not an acronym, but rather
      stands for &quot;A Stimulation&quot; of the body's healing response, describing the physiologic process
      which occurs with Astym treatment. Astym is the trademark name of a non-invasive treatment
      where instruments are applied topically to locate unhealthy soft tissue, and to transfer mild
      to moderate pressure to the underlying soft tissue structures. The aim of Astym treatment is
      to eliminate scar tissue and stimulate tissue regeneration. Both the principal investigator
      and co-investigator have been trained and certified in administering the Astym treatment. The
      specific exercise protocol will involve exercises that strengthen the Achilles and calf
      through eccentric exercise. Eccentric exercise is a form of exercise where the benefit comes
      from applying a controlled lengthening stress to the muscle and tendon.
