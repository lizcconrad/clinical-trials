    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the medication TP05 to the medication
      Asacol™ for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of TP05. This study will investigate whether TP05 is as good as (non-inferior
      to) Asacol™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3.2 g of TP05/day compared to 3.2 g/day of
      Asacol™ with an open label extension to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of TP05
      administered over a 26 week period. A total of 800 subjects with mildly to moderately active
      UC will be evaluated. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      3.2 g/day of TP05 (administered once daily) or 3.2 g/day of Asacol™. The primary efficacy
      outcome will be assessed at Week 8. All subjects who respond to TP05/Asacol™ (response or
      remission) will continue receiving blinded study treatment for up to 12 weeks. After that,
      subjects can enroll in an Open Label Extension (OLE) for 26 weeks duration to receive TP05.
      Subjects failing to respond to study drug at the Week 8 visit can enroll in the OLE at week 8
      and receive 4.8 g/day of TP05.
