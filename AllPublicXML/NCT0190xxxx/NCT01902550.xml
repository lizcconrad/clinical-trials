    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effect of co-administration of JNJ-54452840 and
      metoprolol tartrate immediate-release (metoprolol IR) compared to metoprolol IR alone on the
      exercise heart rate and blood pressure measured at the end of each 3-minute exercise test in
      healthy participants.

      This is a Phase 1, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), single-center,
      double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant
      receives) and 2-period crossover (participants may receive different interventions
      sequentially during the trial) study of JNJ-54452840 and metoprolol tartrate in healthy
      participants. The duration of study will be up to 7 weeks per participant and up to 1 year
      for participants if they develop anti-beta 1-AR (adrenergic receptor) auto-antibodies
      (auto-antibodies targeting the human beta-1-AR, antibody is a type of protein that helps
      protect the body against foreign matter, such as bacteria and viruses). The study consists of
      3 parts: Screening (that is, up to 14 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment
      (consists of either metoprolol IR and JNJ-54452840 or metoprolol IR and Placebo for 8 days,
      in subsequent two-treatment periods, separated by wash-out period of 2-7 days); and Follow-up
      (that is, 7-10 days after last study dose for safety assessment; followed by another visit
      after 21-28 days of last study dose for assessment of anti beta-1-AR auto-antibodies in
      blood). Any potential interaction between JNJ-54452840 and metoprolol tartrate IR will
      primarily be evaluated by measuring exercise induced heart rate (that is, post exercise).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study. If beta-1-AR-auto-antibodies are
      detected at the follow up visit 21-28 days after last treatment period study procedure,
      additional testing will be performed every 3 months until auto-antibody levels fall below the
      level of detection of the assay or for 1 year, whichever occurs earlier.
