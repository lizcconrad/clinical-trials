    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to clarify and improve the efficiency of the standardized
      walk-test in Cardiovascular Rehabilitation. The psycho-metric properties of the 400m walk
      test at a self-selected speed will be evaluated. Such tests, made at a self-selected
      (&quot;comfortable&quot;, &quot;free&quot;) speed particularly assess the endurance capacities. The results of
      the physiological measurements during the tests will be compared with those of TM6min of Test
      of Fast Walking of 200m (TMR200m) and a maximal treadmill exercise. Stable coronary patients,
      aged over 55 years old, will be included.

      This study should permit a simplification and a better understanding of the clinical-use of
      walk tests. In the future, two kinds of tests might be proposed with different distances, 1-
      200m-fast-walking-test aimed to evaluate the performance closed to the maximum capacity, 2-
      self-selected-walk-test on a doubled distance (400m) aimed to evaluate the aerobic capacities
      of the adaptation of the body in response to effort.

    <description>Measurement between:
1) The Maximal consumption of oxygen (VO2) uptake during the 400m-walk-test (TML400m) and the VO2 value at the first aerobic threshold measured during graded maximal exercise on treadmill.
2) the heart rate during TML400 and the heart rate value at the first aerobic threshold measured during graded maximal exercise on treadmill.
These ICC will be also assessed, during a 6-minute-walk-test and a 200m-fast walk test compared to the maximal graded test.</description>

    <measure>A variance analysis (ANOVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine differences between the different measures performed in the VO2 tests. If a significant difference is found, a post-hoc LSD(Least Significant Difference)test types will be conducted to classify the variables.</description>

    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>To search for potential relationships between the maximum heart rate and the following variables: age, height, weight, BMI, HRrest (resting heart rate), FC6mn (heart rate at 6 minutes), T6mn (T=6 minutes), FCT200, TMR200 (Test of fast walking of 200m), and TML400. To select the variables of interest, we will use a stepwise method using algorithms available in the NCSS 2004 software (Statistical software).</description>

    <description>Patients will make a 6-minute-walk-test, the 400m-walk-test and a 200m-fast walk test. These first 2 tests (TM6min and TML400m) will be made in an order determined by randomization.
This series of test will be repeated 72 hours later for the study reproducibility.
It will be followed by a phase of rest of 15 min and a test of effort on travelator, according to the protocol of &quot; modified Bruce &quot; in moderation of portable VO2.</description>

             trans-thoracic echocardiography according to Simpson's method or assay plasma
             N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP-3) times the values used in

             capacity (respiratory failure, metabolic disorders such as non-stabilized progressive
             renal failure) and involving the vital prognosis in the short or medium term
