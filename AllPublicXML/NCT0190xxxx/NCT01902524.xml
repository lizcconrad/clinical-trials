    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm effectiveness and safety of fentanyl transdermal
      patch Durogesic速 D-Trans for treatment of chronic pain in participants with chronic
      non-cancer pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase 4, prospective, open-label (meaning that both the research physician
      and study participants will know which medication is being administered) study of fentanyl
      transdermal patch-type system (TTS) Durogesic速 D-Trans in patients with non-cancer pain. The
      patch is designed to systematically release the adsorbed fentanyl percutaneously, in a
      constant rate for three days (72 hours). The study will be conducted for 12 weeks. The
      efficacy and safety will be evaluated at week 1, week 4, week 8 and week 12 visits. All
      participants will use the patch at least once during the study. The drug efficacy will be
      evaluated by the percent change in pain intensity before and after treatment and by
      improvements in the following activities: daily life, walking, meal intake, mood regulation.
      The overall safety will be assessed based on the adverse events reporting.
