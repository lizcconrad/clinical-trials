  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disposable Air-Q self-inflating laryngeal intubation mask (Air-Q, Mercury Medical,
      Clearwater, FL, USA) is an extra-glottic airway device which enables blind intubation with a
      tracheal tube. This intubating laryngeal airway device (ILA) is already commercially
      available and worldwide certificated (CE 0482), but data about the success rates of blind
      intubation via this device in adult patients are lacking. Success rates of blind intubations
      with the non-self-inflating device range between 57 and 97%.

      Although the self-inflating disposable Air-Q device is certified for blind intubation, the
      success rate and rate of adverse events associated with this procedure have not been
      published so far. In a study comparing adverse events of conventional intubation with blind
      intubation via a different supra-glottic airway device (ILMA) the rates of sore throat and
      cough were comparable in both groups and were reported in 10-17% of the patients. In a pilot
      study using the non-self-inflating Air-Q for blind intubation in 19 patients, 10% reported
      dysphagia and one patient had a bilateral lingual nerve injury which was self-limited. One
      study using the self-pressurised disposable Air-Q for ventilation of children showed broncho-
      or laryngospasm in 3% and mucosal damage such as blood stained ILA or sore throat were
      reported in 1%.

      This data suggests that the rate of adverse events using the Air-Q supra-glottic device are
      comparable to other devices such as LMA.
