    <textblock>
      Epiretinal membrane is common disease, affecting 5~10 % incidence over 60 years old
      population. It reduce visual acuity, cause metamorphopsia. In the past, vitrectomy and
      epiretinal membranectomy was indicated in patients with visual acuity less than 20/40, but
      nowadays with technical improvement and surgical instrument renovation, it seems to have been
      changed the surgical indication. Therefore, we plan to evaluate the changes of binocular
      visual acuity, aniseikonia in patients with epiretinal membrane.

    <description>Stereopsis is normal binocular vision. Its presence or absence is an important indicator of the state of binocularity. The TNO test is graded to provide retinal disparities ranging from 15 to 480 second of arc.</description>
