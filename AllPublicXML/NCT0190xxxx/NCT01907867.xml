    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of finafloxacin as a novel
      fluoroquinolone and a potential therapeutic agent for lower respiratory infections such as
      bacterial pneumonia. A comparison of the PK profile of finafloxacin in plasma and lung ELF
      using different bronchoscopic ELF sampling techniques (BMS and BAL) is conducted.

    <time_frame>Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), physical examinations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs. Other safety data will be summarized as appropriate. The data will be presented in descriptive manner.</description>

    <description>Day 1: Finafloxacin 800 mg will be administered as an oral dose once in the morning (first dose). Subjects will have plasma PK samples drawn at specified times around the first dose. Bronchoscopic microsampling will be performed to obtain bronchial ELF samples in triplicate at 3 hours after the oral dose.
Day 2: Finafloxacin 800 mg will be administered as an oral dose once in the morning (second dose).
Day 3: Finafloxacin 800 mg will be administered as an oral dose once in the morning (third dose). Subjects will have plasma PK samples drawn at specified times around the third dose. Bronchoscopic microsampling will be performed to obtain bronchial ELF samples in triplicate at 6 hours after the oral dose, followed immediately by BAL to obtain alveolar ELF samples.</description>
