  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that skeletal muscle lipid content (IntraMyoCellular Lipid,
      IMCL) markedly increases the risk of metabolic complications, including insulin resistance
      and cardiovascular events. The investigator hypothesizes that skeletal muscle is passively
      taking up FFAs when the availability is high, thereby leading to an increased storage. To
      test this hypothesis, the investigator wants to manipulate FFA levels, by means of exercise,
      and monitor intramuscular lipid content.

      Therefore the objective is to examine the effect of an exercise-induced elevation of FFA on
      skeletal muscle lipid content in healthy lean men. To this end, skeletal muscle lipid content
      will be investigated at baseline and after an exercise protocol and again after a four-hour
      recovery period from exercise, once in a condition with high FFA concentration, once with low
      FFA concentration. To achieve high- versus low FFA concentrations, an exercise protocol was
      chosen and participants had to perform this protocol once with a glucose supplementation and
      once without.

      Skeletal muscle lipid content will be determined before, directly after exercise and 4 h post
      exercise (from muscle biopsies) with or without glucose supplementation.
