    <textblock>
      QGC001/1QG1 is a Phase I &quot;first time in man&quot; study aiming to determine the overall safety and
      tolerability of single ascending oral doses of QGC001 in healthy male subjects compared to
      placebo, as well as the pharmacokinetics of QGC001 and its metabolite EC33 and the
      pharmacodynamic properties of QGC001 (effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,
      blood pressure and heart rate) in healthy male subjects.
