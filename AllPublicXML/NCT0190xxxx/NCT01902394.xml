  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if substituting whole grains for refined grains in
      the diets of healthy adults over a period of 6 weeks alters the composition of the bacteria
      in the gut, and has beneficial effects on immune function, digestive health, cardiovascular
      health, regulation of body weight and composition, and vitamin K status.

      The investigators hypothesize that whole grain consumption over a period of 6 weeks will
      alter the gut microflora toward a more beneficial bacterial profile, improve the immune
      response while reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, have favorable effects on
      factors influencing the regulation of body weight and composition,increase bacterial vitamin
      K synthesis, and beneficially effect surrogate markers of cholesterol synthesis/absorption,
      vitamin D concentrations, and whole genome DNA methylation patterns. In statin users it is
      hypothesized that, consumption of whole grains will alter statin pharmacokinetics by
      decreasing rate of statin absorption, resulting in more sustained plasma concentrations.

      This study is a randomized parallel-arm trial using a six-week dietary intervention following
      a 2 week run-in period. Healthy volunteers will be randomized to two groups (n=40/group), and
      consume either a diet rich in whole grains or a diet rich in refined grains provided at
      estimated energy requirements for 6 weeks. Outcomes will be measured during the run-in period
      and at week 6 of the intervention. To control for variation in microbiota an additional 10
      volunteers will serve as &quot;negative controls&quot; and not undergo any diet intervention.
