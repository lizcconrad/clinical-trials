      To determine the prevalence of sexual problems particularly premature ejaculation and
      erectile dysfunction among men working in factories of Dongguan city, using the self-rating

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, the floating population is a special group of people who work and live outside
      their hometowns and without residence cards of that area they reside. Sexual problems are
      common in floating population, majority of whom are in their sex active age. There is a lack
      of studies concerning these sexual problems, so we conduct this survey to investigate the
      sexual dysfunctions among men, especially the floating population, and to find out whether
      most of these sexual problems are related to their social lives, medical illnesses, and
      psychological status.
