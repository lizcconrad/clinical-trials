    <textblock>
      Sleep disorder is a common problem in menopausal women and the decrease in the sleep leads to
      poor daily activity. Traditional Chinese acupressure is a noninvasive, effective and safe
      technique that can be easily taught to menopausal women so that they apply it as a self-care
      method and a manager of sleep disruption. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate
      the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality of postmenopausal women.This double blind
      randomized clinical trial was performed on 120 qualified menopausal women at the age of 41-65
      years; and sleep quality was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI
      ).Participants were randomly assigned to an acupressure group, a sham acupressure group and a
      control group by two time randomized method (systematic and simple randomized). These
      interventions were carried out for 4 consecutive weeks. Participants in acupressure group and
      sham acupressure group learned to carry out acupressure technique as a self care at home with
      the simultaneous massage techniques that were to be performed 2 hours before sleep, whereas
      only conversation was used in the control group. The statistical software package for social
      science (SPSS) Version 17 was used for data analysis.
