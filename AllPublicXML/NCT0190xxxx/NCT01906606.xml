      The purpose of the current study involves the development, implementation and evaluation of a
      parenting program to target maternal well-being and child health, growth and development in
      Lira, Uganda. The current study aims to address maternal care within a parenting program as
      well as parenting practices emphasizing nutrition, hygiene, and psychosocial stimulation
      through peer-support, practice and problem-solving. Outcomes include child health, growth and
      development, maternal mental health, mother-child interactions, and maternal-spousal
      relations.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Children of parents who attend the parenting program will have better health, height and
           cognitive/language development at post-test, than children whose parents did not have
           the opportunity to attend parenting sessions.

        2. Parents who attend the parenting program will have more knowledge about child
           development and provide more home stimulation, dietary diversity and preventive health
           practices than parents who do not have the opportunity to attend parenting sessions.

        3. Mothers who attend the parenting program will have improved well-being compared to
           mothers who do not have the opportunity to attend parenting sessions.
