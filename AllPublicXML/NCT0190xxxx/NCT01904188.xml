  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to test the utility of the Gene-Z device as well as other rapid
      identification techniques that we have developed in the lab on clinically obtained bodily
      fluid samples taken from patients with suspected sepsis based on having three of four
      positive Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome markers, or having a known infection for
      which a specimen is being collected. Specimens will be collected by Sparrow Laboratories and
      McLaren Greater Lansing laboratories, processed and stored for analysis at a later date to
      determine if the microbial pathogens identified by current methods of culture, as well as
      pathogen susceptibility to antibiotics by culture results, can be identified by the GeneZ
      technology or other developed technology accurately, and more timely. It will not affect
      current patient care nor impact patient care, which will continue in the standard fashion
      today for sepsis. Results will be compared to standard culture results and antibiotic
      sensitivities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dramatic improvement in the timely and effective treatment of patients afflicted with sepsis
      can be achieved with the implementation of modern technologies for identification of
      offending microbial species and their innate genetic antibiotic treatment targets. Our
      collaborative team is planning to address this need using a Point-of-Care (POC) device
      equipped for identification of a bacterial species within 20 minutes of a routine Emergency
      Department laboratory blood draw or other specimen collection, followed by targeted analysis
      of its innate genetic antibiotic resistance elements within as little as 7 hours time. This
      revolutionary improvement in clinical management is critical for improving patient outcomes
      for a disease syndrome that is not only highly prevalent worldwide, consuming a massive
      amount of medical resources daily, but that only threatens to continue to worsen given
      current antibiotic stewardship practices. Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) is the standard
      by which medical interventions are now shaped across fields in the modern clinical setting,
      ranging from trauma and neurosurgery to cardiology and infectious disease. Rapid and accurate
      diagnoses, paired with aggressive and effective intervention, are manifest to stemming the
      disease process as well as maintaining economically feasible care and improving long-term
      morbidity. The effort to apply EGDT to patients at high risk for systemic infection, sepsis,
      was initiated over a decade ago by Rivers and colleagues in the Emergency Department setting.
      Systematic approaches to early sepsis identification and intervention including
      broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and adequate fluid volume resuscitation have yielded
      definite improvements in patient outcomes and health care resource utilization. It has been
      recognized that one of the limiting factors in treatment of sepsis in the hospital setting is
      the timeliness of pathogen identification and implementation of appropriate antimicrobial
      therapy. The current &quot;gold standard&quot; of sepsis microbial identification is blood culture,
      which takes 3-5 days for a definitive species identification. Antimicrobial agent
      susceptibility for the given organism is generally garnered within this same timeframe.
      However, in the period it takes from specimen collection to culture results, empiric
      broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, often involving multiple antibiotics, must be provided to
      ensure organism eradication. This proposal aims to use Point of Care (POC) testing, as
      described by our laboratory, to accurately identify pathogenic microorganisms in patients
      with suspected sepsis within 20 minutes of a laboratory blood draw or urine collection. The
      scope of our proposal is feasible in that 20 organisms account for 87% of microbial
      infections identified by culture-based techniques at Sparrow Hospital, representing the
      greater Lansing, Michigan area, and 50 microorganisms would account for virtually every
      microbial infectious species (Khalife, 2011, unpublished data). To date we have validated
      this approach with laboratory-processed samples of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
      aureus. POC testing will now be expanded to include additional microorganisms commonly
      encountered in sepsis patients. Secondarily, antimicrobial resistance genes will be scanned
      using a functional genomics approach with highly-parallel quantitative PCR as performed by
      our laboratory in a previous study exploring the microbiota of porcine gastrointestinal
      tract.
