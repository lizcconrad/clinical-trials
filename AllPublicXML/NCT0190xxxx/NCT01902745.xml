  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are over 2 million breast cancer survivors today. Persistent cancer-related fatigue
      (PCRF), a state of being tired or weary, is one of the most common and distressing symptoms
      experienced by breast cancer (BC) survivors. PCRF is associated with decreased quality of
      life, decreased sleep quality, depression, chronic pain and impaired cognition. Currently,
      there are few treatment options for PCRF and existing treatment options are associated with
      significant costs, are a considerable burden on the part of the patient, or have unacceptable
      side-effects. As such, there is a clear need to conduct studies evaluating the impact of
      safe, easy to implement and inexpensive treatments for PCRF in BC survivors.

      Individualized nutritional counseling has been found to be beneficial for decreasing fatigue
      and improving quality of life in cancer patients receiving treatment.However, there is a
      dearth of research examining the use of diet for treating fatigue in cancer survivors. Our
      preliminary data in 40 adult cancer survivors found that fatigue severity was associated with
      decreased intake of key food groups, e.g., green leafy vegetables, and nutrients, e.g.,
      omega-3 fatty acids, as reported in diet records. However, diet records are often not highly
      correlated with actual nutrient concentrations in the body and tend to capture short-term
      dietary habits not long-term patterns. The main objective of this research is to expand upon
      and confirm our cross-sectional preliminary data and to take advantage of a pilot clinical
      dietary study we are conducting by examining key nutrient differences in biological samples
      in the breast cancer survivors. By examining differences in biological samples we will be
      able to explore three key questions, which will directly influence our future interventional
      studies: (1) to determine if there are actual differences in concentrations of key nutrients
      in body tissue and which nutrients these are; (2) to assess if a dietary intervention focused
      on improving fatigue in BC survivors changes baseline levels of key nutrients; and (3) what
      is the effect size and variability of change in key nutrients in body tissue both at baseline
      and after a dietary intervention.

The BFI assesses the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on daily functioning in patients with fatigue due to cancer and cancer treatment.</description>

    <description>The FRD maintains a participant on a diet with their typical caloric intake and replaces some of their calories with the following foods on a daily basis; whole grains, vegetables (one leafy green, one tomato, and on yellow/orange), fruit (one high in vitamin C), fatty fish and nuts and/or seeds.
A social cognitive theory intervention method will take place that motivates the participant to change their behavior and lifestyle for overall well being.</description>

             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.) at least 1 year prior to enrollment except hormone
             therapy which must have been initiated at least three weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Apparently cancer-free

          -  Have a complaint of persistent, moderate to severe fatigue despite standard treatment
             [defined as â‰¥ 4 on the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)]

          -  Dietary eligibility requirements from a seven-day food record fruit and vegetable (FV)
             intake less than &lt;5.5 servings/day, not including potatoes and iceberg lettuce.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             eating disorders and high BMI values, above the midpoint of the obesity range, could
             indicate more prevalent health problems
