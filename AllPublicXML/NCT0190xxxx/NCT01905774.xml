    <textblock>
      Thalassemia Major patients developed Iron Overload due to blood transfusions and intestinal
      iron absorption. Renal function caused by Iron overload was studied in a previous study and
      shows principally tubular disfunction. In this previous study the Iron chelator used was
      Deferrioxamine. In the last five years an oral Iron chelator was introduced and approved by
      the FDA, Deferasirox, (Novartis, Switzerland and USA). The purpose of this study is to assess
      the renal function in Thalassemia Major patients treated with this new oral iron chelator and
      compare the results with our previous study.

      Patients with Thalassemia Major. The laboratory tests that will be studied are: Urine dip
      stick, Urea, Creatinine, Na, K, Uric Acid, Calcium, Phosphorus in serum and urine, and N
      acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase in Urine.Blood gases will be also taken in serum samples.

      The overall iron accumulation will also be calculated based in the amount of Packed Cells
      Units transfused. The total iron burden will also assessed by measurement of Transferrin
      saturation and Serum Ferritin.
