      Primary Objective:

      To compare the impact of switching from efavirenz (EFV) plus two nucleoside analogs to
      rategravir (RAL) plus two nucleoside analogs versus keeping the same antiretroviral regimen
      on hepatic steatosis (HS) as measured by the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) among
      HIV/HCV-coinfected patient.

      Secondary Trial Objective:

        1. To compare the proportion of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with one category decrease in
           the grade of HS between patients continuing with EFV plus two nucleoside analogs and
           those switching from EFV plus two nucleoside analogs to RAL plus two nucleoside analogs.

        2. To evaluate the proportion of patients who maintain viral control (HIV RNA &lt; 50
           copies/mL) after switching.

      Design:

      Open-label, randomized clinical trial to evaluate safety (phase IV)

      Condition:

      HIV and HCV coinfection.

      Intervention:

      Patients on current EFV plus two nucleoside analogs will be randomly assigned to switch EFV
      to RAL (400mg BID), maintaining nucleoside analogs unchanged, or to continue the current
      regimen.
