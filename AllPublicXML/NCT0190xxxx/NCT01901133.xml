  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety
      and tolerability of a single dose of MDV3100 in male subjects.

      The study will consist of two treatment arms. Arm A will assess the influence of mild hepatic
      impairment, and Arm B will assess the influence of moderate hepatic impairment. Data obtained
      from subjects with hepatic impairment will be compared to data from Body Mass Index (BMI) and
      age-matched subjects with normal hepatic function.
