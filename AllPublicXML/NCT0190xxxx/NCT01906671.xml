  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for 30 % of all childhood malignancies. The
      patients undergo four phases of treatment, finishing with a late maintenance phase in which
      6-mercaptopurine and Methotrexate are essential components. Insufficient treatment intensity
      in this phase is associated with increased risk of relapse. Excessive variation in the
      bioavailability of 6-mercaptopurine has been observed which can cause both risks of
      undertreatment/relapse as well as overtreatment with severe side effects.

      In the attempt to achieve individualized 6-mercaptopurine dosing different approaches have
      been pursued. Nonetheless variation in bioavailability remains a problem.

      Earlier, oral tablets of 50 mg (Purinethol) were the only administration form of
      6-mercaptopurine and it was primarily designed for adult patients. Challenges with accurate
      dosing and getting the children to swallow the tablets have been a widespread problem,
      forcing the caregivers to divide or crush the tablets as well as having to administer
      different dosages over 2-3 days. Due to these problems, an oral liquid formulation of
      6-mercaptopurine (Xaluprine) has been developed. However this oral liquid has only been
      tested on healthy adult volunteers, and not on the target group, childhood patients. This
      project will assess the bioavailability and plasma kinetics of oral liquid and tablet
      formulation of 6-mercaptopurine in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      The investigators hypothesize to observe comparable plasma kinetics, in children with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia when treated with 6-mercaptopurine in the form of a tablet and oral
      liquid formulation, as previously observed in healthy adults.
