      The investigators adopt Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation for weaning in tracheotomy
      patients innovatively. The investigators randomly allocate the subjects into two groups. One
      group is weaned by traditional strategy. The other one is weaned by Noninvasive Positive
      Pressure Ventilation by plugging the tracheotomy tube and deflating the cuff.

      The investigators adopt Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation for weaning in tracheotomy
      patients innovatively .If patients'conditions met our defined criterions, the investigators
      randomly allocate two groups. One group adopts traditional weaning strategy, the other adopts
      Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation. If patients' condition deteriorated in group two,
      the investigators turned them to invasive positive pressure ventilation, until patients
      adapted in a satisfactory condition, the investigators shift them into Noninvasive Positive
      Pressure Ventilation. The investigators will extubate the tracheotomy tube, if patients are
      received Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation more than 24 to 48 hours. After
      extubation, the investigators try to wean Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation.
      Successful wean is defined weaning mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours.
