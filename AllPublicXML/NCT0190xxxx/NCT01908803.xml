    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a single application of AL-60371/AL-817 Otic
      Suspension relative to ototopical CIPRODEX for sustained clinical cure, microbiological
      success, and time to cessation of otorrhea.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Sustained Clinical Cure at Day 3 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 post-treatment up to Day 8 or Early Exit</time_frame>
    <description>A sustained clinical cure at Day 3 was attained if otorrhea was absent at the Day 3 visit and continued to be absent through the last study visit (Day 8 or Early Exit). Proportion of subjects is reported as a percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Microbiological Success at the Day 8 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological success was attained if all pre-therapy bacteria were absent in the Day 8 specimen. In a subject with no otorrhea at Day 8, eradication of pre-therapy bacteria was presumed and the subject was considered a microbiological success.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time (in Days) to Cessation of Otorrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to event, up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Median time (in days) to the cessation of otorrhea (ie, otorrhea was absent) was calculated as the number of days from the Day 1 (Visit 1) to the absence of otorrhea in the affected ear(s) as recorded by the parent/guardian via the twice-daily diary. Cessation of otorrhea was defined as ending on the first day that otorrhea was absent from the affected ear(s) and remained absent for any/all subsequent diary entries.</description>

        <description>Median time (in days) to the cessation of otorrhea (ie, otorrhea was absent) was calculated as the number of days from the Day 1 (Visit 1) to the absence of otorrhea in the affected ear(s) as recorded by the parent/guardian via the twice-daily diary.
