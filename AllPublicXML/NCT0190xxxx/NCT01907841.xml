  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strenuous exercise or exercise involving eccentric muscle contractions can lead to muscle
      damage and changes in muscle function; this is known as exercise-induced muscle damage
      (EIMD). It is known that brief, repeated periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion, known
      as Ischemic Preconditioning (IPC) cause a delay in cell injury in cardiac muscle as well as
      in various other organs.

      Therefore the purpose of this study is to:

        1. Quantify the use of IPC in recovery following EIMD.

        2. Identify any effect of IPC during recovery on muscle function

    <time_frame>pre exercise, 24 hours post, 48 hours post and 72 hours post exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric MVC of the participants' dominant knee extensors was assessed using a strain gauge. MVCs were performed for 3 s with a 60 s rest between each repetition.
The change in MVC will be determined 24, 48 and 72 hours following pre exercise conditions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Creatine kinase</measure>
    <time_frame>pre exercise, 24 hours post, 48 hours post and 72 hours post exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma CK was determined from an earlobe capillary blood sample. The sample (10 microlitres) was analysed immediately using an semi-automated clinical chemistry analyser.
The change in CK will be determined 24, 48 and 72 hours following pre exercise conditions</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Limb girth</measure>
    <time_frame>pre exercise, 24 hours post, 48 hours post and 72 hours post exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Mid-thigh and calf circumference was assessed as a measure of limb swelling using an anthropometric tape measure. Both measures were obtained with the participant in a standing position.
The change in limb girth will be determined 24, 48 and 72 hours following pre exercise conditions</description>

    <measure>Chnage from baseline in Vertical jump</measure>
    <time_frame>pre exercise, 24 hours post, 48 hours post and 72 hours post exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical jump (VJ) performance was assessed using an electronic timing mat with hands placed on hips and participants dropping down to a self-selected level before jumping maximally.
The change in VJ will be determined 24, 48 and 72 hours following pre exercise conditions</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Muscle soreness</measure>
    <time_frame>pre exercise, 24 hours post, 48 hours post and 72 hours post exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle soreness - Participants were asked to perform and hold a squat (90Â° knee angle) whilst they rated their perceived muscle soreness on a 200 mm visual analogue scale. The scale consisted of a line from 0 mm (no pain) to 200 mm (unbearably painful).
The change in muscle soreness will be determined 24, 48 and 72 hours following pre exercise conditions</description>
