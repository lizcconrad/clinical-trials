      Background:

      - This research is being done to describe the types of bacteria found in the mouths of
      patients who have severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and are treated with drugs that suppress the
      immune system or with stem cell transplant. People with SAA who receive these treatments are
      more likely to get infections. Studies show that there might be a link between the bacteria
      in your mouth and those bacteria that can cause infections. The bacteria found in the mouths
      of patients with SAA will be described.

      Objectives:

      - To understand the changes in mouth bacteria that are related to treatment and to describe
      the oral bacterial environment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults at least 18 years of age who are going to be treated for SAA.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will answer questions about their medical history and dental care. Their
           mouths will be examined.

        -  Participants with SAA will be tested during treatment for their disease, over the course
           of 1 year. All participants with SAA will be tested at 3 scheduled appointments. Any
           participants who require a breathing tube will receive additional tests.

        -  Healthy volunteers will be tested during 1 visit.

        -  Participants will give two samples each time. A saliva sample will be taken with a
           disposable padded tool. Skin cells will be collected from the tongue with a small
           plastic brush.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mouth is a complex biological ecosystem normally containing over 700 different species of
      bacteria. Some of these bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm and occupy
      specific niches in this complex oral environment. Understanding the oral environment and the
      microbiota that inhabit it will assist in determining their impact on health and disease.
      There are several studies in critically ill patients demonstrating changes in oral bacteria
      related to acute illness. Identification of respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led
      researchers to hypothesize that a relationship exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary
      infections. Identification of potential pathogens in the oral cavity of patients with severe
      aplastic anemia could indicate a similar association between oral pathogens and infection in
      patient who develop respiratory infections that are severe enough to require intubation. This
      descriptive case-control study will characterize the oral microbiota of patients who have
      severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients will be followed for 1 year after treatment for
      development of respiratory symptoms that require intubation (cases). The cases will be
      compared to two groups of controls, namely those SAA patients who did not require intubation
      that received treatment for SAA and normal healthy volunteers who are age and gender matched.
      A difference in the oral microbiome will be identified in specimens collected before and
      after treatment and in those patients who require intubation.

      <textblock>
        -  All adult patients who are scheduled to receive treatment for SAA will be screened for
             this protocol. These patients will be recruited from the numerous protocols that are
             actively accepting new research participants at the Clinical Center, NIH.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Any adult patient (greater than or equal to18 years of age), diagnosed with SAA.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Any SAA patient found to have significant tooth loss from decay or is edentulous are
        excluded. This exclusion criteria will be assessed by the PI or her representative prior to
        signing the informed consent.
