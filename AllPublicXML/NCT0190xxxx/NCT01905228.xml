      The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose and
      recommended Phase 2 dose of CBL0137 when administered intravenously (IV) to patients with
      metastatic or unresectable advanced solid malignancies.

      Patients must have documented recurrent or refractory solid tumors; patients enrolled in the
      dose-expansion part of the trial must have least one lesion that may qualify as a target
      lesion based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Following the provision of signed informed consent,
      patients will be screened for entry into the study. Screening numbers will be assigned by the
      site. Patients who do not meet entry criteria will not have their screening data entered into
      the database.
