    <textblock>
      Diabetes self-management is important to help adults with type 2 diabetes achieve glucose
      control. Obstructive sleep apnea often co-exists with type 2 diabetes and may act as a
      barrier to diabetes self-management and glucose control. We will examine if treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), combined with
      diabetes education, results in improved diabetes self-management and glucose control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While diabetes self-management has been improved and refined over the last 30 years, many
      persons with T2DM continue to have difficulty in achieving glycemic goals. Obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) has a high prevalence among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and is associated
      with excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired mood, decreased vigilance, and reduced functional
      outcomes. The degree that OSA affects diabetes self-management, a known determinant of
      glycemic control, remains unstudied.

      The most effective treatment for OSA, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), results in
      improved self-reported daytime functioning. However, the effect of CPAP treatment on
      reception of diabetes education remains unknown. The underlying premise of the proposed study
      from this new investigator is that OSA hinders diabetes self-management in adults with T2DM.

      Our goal is to improve understanding of the effect of OSA on diabetes self-management and to
      determine the efficacy of CPAP treatment in improving diabetes outcomes in adults treated
      with CPAP compared to those on sham-CPAP. Expanding our understanding of the effect of sleep
      disturbances on diabetes self-management may lead to improved guidelines for screening and
      treatment of OSA in the increasingly large portion of the population with diabetes
