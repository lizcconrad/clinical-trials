  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans represent a particularly vulnerable subgroup of persons with hypertension,
      as they are more likely than Whites to have hypertension, equally as likely to be aware of it
      and to be treated for it, but less likely to achieve blood pressure control while receiving
      treatment. African Americans are also more likely than Whites to suffer end organ damage as a
      result of hypertension. Patients' hypertension self-management behaviors (including adherence
      to prescribed care, self-blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle changes, and shared medical
      decision-making) represent a cornerstone of hypertension therapy. Evidence suggests some
      African Americans with hypertension may experience difficulties carrying out positive
      self-management behaviors, in part due to cultural beliefs and practices, knowledge and
      perceptions regarding the nature and consequences hypertension, and lack of systems to
      support ongoing engagement in prescribed care within their communities. Substantial evidence
      has demonstrated the important role of family and community support in improving patients'
      management of a variety of chronic illnesses.

      The goal of this study is to rigorously test the effectiveness of hypertension
      self-management interventions that engage African American patients, their families, and
      their community-level resources to improve African American patients' blood pressure.

      We hypothesize patients' hypertension control rates may be improved when combining community
      health worker self-management support with other types of hypertension self-management skills
      training.

    <description>Hypertension control based on JNC-7 guidelines and changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure (BP) will be measured by trained and certified observers during regularly scheduled clinical visits at EBMC using an automatic oscillometric monitor (Omron HEM 907-XL). This device programs a five-minute delay before activation and has a 30-second delay between the triplicate measurements. We will use two measures — the average of all three measurements and the average of the last two measurements — obtained at each time point at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months follow-up.</description>
