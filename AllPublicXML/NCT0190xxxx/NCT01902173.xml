      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of Akt inhibitor GSK2141795
      when given together with dabrafenib and trametinib and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with stage IIIC-IV cancer. Akt inhibitor GSK2141795, dabrafenib, and trametinib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 with dabrafenib and trametinib may be a better treatment for cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of dabrafenib in combination with Akt inhibitor GSK2141795
      (GSK2141795) and select the optimal dose of GSK2141795 for the phase II portion in patients
      with BRAF mutant cancer. (This trial will not proceed to the Phase II study of dabrafenib and
      GSK2141795, but will move to an evaluation of triple therapy) (Phase I) II. To assess the
      safety of dabrafenib and trametinib and GSK2141795 in combination and select the optimal dose
      of the combination for the Phase II Portion in patients with BRAF mutant cancer. (Phase I)
      III. To evaluate the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial
      responses) in patients with BRAF^V600 mutant metastatic melanoma who have previously
      progressed on BRAF^V600 inhibitor-based therapy (BRAFi), or BRAFi + MEK inhibitor-based
      therapy (MEKi). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate overall survival and progression-free survival. II. To assess the toxicity
      profile of the recommended phase II dose. III. To assess response (complete and partial,
      confirmed and unconfirmed) of patients enrolled on each phase I portion).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy using
      available biopsies of lesions that progressed during prior BRAF inhibitor-based therapy.

      II. To explore potential drug-drug interactions between dabrafenib and GSK2141795 leading to
      changes in the expected exposure with either agent compared to prior experience. (Phase I)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 followed by a
      phase II study. Dose escalation of dabrafenib, trametinib, and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 will
      be initiated after completion of the dabrafenib + GSK2141795 phase I dose escalation.

      Dabrafenib and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Dabrafenib, trametinib, and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID,
      trametinib PO QD, and Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

             from an archival biopsy or a new biopsy after the patient has been registered to the
             protocol; since patients are referred to this protocol after progression on prior BRAF

             must have stage IIIC or stage IV disease

          -  Patients must have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (e.g. dabrafenib,
             vemurafenib) within 56 days prior to registration; prior trametinib therapy is
             permitted; patients are not required to interrupt BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy prior
             to the initiation of three agent combination therapy on study

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; all measurable lesions must be assessed (by
             physical examination, CT, or MRI scan) within 28 days prior to registration; tests to
             assess non-measurable disease must be performed within 42 days prior to registration;
             patients whose only measurable disease is within a previous radiation therapy port
             must demonstrate clearly progressive disease (in the opinion of the treating
             investigator) prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on
             the baseline tumor assessment form (RECIST 1.1)

          -  Patients must have Zubrod performance status =&lt; 2

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years; patients
             with history of RAS mutation-positive tumors are not eligible regardless of interval
             from the current study; Note: Prospective RAS testing is not required; however, if the
             results of previous RAS testing are known, they must be used in assessing eligibility
