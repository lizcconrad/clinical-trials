      This will be a randomized double blind study which will be conducted on patients admitted to
      Department of Hepatology from June 2013 to may 2014 at ILBS, New Delhi. Patients not having
      any exclusion criteria will undergo bone marrow examination and liver biopsy at the baseline.

      60 patients of decompensated cirrhosis will be randomised into two limbs- limb A (30
      patients) will receive G-CSF and erythropoietin while those on limb B (30 patients) will
      receive G-CSF alone. The drugs will be given for 2 months and patient will be followed for 1
      year. G-CSF will be given at a dose of 5 Âµg/kg s/c at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then every 3rd
      day till day 60 (total 22 doses). Erythropoietin will be given s/c at dose of 500 IU/Kg twice
      a week for 2 months.

      Follow up will be done on days 0,3,7,14,28, day 42 (6 weeks), day 60 (2 months), day 90 (3
      months), day 180 (6 months), day 270 (9 months); and day 360 (1 year).
