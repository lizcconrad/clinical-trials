  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective data collection is to track patients who are treated at HSS
      who are confirmed with knee osteoarthritis. The registry will collect prospective patient
      related and functional outcomes (including use of assistive devices), medication use and
      imaging data on patients with confirmed osteoarthritis, and the effect of different medical
      interventions that include PRP, Synvisc / Orthovisc /Euflexxa, bracing, suggested exercises,
      supplements, and diet. Information from the data collection will be used to compare outcomes
      of non-surgical alternatives with the end point being knee arthroplasty. The information
      results will enhance our knowledge of the long-term efficacy and effectiveness of
      non-surgical interventions intended to treat the progression of osteoarthritis.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Different non-surgical interventions such as PRP, Synvisc®, Orthrovisc®, Euflexxa,
           bracing, physical therapy, and a prescribed combination of exercise, diet, and
           supplements will demonstrate statistically significant differences in patient pain and
           functional outcomes compared to usual interventions including use of NSAIDs,
           corticosteroid injections, and use of assistive devices such as canes.

        -  Non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis will be associated with different
           rates of breakdown of articular cartilage and different rates of progression of
           osteoarthritis as evidenced by MRI or joint space narrowing on standing knee films?

        -  Education about available non-operative treatment methods may change time the end point
           of total or partial knee replacement for patients with knee osteoarthritis of varying
           severity.

        -  Different non-operative interventions will be associated with different times to total
           or partial knee arthroplasty in patient with knee osteoarthritis of similar severity.

        -  An electronic data capture system (EDC) for osteoarthritis patients will improve patient
           care and patient outcomes.

      Specific Aims:

        -  To ascertain the long term success of non-surgical interventions intended to alleviate
           symptoms or slow progression of osteoarthritis of the knee.

        -  To ascertain if non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis improve patient
           pain, function, and quality of life.

        -  To ascertain if non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis affect the breakdown
           of articular cartilage and slow progression of osteoarthritis as evidenced by MRI or
           joint space narrowing on standing knee films?

        -  To ascertain the amount of time between the initial entry into care at HSS and the end
           point of total or partial knee replacement for patients with knee osteoarthritis of
           varying severity.

        -  To ascertain if non-operative interventions for knee osteoarthritis prolong time to knee
           replacement surgery.

        -  To implement at electronic data capture system (EDC) for osteoarthritis patients which
           will store validated patient reported outcomes, physical findings, and imaging results.

    <description>Changes in MRI will be measured by a chance in the Whole-Organ MRI Scoring (WORMS) score of femur and tibia, and Outerbridge score for cartilage. The Boston Osteoarthritis Knee Study defined cartilage loss using the WORMS score as &quot;an increase in the score at any sub-region compared to baseline in any of the 14 subregions of the knee scored for cartilage in each knee.&quot; For patients who have only standing radiographs available a 0.7 mm loss of joint space will be considered a significant loss over 3 years. Bruyere et al predicted that &quot;the cut off for minimum JSN maximizing sensitivity and specificity for predicting future surgery was a change of 0.7 mm or more in minimum joint space width over a period of three years.&quot; Note: change is being assessed.</description>
