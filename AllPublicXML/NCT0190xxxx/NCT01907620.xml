      The aim of this study is to explore a mechanism that could potentially explain why women with
      a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia are described as having an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease later in life.

      If the hypothesis of this study turns out to be true, that is to say that women with
      pre-eclampsia have a higher level of oxidative stress than women with a normal pregnancy and
      that this difference persists after the delivery (6 months), a controlled randomized
      interventional study aiming to evaluate either therapeutic supplementation with antioxidant
      vitamins (Vit C and E) or modifications in diet could be envisaged.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have provided written informed consent

          -  Patients covered by a Health Insurance scheme

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Normal pregnancy

          -  or pre-eclampsia defined according to the following classical criteria: (i) de novo
             hypertension defined by arterial blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg (systolic) or at
             least 90 mm Hg (diastolic) confirmed by at least two measurements separated by at
             least 4-6 h, occurring after the 20th week of gestation in a women known beforehand to
             have a normal blood pressure, (ii) proteinuria defined by urinary excretion of at
             least 300 mg of protein per 24 h. If 24-hour urine is not available, proteinuria is
             defined as a concentration of urinary protein of 300 mg/L or more (or &gt;1 + on the
             urinary dip) in at least two samples of urine taken randomly, but at an interval of at
             least 4-6 h [7]. Pre-eclampsia is defined as severe if: persistent systolic BP &gt; 170
             mm Hg and/or diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg, and/or diuresis &lt; 30 ml/hour, and/or at least 2
             of the following signs (headache, phosphenes, epigastric pain or vomiting,
             pyramidal-type patellar reflexes, papilledema, hepatic pain, thrombopenia &lt; 100x106
             /l, ALT AST &gt; 70 UI/l and or hemolysis manifesting as haptoglobin &lt; 0.06 g/l, or a
             fall in LDH or the presence of schistocytes, the latter three signs define the HELLP
             syndrome) and/or seizures.

          -  Term&gt; 26 SA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal to provide consent

          -  Context of patent infection.

          -  Premature rupture of the fetal membranes.

          -  preexisting or gestational diabetes.

          -  Vasculoplacental diseases other than pre-eclampsia: placental abruption or infarction,
             intrauterine growth retardation of in utero fetal death not occurring in a context of
             pre-eclampsia.

          -  Chronic or gestational AHT not meeting the criteria for pre-eclampsia.

          -  Twin/multiple pregnancies
