  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are some adults with skeletal muscle weakness (called &quot;myopathy&quot;) and heart muscle
      weakness (called &quot;cardiomyopathy&quot;) who have low blood levels of a compound called carnitine
      as a cause of their problems. Carnitine is very important to energy production in muscles. In
      fact, there are reports of some people with carnitine deficiency who have developed myopathy
      and cardiomyopathy that was completely reversed with carnitine treatment. The main objective
      of our project is to determine the number of patients who have carnitine deficiency as a
      cause of their myopathy and cardiomyopathy. The investigators will be measuring carnitine
      levels in 1000 patients with cardiomyopathy and will describe the specific features in all
      the study patients to see if there are any trends that may help us predict which patients
      with muscle weakness are at risk of developing low carnitine levels. The investigators will
      be treating patients with low carnitine levels with carnitine and observing them to see if
      their cardiomyopathy and their muscle weakness improve. Knowing the exact percentage of
      myopathy and cardiomyopathy patients with carnitine deficiency may allow for screening of
      patients in a cheap and targeted way to treat the serious complication of this condition,
      including heart failure and sudden death.

      The primary objective of this research is to determine the prevalence of primary and
      secondary (genetic and acquired) carnitine deficiency in patients with limb girdle weakness
      and hypertrophic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy where an underlying cause is unknown.
      Identification and treatment with carnitine may potentially reverse or halt heart failure and
      skeletal muscle weakness in these patients.

      Specific aims:

        1. To ascertain the prevalence of primary and secondary carnitine deficiency in a
           population of adults with myopathy and hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy of
           unknown etiology

        2. To describe the demographic and phenotypic characteristics of patients with myopathy and
           dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who have primary and secondary carnitine
           deficiency

        3. To measure the motor and cardiovascular response to carnitine supplementation in
           patients with myopathy, cardiomyopathy and carnitine deficiency

    <description>An elevated BNP level is a marker of increased LV filling pressures and LV dysfunction and is highly correlated with severity of, and prognosis in, heart failure.
