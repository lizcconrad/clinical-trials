    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new procedure, called laser-assisted lamellar
      anterior keratoplasty (LALAK), can achieve the same level of vision with a lower risk of
      potential complications after surgery compared to another corneal transplant procedure. The
      current procedure is called Intralase-enabled keratoplasty (IEK) and replaces the entire
      cornea.

      The LALAK procedure involves transplanting only the top layers of the cornea instead of the
      entire cornea. Only one eye will have this experimental procedure performed. If both eyes
      need to have surgery your doctor will help you decide on the best non-study option for your
      other eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corneal transplantation (keratoplasty) is the most common organ transplant, with 42,606
      procedures in the U.S. in 2009. Many surgeons are moving away from full thickness corneal
      transplantation, also called penetrating keratoplasty (PK), because of risks involving
      rejection, irregular astigmatism and wound dehiscence. They are moving towards partial
      thickness (lamellar) transplantations of either the anterior or posterior (endothelial)
      layers, which can reduce these risks.

      The femtosecond laser has been used to create excellent tongue-in-groove junctions between
      the graft and host in full thickness PK.1 This technique, called IEK (Intralase-enabled
      keratoplasty), has now become a standard surgical procedure. The tongue-in-groove junction
      achieved at the circumferential edge of the graft and host leads to a continuous smooth
      anterior surface and strong wound healing.

      The new technique is called dovetail LALAK. In this technique, the femtosecond laser is used
      to create a 31% anterior lamellar graft with dove tailed side cuts. It is also used to create
      a shallow anterior lamellar dissection and beveled side cuts on the recipient cornea to match
      with the dovetail graft.

      In the new technique, the depth of the graft and donor dissections will be guided by OCT
      measurements. The proposed trial will test if the new technique can reproducibly achieve good
      visual outcomes without the risk of rejection. The outcome of the LALAK procedure will be
      compared to that of IEK.

    <description>A &quot;dovetail&quot; shaped cut will be made on the graft using a femtosecond laser at the eye bank. The cut depth will be proportional to the central stromal thickness of the graft. This graft will be separated from stromal bed by eye bank personnel for examination of the cut surface. High-quality graft will be replaced in preservation medium and shipped to the surgeon prior to surgery.
The host cornea will receive femtosecond laser cut consisting of a shallow lamellar cut with angled side cut to match the dovetail graft in a tongue-in-groove fashion. The femtosecond laser treatments will be performed under topical anesthesia in the laser suite. The femtosecond laser is an FDA-approved device for use in this indication (corneal transplantation including lamellar keratoplasty). A protective eye shield is placed over the eye. The graft will be sutured into the host bed.</description>

    <description>A full thickness graft will be prepared at the eye bank with zigzag side cuts prepared with a femtosecond laser. The graft is separated from the rim, replaced in the preservation medium, and shipped to the surgeon prior to the surgery.
In the laser suite, the host cornea will be cut with the femtosecond laser with zigzag side cuts leaving a 70-100 micron bridge. A protective eye shield is placed over the eye. The graft will be sutured into the host bed.</description>

The iFS is FDA-approved for corneal surgery including full thickness and lamellar keratoplasty. Eye banks use earlier versions of the Intralase system which are also FDA approved for this indication.</description>
