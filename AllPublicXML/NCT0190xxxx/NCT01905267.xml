    <intervention_name>Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention targets rumination and other maladaptive forms of emotion regulation such as suppression and avoidance and provides skills training in effective coping strategies. Mindfulness is a key component of this intervention as a strategy for disengaging from one's thoughts. Strategies from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), such as the use of effective interpersonal skills, are also included as methods for regulating strong emotion. Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy is a structured, manual based program designed to be delivered weekly over eight weeks. Sessions are 60-90 minutes in length.</description>
