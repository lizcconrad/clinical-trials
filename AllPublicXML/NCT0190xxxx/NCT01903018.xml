      A Multicenter, Phase II/III Study to Assess Radiation Induced Mucositis in Subjects with
      Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck Administered Cisplatin and
      Radiation with or without P276-00

      The Phase II component will be a single arm, open label, multicenter study to assess RIM in
      subjects with locally advanced SCCHN treated with P276-00 in combination with radiation
      therapy and cisplatin. `

      The Phase III component will be a randomized, assessor blinded, multicenter, two-arm study to
      compare the time to onset of WHO Grade ≥ 3 RIM in subjects with locally advanced SCCHN (OC,
      OP, HP, and L) who are receiving definitive CRT for treatment of their malignancy. Subjects
      receiving definitive CRT will receive weekly intravenous cisplatin administered during
      radiation.
