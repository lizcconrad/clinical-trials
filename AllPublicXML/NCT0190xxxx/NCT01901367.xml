      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies how well nutritional intervention and exercise
      intervention works in preventing metabolic syndrome in younger patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia. Nutritional intervention may help weight loss and improve quality of
      life in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Exercise may help decrease feelings of
      being tired caused by cancer, may help improve strength, and may help build up lost muscle
      tissue. Nutritional intervention plus exercise intervention may be effective at preventing
      metabolic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate feasibility, adherence, completion rates and participant satisfaction
      associated with a family based lifestyle intervention for overweight pediatric acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients or those at high risk to become so (body mass index
      [BMI] &gt;= 50th percentile).

      II. Assess changes in BMI z-score, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure
      exercise tolerance and physical activity at baseline, immediately post intervention and three
      months later.

      III. Assess changes in serum glucose, insulin, leptin and adiponectin in patients over the
      intervention course and at 3 months post intervention.

      IV. Assess changes in self-reported quality of life, physical activity, caloric intake, and
      fatigue associated with the nutrition and exercise program in the participant and their
      primary caregiver.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care individualized diet and exercise plan and monthly
      booster follow-up sessions from the nutritionist and exercise physiologist and weekly phone
      counseling with a trained health coach to address barriers to improve plan adherence.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care individualized diet and exercise plan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

          -  Diagnosis of pre-B cell or T cell ALL and in continuous first remission; at least 3
             months into maintenance therapy with at least 7 months remaining before therapy
             completion

          -  English speaking patient and primary caregiver

          -  BMI &gt;= 75th percentile at time of study enrollment; (patients &gt;= 75th percentile were
             selected as they were the group in our preliminary data that had a high risk of
             becoming overweight during maintenance therapy)

          -  Provision of informed consent by primary caregiver

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any physical or mental limitation that would prevent participation in study activities
             (Including but not limited to grade 4 neuropathy or inability to ambulate)

          -  As this is intended to be a family-based intervention, all family members will be
             invited to participate, including those living in more than one household, however
             endpoints will only be assessed formally in the patient and identified primary
             caregiver; siblings are not required for participation.
