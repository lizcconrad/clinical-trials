  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in combination with relaxation therapy is used
      to modulate the neural pathways contributing to the perception and distress of phantom
      sounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or
      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. One significant modulator of tinnitus is stress. Tinnitus
      has been shown to be generated in the brain, as a result of functional reorganization of
      auditory neural pathways and the central auditory system. Also non-auditory cortical areas of
      attention allocation and emotional processing was shown to be involved. Treatment remains
      difficult. The most effective treatment in chronic tinnitus is cognitive behavioral therapy
      including elements of relaxation therapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      is also effective in treatment of tinnitus with moderate effect size. Pilot data were
      positive for low-frequency rTMS applied to the temporoparietal areas and high-frequency rTMS
      applied to the left frontal cortex. Newer findings indicate that exercise-combined
      non-invasive brain stimulation might show superior effects in contrast to rTMS or exercise
      alone. Combination of relaxation and two-sided (frontal and temporo-parietal) rTMS will be
      examined with regard to feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy in patients suffering from
      chronic tinnitus in a pilot trial.
