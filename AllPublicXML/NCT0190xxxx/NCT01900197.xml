    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor and quality assure the efficacy and safety of
      Monofer® in a broad patient population when Monofer® is used according to the Monofer® label
      (SPC) in current practice and where standard routines are being followed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration of the study is approximately 21 months, which includes a 6 months
      enrolment period. The number of patient visits depends on the number of Monofer® treatment
      courses needed during the study period. Each patient can receive one or more treatment
      courses during 12 months after informed consent. The last blood test will be taken after the
      last Monofer® treatment course which might occur 13-15 months after Informed consent.
      Patients will only attend hospital visits planned as part of their standard treatment and
      they will receive treatment as a part of standard care and according to the doctor's
      discretion. Study termination will occur once the 12 months observational period has been
      completed for all patients and the last blood test has been collected from the last Monofer®
      treated patient in the study. Each treatment course can consist of one or more Monofer®
      administrations. For each administration of Monofer® either intravenous infusion or injection
      can be used. Pre- and post-treatment blood tests according to standard treatment are a part
      of the Monofer® treatment course.

      DATA COLLECTION:

        -  Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable standards and
           data cleaning procedures.

        -  The collected data will systematically be entered into an eCRF (MyEDC, Biostata). The
           source of information is the relevant laboratory results obtained from the patient
           record.

        -  The data will be evaluated by the Pharmacosmos A/S Medical Affairs team.

      Laboratory assessments, i.e. anemia work-up/treatment evaluation, shall be a part of local
      standard practice. The protocol does not accept any additional samples outside current local
      standard practice to be taken.
