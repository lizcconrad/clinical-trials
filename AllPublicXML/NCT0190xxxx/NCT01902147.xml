  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery following general anesthesia and surgery is a complex issue confounded by the type
      of surgery, surgical care, inflammation, different anesthetic drugs and techniques, patient
      co-morbidities, and differing patient and clinician perceptions of what constitutes good
      recovery. In this observational study, quality of recovery and patient satisfaction will be
      measured using the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS). This tool includes six
      domains of recovery: physiological, nociceptive (pain and nausea), emotive (anxiety and
      depression), functional recovery (return of activities of daily living), self-assessed
      recovery, and cognitive recovery.

    <description>The PQRS is completed prior to surgery to provide baseline values, and then repeated at different intervals: 15 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 and 3 days, and 4-8 weeks after the completion of surgery. Recovery is broadly defined as return to baseline or better.</description>
