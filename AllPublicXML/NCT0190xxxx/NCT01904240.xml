    <textblock>
      The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently unknown. Both environmental and genetic
      factors have been found to contribute to PD pathogenesis. The pathology of PD is distributed
      throughout the entire nervous system including the central, peripheral, and enteric nervous
      system. There is evidence that inflammation plays a major role in neurodegeneration in PD. In
      both the striatum and substantia nigra of PD patients activated microglia were found and
      proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1B, IL-6, iNOS) are increased in the CSF. An
      inflammation-driven animal model has emerged and has been widely accepted as a model of the
      disease based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neurotoxicity. LPS is an endotoxin found on
      the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and humans are exposed to LPS through the
      intestinal tract. The intestinal tract and thus the enteric nervous system serve as a conduit
      to the central nervous system. It has been posited that the inflammatory process could gain
      access to the lower brainstem via the vagal nerve and then ascend through the basal mid- and
      forebrain until it reaches the cerebral cortex, producing various pre-motor and motor
      symptoms of PD along the way. LPS may be one of the inflammatory triggers involved in this
      process. Systemic exposure to bacterial endotoxin can be determined by measuring plasma LPS
      binding protein (LBP). A study of 9 patients with early PD (median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2)
      and age matched controls found that the PD subjects had a significantly lower mean level of
      plasma LBP compared to control subjects. The aim of the research plan is to establish LBP as
      a potential biomarker for PD across a spectrum of disease severity.
