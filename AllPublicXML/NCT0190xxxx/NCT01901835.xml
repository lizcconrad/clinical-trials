    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies media diversion in improving quality of life in
      patients with recurrent gynecologic cancers receiving chemotherapy. Media diversion may
      improve mood and quality of life in patients having cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze the impact of a media-based intervention on patient mood during the receipt of
      chemotherapy for recurrent gynecologic cancers.

      OUTLINE: are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants are provided headphones and a tablet and choose among a selection of
      humorous movies. Upon the third course of chemotherapy, participants are provided a selection
      of non-humorous movies.

      ARM II: Participants are provided headphones and a tablet and choose among a selection of
      non-humorous movies. Upon the third course of chemotherapy, participants are provided a
      selection of humorous movies.

    <time_frame>Up to day 1 of course 3 of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Summarized in terms of means, standard deviations and ranges, stratified by group and assessment time point. Absolute and percentage changes from baseline within each group will be calculated and reported in terms of means and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Changes from baseline will be evaluated using a paired t-test. A Grizzle model for a 2 X 2 cross-over design will be used to compare changes in PANAS-X positive and negative affect scores between groups.</description>

    <description>Assessed with a Likert scale at the completion of the subject's participation to understand how the intervention may be improved should results of this study favor implementation into standard clinical procedure for future patients. Summarized in terms of medians and ranges, stratified by group and assessment time point. Changes from baseline within each group will be evaluated using a nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test</description>
