    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Aortic valve stenosis is a disease that makes a major heart valve get smaller. This reduces
      heart function and causes death. Severe aortic stenosis (AS) can be treated in a couple of
      ways, including replacing a heart valve.

      Objectives:

      Researchers want to study fibrosis in the heart. A sub-study will test whether heart function
      and blood supply improve after a valve replacement.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years old with aortic stenosis.

      Design:

        -  Participants will visit a clinic for 1 day for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their
           heart. This uses magnets, radio waves, and computers to produce detailed pictures of the
           heart.

        -  After this visit, participants will have their aortic valve procedure at the the
           Washington Hospital Center. A hospital team will contact participants for 1 year by
           phone or email. This follow-up will consist of 15 minutes of questions about the
           participant s health status.

        -  Some participants will join a sub-study.

        -  They will be given an additional medication to evaluate the blood supply of the heart.

        -  They will visit a clinic for 1 day for an MRI of their heart, as part of the main study,
           prior to the aortic valve replacement.

        -  After they have their valve replaced at the hospital, they will return to the clinic for
           another MRI.

        -  They will have the same follow-up as in the main study.

    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis is a disease that causes narrowing of a major heart valve, and that
      reduces heart function and causes death. The purpose of this protocol is to use magnetic
      resonance imaging of the heart to identify which patients would benefit from replacement of
      the diseased valve.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects must meet all the following inclusion criteria prior to enrollment into the trial:

          1. Severe aortic stenosis defined as aortic valve area of less than 1 cm(2) or index area
             of 0.6 cm(2)/m(2) by echocardiography.

          2. Symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis referred for medically indicated AVR

          3. LV EF less than or equal to 0.50

          4. Signed informed consent to participate in the study.

             Specific criteria for MR perfusion sub-study:

          5. Absence of any significant coronary lesions or presence of coronary disease for
             conservative (medical) therapy&lt;TAB&gt;.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Inability to sign written informed consent.
