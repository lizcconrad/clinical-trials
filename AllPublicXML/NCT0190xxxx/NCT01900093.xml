  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although ACTHAR gel is approved for the treatment of acute relapses, it is currently not
      widely used. Thus, we propose to conduct a small open-label proof-of-concept trial to
      evaluate the response to ACTHAR gel therapy in patients who have failed to make a
      satisfactory recovery after treatment with high dose IVMP. Documentation of the clinical
      course as well as any adverse events related to IVMP use will be made. The investigators
      propose to study the potential benefit of a 14-day course (the dose historically used since
      the landmark clinical trial of Rose et al1) of subcutaneous ACTHAR gel in 10 patients who
      have demonstrated inadequate improvement after a course of IVMP, 1000 mg daily, for 5
      treatments (over a maximum of 8 days). These would be patients for whom PLEX would be
      considered as a treatment possibility. The primary outcome measure will be improvement in the
      targeted neurological deficit, as measured on the appropriate functional system score (FSS)
      of the EDSS.

      This is an open-label, small, proof-of-concept study examining the safety, tolerability, and
      extent of recovery of a two-week course of subcutaneous Acthar Gel therapy in patients with
      MS relapse who have failed to make a satisfactory recovery after treatment with high dose
      methylprednisolone. Eligible patients will be given 80 units of Acthar for 14 days. Patients
      will be evaluated at baseline, at 1 week of Acthar treatment, at completion of Acthar
      treatment, and 1 week after completion of treatment. For those who do not undergo
      plasmapheresis an additional evaluation will be conducted 2 weeks after completion of
      treatment. Monitoring will include blood pressure determination and blood sugar
      determination.

          -  Sustained a significant MS exacerbation affecting vision, brainstem, motor, or
             cerebellar function AND were initially treated with a 5 day course of IVMP within 10
             days of the onset of symptoms.

          -  Failed to make adequate improvement and must initiate Acthar Gel therapy within two
             weeks (+/- 72 hours) after the first day of 5 treatments with 1000 mg IVMP, as judged
             by their treating neurologist.

             investigator.

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and date
