    <textblock>
      This study will investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-354 in up to 20
      male and female subjects, between 55 to 90 years of age with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease on stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose, multicenter study. Up
      to 20 male and female subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are taking
      stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors will be enrolled in this study. Within 28
      days prior to study drug administration, subjects will be screened based on National
      Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and
      Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for probable AD, Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE) and Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) scores, medical history,
      physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests and
      response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

      The study will be performed in two groups of 10 subjects each. In each group of 10 subjects,
      7 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ABT-354 and 3 subjects to receive matching
      placebo.
