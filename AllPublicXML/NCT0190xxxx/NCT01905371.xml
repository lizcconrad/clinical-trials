      This is an NIH Pilot Clinical Trial Grant designed to provide data to permit the rationale
      design of a subsequent efficacy study. The purpose of this project is to determine the
      potential benefit of amphetamine combined with physical therapy in enhancing motor recovery
      in patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation between 10 and 30 days after hemispheric
      ischemic stroke. The study hypotheses are: 1, The addition of treatment with d-amphetamine
      will result in at least a 12.6 point improvement in the Fugl-Meyer motor score 3 months after
      stroke. 2, There will be no clinically significant increase in the frequency of serious
      adverse events associated with treatment with d-amphetamine which would preclude further
      testing.

      The purpose of this Pilot Grant is to collect data critical for the design of a subsequent
      full-scale clinical trial testing the efficacy of treatment with amphetamine combined with
      physical therapy to facilitate poststroke motor recovery. When combined with task-relevant
      experience, a single dose of d amphetamine given 24 hr following a unilateral sensorimotor
      cortex ablation in the rat results in an enduring enhancement of motor recovery. This
      amphetamine effect extends to functional deficits that occur following focal lesions produced
      through a variety of mechanisms including ischemic brain injury, to lesions affecting other
      areas of the cortex, and to other behaviors. Laboratory studies not only show that certain
      drugs such as amphetamine may facilitate recovery, but that other classes of drugs may be
      harmful. Clinical studies suggest similar detrimental drug effects may occur in humans
      recovering from stroke. Three small studies of the impact of treatment with amphetamine on
      poststroke recovery have been carried out. Two found a beneficial effect and the third was
      negative. These studies differed in significant ways as reviewed in the referenced section of
      the proposal. The present study is designed based on these small studies. Using a
      multicenter, block-randomized, placebo-controlled design, this pilot study will:

        1. Refine the intervention strategy which has been developed for this Pilot Grant based on
           the best available laboratory and preliminary clinical data.

        2. Refine the target patient population.

        3. Gain information to permit an accurate sample size calculation (estimated for this pilot
           study) for a subsequent trial.

        4. Refine outcome measures, site monitoring techniques, data consistency protocols, and
           data management procedures.

        5. Obtain data to further support the safety of the proposed intervention.

      This study has several hypotheses.

        1. Patients treated with d-amphetamine combined with physical therapy will have improved
           recovery of motor function as compared to similar patients treated with placebo combined
           with physical therapy measured 90 days after hemispheric ischemic stroke.

        2. There will not be a clinically significant increase in the frequency of serious adverse
           events associated with treatment with d-amphetamine which would preclude further testing
           of these regimens.

      Secondary goals include:

        1. Refinement of the target patient population.

        2. Gain information to permit an accurate sample size calculation (estimated for this pilot
           study) for a subsequent trial.

        3. Refinement of outcome measures, site monitoring techniques, data consistency protocols,
           and data management procedures.

    <measure>Mean Change in Fugl-Meyer Score from Baseline to 90 days Poststroke</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer score was determined at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 90 days poststroke in order to assess voluntary movement in both the upper and lower limbs using an ordinal scale. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at each timepoint for each study arm.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Ambulation Speed Score from Baseline to 90 Days Poststroke</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulation speed was measured at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 90 days poststroke to indirectly measure gait quality. Walking speed was measured by using a standardized 10 meter walk test. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at each timepoint for each study arm.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Ambulation Endurance Score from Baseline to 90 days Poststroke</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulation endurance was determined at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 90 days poststroke to indirectly measure gait quality. The poorer the gait quality the more effortful it is and the more easily patients fatigue. Ambulation endurance was assessed using the standardized 6 minute walk test. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at each timepoint for each study arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score from Baseline to 90 days Poststroke</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT score was determined at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 90 days poststroke assess arm and hand function. It tests the ability to develop gross grasp and release of cubes and spheres of defined size and weight. Pincer grasp and opposition of thumb to 3rd and 4th fingers are tested by asking the patient to pick up a marble and a 0.24 inch diameter steel ball bearing. Functional wrist pronation-supination is tested by asking the patient to pour water from a standardized cup. More difficult finger prehension wrist rotation tasks involve picking up and placing metal cylinders over wooden pegs of matching size, and placing a washer over a metal bolt. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at each timepoint for each study arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in the Mobility Subscale of the Functional Independence Measure from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mobility subscale score was measured at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 90 days poststroke to assess the patient's ability to transfer to and from bed, chair, toilet, and tub. It also scores the patient's ability to walk and climb stairs. The mobility subscale score is computed from the more movement dependent portions of the FIM were assessed. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at each timepoint for each study arm.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in the NIH Stroke Scale Score from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH stroke scale score was measured at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 90 days poststroke to provide a measure of stroke impairment. Analysis of change scores for the various domains of the NIH Stroke Scale permitted the detection of possible carry-over effects. The mean change from baseline will be calculated at each timepoint for each study arm.</description>
