  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the annualized relapse rate (ARR) over a
      12-month period in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) who are treated
      with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) after suboptimal response to glatiramer acetate (GA). The
      secondary objectives of this study in this study population are to assess the impact of DMF
      over a 12-month period on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health economic-related
      outcomes and to evaluate additional clinical outcomes at Month 12.

    <description>SF-36 is a self-administered, generic health status questionnaire consisting of 36 questions that measure 8 health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MFIS-5 is a modified form of the Fatigue Impact Scale that consists of five questions that assess the impact of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, with five response levels ranging from 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Almost always&quot;). Total scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores representing a greater impact of fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MMAS-8 is a self-reporting tool to facilitate the identification of barriers to and behaviors associated with adherence to chronic medications. Scores on the MMAS-8 range from 0-8, with scores of less than 6 reflecting low adherence.</description>

        Prescribing Information, and who are suboptimal responders to glatiramer acetate (GA), as
        determined by the Prescribing Physician.

             (GA) or have initiated treatment with a new disease-modifying therapy since
             discontinuation of glatiramer acetate (GA).

          -  Are currently enrolled in any other clinical studies, with the exception of the
