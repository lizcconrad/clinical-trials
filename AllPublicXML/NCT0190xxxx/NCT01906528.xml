  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle relaxants are drugs providing muscle relaxation during surgical treatment. Previous
      studies have shown that males and females respond differently to this kind of drug. Our
      hypothesis is that males are more sensitive to the effect of Mivacurium (a muscle relaxant)
      than females, meaning that males need a lower blood concentration of the drug than females in
      order to obtain a given effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle relaxants are a type of drug used to provide muscle relaxation during induction of
      anesthesia and surgical treatment. Residual drug effect postoperatively (i.e. residual muscle
      relaxation) occurs frequently and studies have shown that this may be harmful in certain
      groups of patients. Of special concern is residual effect on upper airway and breathing
      muscles. A previous study has shown that males and females respond differently to the effect
      of this kind of drug. It appears that some muscle groups which are important for airway
      protection and breathing are more sensitive to the effect of muscle relaxants in males than
      females. Males may therefore be more susceptible to postoperative lung complications than
      females. In this study we try to determine what causes the observed sex-related difference in
      response to the muscle relaxant Mivacurium. We have previously shown that this sex-related
      difference cannot be explained by different pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug)
      in males and females. Our hypothesis is that a pharmacodynamic (what the drug does to the
      body) difference between sexes exists, i.e. that a lower blood concentration of Mivacurium is
      needed in males than females in order to obtain a predefined degree of muscle relaxation in
      certain muscle groups.
