  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation involved in mood disorders are factors of
      chronicity and severity. These mechanisms induce a phenomenon of accelerated cellular
      senescence and are reflected by alterations in systemic gene expression detectable in
      leukocytes in peripheral blood. The genetic markers of these mechanisms are clinically
      significant markers. The identification of new genetic markers will make it possible to
      improve evaluations of the severity and somatic consequences of depressive syndromes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who have given their written informed consent

             history of psychiatric disorders

          -  diagnosis of a first episode of a major depressive disorder

          -  diagnosis of a recurrent major depressive disorder (at least three episodes) with or

          -  the presence of a recent or older attempted suicide must lead to a careful clinical
             assessment of the diagnosis of depressive disorder and must be clearly mentioned in
             the case report form.

        Exclusion Criteria:
