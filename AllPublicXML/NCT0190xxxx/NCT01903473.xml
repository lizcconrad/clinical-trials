  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system has offensive and defensive capacities. In bone marrow transplantation,
      offensive cells in the donor grafts may attack host's organs, leading to a complication known
      as Graft versus Host Disease (GVDH). At present, patients receive steroid treatment to combat
      this tricky situation. Nevertheless, some patients do not respond to this therapy. Recently,
      it has been shown that immune system cells having defensive capacities can help in preventing
      the occurrence of a GVDH.

      This study aims to evaluate if these protective cells together with a non-standard
      immunosuppressor can improve the clinical condition and suppress the activity of the
      offensive cells in the graft.

      1. Collection and isolation of T regulatory cells will be carried out at the Laboratory of
           Cell and Gene Therapy (LTCG) at the University of Liege.

           The following laboratory analyses will be performed in the lymphocyte collection as well
           as start, intermediate and final fractions of the Treg selection:

             -  Nucleated cell count and differential on an automated cell counter;

             -  FACS analysis with determination of the % cells (on total WBC) with the markers:
                CD20-FITC, CD14-PE, CD15-PE, CD56-PE, CD45-VioBlue, CD8-APC, PropidiumIodid, T reg
                Detection Kit (CD4/CD25/CD127), and Treg Detection (CD4/CD25/Foxp3).

             -  Treg phenotype using the following markers: CD127, CD45RA, CCR4, CCR7 and KI67.

             -  Estimation of Treg function.

             -  Cell viability by trypan blue exclusion.

        2. Treg release

           The following criteria should be met for Treg release:

             -  ≥ 0.5 x106 cells/kg recipient;

             -  ≥ 55% CD4+FoxP3

        3. Treg injections: Treg will be administered fresh. A dose of ≥ 0.5 x106 cells/kg
           recipient Treg cells should be ideally administered.

        4. Patients Follow up

           4.1. Quality controls of Treg products: quality controls of Treg cells will include
           microscopy, nucleated cell count and differential, cell viability testing, microbiology
           testing (including standard virology, bacterial culture and detection of mycoplasmal
           enzymes by bioluminescence, endotoxin testing, karyotype and FACS analysis as stated
           above point 1)

           4.2. Toxicities of cell infusions: Potential toxicities associated with Treg infusions
           will be carefully monitored per the institution's standards and documented on the
           infusion report and/or the SAE report form. No dosage modifications are scheduled.

        5. Clinical data:

             -  Duration of hospitalization, infections, any other serious complication, death and
                survival will be recorded.

             -  Incidence, timing and severity of acute GVHD following Treg cells infusion (DTI),
                its treatment and outcome;

             -  Evolution of chronic GVHD, its treatment and outcome. More specifically, chronic
                GVHD (including current immunosuppressive therapy) will be assessed for each organ
                according to the NIH consensus at:

                  -  The day of inclusion (or the first day of rapamycin administration).

                  -  3 to 4 weeks after rapa onset (but before DTI).

                  -  1 week after DTI (DTI arm) or 4-5 weeks after rapamycin onset (control arm).

                  -  3 weeks after DTI (DTI arm) or 6-7 weeks after rapamycin onset (control arm).

                  -  3, 6 and 12 months after rapamycin onset.

             -  Incidence, timing and severity of secondary cytopenia, its treatment and outcome;

             -  Incidence, timing and severity of bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal infections

             -  Duration of hospitalization if any;

             -  Evolution of the primary malignant disease : response if not in CR at the time of
                inclusion, relapse, its treatment and outcome;

             -  Any other serious complication associated with the transplant procedure;

             -  Death and survival.
