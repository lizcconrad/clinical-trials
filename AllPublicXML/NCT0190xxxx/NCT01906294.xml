      This observation plan outlines the approach to build a diabetes registry to collect data on
      daily routine of treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

      The choice to establish such a (general and specific) disease patient registry was based on
      several scientific and practical considerations as described in the AHRQ user's guide:
      registries for evaluating patient outcomes (www.ahrq.gov, 2007). From a public health point
      of view, such a register should monitor naturalistic (i.e., unbiased) use of diabetes
      treatment in the community and should primarily guide and assist medical professionals to
      make optimal choices in combating diabetes. The primary focus of this registry is therefore
      to monitor the medical and lifestyle treatment of diabetes in order to enable comparison of
      different treatment options and to provide data for future discussions of optimal treatment.

    <description>The objective of the project is to develop a sustainable Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) registry to collect daily routine treatment data (e.g. diagnostics, kind and dosage of pharmacological diabetes treatment) to provide a better understanding of the disease specific epidemiology, treatment patterns, patient relevant outcomes, patient subgroups, specifically among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Further DDG (&quot;Deutsche Diabetes Gesellschaft&quot;) guideline adherence and economic aspects of diabetes treatment should be evaluated on the basis of this registry data.</description>
