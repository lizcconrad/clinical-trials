  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-427 in patients with advanced or
      refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. CUDC-427 is a drug that is designed to antagonize
      proteins that prevent or interfere with cell death. The study is designed to assess the
      safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer
      activity of CUDC-427.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of CUDC-427 as a single agent administered orally, in subjects with advanced and
      refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.

      Sequential dose escalation cohorts of oral CUDC-427 are planned. Subject enrollment and dose
      escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design. In the absence of intolerable
      toxicity, each subject will receive a minimum of 1 cycle (21 days) of study treatment, and
      may continue to receive additional cycles until disease progression has been documented or
      other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met.

      No intrasubject dose escalation will be allowed. During the dose escalation phase, up to 3
      additional subjects may be enrolled at previously cleared dose levels to better define the
      safety, tolerability and activity of the study treatment. Similarly, an MTD expansion cohort
      of up to 12 evaluable subjects may also be enrolled.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as
      assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03). A Safety Review
      Committee comprised of the Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and Sponsor
      representatives, will be convened to review safety information and to decide upon dose
      escalation and further subject enrollment.

      The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to the Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), or the Revised Response Criteria for
      Malignant Lymphoma as appropriate for each subject's tumor type.

      Exploratory biological markers of CUDC-427 activity will be assessed in tumor samples (where
      available), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma.
