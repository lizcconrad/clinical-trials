      Objectives: MAIN: To evaluate the parameters of microbial translocation after treatment with
      probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii) in HIV+ patients and its role on immune reconstitution
      and the changes in gut microbiota composition.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1) To analyze the progress of immune activity markers after the
      administration of probiotics. 2) To determine the improvement of CD4+ lymphocytes and HIV
      viral load in patients after taking probiotics.

      Methods: Design: A prospective randomized open controlled double-blinded trial, to be
      performed at a tertiary care hospital in Barcelona. Subjects: Chronic HIV infected patients.
      Sample size: 44 cases. They´ll be divided in 2 groups: (1) Patients with CD4 +&gt; 400 cells /
      ml and undetectable viral load for more than two years (22 cases) and (2) Patients with
      immunodiscordancy, defined as patients with CD4 + T cells lower than 350 cells / ml despite
      4-7 years of effective antiretroviral therapy. (22 cases). Intervention: Patients were
      randomized in 2 subgroups: (A) they´ll receive daily oral supplementation with S. boulardii
      for 3 months and (B) they ´ll receive placebo. Variables: bacterial lipopolisaccharide levels
      measured by the Lipid-Binding protein (LBP), parameters of immune activation in plasma
      (soluble CD14, IFN-Υ, TNF-Alpha, IL (interleukine)-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12)and gut microbiota
      composition prior to the use of probiotics (baseline), at 3 and 6 months. Immunological and
      clinical data. Outcome measures: quantification of bacterial translocation levels, markers of
      activity and immune recovery. Analysis: Comparison of variables before and after the
      intervention. The analysis will be performed by biological and immunological effectiveness.
