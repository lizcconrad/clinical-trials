  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the combination of AMG 386 and docetaxel for the
      treatment of advanced urothelial cancer. Subjects are being asked to be in this research
      study because they have advanced urothelial cancer which has progressed after treatment with
      a platinum-based therapy.

      The hypothesis is that AMG 386 will increase the historical response rate of docetaxel as a
      single agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMG 386 is a medication made to stop the growth of blood vessels in cancer tissues. Cancer
      relies on new blood vessels to bring it oxygen and nutrients to grow. Docetaxel is currently
      approved by the FDA for advanced urothelial, hormone-refractory prostate, breast, non-small
      cell lung, gastric, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
