  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple-dose
      administrations of aripiprazole intramuscular (IM) depot in the deltoid muscle in adult
      subjects with schizophrenia. The trial consists of a 113 day treatment period with a 28 day
      followup. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 18 and 64 years
      (inclusive), with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by DSM-IV-TR criteria and a
      prior history of tolerating aripiprazole per investigator's judgement.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were recorded from the time the informed consent was signed until follow-up for 28 days after last</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a participant while enrolled in the trial, whether or not it was considered drug related by the investigator. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death or was life threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE that started after start of study medication or an AE that continued from baseline and that worsened, was serious, was study medication related, or resulted in death, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of study medication.</description>

    <measure>Mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score for Rating of Pain at the Injection Site.</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 113</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the pain associated with injection of aripiprazole IM using the VAS instrument. This was done approximately 30 minutes pre-dose and 1 hour (±15 min) Post-dose on Days 1, 29, 57, 85 and 113. For the first injection, the pre-dose assessment was of the current injection site. For the injections 2 through 5, the pre-dose assessment was of the prior injection site. Investigator's Assessment of Most Recent Injection Site including pain, swelling, redness, and induration were reported in 4-point categorical scale (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe) by first injection site at each injection.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Suicidal Ideation Intensity Total Score Via Columbia-suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 141)</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidality was monitored throughout the trial using C-SSRS. The C-SSRS addresses the need for standardized classification of suicide reports to assess suicide risk. This scale consisted of Baseline evaluation that assessed the lifetime experience of the participant with suicidal events and suicidal ideation and a post baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last trial visit. The C-SSRS since last visit form were completed on Day 1 pre-dose and prior to dosing on Days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141/ Early Termination(ET) and prior to pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling on Days 8, 15, 22, 120, 127 and 134. The suicidal ideation intensity total score was the sum of suicidal ideation severity rating scores for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation. For each item, each participant got an intensity score from 0(none) to 5(worst). Therefore,the suicidal ideation intensity total score range from 0 to 25, with a score of 0 given for no suicidal ideation.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline Measured by EPS by Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS assessment consisted of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) were observed unobtrusively while the participant was at rest (e.g., in the waiting room), and the study physician would make global judgments on the participant's dyskinesia's (items 8 through 10). These items are rated on a five-point scale of severity from 0-4. The scale is rated from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). Overall AIMS scores range from 0 to 42.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline Measured by EPS by Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The BARS consisted of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by the study physician, subjective feelings of restlessness by the participant, participant distress due to akathisia, and global evaluation of akathisia. To complete this scale, participants were observed while they were seated and then stood for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena were to be elicited by direct questioning. The first 3 items were rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of 0 = absence of symptoms and a score of 3 = severe condition. The global clinical evaluation were made on a 6-point scale, (0=absent, 1=questionable, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Suicidal Ideation Intensity Total Score Via Columbia-suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).</title>
        <description>Suicidality was monitored throughout the trial using C-SSRS. The C-SSRS addresses the need for standardized classification of suicide reports to assess suicide risk. This scale consisted of Baseline evaluation that assessed the lifetime experience of the participant with suicidal events and suicidal ideation and a post baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last trial visit. The C-SSRS since last visit form were completed on Day 1 pre-dose and prior to dosing on Days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141/ Early Termination(ET) and prior to pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling on Days 8, 15, 22, 120, 127 and 134. The suicidal ideation intensity total score was the sum of suicidal ideation severity rating scores for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation. For each item, each participant got an intensity score from 0(none) to 5(worst). Therefore,the suicidal ideation intensity total score range from 0 to 25, with a score of 0 given for no suicidal ideation.</description>

The C-SSRS since last visit form were completed on Day 1 pre-dose and prior to dosing on Days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141/ Early Termination(ET) and prior to pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling on Days 8, 15, 22, 120, 127 and 134. The suicidal ideation intensity total score was the sum of suicidal ideation severity rating scores for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation. For each item, each participant got an intensity score from 0(none) to 5(worst). Therefore,the suicidal ideation intensity total score range from 0 to 25, with a score of 0 given for no suicidal ideation.</description>
          <population>The safety sample included all randomized participants who were administered at least one dose of study medication, regardless of any protocol violation. In LOCF dataset, missing data at a post-baseline visit were imputed with the value obtained at the nearest preceding visit.</population>

Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) were observed unobtrusively while the participant was at rest (e.g., in the waiting room), and the study physician would make global judgments on the participant's dyskinesia's (items 8 through 10). These items are rated on a five-point scale of severity from 0–4. The scale is rated from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe).

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline Measured by EPS by Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS).</title>
        <description>The BARS consisted of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by the study physician, subjective feelings of restlessness by the participant, participant distress due to akathisia, and global evaluation of akathisia. To complete this scale, participants were observed while they were seated and then stood for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena were to be elicited by direct questioning. The first 3 items were rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of 0 = absence of symptoms and a score of 3 = severe condition. The global clinical evaluation were made on a 6-point scale, (0=absent, 1=questionable, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 20</time_frame>
        <population>The safety sample included all randomized participants who were administered at least one dose of study medication, regardless of any protocol violation. In LOCF dataset, missing data at a post-baseline visit were imputed with the value obtained at the nearest preceding visit.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Score of Subject Well-being Under Neuroleptic Treatment-Short Form (SWN-S).</title>
        <description>The participant's feeling of their own well-being was assessed using the 20 question SWN-S. The SWN-S was a validated self-report instrument that evaluated the participant's perception of 1 being while receiving antipsychotic medication. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items and 5 subscales (mental functioning, social integration, emotional regulation, physical functioning, self-control) whose items followed in random order. For items marked with a '+', response choices and scoring were as follows: not at all = 1, hardly at all = 2, a little = 3, somewhat = 4, much = 5, very much = 6. For items marked with a '-', the scoring was reversed; response choices and scoring were as follows: not at all = 6, hardly at all = 5, a little = 4, somewhat = 3, much = 2, very much = 1. The total score from the scale ranges from 20 (bad subjective experience) to 120 (perfect subjective experience).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Physical Functioning Score of SWN-S.</title>
        <description>The participant's feeling of their own well-being was assessed using the 20 question SWN-S. The SWN-S was a validated self-report instrument that evaluated the participant's perception of 1 being while receiving antipsychotic medication. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items and 5 subscales (mental functioning, social integration, emotional regulation, physical functioning, self-control) whose items followed in random order. For items marked with a '+', response choices and scoring were as follows: not at all = 1, hardly at all = 2, a little = 3, somewhat = 4, much = 5, very much = 6. For items marked with a '-', the scoring was reversed; response choices and scoring were as follows: not at all = 6, hardly at all = 5, a little = 4, somewhat = 3, much = 2, very much = 1. SWN-S subscale score's each item was rated on a score of 0 (none) to 6 (severe), with higher scores indicating stronger subjective feelings of deficit.</description>
