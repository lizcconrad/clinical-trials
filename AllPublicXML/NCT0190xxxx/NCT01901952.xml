      The primary aim of the LIFE study is to compare low-income African American diabetes patients
      in a lifestyle intervention group with those in a standard of care control group on change in
      glycemic control at 12-months. We hypothesize that, on average, participants in the
      intervention group will achieve greater glycemic control at 12-months relative to their
      baseline A1c, than those in the control group.

      This project is a randomized controlled trial to test an innovative lifestyle intervention to
      achieve sustained improvements in glycemic control among low-income African American diabetes
      patients. The LIFE (Lifestyle Improvement through Food and Exercise) program is a diabetes
      self-management program focused on diet and exercise, informed by anthropological research on
      models of food and health among low-income African-Americans. Pilot work demonstrated that
      the LIFE Program is effective in improving glycemic control among low-income African
      Americans at 6-months. The main goal of the current study is to determine whether the LIFE
      Program can achieve sustained improvements in glycemic control for 12 months. The trial will
      randomize low-income African American adults with diabetes to a control group, which receives
      standard diabetes education, or an intervention group, which receives the LIFE Program (28
      group meetings with peer support telephone calls) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase
      (quarterly group sessions with monthly peer support phone calls). The primary aim of the
      proposed research is to compare low-income African American diabetes patients receiving the
      LIFE Program with those in a standard of care control group on change in glycemic control at
      12 months. Our primary hypothesis is that patients in the intervention group will achieve a
      change in A1c from baseline that is less than patients in the control group. Secondary aims
      are to compare low-income African American diabetes patients receiving the LIFE Program with
      those in a standard of care control group on (a) change in glycemic control at 18 months; (b)
      change in physical activity and total energy intake at 12 months; (c) change in physical
      activity and total energy intake at 18 months; and (d) to obtain estimates needed for a
      subsequent trial, including weight, blood pressure, and diabetes-related hospitalizations.
      For secondary aims we hypothesize that a) the intervention group will achieve a mean 18-month
      change in A1C that is less than the change in the control group; b) at 12 months, a greater
      proportion of intervention patients will have achieved the activity goal of 150 minutes of
      moderate activity per week, and the intervention group will achieve a greater reduction from
      baseline in mean total energy intake than the control group; and c) at 18 months, a greater
      proportion of intervention patients will have achieved the activity goal of 150 minutes of
      moderate activity per week, and the intervention group will achieve a greater reduction from
      baseline in mean total energy intake than the control group.
