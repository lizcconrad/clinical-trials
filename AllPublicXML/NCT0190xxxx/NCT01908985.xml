      Monocentric prospective study conducted in two phases evaluating the secretion and
      elimination of aqueous humor by fluorophotometry in patients with glaucoma treated with
      cyclo-coagulation with ultrasound.

      Population selected:

      - Patients with refractory open angle glaucoma despite previous treatments currently
      validated for glaucoma.

      The purpose of our study is:

      - To evaluate the mechanism of action of glaucoma treatment by cyclo-coagulation with high
      intensity focused ultrasound in studying the secretion and elimination of aqueous humor by
      fluorophotometry.

      Planning:

        -  First phase: 2 patients (feasibility study) If reduction of at least 10% of the flow of
           aqueous humor production at one month in the first two patients in the feasibility
           study, further in second phase.

        -  Second phase: 6 patients

      Main outcome criteria:

      Reduction of aqueous humor flow at 6 months compared with the pretreatment of aqueous humor
      flow.

          -  IOP&gt; 21 mm Hg and &lt;32 mm Hg with an optimal treatment.

          -  Lack of history of cyclo-destruction of the ciliary body (laser diode, cold ...)

          -  Lack of intraocular surgery or laser therapy in the eye seen in the three months
             preceding the date of HIFU treatment.

          -  Male or female age (s) of at least 18 and able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of glaucoma by placing a drainage implant (valves, pipes ...)

          -  previous refractive procedures preventing accurate measurement of intraocular pressure
             (PRK, LASIK)

          -  General treatment which may alter IOP began in the month before the HIFU procedure

             child

          -  Participation in another clinical investigation of a medical or surgical treatment can
