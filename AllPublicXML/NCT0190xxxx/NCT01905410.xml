  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VVZ-149 is a novel analgesic drug candidate that shows a potential analgesic activity
      inhibiting GlyT2 and 5HT2A simultaneously. There have been many efforts to develop
      single-target selective drugs to treat pain, but usually unsuccessful due to the lack of
      efficacy or limitations of single-target approach for new drug discovery. VVZ-149 is expected
      to have a dual-target activity, demonstrated having a synergism between GlyT2 and 5HT2A
      antagonistic activities to maximize an antinociceptive effect in the in vivo animal models.
      Now the investigators are developing VVZ-149 as an IV injection to treat post-operative pain.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      properties of VVZ-149 injection with placebo in healthy male volunteers. This Phase 1 study
      consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single and multiple ascending
      dose (SAD &amp; MAD) escalation clinical trials.

      In this clinical study, the investigational drug product will be offered as an injectable
      form in a transparent glass vial that contains VVZ-149 dissolved by water for injection. When
      administered, the drug will be diluted by normal saline and will be given by intravenous
      infusion for 4 hours.

      SAD study is planned that maximal 7 cohorts of healthy male subjects are administrated single
      dose of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The planned groups for dose escalations were 0.25, 0.5,
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg groups. As a pilot study for safety in this first-in-human study,
      only 3 subjects received active drug are allocated to first two groups each, without subjects
      for placebo. For the following groups, 6 subjects for active drug and 2 for placebos are
      allocated after randomized.

      MAD study is planned that 2 cohorts of 10 healthy male subjects each were administered
      multiple doses of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The final doses of VVZ-149 injection will be
      determined later based on the results of SAD study. In each group, 7 subjects for active drug
      and 3 for placebos are allocated after randomized
