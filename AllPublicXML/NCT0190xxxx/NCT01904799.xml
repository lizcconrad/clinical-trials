      After a CVA, all of the cognitive functions can be affected and analysed, but the presence of
      a language disorder may considerably hamper the evaluation of other functions.

      The battery of rapid tests to screen for and quantify cognitive disorders, including the
      MMSE, the MOCA, the R-CAMCOG or the RBANS, are not suitable for aphasic patients because they
      contain items with a strictly verbal response. Because of this, inexperienced doctors cannot
      evaluate higher functions (other than language) of aphasics in routine practice. For the same
      reason, aphasics are regularly excluded from post-cva therapeutic protocols, whether or not
      the trial bears on the evolution of cognitive functions.

      Nonetheless, it is possible to evaluate, at least roughly, all of the cognitive functions
      without resorting to language.

      The investigator have developed , from validated tests and classical clinical manoeuvers, the
      Cognitive Assessment for Stroke Patients (CASP) :

        -  for the rapid screening (less than 15 minutes) and quantification of post-cva cognitive
           disorders (6 functions: language, apraxia, short-term memory, temporal orientation,
           impaired spatial/visio-construction and executive functions);

        -  the CASP can be used in most patients, including those with severe disorders of
           expression and moderate problems with comprehension, The format of these tests has been
           adapted so that severe disorders of expression (essentially left-hemisphere CVA), and
           left spatial impairment (right-hemisphere CVA) do not affect the ability to take the
           test. Its validity in terms of appearance and content were verified in 2011.
