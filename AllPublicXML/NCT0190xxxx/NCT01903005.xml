  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess safety, efficacy, and treatment retention following
      extended treatment with OX219, a higher-bioavailability buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX)
      sublingual tablet formulation in opioid-dependent patients who completed 1 of 2 primary
      efficacy and safety studies of OX219.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, single-arm, 24-week, extension study to
      assess safety, efficacy, and treatment retention during maintenance treatment.

      Eligible patients had completed 1 of 2 primary efficacy and safety studies of the
      higher-bioavailability BNX sublingual tablet formulation (primary study OX219-006
      [NCT01908842] or OX219-007 [NCT01848054]). The total duration of study treatment was 24
      weeks.

             or OX219-007 study and continue to use it for the OX219-008 study. Females who are not
             of child-bearing potential who are either surgically sterile (by hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or tubal ligation), or

             become pregnant during the study.

          -  Participants who are unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the
             protocol (eg, pending incarceration) or are in a situation or condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may interfere with participation in the study.

          -  Participants who are participating in any other clinical study in which medication(s)
             are being delivered or who had used an investigational drug or device within the last

          -  Participants with any known allergy or sensitivity or intolerance to buprenorphine,
             naloxone, or any related drug, or history of any drug hypersensitivity or intolerance
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject
             or the study.

          -  Participant with a contra-indicated serious medical condition.

          -  Participants who are at suicidal risk as determined by any of the following: a history
             of suicidal ideation ≤ 3 months prior to baseline with a score of 4 (intent to act) or
