  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      study medication) and safety of subcutaneously (under the skin) administered golimumab in
      pediatric participants (aged 2 to 17 years) with moderately to severely active Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both [participants and investigator] know what treatment participants
      will receive) and multicenter study. The study is divided into 2 parts: Part 1:
      pharmacokinetics portion (Week 0 to Week 14); Part 2: study extension (Week 14 to Week 114).
      The focus of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of golimumab.
      Additionally the efficacy of short-term therapy with golimumab will be evaluated.
      Participants in clinical response at Week 6 will continue to receive open label golimumab
      maintenance therapy and will enter the study extension at Week 14. Participants who are not
      in clinical response at Week 6 will be withdrawn from further treatment with golimumab. At
      Week 114, participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may benefit from continued
      treatment will be eligible to continue to receive golimumab every 4 weeks until marketing
      authorization is obtained in the treatment of pediatric UC in that country, or until a
      decision has been made not to pursue an indication in pediatric UC. Approximately 30
      participants will be enrolled in this study. The total duration of study participation for a
      participant will be approximately 126 weeks or longer.

    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by greater than or equal to 30 percent and greater than or equal to 3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore of 1 or more or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe. Higher scores indicate worsening of the disease.</description>

    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score less than or equal to 2 points, with no individual subscore greater than 1. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), rated as 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). Total score is calculated as the sum of 4 subscores and values range from 0 to 12 scores, where 3 to 5 = mild; 6 to 10 = moderate; and 11 to 12 = severe. Higher scores indicate worsening of the disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a score less than 10 and it will be measured by the PUCAI scores, a noninvasive measure of ulcerative colitis disease activity. The PUCAI score consists of 6 scales (abdominal pain [points 0 to 10], rectal bleeding [points 0 to 30], stool consistency [points 0 to 10], number of stools [points 0 to 15], nocturnal bowel movement [points 0 to 10], and activity level [points 0 to 10]). The total score ranges from 0 and 85 points, where it is calculated as the sum of the 6 scales and decrease of 20 points is considered a minimally clinically important change. Higher scores indicates a more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Golimumab will be administered subcutaneously. For participants weighing less than 45 kg, the dose of golimumab at Week 0 will be 90 mg/m2 (up to 200 mg) and 45 mg/m2 (up to 100 mg) at Weeks 2, 6, and 10. For participants weighing 45 kg or more, the dose of golimumab at Week 0 will be 200 mg and 100 mg at Weeks 2, 6, and 10. From Week 14, the dose of golimumab will be 45 mg/m2 and 100 mg, every 4 weeks for participants weighing less than 45 kg and 45 kg or more, respectively. From Week 18, participants weighing 45 kg or more have the option to administer golimumab at home after being properly trained. At Week 14 or at any time after, the participants have the option to decrease their dose of golimumab to 50 mg (weighing 45 kg or more) or 22.5 mg/square meter (less than 45 kg) at the discretion of the investigator. A single dose increase back to 100 mg or 45 mg/m2 is permitted based on the investigator's assessment of an increase in a participant's ulcerative colitis disease activity.</description>
