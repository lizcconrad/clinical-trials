    <textblock>
      An randomized clinical trial to investigate whether among adult borderline patients (18 - 40
      year), intensified inpatient short term (12 weeks) inpatient Dialectical Behavior Therapy
      (DBT) is more effective in declining the proportion of patients that show
      suicidal/self-harming behavior in the first 3 months of treatment, compared to standard
      outpatient DBT, and whether this difference between the groups is sustained at 6 and 12
      months.

      Objective: Goal is to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a short term intensive DBT
      treatment program (12 weeks) versus outpatient DBT, in terms of reduction of suicidal and/or
      self-harming behavior, and of general BPD symptomatology severity.

      Study design: A randomized trial, analyzed by a intention-to-treat (ITT) approach, with two
      parallel groups: a) intensified adapted DBT program (12 weeks inpatient program, plus six
      months standard outpatient DBT, n=36); b) standard outpatient DBT for 12 months (n=36).

      Study population: All borderline patients (18-40 years), who will be admitted from January
      2013 till June 2014 for treatment in the Jelgersma Treatment Centre, or the outpatient DBT
      programs of Rivierduinen, who: (1) receive a diagnosis of BPD, (2) have shown suicidal and/or
      self-harming behavior in the year preceding the admission/ start of DBT treatment, including
      the last month preceding baseline measurement, and (3) show a severe level of borderline
      symptomatology (&gt; 24 on the BPDSI).

      Intervention:

      All patients receive DBT according to the basic DBT treatment protocol. Treatment integrity
      is established by supervision in both groups.

      Outcome measures Main study parameter is the number of suicide attempts/self-harming acts
      (the Life Time Parasuicide Count and the Parasuicide Scale of the Borderline Personality
      Severity Index). Second study parameter is the severity of borderline symptomatology (BPDSI).
      Quality of life as measured on the SF-36, and the EQ-5D and psychopathological symptoms (BSI)
      will also be taken into account. The cost-effectiveness of the inpatient program compared to
      the outpatient program will be examined (TiC-P).

      Sample size. The researchers expect that after 12 weeks of treatment, 20% of the patients of
      the intervention group still show suicidal and/or self-harming behavior compared to 60% of
      the patients in the control condition, and that this difference sustains after 24 weeks and
      will be gradually reduced between 24 and 52 weeks by the additional reduction in suicidal
      and/or self-harming behavior in the control group. To be able to detect a difference of 40%
      after 12 weeks, with a power of 0.80 and α = 0.05, 36 patients per experimental condition are
      required. The researchers expect to recruit about 150 patients, which guarantees enough
      power, even with a 20% drop out rate.

    <description>The Lifetime Parasuicide Count (LPC: Comtois &amp; Linehan, 1999), obtains information about the frequency and subsequent medical treatment of self-mutilating behaviors (e.g. cutting, burning and pricking). Duration of the interview depends on how frequent and how much self-destructive behavior has been shown. Patients report that they feel that their problems are taken seriously because of the interview.
The Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI: (Giessen-Bloo et al., 2010) is a semi-structured interview assessing the frequency of borderline symptoms in the previous 3-month period. The BPDSI consists of nine sections, one for each of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder. The parasuicide section includes three items reflecting distinct suicidal behaviors (suicide threats, preparations for suicide attempts, and actual suicide attempts).</description>

    <description>The Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI: (Giessen-Bloo et al., 2010) is a semi-structured interview assessing the frequency of borderline symptoms in the previous 3-month period. The BPDSI consists of nine sections, one for each of the criteria for borderline personality disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV.The parasuicide and impulsivity sections have shown reasonable internal consistencies (0.69 and 0.67, respectively), excellent interrater reliability (0.95 and 0.97, respectively) and good concurrent validity ( Arntz et al., 2003). Three month test—retest reliability for the total BPDSI score was 0.77. Patients have reported that they feel acknowledged by the BPDSI for their problems (van den Bosch, 2005).</description>

    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being: Physical Functioning (10 items), Role-Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items), Vitality (4 items), Social Functioning (2 items), Role-Emotional (3 items) and Mental Health (5 items) as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index.
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions descriptive system (EQ-5D) consists of five dimensions (Mobility, Self Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression) with three levels each (no problems, some problems and extreme problems), thus defining 243 (35) distinct health states.</description>

    <description>The 'Trimbos and institute for Medical Technology Assessment questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness' (TiC-P: Hakkaart- van Roijen, 2010) is a validated tool commonly applied in economic evaluations of treatments in mental health care. The TiC-p consists of two parts. The first part measures direct medical costs. The second part estimates the productivity costs. The number of hospital days and/or outpatient contacts for treatment will also be collected directly from the participating centres. Reference unit prices of health care services will be applied (Hakkaart et al, 2010).
The second part of the TiC-P includes a short form of the Health and Labor questionnaire (HLQ) for collecting data on productivity losses (van Roijen et al., 1996).</description>

    <description>The Brief Symptomatology Inventory (BSI; Derogatis &amp; Melisaratos, 1983) includes 49 items grouped into nine scales that encompass nine primary dimensions of psychopathological symptoms: psychoticism, somatization, depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, obsessive-compulsivity, anxiety (panic), paranoid ideation, and nervous tension. As to reliability, Derogatis and Melisaratos (1983) presented appropriate coefficients of internal consistency of the BSI ranging from 0.71 to 0.85 and test-retest reliability coefficients ranging from 0.68 to 0.91. Other studies have reported similar estimates (e. g., Boulett &amp; Boss, 1991; Hayes, 1997). As to validity, Derogatis and Melisaratos (1983) provided evidence for a good construct validity of the BSI.</description>
