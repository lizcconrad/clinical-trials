  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      City of Hope National Medical Center, located in Duarte, CA, is hosting a clinical study on
      islet cell transplantation, an experimental procedure being evaluated as a treatment for
      patients with type 1 diabetes. Islet cell transplantation involves taking insulin-producing
      cells from organ donors and transplanting them into the liver of a patient with diabetes.
      Once transplanted, the islets produce insulin, which can improve blood sugar control and
      eliminate the need to inject insulin or use an insulin pump.

      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is an anti-rejection medication that works by decreasing a
      patient's T-cells. T-cells are special white blood cells that recognize and destroy unwanted
      things like infections but can also attack transplanted cells and organs. Reducing the number
      of T-cells at the time of transplant is expected to protect islets and improve long-term
      transplant results. Transplant programs around the world have seen improved islet transplant
      results using T-cell depleting medications. Approximately 5-6 out of every 10 patients remain
      off insulin five years after transplant. These results are similar to those achieved with
      whole pancreas transplant without requiring major surgery, and therefore, may be an option
      for patients who are not eligible for a whole pancreas transplant.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if islet cell transplantation using ATG, along with
      additional medications to prevent the body from rejecting the transplanted cells, is a safe
      and effective treatment for type 1 diabetes. Study participants may receive up to three islet
      transplants and will be followed for five years to monitor blood sugar control, islet
      transplant function, and changes in quality of life.
