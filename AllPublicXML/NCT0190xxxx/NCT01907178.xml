  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate postoperative pain management in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement
      while they are in the hospital and following discharge to their home. Additionally, sample
      questions will be asked prior to surgery to predict patient's postoperative pain experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that patients experience more postoperative pain at home than they do in
      hospital and factors such as preoperative anxiety, depression, and preoperative pain affect
      the level of postoperative pain experienced by patients. A total of 200 patients undergoing
      total knee surgery will be enrolled in this observational study. They will be asked to fill a
      baseline questionnaire including demographic information, medical problems, anxiety,
      depression, preoperative pain level, etc. Following routine standard anesthesia and surgery,
      patient's pain will be assessed every 4 hours when they are in the hospital after surgery,
      then daily assessment for 1 week after they are discharged home followed at 2 months, and 6
      months after surgery.
