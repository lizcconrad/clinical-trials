    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I Study of veliparib (ABT-888) in combination with Gemcitabine and Intensity
      Modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients with Locally Advanced, Unresectable Pancreatic
      Cancer.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerable dose of veliparib in combination with gemcitabine and
           intensity modulated radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic
           cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of veliparib with gemcitabine and
           radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine will be administered by intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, 15 of the cycle. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be given to a
      total dose of 36 Gy in 15 fractions (2.4 Gy per fraction, one fraction per day, 5 fractions
      per week, Monday through Friday) beginning on day 1. Veliparib will be administered per a
      dose escalation schema. The starting dose of veliparib is 20 mg BID based upon
      safety/efficacy data available. Dose escalation will continue in 20 mg increments until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histopathological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas, as well as those with high clinical suspicion of adenocarcinoma, which is
             deemed locally advanced unresectable or borderline resectable as determined by a
             pancreatic cancer surgeon and/or following evaluation by a GI oncology tumor board.

          -  Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior anti-cancer treatment for their disease

          -  Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
