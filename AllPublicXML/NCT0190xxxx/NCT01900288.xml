      The purpose of this study is to test Mobile Technologies in Assisting Patients &amp; Family
      Caregivers in Healthy Living and complex home care by connecting to information and
      professionals from a distance.

    <textblock>
      HPN (Home Parenteral Nutrition) families with TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) users are
      typically geographically distant from one another (peers) as well as professional providers.
      Real-time mobile access to health related information, peer and professional support will be
      tested in this study.

    <description>A mobile device (iPad mini) is loaned to Group 1 subjects providing a connection to HPN Internet information for the 6 to 12 months of the study. Two scheduled times during the study period, visual connections to geographically distant professionals and peers over the iPad mini (HPN Group Clinic Appointment) will be held for approximately 1 ½ to 2 hours each time (called Healthy Living Connections).
On the iPad mini screen during the HPN Group Clinic Appointments, subjects will be able to see professionals and peers all at the same time and they will be able to see them in their home. This group will also receive electronic prompts about healthy activities.</description>

    <description>A mobile device (iPad mini) is loaned to Group 2 subjects providing a connection to Internet information for the 6 to12 months of the study. At the end of the study period, Group 2 subjects will have 1 scheduled time during the study to connect to professionals and peers over the iPad mini for approximately 1 ½ to 2 hours (called Healthy Living Connections) before the study concludes.
On the iPad mini screen during the placebo control group clinics, subjects will be able to see professionals and peers all at the same time and they will be able to see them in their home. This group will also receive one electronic prompt about healthy activities as a comparison control to the intervention group.</description>
