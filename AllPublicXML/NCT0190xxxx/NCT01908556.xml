  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors have shown a superior efficacy compared to tamoxifen in the treatment of
      hormonal receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal patients.

      Side effects like osteoporosis, bone fractures and muscle/bone pain are however more frequent
      using of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen. These side effects compromise the
      patients' well being in a significant way and may favour the use of Tamoxifen in clinical
      practice.

      Furthermore there is evidence that polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 Gene might be associated with
      an improved efficacy of Tamoxifen that is equieffective to aromatase inhibitors.

      Concerning the pharmacogenetics of aromatase inhibition there are known polymorphisms of the
      CYP19A1 gene that are associated with altered peripheral sex hormone levels and altered
      prognosis in breast cancer patients. One study could even associate a polymorphism in the
      CYP19A1 gene with a prolonged time to progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer
      who have been treated with letrozol.

      Therefore the aim of this study is to identify biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of
      an adjuvant Letrozol treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

    <description>All patients are treated with letrozole 2.5 mg for 5 years for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with a hormone receptor positive primary breast cancer. Patients are treated according to the authorities' approval of the drug. Of all patients a germline DNA sample will be obtained before the treatment starts and serum samples will be taken at months 0, 6 and 12. Furthermore the paraffin embedded tissue block will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for central assessment of tumor biomarkers.</description>
