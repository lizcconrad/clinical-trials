  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an infectious disease that destroys the tooth supporting tissues and
      triggers a local and systemic immune response. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) is a risk
      factor for periodontitis.Patients with DM2 and periodontitis have greater difficulty getting
      and maintaining an appropriate glycemic control. It has been reported an average decrease of
      0.4% in glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) in patients periodontally treated versus
      untreated. It is not has been established that periodontal treatment type in spaced sessions
      (multiple sessions over a period of 4 weeks) or rapid and intensive (2 sessions in 24 hours),
      has a greater impact on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of intensive periodontal treatment modality as
      compared with conventional on HbA1c level in periodontitis and DM2 decompensated patients.

  <detailed_description>

      It is proposed to conduct a clinical trial in 100 type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic
      control defined as a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 7% at last check, with randomization
      stratified by referral center, with two parallel groups (1: 1). Diabetic patients are in
      treatment and control in Diabetes Polyclinic Medical Specialty Center of the University of
      the Andes or the medical polyclinic Joan Alsina in San Bernardo . All decompensated DM2
      patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis will receive periodontal treatment based on 2
      different periodontal treatment modalities: the first and most traditional is by spaced
      sessions by quadrant in 1 weekly session (5 sessions). The second form of treatment
      corresponds to an intensive periodontal treatment, whole mouth in 24 hours.

      All patients will be given an initial periodontal examination with manual north carolina
      periodontal probe, performed by a single operator previously calibrated.

      Periodontal status will be determine according to the classification of Page and Eke (2007)
      and periodontal wound size (PISA) will be also determine. Also, will be measured inflammatory
      mediators and cytokines in both plasma and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by ELISA test. The
      data were entered into a medical record designed specifically for this study and the
      variables will be recorded prior and at 3 and 6 months after periodontal therapy.

    <description>Treatment group by quadrant in five weeks. Patients in this group will receive periodontal treatment including plaque control instructions, supragingival and subgingival debridement and root planing. This treatment is done in 5 sessions with a periodicity of 1 session per week. In the first session patients will receive hygiene instruction and supragingival debridement performed with and ultrasonic device. In the following session, there will be done the scaling and root planing to one quadrant per session, using site specific hand curettes. In case of being partially edentulous patients will be implemented at least 3 teeth per quadrant in each session.</description>

    <description>Intensive treatment group in 24 hours: Patients in this group will receive periodontal treatment including: plaque control instructions, supragingival and subgingival debridement and scaling and root planing. This treatment is carried out in 2 sessions within 24 hours. In the first session hygiene instruction and supragingival and scaling and root planing of the teeth in right side at the upper jaw and mandible will be performed. The implementation of each upper and lower hemiarcade will be made until the periodontist treating check manually the removal of all subgingival calculus deposit and feel the smoothness of the root surface. In the second session, there will be an identical procedure in the arch left.</description>
