  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of advanced GIST patients is based on imatinib followed with sunitinib in case
      of resistance/intolerance. However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) on sunitinib
      is frequently short, and after failure with both imatinib and sunitinib, treatment remains
      controversial.

      Previous studies on GISTs have linked 9p21 alterations to tumor progression (El-Rifai et al.
      2000; Kim et al., 2000; Schneider-Stock et al., 2003; Schneider-Stock et al., 2005; Romeo et
      al. 2009; Haller et al., 2008) but the driver gene was not positively identified (CDKN2A,
      CDKN2B, or MTAP) (Astolfi et al., 2010; Belinsky et al., 2009; Perrone et al., 2005; Assamaki
      et al. 2007; Huang et al., 2009). A recent study has shown that homozygous 9p21 deletions
      target CDKN2A and more specifically p16INK4a 4. Most of the CINSARC genes are known to be
      under the transcriptional control of E2F. RB1 sequesters E2F, which is released from the
      complex upon RB1 phosphorylation by CDK4. CDK4 is, in turn, inhibited by p16INK4a. Hence, we
      hypothesize that alteration of the restriction point via deletion of p16INK4a (and more
      rarely of RB1: 20% of cases) gene in GISTs is likely to be a causative event that leads to
      the overexpression of CINSARC genes, which in turn induce chromosome instability and
      ultimately metastasis. Low p16INK4a expression was associated with response to PD-0332991 in
      several in vitro tumor model(Konecny et al. 2011; Katsumi et al. 2011; Finn et al. 2009).
      Considering our molecular data, we believed that PD-0332991 warrants clinical investigation
      in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors with alteration of p16INK4a. This alteration is
      detectable by comparative genomic hybridization which is a technique highly manageable in the
      context of routine clinical care and clinical trial.

      Exploratory, one-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial based on twostage Simon's design

      To assess the antitumor activity of PD-0332991 in terms of non-progression at 16 weeks (after
      centralized review) in patients with documented disease progression while on therapy with
      imatinib and sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST.

      This is a multicentre single-arm Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of orally
      PD-0332991, 125 mg/day, 21 days on/7 days off, in patients with documented disease
      progression while on therapy with 2nd line sunitinib for unresectable and/or metastatic GIST.
      Indeed, the usual treatment for advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Refractory to
      Imatinib and Sunitinib is best supportive care for which outcome data are already available
      (Demetri et al., 2012; Italiano et al., 2012). Sixty three patients will be included in 10
      centres of the French Sarcoma Group over a period of 18 months of enrolment.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to three study periods:

        -  Pre-treatment (PRE TT): from signature of informed consent to the first treatment by
           PD-0332991.

        -  Treatment (TT): from the first treatment by PD-0332991 to the first 28 days following
           the last PD-0332991 administration.

        -  Follow-up (FUP): after treatment discontinuation, all patients must be followed up for
           28 days after the last dose of the study drug for safety assessment (AEs and/or SAEs).

    <description>Efficacy is assessed based on 4-month non progression. Non progression is defined as complete or partial response (CR, PR) or stable disease (SD), using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Non-progression rate will be calculated as the number of alive and progression free patients divided by the number of eligible and assessable patients for the efficacy analysis. Eligible and assessable populations are described in corresponding section of protocol. As recommended by RECIST v1.1, all claimed response will be centrally reviewed by an expert of the study. The results of the centralized radiological review will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint.</description>
