  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that chronic sleep disorders in children with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD), Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) are associated with
      disturbed melatonin secretion and melatonin administration has been shown to be effective in
      these populations. For children who have difficulties swallowing a tablet, Neurim has
      developed an age-appropriate Melatonin formulation in the form of mini-tablets which have the
      same dissolution profile as the Circadin® tablets product, thus should produce the same
      melatonin concentration-time profile with the same effects. This study concerns the
      pharmacokinetic study.

      The purpose of this study is to :

        -  Establish the 24 hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and
           urine 6-SMT excretion in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with
           neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.

        -  Establish the concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24 hour
           6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin® mini-tablets single dose
           administration in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental
           disorders with sleep disturbances.

        -  Evaluate the adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin®
           mini-tablets in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental
           disorders with sleep disturbances.
