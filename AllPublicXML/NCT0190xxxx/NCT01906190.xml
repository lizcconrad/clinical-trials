    <textblock>
      This clinical study will be performed in subjects aged 12-60 years old enrolled in
      NCT01310374 who received 2010 seasonal influenza vaccine to evaluate the persistence of the
      immune response of influenza vaccine up to 24 months after vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were previously vaccinated at 12 to 60 years of age with 2010 seasonal influenza
      vaccine.The persistence phase starts 24 months after the primary vaccination and blood
      samples will be taken at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after primary vaccination. Subjects whose
      antibody titer less than 1:40 at 6 months after primary vaccination will receive a booster
      dose of influenza vaccine.
