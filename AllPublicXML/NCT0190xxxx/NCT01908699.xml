    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, to assess
      the efficacy and safety of BPS-314d-MR when added-on to inhaled treprostinil (Tyvaso®)in
      patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

      Patients new to Tyvaso, will enter a run-in period on inhaled treprostinil until 90 days of
      experience is achieved to ensure drug tolerability before enrolling in the study.

      Treatment groups consist of one active and one placebo group. Subjects will be randomly
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups.

          7. A 6-Minute Walk distance (6MWD) of ≥ 100 meters at the Screening Visit.

          8. Previous (within five years prior to the Baseline Visit) right heart cardiac
             catheterization (RHC) with findings consistent with PAH, specifically mean Pulmonary
             Arterial Pressure (PAPm) ≥25 mmHg (at rest), Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP)
             (or left ventricular end diastolic pressure) ≤15 mmHg, and Pulmonary Vascular
             Resistance (PVR) &gt;3 mmHg/L/min.

          9. Echocardiography excluding any clinically significant left heart disease (e.g. left
             sided valve disease, wall motion abnormality suggesting of myocardial infarction, left
             ventricular hypertrophy, etc).

         10. Pulmonary function tests conducted within 12 months before or during the Screening
             period to confirm the following:

               1. Total lung capacity (TLC) is at least 60% (predicted value) and

               2. Forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) of at least 50% (predicted value).

         11. Subjects receiving additional FDA approved PAH therapies must be stable on their
             current dose for at least 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit, apart from modification
             of anticoagulant or diuretic dosages.

         12. Must have completed 90 days of uninterrupted inhaled treprostinil treatment and
             received a stable dose of inhaled treprostinil for at least 30 days prior to Baseline
             to be eligible for randomization into the study.

         13. Women of child-bearing potential (defined as less than 1 year post-menopausal and not
             surgically sterile) must be practicing abstinence or using two highly effective
             methods of contraception (defined as a method of birth control that result in a low
             failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, such as approved hormonal contraceptives,
             barrier methods [such as a condom or diaphragm] used with a spermicide, or an
             intrauterine device). Subject must have a negative pregnancy test at the Screening and
             Baseline Visits.

         14. Willing and able to comply with study requirements and restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Pregnant or lactating.

          2. Has previous experience with beraprost or BPS-314d (i.e., BPS-IR, BPS-MR or BPS-314d-
             MR).

          3. PAH related to any condition not covered under inclusion criteria, including but not
             limited to pulmonary venous hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary
             capillary hemangiomatosis, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

          4. History of interstitial lung disease, unless subject has collagen vascular disease and
             has had pulmonary function testing conducted within 12 months of the Baseline Visit
             demonstrating a total lung capacity ≥60% of predicted.

          5. Has active hemorrhagic condition (e.g., upper digestive tract hemorrhage, hemoptysis,
             etc), or has a pre-existing condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, may
             increase the risk for developing hemorrhage during the study (e.g., hemophilia).
             Transient hemorrhage (e.g., epistaxis, normal menstrual bleeding, gingival bleeding,
             hemorrhoidal bleeding, etc) will not preclude enrollment.

          6. Has received any investigational drug, device or therapy within 30 days prior to the
             Baseline Visit or is scheduled to receive another investigational drug, device or

          7. Has any musculoskeletal disease or any other disease that would significantly limit
             ambulation.

          8. Has any form of unrepaired or recently repaired (&lt; 1 year) congenital
             systemic-to-pulmonary shunt other than patent foramen ovale.

          9. Evidence of significant coronary arterial disease with symptoms, such as angina.

         10. Left sided myocardial disease as evidenced by left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;
             40%, or shortening fraction &lt;22%.

         11. Has creatinine clearance &lt;30 (using the Cockroft-Gault formula) or requires
             hemodialysis.

         12. Has Childs-Pugh class C liver cirrhosis.

         13. Has had previous atrial septostomy.

         14. Any other clinically significant illness or abnormal laboratory values (measured
             during the Screening period) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might put the
             subject at risk of harm during the study or might adversely affect the interpretation
             of the study data.

         15. Anticipated survival less than 1 year due to concomitant disease.

        The Sponsor recognizes that the pulmonary hypertension population is complex and diverse.
        In order to facilitate enrollment of appropriate subjects to this pivotal trial,
        Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact the medical director or study team to
        discuss potential study subjects who have comorbid conditions before enrollment into this
        study. See Appendix 9 for additional details.

        No waivers to entry criteria are allowable in this study. Subjects who are initially
        ineligible for this study may be reassessed for eligibility after consultation with the
        Sponsor.
