  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While radiation is an essential component to the treatment of glioblastoma, it's use is
      limited due to toxicity when higher doses are attempted. Rhenium is a compund which releases
      radiation in small particles that are absorbed after only a fraction of an inch. This limited
      penetration means that high doses potentially can be given without the toxicity of other
      forms of radiation. In order for the radiaiton to be retained within the tumor, it has been
      packaged in microscopic fat like particles termed nanoliposomes. These facilitate the uptake
      of the radiation particles by the tumor. In order to better characterize this form of
      radiation therapy, it is being administered in patients who have failed other forms of
      therapy for glioblastoma. The treatment is administered by tubing inserted into the center of
      the tumor in the operating room. There are two portionms to this study. The first involves
      progressively increasing doses until the most tolerable dose can be identified. The second
      portion of the study involves a larger number of patients being treated at the determined
      most tolerable dose to better evalaute how well the treatment works.

      Rhenium-186 (186Re) (half-life 90 hours) is a reactor produced isotope with great potential
      for medical therapy. It is in the same chemical family as Technetium-99m (99mTc), a
      radioactive tracer that is the most commonly used isotope for diagnostic scintigraphic
      imaging in nuclear medicine. Like 99mTc, rhenium is not taken up by bone and is readily
      cleared by the kidneys. 186Re emits both therapeutic beta particles and every 10 isotope
      decays is associated with a gamma photon. The average 186Re beta particle path length in
      tissue of 2mm is ideal for treatment of solid tumors. Additionally, the emitted gamma photons
      have similar photon energy to those emitted by 99mTc, therefore allowing for imaging of the
      isotope within the body on standard nuclear imaging machines available in routine medical
      practice. Therefore, the 186Re isotope has great potential in CED applications of local
      therapy of solid tumors. However, a carrier is needed to deliver the isotope to the brain and
      maintain its localization at the desired site, as otherwise it would quickly disperse and be
      carried away from the site of injection by the circulatory system.

      Liposomes are spontaneously forming lipid nanoparticles that have been well studied for over
      30 years. Although larger liposomes can be manufactured, the most useful size range for drug
      carrier applications is 80-100 nm. Liposomes of this size are often referred to as
      nanoliposomes and have the ability to facilitate retention at the site of injection. A method
      for the efficient loading of liposomes with the to very high levels of specific activity has
      been developed. These rhenium-labeled nanoliposomes (186RNL) have shown great promise in
      preclinical studies 186RNL of glioblastoma that surpassed results typically seen with
      currently standard treatment modalities such as oral temozolomide or intravenous bevacizumab.

      This is a single center, sequential cohort, open-label, dose-escalation study of the safety,
      tolerability, and distribution of 186RNL given by convection enhanced delivery to patients
      with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma after standard surgical, radiation, and/or
      chemotherapy treatment.

    <description>At the time of stereotactic biopsy a catheter will be placed within the tumor using stereotactic guidance. Once the patient has adequately recovered from the procedure as determined by the neurosurgeon, 186RNL will be infused through the catheter at the predetermined dose. Spectroscopic imaging will then be obtained at predefined time points to visualize the distribution of the 186RNL as well as calculated the actual dose retained within the tumor. Patients will be monitored longitudinally for evidence of toxicity and response by MRI.</description>
