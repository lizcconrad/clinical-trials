    <textblock>
      Anticipated difficulties at laryngoscopy give time to prepare alternative method and proper
      management.

      Several methods to evaluate the anatomical structures has been used during preoperative
      period for airway assessment.

      Evaluation methods are such as the Mallampati classification, mouth opening, thyromental
      distance and sternocostal distance.

      the Upper Lip Bite test, evaluates the possibility of a patient cover the mucosa of the upper
      lip by the lower incisor.

      The aim of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of the Upper Lip Bite test(ULBT)
      in Korean compared to Modified Mallampati classification(MMT).

    <description>When the patients undergoing general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation, after obtained glottis view with direct laryngoscopy, the performer assessed Cormack and Lehane grade. (It takes about 1 minutes). A grade 1 and 2 were rated as an easy laryngoscopy. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as the inability to visualize the vocal cords, each includes Grades 3 and 4.</description>
