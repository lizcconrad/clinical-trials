      This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this study is to
      assess longitudinal variation of immune biomarkers in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D),
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) and healthy, non-diabetic subjects over a one year period.

      Monthly venous blood samples within the first half year and thereafter bi-monthly the rest of
      the year. A subgroup of the subjects will also be invited for a visit within a week after the
      former visit to assess the variation of the biomarkers within a week. The blood samples will
      be assayed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specificity, phenotype and function
      as well as for islet autoantibodies (presence and precise titers), for autoantibody isotypes
      and diabetes risk parameters. Finally C-peptide levels and residual beta cell function will
      be measured three times during the study after a mix meal tolerance test (MMTT) in subjects
      with T1D.
