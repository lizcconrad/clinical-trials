    <textblock>
      The objective of this double blinded randomized study is to assess the tolerance of two
      extensively protein hydrolyzed infant formulas, one based on rice protein and the other one
      on casein, at introduction, and after 3 months of consumption, and their efficacy on growth
      and on the reduction of allergy symptoms through a 3 months consumption period.

          -  In the past 15 days, treatment or medication likely to :

               -  induce confusion in the allergy tets (ex. : Skin Prick Test) and / or

               -  mask the symptoms of an allergic reaction (Anti-allergy medications ;
