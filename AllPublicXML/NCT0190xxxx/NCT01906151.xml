    <description>SENSIMED Triggerfish® (TF) is a CE-marked portable device that monitors the 24-hour intraocular pressure (IOP) pattern by a wireless contact lens sensor (CLS) placed on the eye that sends its signals wirelessly via a periorbital patched adhesive antenna to a recorder. Upon completion, the recording can be transmitted to a computer for read-out and visualization</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Primary Angle Closure (PAC) or Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) with
             indication for Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI). PAC is defined by the presence of a
             partial or complete iridotrabecular contact(ITC) in more than 2 quadrants with either
             raised intraocular pressure (IOP) (ie. more than 21 mmHg) and/or PAS; however, with
             normal optic disc and visual field. PACG is defined by the presence of ITC with either
             raised IOP and/or PAS, and evidence of glaucomatous optic disc and visual field

          -  No IOP-lowering drug treatment or a 4-week wash-out period prior to Study Day 0

          -  Aged ≥18 years, of either sex

          -  Not more than 6 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye

          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of acute angle closure glaucoma on the study eye

          -  Secondary angle closure glaucoma on the study eye

          -  History of ocular surgery within the last 3 months on the study eye

          -  History of ocular laser treatment, including previous LPI on the study eye

          -  Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation on the study
             eye

          -  Severe dry eye syndrome on the study eye

          -  Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic

          -  Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear

          -  Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the
             investigation
