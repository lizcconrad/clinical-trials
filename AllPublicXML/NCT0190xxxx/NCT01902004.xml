  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will evaluate the role of neuroimaging biomarkers of brain aging (i.e.,
      neurodegenerative and vascular brain changes) and mild cognitive impairment in the patterns
      of treatment response to memantine combined with escitalopram compared to escitalopram and
      placebo.

      This study is designed to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of Namenda
      (Memantine) as an augmentation to Lexapro (Escitalopram) in depressed older adults 60 years
      of age and older. Throughout the course of the study, the investigators anticipate screening
      about 400 subjects to recruit 134 participants in the first four years. This study will
      require that the subjects complete up to 20 (twenty) visits in 12 (twelve) months to the
      study site during their participation. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      Namenda (memantine) when taken in combination with Lexapro (escitalopram), may improve the
      quality of treatment response by making it faster and more complete, and also by improving
      thinking and memory in comparison to Lexapro taken with a placebo. Enrolled subjects will be
      provided with 10-20 mg of escitalopram for 12 months, and concurrently randomly assigned to
      either memantine or placebo groups. The investigators will also examine the safety and
      tolerability (how well the treatment works and the side effects) of a combination of Namenda
      and Lexapro as compared to placebo and Lexapro in subjects with major depressive disorder and
      mild cognitive impairment who are at least 60 years of age. Memantine is likely to accelerate
      and enhance antidepressant response to escitalopram and improve cognitive performance.
      Subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or biomarkers of brain aging at baseline are
      likely to have preferential response to the combination of memantine and escitalopram
      compared to escitalopram and placebo, thus identifying a more personalized treatment approach
      in the high-risk subgroups for poor clinical outcomes.
