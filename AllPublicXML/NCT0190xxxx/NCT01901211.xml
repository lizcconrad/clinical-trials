  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As children with cerebral palsy (CP) become teenagers, they experience a decrease in their
      physical function and mobility. Decreased mobility leads to increased social isolation for
      the teens and impacts negatively on their quality of life. This loss of function is
      multifactorial, but poor physical fitness and muscle weakness secondary to disuse are
      significant contributors. Exercise video games are a novel approach to engage youth in
      physical exercise and social interaction with their peers. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the impact of an exercise video gaming intervention to improve physical fitness and
      social wellbeing. Our over-arching research questions are whether &quot;exergames&quot; can provide
      health benefits (improved physical fitness) and improved social wellbeing in youth with CP.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of exergaming on
      cardiovascular fitness and social wellbeing related to friends/peers in youths with CP. The
      secondary objectives of the study will be to evaluate the impact of the exergaming
      intervention on additional components of physical fitness including anaerobic fitness, and
      muscle strength. In addition, the effect of the exergaming intervention on overall
      health-related quality of life (HRQL), self-esteem and motor participation will also be
      measured. Finally, the effectiveness of a technique for balancing performance in multiplayer
      exergames will be evaluated. The objectives will be investigated using a randomized crossover
      study design.Outcomes will be measured a total of four times: at study entry and after the
      first ten-week period (either comparison or intervention), at the end of a six-week washout
      period, then again after second period (either intervention or comparison). Outcomes will be
      assessed by physiotherapists and research staff members who will be blinded to the condition
      of the participants.

    <description>The 7.5m Shuttle Run test (SRT-III) is a maximal, running-based, field test that can assess cardiovascular fitness in children with CP GMFCS level III. In the tests, markers are placed 7.5m apart in a square formation. Participants walk from marker to marker according to progressively faster auditory cues from a music device. The assessment is scored by the total number of shuttle run levels that the participant completes to the nearest half shuttle. A higher score is better.</description>

        <title>Change in the 7.5 Meter Shuttle Run Test for Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS) Level III (SRT-III)</title>
        <description>The 7.5m Shuttle Run test (SRT-III) is a maximal, running-based, field test that can assess cardiovascular fitness in children with CP GMFCS level III. In the tests, markers are placed 7.5m apart in a square formation. Participants walk from marker to marker according to progressively faster auditory cues from a music device. The assessment is scored by the total number of shuttle run levels that the participant completes to the nearest half shuttle. A higher score is better.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (1-week pre-study arm 1), 11-weeks (post study arm 1), 17-weeks (post washout period), 28-weeks (post study arm 2)</time_frame>
        <population>One participant was unable to complete post-assessment after Exergaming Arm. Therefore, 11 participants did complete the protocol, as indicated in the participant flow section, however change scores for outcome measures were not calculated for one participant during the Exergaming Arm. This participant was part of the Comparison First group.</population>

            <description>In this arm, the participants will participate in the exergaming intervention in either the first or the last part of the study.
Exergaming Intervention: The exergaming system will be installed into the participants' homes. Players will pedal the exergame bike in order to move their game avatar. Headsets allow players to communicate with each other in real-time. Participants will play the games 3 to 5 times per week, during scheduled game times. Players will wear a heart rate (HR) monitor and will achieve game benefits for reaching their target HR. They will be asked to exercise in a target HR zone of 40-65%HR reserve. Each week, participants will receive a call from a research assistant (RA), who will provide feedback on their exercise progress and a HR goal for each week. The RA will also record physical and social activities engaged in and any difficulties like leg pain or technical issues.</description>

Exergaming Intervention: The exergaming system will be installed into the participants' homes. Players will pedal the exergame bike in order to move their game avatar. Headsets allow players to communicate with each other in real-time. Participants will play the games 3 to 5 times per week, during scheduled game times. Players will wear a heart rate (HR) monitor and will achieve game benefits for reaching their target HR. They will be asked to exercise in a target HR zone of 40-65%HR reserve. Each week, participants will receive a call from a research assistant (RA), who will provide feedback on their exercise progress and a HR goal for each week. The RA will also record physical and social activities engaged in and any difficulties like leg pain or technical issues.</description>

          <title>Handheld Dynamometry Measures of Knee Flexors and Knee Extensors</title>
          <description>Handheld dynamometry will be used to measure muscle strength for the quadriceps muscles and the hamstrings at 90˚ of knee flexion in both legs.
The individual sits with legs at 90˚ of knee flexion and resistance will be given anteriorly (knee extensors) and posteriorly (knee flexors) two inches proximal to the lateral malleoli.
Higher score indicates greater strength.</description>
          <population>One participant was unable to complete post-assessment after Exergaming Arm. Therefore, 11 participants did complete the protocol, as indicated in the participant flow section, however change scores for outcome measures were not calculated for one participant during the Exergaming Arm. This participant was part of the Comparison First group.</population>

        <title>The 30-second Wingate Cycle Test</title>
        <description>The 30-second Wingate Cycle Test is a measure of anaerobic power, a key component of physical fitness. The cycle test is performed when a participant uses a cycle ergometer and pedals as hard as they can for 30-seconds against a constant braking force.
The measure is relative peak power (watts/kg) normalized to body weight. Higher scores indicate greater anaerobic power.</description>

Players will wear a heart rate (HR) monitor and will achieve game benefits for reaching their target HR. They will be asked to exercise in a target HR zone of 40-65%HR reserve. Each week, participants will receive a call from a research assistant (RA), who will provide feedback on their exercise progress and a HR goal for each week. The RA will also record physical and social activities engaged in and any difficulties like leg pain or technical issues.</description>

          <description>The total score of the 24-item KINDL-R questionnaire will measure the participants' health-related quality of life.
Scores are on a five-point Likert scale that can be scored in isolation and is converted to percent of total score. Total score is the summed score divided by the number of items (24).
Higher scores indicate greater health related quality of life.</description>

Each week, participants will receive a call from a research assistant (RA), who will provide feedback on their exercise progress and a HR goal for each week. The RA will also record physical and social activities engaged in and any difficulties like leg pain or technical issues.</description>
