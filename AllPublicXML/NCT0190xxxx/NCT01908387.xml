      To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral azacitidine on different treatment
      schedules in Japanese subjects with hematological neoplasms

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study that will evaluate the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-486 in
      Japanese subjects with hematological neoplasms including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM),
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). A standard phase 1 design for MTD
      determination, an open label, dose ascending, &quot;3 + 3&quot; design, is adopted in this study. This
      study consists of screening phase, MTD determination phase, and treatment phase. Each subject
      continues study treatment until documentation of progressive disease or discontinuation of
      study treatment for any reason. Originally only MDS subjects were targeted and the MTD of
      CC-486 when administered once daily (QD) for 21 days in a 28-day cycle would be evaluated in
      this study. Currently CC-486 is being clinically developed with both 14-day and 21-day dosing
      schedules in various diseases. This study was suspended to amend protocol to evaluate the MTD
      on these different dosing schedule in larger population. This study was re-opened after
      amended protocol was approved by institutional review board at study site.
