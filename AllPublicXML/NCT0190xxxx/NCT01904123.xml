  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that
      can be given to patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous brain tumors
      or melanoma that has spread to the brain. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells
      divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout
      the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system. Targeting this
      pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells.

      This is the first study using WP1066 in humans.

      This is an investigational study. WP1066 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 33 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 6 groups of 1-6 participants will be enrolled
      in Part 1 of the study, and up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Part 2. Up to 12
      participants who will have surgery on the tumor during the study will be enrolled in Part 3.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of WP1066 you receive will depend on when you joined
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of WP1066.
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of WP1066 than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of
      WP1066 is found.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2 or Part 3, you will receive WP1066 at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Part 1.

      If you are enrolled in Part 3, you will have additional tumor testing and advanced MRIs
      performed as described below.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take WP1066 by mouth 2 times per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of Weeks 1 and
      2 of each 28-day cycle. For 2 hours before and 2 hours after each dose, you must fast (have
      nothing to eat or drink except water).

      If you miss a dose, you may take it within 24 hours. However, if it has been more than 24
      hours since when you were supposed to take WP1066, you will need to contact the study doctor.

      For the first and last dose of Cycle 1, you will take WP1066 in the clinic so that timed
      blood tests can be done. If you are the first enrolled participant in a study group, you will
      be watched for 1 hour after your first dose in Cycle 1, and your vital signs will be checked
      every 15 minutes.

      The study doctor may decide to lower your dose of the study drug if you have side effects.

      You will write down the times of your doses of WP1066 in a study drug diary that will be
      given to you. You should bring the diary to the clinic at the end of each cycle.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, you will be asked about any new drugs you may be taking, including vitamins,
      herbs, and supplements. You will also be asked about any changes in your health, how you
      feel, and any side effects you may be having.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital
           signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing
           before receiving WP1066 and 8 times during the 10 hours after the dose. PK testing
           measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

      On Day 2 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1, blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 14 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing before
      receiving WP1066 and 8 times during the 10 hours after the dose.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for PK testing and routine
      tests.

      On Day 22 of Cycle 1 and Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 2, blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital
           signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital
           signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 8 weeks, if you are in Part 1 or Part 2, you will have an MRI to check the status of
      the disease.

      Every 8 weeks, if you have melanoma, you will have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and
      pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      If you are in Part 3, leftover tumor tissue from surgery will be tested for immune responses
      and to find out if STAT3 is in the tumor. Before surgery, after surgery, and every 8 weeks
      after that, you will have an advanced MRI to check the status of the disease. The advanced
      MRI is a special MRI that takes about an hour and a half longer than usual, and provides very
      detailed information for studying the area of the brain where the tumor is.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, certain tests may be repeated at other times.

      If it is more convenient, you can have your blood and urine collections for routine tests
      done at your local clinic or lab instead of at MD Anderson.

      Length of Study Drug Dosing:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      At 1 and 2 months after your last study drug dose:

        -  You will be asked about any changes in your health, how you feel, and any side effects
           you may be having.

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam, including measurement of your vital
           signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (up to 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed progressive brain metastases from melanoma
             melanoma or recurrent/progressive malignant glioma (glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma),
             for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer
             effective.

          2. Patients must have measurable disease in the brain, defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as &gt;=10 mm by brain magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI). MRI of the brain (with and without gadolinium enhancement) is
             to be performed using standard 5-mm slices with 2.5-mm spacing for comparison to
             subsequent MRI scans.

          3. In the case of malignant glioma patients, they must have previously undergone
             standard-of-care treatment including surgery, radiation, and first line adjuvant
             chemotherapy prior to the experimental treatment (WP1066). In the case of melanoma
             patients with brain metastasis, they may have previously undergone a resection (with
             radiographic evidence of progression), have undergone Gamma Knife radiosurgery (with
             radiographic evidence of progression), whole brain radiation, or have been treated
             with other systemic therapies that have failed.

          4. Age &gt;=18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of WP1066 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.

          5. ECOG performance status &lt;=2, and Karnofsky Performance Scale score &gt;=60%.

          6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes
             &gt;=3,000/mcL, absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,000/mcL, platelets &gt;=100,000/mcL, total
             bilirubin within normal institutional limits, AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;=2.5 X
             institutional upper limit of normal, creatinine within normal institutional limits OR,
             creatinine clearance &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal. PT/PTT &lt;1.5 x normal institutional standard

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          8. Melanoma patients must be intolerant of, or have disease that has proven refractory to
             approved therapies such as BRAF or MEK inhibitors for BRAF-positive metastatic
             melanoma and/or checkpoint blockade with either anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA-4 for metastatic
             melanoma.

          9. Willing and able to tolerate brain MRI's with contrast.

         10. Patients with stable seizures (e.g., no seizures for &gt;= 14 days and not requiring
             escalation or addition of anti-epileptic drugs) will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Biological agents, immune
             modulators, and targeted therapeutic approaches require a 2-week washout window.

          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents require a 4 week washout
             period. Patients who have received cellular or gene therapy at any time are not
             eligible.

          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to WP1066.

          4. The enzymatic metabolism profile of WP1066 is unknown. Patients who are receiving
             drugs that significantly interact with the CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible. However,
             if they are switched to other medications with a 2-week washout window, they will be
             eligible. Patients are also excluded if they have been exposed within 7 days of
             planned first study treatment day to mediations that are predominantly CYP2D6, 2C9 or
             2C19 substrates, strong inhibitors or inducers, and sensitive substrates of CYP3A4
             with narrow therapeutic range.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          6. No single lesion can be larger than 3 cm in maximal diameter. There may not be midline
             shift exceeding 5 mm or hydrocephalus.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because WP1066 could potentially be
             teratogenic or have abortifacient effects. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with WP0166. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be
             willing to use 2 methods of birth control prior to study entry, during the study, and
             for 2 months after the last dose of the study drug or be surgically sterile. Subjects
             of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have
             not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of WP1066 administration.

          8. HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with WP1066.

          9. Patients who have received bevacizumab, Gliadel®, or are on active therapy with
             Optune® are not eligible.

         10. The potential for further hemorrhaging with the use of WP1066 is unknown. Furthermore,
             because brain melanoma metastases commonly hemorrhage, toxicity may be inappropriately
             attributed to WP1066 in this setting. It will be at the PIs discretion to enroll a
             patient who has a small, asymptomatic brain hemorrhage, but patients who have had
             symptomatic hemorrhages will be excluded.

         11. Patients requiring escalation of the corticosteroid dose will be excluded, but
             patients receiving a stable or decreasing dose for at least one week will be eligible.

         12. Because one of the secondary objectives is PFS based on radiographic volumetric
             analysis of the tumor, the presence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease will be an
             exclusion criterion for this study. This is secondary to the inadequacy of measuring
             the extent of the tumor burden within this setting and the very poor prognosis of
             these patients.

         13. The cardiac toxicities of WP1066 are unknown. Thus, patients who have a mean QTc
             interval &gt;450 ms at base line will be excluded. Concomitant use of agents that prolong
             the QT interval will be avoided.

         14. Malignant glioma patients within 12 weeks of completion of radiation with concurrent
             temozolomide will be excluded.

         15. Melanoma patients with large or symptomatic brain metastasis, and in whom
             neurosurgical removal is indicated will not be eligible for this trial.

         16. Patients with uncontrolled seizures or seizure requiring escalation or addition of
             anti-epileptic drugs will be excluded.
