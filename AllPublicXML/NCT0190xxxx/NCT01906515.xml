  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous and noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb) monitoring provides clinicians with real-time
      trending of changes or lack of changes in hemoglobin, which has the potential to alter red
      blood cell (RBC) transfusion decision making. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
      impact of SpHb monitoring on RBC transfusions in high blood loss surgery. The investigators
      hypothesize that SpHb will improve blood transfusion practice in the for of change the number
      of blood unit per patient and improve the outcome regards the time to take decision of
      transfusion trigger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients scheduled for neurosurgeries were enrolled into either a standard care
      group (Control Group) or an intervention group (SpHb Group). The Control Group received
      typical anesthesia care including estimated blood loss (EBL) assessment and intraoperative
      hemoglobin measurements from the central laboratory (Hb). Blood samples were taken when EBL
      was ≥15% of total blood volume. RBC transfusion was initiated if Hb was ≤10 g/dL and
      continued until the EBL was replaced and Hb &gt;10g/dL was confirmed. The SpHb Group followed
      the same transfusion practice as the Control Group except the anesthesiologist was guided by
      the addition of SpHb monitoring with blood samples still taken pre- and post-transfusion.
      Additionally, the absolute and trend accuracy of SpHb compared to Hb was evaluated. Potential
      cost savings from reduced RBC utilization will be calculated if occured.

    <description>To assess absolute accuracy, or single point comparison, paired SpHb and Hb measurements were compared pre- and post- transfusion and bias and standard deviation were calculated. A Bland Altman graph with limits of agreement (1.96 x standard deviation, adjusted for the bias) was plotted to show agreement across the range of values. To assess trending, a regression plot of changes in Hb and corresponding changes in SpHb was plotted and a coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated</description>
