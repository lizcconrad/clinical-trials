  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the effects of two different fish oil products
      containing DHA and EPA by comparing the omega-3 fatty acid levels in the blood.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the acute and sub-chronic (2 week)
      bioavailability of EPA and DHA from two marine oil supplements consumed with a meal in men
      and women with mildly elevated triglycerides. The supplements provide similar amounts of EPA
      + DHA esterified as either triglycerides; or esterified as phospholipids and triglycerides.

    <description>This randomized, controlled crossover study will include four treatment visits (visits 2, 3, 4, and 5; days 0, 14, 42, and 56). Subjects will be randomly assigned, by sex and age, to their first treatment study product (active or control), which will be administered with a standardized low-choline, DHA-, EPA- free breakfast meal at t = 0 h. Subjects will consume placebo or phospholipid-rich fish oil for two weeks, washed out for 4 weeks, then treatments switched. Blood samples will be obtained for acute measurements on visits 2 and 4, via an indwelling venous catheter or venipuncture at t = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h ± 5 min, to determine plasma fatty acid profile. Chronic fatty acid measurements will be determined after 2 weeks on visits 3 and 5.</description>
