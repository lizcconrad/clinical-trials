  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies ultrasound elastography in diagnosing patients with kidney or
      liver solid focal lesions. New diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound elastography, may be
      a less invasive way to check for kidney or liver solid focal lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the utility of ultrasound elastography in correlation with kidney or liver
      biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultrasound elastography.

    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Suspicious liver and kidney lesions will be analyzed separately on a per-lesion basis. Within each population, the strain ratio of cases and controls will be compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the analysis will be illustrated using the non-parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC).</description>
