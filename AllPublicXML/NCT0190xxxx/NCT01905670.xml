  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to demonstrate the safe implant of small receiver-electrodes into the
      endocardial surface of the left ventricle and to demonstrate its utility in providing cardiac
      resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients.

      Eligible patients will undergo an acoustic window assessment using transthoracic
      echocardiography. Patients with adequate acoustic windows will undergo implantation of the
      WiCS-LV system.

      Patients will undergo evaluations pre-hospital discharge, and at one month, 3 months, and 6
      months post implantation. Extended follow-up will be obtained via a registry at 1, 2, 3, 4,
      and 5 years post implantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        AND meeting criteria for one of these two categories:

          1. Patients with previously implanted pacemakers or ICD's and meeting standard
             indications for CRT but in whom standard CRT is not advisable due to known high risk -
             referred to as &quot;upgrades&quot;. Justifications for not using standard CRT must be
             documented in a CRF.

          2. Patients in whom coronary sinus lead implantation or attempted implantation for CRT
             has failed to provide demonstrable therapy benefit - referred to as &quot;untreated&quot;

         12. Life expectancy of less than 12 months

         13. Chronic hemodialysis

         14. Stage 4 or 5 renal dysfunction defined as GFR &lt;30

         15. Grade 4 mitral valve regurgitation

         16. Myocardial infarction within one month

         17. Major cardiac surgery within one month

         18. History of a pericardial effusion in prior procedures
