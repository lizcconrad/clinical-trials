      The purpose of this study is to determine the narrowest excision margin for head and neck
      Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) tumors satisfying the National Comprehensive Cancer NetworkÂ®
      (NCCN) low-risk for recurrence clinical and histopathological criteria that gives an
      acceptable (95%) clinical cure-rate over a 3 year follow-up period. Margins of 1 and 2mm are
      evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer in the US. Most are treated by
      surgical excision. Excision margins vary by tumor size, anatomic location, histological
      subtype, and surgeon preference. Published recommendations and follow up observation times
      vary. Current clinical practice supports the 4 mm excision margin; however, this can be a
      disservice to the patient by potentially excising additional normal tissue unnecessarily and
      yielding larger scars. Considering healthcare costs, both the excision and repair components
      are usually billed by size measurements. Determining the narrowest excision margin to give an
      acceptable clinical cure could feasibly reduce this expenditure.
