      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives in improving and
      maintaining weight loss.

    <textblock>
      Study participants will be obese volunteers recruited from a major community-based weight
      loss program (Weight Watchers), who have lost at least 5kg during the 4-6 months prior to
      enrolling in the study. Among these participants, the following will be assessed: 1. The
      effectiveness of a daily lottery-based financial incentive, relative to the control group, on
      weight loss and weight maintenance; 2. The effectiveness of a direct payment incentive,
      relative to the control group, on maintenance of weight loss; 3. Assess the comparative
      effectiveness of lottery-based and direct payment financial incentives on weight loss and
      maintenance; 4. The degree to which weight loss is maintained in the intervention groups
      relative to usual care during the 6 months following cessation of the intervention will also
      be determined.

      During Phase I, incentives will be provided to some study participants (direct payment and
      lottery arm) for the first 6 months and subjects will be followed for 6 more months to
      examine effects following cessation of incentives.

    <description>No other financial incentive other than for the 3-, 6-, 9-, &amp; 12-month weigh-ins and surveys. Participants will receive daily feedback for months 1-6 and will be observed without intervention in Phase II (months 7-12). Two weigh-ins will be required during Phase II, one at 9 months and the other at 12 months.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to the incentives for the 3-, 6-, 9-, &amp; 12-month weigh-ins, participants who meet their daily goal will be eligible to receive an incentive for each day their goal is met during the first 6 months of the study. All daily incentive earnings will be paid out after verifying participants' weights during an in person weigh in at a Weight Watchers location at months 3 and 6. Winnings will be proportional to weight loss. For example, if a participant's goal was to lose 6 pounds by month 3, but he/she only lost 3 pounds, that participant would only receive 50% of their total eligible winnings.
Similar to the control arm, participants will receive daily feedback for months 1-6 and will be observed without intervention in Phase II (months 7-12). The weigh-ins at 9- and 12-months will also be required.</description>

    <description>In addition to the incentives for the 3-, 6-, 9-, &amp; 12-month weigh-ins, participants who meet their daily goal will be eligible for the daily lottery during the first 6 months of the study. The expected daily winning for the lottery is the same as for the direct payment arm. All daily incentive earnings will be paid out after verifying participants' weights during an in person weigh in at a Weight Watchers location at months 3 and 6. Winnings will be proportional to weight loss. For example, if a participant's goal was to lose 6 pounds by month 3, but he/she only lost 3 pounds, that participant would only receive 50% of their total eligible winnings.
