    <textblock>
      Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as
      rigid bronchoscopy. A more modern alternative is the application of low-dose rocuronium,
      reversed by low-dose sugammadex. The investigators compare the intubating conditions,
      incidence of postoperative myalgia (POM), as well as patient satisfaction for these two
      muscle relaxants.

    <measure>Fasciculations</measure>
    <time_frame>After application of the neuromuscular blocking agent (after 3-5 min)</time_frame>
    <description>Fasciculations were graded by the investigator on the following four-point scale
0 = no fasciculations
= mild, fine fasciculations of the eyes, neck, face or fingers, without limb movement
= moderate fasciculations occurring at more than two sites, or obvious limb movement
= vigorous or severe, sustained and widespread fasciculations in the trunk and limbs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Myalgia (POM)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 Hours after Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of POM was measured using a four-point scale 0 = no myalgia
= minor pain limited to one area of the body
= muscle pain or stiffness noticed spontaneously by the patient, which may have required analgesic therapy
= generalized, severe, or incapacitating discomfort</description>
