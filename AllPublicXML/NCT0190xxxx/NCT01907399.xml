  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a link between activation of the immune response inducing chronic inflammation and
      both obesity and type 2 diabetes. To date, however, the cause(s) of this inflammation, the
      mechanisms of the inflammatory cascade and the type of cells involved are not completely
      known. The aim of our project is to study the principal cell types involved in the immune
      response from a quantitative and functional point of view in obese diabetic patients versus
      obese non-diabetic patients and healthy subjects who are neither diabetic nor obese.

      Despite possible inter-individual heterogeneity of immune cells, the fact that this work will
      be carried out by an accredited team with considerable expertise in the study of almost all
      the different types of immune cells will probably make it possible to know whether cell
      dysfunction and inflammation are associated with obesity or rather linked to insulin
      resistance. This study will be completed later by a second study on cell infiltration in
      adipose tissues in the 3 groups defined above. Better understanding of the physiopathology
      and especially the mechanisms and type of cells involved in obesity-related inflammation
      could quickly lead to the development of appropriate therapies that could act specifically on
      the cells involved and thus preclude the onset of complications.
