      This study is being conducted at the Daegu Catholic University Medical Center. Enrolled
      participants will be randomized into two groups : acupuncture treatment plus epidural block
      and epidural block alone.

      This trial will include treatments during 3 weeks, and then follow up after 2 weeks.
      Participants will have acupuncture treatments of three times per week and epidural block of
      once per week. All examinations and treatments will be provided free of charge. Compared with
      epidural block group, acupuncture plus epidural block group will give more effectiveness for
      alleviate pain caused by lumbar spondylosis.
