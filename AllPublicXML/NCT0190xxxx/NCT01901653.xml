  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SC16LD6.5 at different
      dose levels in patients with small cell lung cancer whose cancer has progressed or recurred
      following standard chemotherapy. Once a safe and tolerable dose is determined, the
      anti-cancer activity of SC16LD6.5 will be assessed by measuring the extent of tumor
      shrinkage. SC16LD6.5 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody (SC16) targets a
      protein that appears to be expressed on the surface of most small cell lung cancers that have
      been assessed using an immunohistochemical assay. The drug, D6.5, is a very potent form of
      chemotherapy, specifically a DNA-damaging agent, that is cell cycle independent. ADC's
      theoretically provide more precise delivery of chemotherapy to cancer cells, possibly
      improving effectiveness relative to toxicities.

          7. A minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks

          8. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function as evidenced by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L
