      The study will enroll low risk MDS patients who need red blood cell transfusions and who are
      refractory to or are not using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The purpose of the study is
      to determine whether oral rigosertib treatment results in hematological improvements
      according to the 2006 International Working Group criteria in these patients. The study will
      also record any side effects that may occur during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter study (approximately 15 centers).
      Approximately 40 transfusion-dependent patients with Low- or Int-1 risk Myelodysplastic
      Syndrome (MDS) by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) will be enrolled and treated
      with oral rigosertib administered twice daily for 21 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle
      (continuous regimen) in order to obtain at least 35 evaluable patients treated for at least 8
      weeks. Patients will take 560 mg rigosertib (two 280 mg capsules) in the morning and 280 mg
      (one 280 mg capsule) in the afternoon, in fasting conditions. All patients on intermittent
      regimen at the time of Amendment 2 of the Protocol will be switched to the continuous
      regimen, including patients on reduced doses.
