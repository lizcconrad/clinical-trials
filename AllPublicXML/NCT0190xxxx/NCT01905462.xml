      This study will assess the risk of spontaneous abortion during weeks 1-23 and weeks 1-19 of
      gestation, respectively, and other pregnancy outcomes, in an exposed cohort, i.e. women with
      last menstrual period (LMP) between 30 days before and 45 days after, or 30 days before and
      90 days after any dose of Cervarix, when compared to a non-exposed cohort, i.e. women with
      LMP between 120 days and 18 months after the last Cervarix dose. The data collected in the
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink General Practitioner OnLine Database (CPRD GOLD) in the
      UK, will be analysed in this study.
