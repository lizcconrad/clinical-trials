  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes using asthma medications called β2-agonists win a disproportionately high number of
      medals at Olympic Games. Due to a large variety in the genes that affect how individuals
      respond to β2-agonists, the investigators will look at variations in the genetic response to
      these medications by dividing athletes into high-responders and low-responders. The
      investigators will then compare athletic performance after the inhalation of β2-agonists to
      placebo. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the effect of β2-agonists on breathing
      mechanics. Due to differences in their anatomy females may decrease the energy needed for
      breathing during high-intensity exercise to a greater extent compared to male athletes after
      the inhalation of β2-agonists.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of inhaled salbutamol on mean power output during cycling performance in female and male athletes</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean power output is assessed over the duration of a 10km time trial (start of time trial until completion of time trial) on a bike ergometer.</time_frame>
    <description>Athletes perform a two time trials, each on a separate day. The time trials are performed 60min after the inhalation of salbutamol or placebo.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of inhaled salbutamol on work of breathing (WOB) and expiratory flow limitation (EFL) in female and male athletes</measure>
    <time_frame>WOB and EFL will be assessed during an incremental exercise test. Exercise will start at 0 Watts and will then be increased every 2.5min by 30 Watts until maximal exertion.</time_frame>
    <description>EFL and WOB will be assessed with the help of an esophageal balloon and mouth pressure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of inhaled salbutamol on minute ventilation in asthmatic and non-asthmatic trained, female and male cyclists</measure>
    <time_frame>Minute ventilation will be assessed during two 10km time trials (one time trial will be started 60min after the inhalation of salbutamol, the second time trial will be started 60min after the inhalation of placebo).</time_frame>
