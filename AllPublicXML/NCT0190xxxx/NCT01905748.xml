  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Migraine attacks can be related to vascular or coagulation activation. Previous studies
      found relative high incidence of prothrombotic events in Migraine. The present study intends
      to assess the coagulation system and activation in patients with Migraine during steady state
      phase and at the beginning of attacks and after 72 hours. A control group of patients with
      another acute neurologic event like convulsions will be also studied. Patients will be at
      pediatric age and teenagers.
