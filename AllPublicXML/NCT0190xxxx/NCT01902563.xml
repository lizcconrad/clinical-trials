  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Several studies have shown the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment on
      neonatal care in reducing length of stay, gastrointestinal problems, clubfoot complications
      and improving cranial asymmetry of infants affected by plagiocephaly. Despite several results
      obtained, there is still lack of standardized osteopathic evaluation and treatment procedures
      for newborns recovered in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

      The aim of this research is to provide a guideline on osteopathic approach in treating
      hospitalized newborns. Specific evaluation tests and treatments have been developed to tailor
      osteopathic method according to preterm and term infants' needs, NICU environment, medical
      and paramedical assistance.
