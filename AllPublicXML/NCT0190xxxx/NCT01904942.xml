      The project is based on a case-control study including cirrhotic patients with (200 cases)
      and without (400 controls) Hepatocellular carcinoma. The determination of sample sizes in
      proteomic or spectroscopic studies has to be adapted to the high dimensional setting. The
      proteomic analysis will be conducted by Clinical Innovation Proteomic Platform of Dijon. Two
      approaches will be used in the proteomic study: A global approach based on the comparison of
      proteomic spectra profiles obtained after mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF). The
      particularity of this study with regard to previous studies is : the procedures used to
      purify the sub proteomes (Five automated methods including depletion fractionation and
      purification will be applied), the qualification of the generated data with the introduction
      of quality controls, the high number of samples included in the study. The second approach
      BIA-MS (Biomolecular interaction analysis mass spectrometry) is targeted approach allows the
      capture, quantification and characterization of proteins.

      The quality controls allow to quantify the various variability sources and to validate that
      biological variability is higher than technical variability. All the samples will be treated
      and analyzed with the same protocols, 100 samples will be used to validate the marker and
      statistical models developed after analysis of the first 500 samples. The infra-red
      spectroscopy analysis will be conducted by MÃ©DIAN team, CNRS UMR 6237 of Reims university.
      The first 300 samples after feature selection reference spectra, are classified into
      different classes by means of mathematical classification methods such as multivariate
      statistical processes of pattern recognition, neuronal networks, support vector machines and
      methods of case-based classification or machine learning, genetic algorithms or methods of
      evolutionary programming. The analysis of a second set of samples (300) will validate the
      different mathematical classification methods developed.

      In the global study the investigators will unravel the relationship between proteomic,
      spectroscopic and metabolic/nutritional data. The description of these relationships will use
      canonical analysis and multi-block analysis in a more general extent. The goal of these
      methods is to explore relationships that may exist between several groups of quantitative
      variables observed on the same set of individuals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases and controls will be males aged 35 or older, and will give an informed consent
             to participate in the study. All HCC cases evolving in cirrhotic liver, whatever the
             etiology of cirrhosis, will be included. Criteria for the diagnosis of HCC will be
             those defined by the European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL) (Bruix J, J
             Hepatol 2001): All patients with cirrhosis, whatever its etiology, will be included.
             The diagnosis of cirrhosis will rely on histological confirmation by liver biopsy:

          -  In patients free of portal thrombosis at Doppler imaging, on the presence of portal
             hypertension ascertained by biological (tricytopenia), morphologic (abdominal US, CT
             or MRI), hepatic venous pressure measurement or upper endoscopy (mosaic gastropathy,
             varices).

          -  In patients with portal thrombosis, on the presence of portal hypertension associated
             with:

               -  Clinical (hepatomegaly with clinical evidence of hepatocellular failure: spider
                  naevi, palmar erythema, white nails, gynecomastia) or morphological signs of
                  cirrhosis (enlarged liver, nodular surface, sharp lower edge).

               -  And/or biological signs of hepatocellular failure (TP&lt;70%, low albuminemia)

               -  And/or sinusoidal block assessed by liver venous gradient &gt;18 mm Hg In the
                  present state of knowledge, a fibrotest value at 4 or a fibroscan value &gt; 12,5
                  kPa Without any other clinical or biological signs will be considered as
                  diagnosis criteria of cirrhosis only for chronic viral C hepatitis. The lack of
                  HCC in cirrhotic patients at inclusion will be assessed through good quality
                  imaging examinations (abdominal US, CT scan or MRI) and AFP below 100 ng/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - patients under 35years old or more than 75 years of age

          -  other cancer in evolution

          -  HIV infection

          -  major somatic or psychiatric illness not compatible with the inclusion in the study

          -  non HCC primary liver cancer.
