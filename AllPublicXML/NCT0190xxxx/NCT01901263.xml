    <textblock>
      Cognitive and behavioral units (CBUs) have been created between 2008 and 2012 French National
      Alzheimer plan for the management of behavior problems of patients suffering from Alzheimer's
      disease or other related disorders and necessitating hospitalisation. This Alzheimer plan is
      promoting the evaluation of these units through the observation of the behavioral and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) evolution. As these units are new, it appears
      important to assess their long-term impact on patients care.

      EXPECTED RESULTS The present study should allow to better understand the long-term impact of
      CBU on care of patients with Alzheimer disease and BPSD. Moreover, it should allow to
      identify patients improved by CBU.

    <description>the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), is uded to assess 10 behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, and aberrant motor activity. The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses to screening questions.</description>
