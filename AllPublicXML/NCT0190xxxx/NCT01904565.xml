  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional phase I/II clinical trial with concomitant local hyperthermia
      and proton beam radiotherapy in patients with primary or recurrent unresectable soft tissue
      sarcomas of the extremities, trunk, retroperitoneum (except intrabdominal). The primary
      purpose would be to assess the safety and efficacy of this approach along with local tumour
      regressions and subsequent tumour downstaging, thereby enabling a near total removal of these
      tumours following the hyperthermia and proton beam therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperthermia would be delivered at Kantonsspital Aarau (KSA) with superficial or deep
      hyperthermia treatment units as may be appropriate. All patients would undergo a
      pre-hyperthermia treatment planning and a temperature of around 41.5 Centigrade to 42.5
      Centigrade would be aimed during hyperthermia sessions.Hyperthermia would be delivered once a
      week and the treatment sessions would last for around 60 minutes of active heating.

      Proton bean therapy would be carried out at Center of Proton Therapy, Paul Scherrer Institute
      (PSI), Villigen using scanning beam proton therapy. A preoperative dose of 55 - 60 Gray
      equivalent (GyE) or those considered for radical treatment, 72-76 GyE would be delivered, 5
      days a week at 1.8 - 2 Gy/fr.

      On days of both hyperthermia at KSA and proton therapy at PSI, the time interval between the
      two treatments could be 90 to 150 minutes, taking into consideration the time to travel
      between the two institutions. Hyperthermia in these days would follow proton beam therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histopathologically proven and classified soft tissue sarcoma (STS) as per the WHO
             classification (2002). For all primary tumours, biopsy would be done within 2 months
             prior to registration and reviewed by the study pathologist. For all recurrent
             tumours, if prior biopsy has been done elsewhere, the histopathology would be reviewed
             by the study pathologist.

          2. Primary STS of extremities, trunk (except intrabdominal) and retroperitoneal which
             are,

               1. Deemed inoperable by the study surgeon

               2. Not feasible for a limb sparing surgery with possible R0/R1 resection as per the
                  study surgeon,

               3. Patient medically unfit to undergo surgery
