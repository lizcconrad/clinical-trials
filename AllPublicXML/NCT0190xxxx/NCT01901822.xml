    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that coronally positioned tunnel with acellular dermal matrix
      using a continuous sling suture to secure both the graft and the flap will result in better
      percent root coverage compared to the continuous sling suturing technique to secure the graft
      and the flap separately.

      Thirty patients will be selected by meeting the following criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria:

      A. At least one Miller Class I or II mucogingival defect ≥ 3 mm (Miller 1985). B. The
      mucogingival defect must be on a non-molar tooth. C. Patients must be between ≥ 18 years of
      age.

      Exclusion Criteria:

      A. Patients with debilitating systemic or diseases that significantly affect the
      periodontium.

      B. Patients with a known allergy to any of the materials that will be used in the study,
      including systemic antibiotics (tetracycline and doxycycline).

      C. Patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. D. Root surface restorations at the site of
      recession. E. No detectable cemento-enamel junction. F. Patients who fail to maintain oral
      hygiene levels of at least 80% plaque free surfaces.

      G. Patients who are pregnant or lactating. H. Patients who use tobacco products (smoking or
      smokeless tobacco). I. Patients with alcohol abuse problems. J. Patients undergoing long-term
      steroid therapy. K. History of previous root coverage procedures, graft or guided tissue
      regeneration, on the test teeth.

      L. Patients who fail to complete the informed consent form.
