      The purpose of this study is to evaluate radiolabeled recovery and survival of autologous red
      blood cells (RBC), derived from Mirasol-treated fresh whole blood (WB), stored as
      leukoreduced packed RBC (LR-pRBC), and re-infused in healthy adult subjects

      This is a feasibility level study conducted to assess the recovery and survival of
      autologous, radiolabeled leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-pRBC) derived from fresh
      whole blood (WB) units that have been treated with the Mirasol System for Whole Blood
      (Mirasol System) and stored for 21 days at 1-6°C.1

    <description>To evaluate, as per FDA criteria, the 24-hour post transfusion RBC recovery in healthy adult subjects of leuko-reduced packed red blood cells (LR-pRBC) that have been derived from Mirasol-treated fresh WB units and stored at 1 to 6°C for 21 days.
24-hour RBC Recovery is a measure of the % of RBCs that are still functioning 24 hours after they have been reinfused back into the donor following storage over 21 days.</description>
