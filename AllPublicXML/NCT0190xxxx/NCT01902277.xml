  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU delirium negatively impacts on patient outcomes, as well as on resources and clinical
      workflow of the ICU. Effective healthcare resource planning requires reliable (i.e.,
      multicentre) data that can inform on both of these.

      The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ICU delirium in terms of both
      patients and beds. The study was carried out prospectively, over a one-week period, at adult
      ICUs comprising the Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire Critical Care Network (NSC CCN).

      Previous delirium prevalence research has been carried out at single sites and yielded highly
      variable results (between 3-87%). Reliable multisite data can be obtained cost-effectively
      using a point-prevalence (&quot;snapshot&quot;) approach.

      Purpose: to obtain reliable data informing on prevalence of ICU delirium, in terms of both
      patients and beds, across the eastern UK region.

      Design and Setting: this one-week observational prospective cohort study was carried out
      between June 25, 2012 (start of ICU day shift) to July 01, 2012 (end of night shift). Nine
      ICUs comprising the Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire Critical Care Network (NSC CCN) took
      part. Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee approved the study (REC reference:
      10/H0308/116) and waived the need for informed consent.

      Patients and procedure: All adults treated over the study week at participating ICUs were
      considered eligible for inclusion. Delirium screening was carried out by patients' direct
      care clinicians using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). All sites used
      this tool as part of their routine clinical practice and had delirium management guidelines
      in place at the time of the study. Patients who screened positive for delirium were treated
      according to local hospital practice.
