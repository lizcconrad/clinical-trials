  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia has become a widely accepted approach to provide
      analgesia for labour pain. Despite the increasingly widespread use of this technique, an
      optimal intrathecal drug regimen has not been established yet.

      Several investigations using local anesthetics such as Bupivacaine, Levobupivacaine and
      Ropivacaine in CSE during labour have been published. But despite the reintroduction of
      Chloroprocaine recently there haven't been any investigations about spinal chloroprocaine.
      Chloroprocaine is already a long-know drug with a beneficial pharmacodynamic/kinetic profile.
      It is known for a very quick onset of action (2 - 3 minutes), high efficacy, rapid metabolism
      by plasma cholinesterases and short half-life both in mother and fetus.

      Because of this beneficial profile, Chloroprocaine is widely used intrathecally for surgical
      anesthesia. Several investigations demonstrate that for surgical anesthesia doses
      Chloroprocaine ranging from 30 - 60 mg are used and that they have an effective surgical
      duration of 40 - 90 minutes.

      Despite these &quot;standards&quot; for surgical anesthesia, little is known about spinal
      Chloroprocaine dose regimens. Therefore the primary goal of this study is to determine the
      minimum adequate dose of Chloroprocaine that is to be given spinally to a woman in labour
      using a CSE procedure. We will use the up-down sequential allocation to identify the median
      effective dose (ED50) or concentration (EC50).

      The Effective dose in 95% of the population (ED95) can be estimated also from an up-down
      sequential allocation and will become an important valuable approximation of the clinical
      dose.

    <description>The motor blockade is determined by the adjusted Bromage scale:
= complete motor block with the impossibility to move the legs
= only the possibility to move the feet
= possibility to move the knees
= weak flexion of the hips
= a complete flexion of the hips and the knees

    <time_frame>During the next 15 minutes after the application of the CSE.</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of the analgesia will be evaluated by a 100mm visual analogue pain score (VAPS). There are two possible outcomes here:
effective: the VAPS is 10mm or lower after the 15 minutes of monitoring. An effective result will decrease the test dose of chloroprocaine with 2mg for the next patient in this study.
Ineffective: the VAPS is more than 10mm after 15 minutes of monitoring. An ineffective result will increase the test dose of chloroprocaine with 2mg for the next patient in this study. Patients who indicate an ineffective result will receive a rescue treatment by the administration of 12ml levobupivacaine epidurally.</description>
