      This clinical trial will test two new therapies for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.
      Patients who &quot;respond&quot; to the current standard of care therapy for alcoholic
      hepatitis(corticosteroid/prednisolone therapy) after 1 week of treatment will be randomly
      assigned to either continue on standard therapy, or, to begin treatment with rilonacept in
      combination with standard therapy. Patients who are &quot;non-responders&quot; to the current standard
      of care therapy after 1 week of treatment will be randomly assigned to standard of care or to
      begin treatment with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with standard therapy. Patients
      will be treated for a total of 4 weeks in this clinical trial. Patients will be followed for
      up to five months after completing therapy (6 months total).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized trial of two experimental treatments, prednisolone +
      mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone + rilonacept, in comparison with standard of care, in
      patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Patients will start therapy with prednisolone. At Day 8
      response to prednisolone will be determined using the Lille score. Patients with a Lille
      score ≥ 0.45 will be randomized to standard of care (continue prednisolone, stop all therapy
      and/or offer palliative care) or to have prednisolone continued and mycophenolate added for
      the next three weeks. Patients with a Lille score &lt;0.45 will be randomized to continue
      prednisolone alone (standard of care) or to have rilonacept added to their treatment regimen
      (experimental group) for the next three weeks. Patients will complete follow-up visits at
      Week 12 and Week 24.
