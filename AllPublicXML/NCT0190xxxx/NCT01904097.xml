  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and cerebral neuronal ability to
      adaptation in patients with fibromyalgia who receive pregabalin and transcranial direct
      current stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome occurs in around 2% of the population (predominantly women), and is
      characterized by its poor response to conventional therapies. Therapeutic approaches
      modulating inhibitory pathways, including pharmacologic options as pregabalin, and non
      pharmacological ones as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been proven to be
      of limited utility independently. Aiming to evaluate a better understanding of the
      pathophysiogenic mechanisms and the effect of these treatments on neuroplasticity, this study
      was designed evaluating neurophysiologic, neurochemical and clinical parameters.
      Neurophysiologic parameters and functions to be assessed will include pain threshold, motor
      evoked potential, silent period, intracortical facilitation and inhibition assessed by
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and optic functional neuroimaging. Neurochemical
      measurements considered will be neurotrophins (BDNF) and inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL1,
      IL6, IL10 and cortisol). Clinical characteristics will be assessed using validated scales
      capable to detect functional capacity, quality of life (WHOCOHL), catastrophism, sleep
      disruptions (Pittsburgh) and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory). Considering the
      above described hypothesis, the present randomized clinical trial with blinded patients and
      evaluators is proposed. It pretends to analyze short-, mid- and long-term neurobiological
      mechanisms triggered by the selected interventions.
