    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure and compare the amounts of the study drug evacetrapib
      found in the blood after taking two different formulations. The study has 3 periods.
      Participants will take each formulation by mouth at least once. A minimum of 14 days will
      pass between study drug doses. The safety and tolerability of the study drug will also be
      examined. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This
      study will last approximately 6 weeks.
