      This study will evaluate relaxin (RLX) levels in patients with multiple sclerosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to obtain baseline information on serum and cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) relaxin levels in patients with MS, as well as to further study RXFP-1 receptor binding
      affinity for RLX in patients with active and clinically stable MS.

    <description>There is no information available on what serum and CSF levels of RLX are observed in patients with active versus stable relapsing MS, how these values compare to that found in human volunteers without MS or other inflammatory diseases, and whether RLX functions normally in subjects with active or stable MS.</description>

    <description>Group 1 will consist of 10 subjects with suspected MS, who have had a clinical attack within the last 12 weeks, have at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion on brain or spinal cord MRI taken within the prior 4 weeks, and for which they have not received any immunomodulating or immunosuppressant medication.

    <description>Group 2 will consist of 10 subjects with clinically stable definite MS, with no evidence of clinical relapse for at least the past 12 weeks, and have no gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI in the prior 4 weeks. These subjects will fulfill the Revised (2010) McDonald's Criteria for the Diagnosis of MS.

             have at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion on brain or spinal cord MRI taken within
             the prior 4 weeks, and for which they have not received any immunomodulating or
             immunosuppressant medication.

          -  Subjects with clinically stable definite MS, with no evidence of clinical relapse for
             at least the past 12 weeks, and have no gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI in the
