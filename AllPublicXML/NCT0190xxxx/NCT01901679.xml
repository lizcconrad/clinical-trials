      The study plans to find out whether Celebrex may be potentially useful to decrease
      inflammation in fat tissues and thereby lower the production of substances such as estrogens
      that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer and lead to a poor outcome of the
      disease.

      This study seeks to examine how effective the celebrex may be in reducing inflammation,
      crown-like structures in fat tissue, the enzyme aromatase, PGE-M in the urine and estrogen in
      blood and urine. Volunteer subjects will be expected to stay in the hospital for about 2
      weeks taking Celebrex for approximately 10 days while eating a diet similar to what they
      consumed before coming into the hospital for the study.
