  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is very successfully treated with a type of
      therapy called Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART). Although HAART has made a great
      improvement to the health and lives of all people living with HIV, HAART cannot be stopped
      because it is not able to 'cure' or eliminate the HIV virus from all cells in the body - the
      remaining viruses are referred to as 'latent' or sleeping virus. As soon as the HAART
      treatment is stopped the virus comes back (wakes up). It is for this reason that stopping
      HAART treatment is not recommended. However, it may be that other drugs if given with HAART
      could have a stronger effect on the latent virus. There is some evidence from laboratory
      research that suggests that some of the drugs we use to treat certain types of cancer may
      have an effect on the latent virus. The purpose of this research study is to use new
      laboratory research technology to measure the amount of 'latent' virus in people who are
      treated with HAART who then need to use chemotherapy treatments for cancer. We will look at
      whether the levels of HIV virus are reduced in patients having chemotherapy by looking at the
      virus levels before, during and after chemotherapy treatment. We do not know very much about
      how HIV persists in the body despite therapy and unless new approaches are developed, removal
      of the HIV virus from all cells in the body will not be possible.

      STUDY DESIGN This study will be performed at one investigational site in the UK. This is a
      single centre, prospective observational cohort study of HIV positive individuals on
      suppressive HAART with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy.

      ELIGIBILITY Individuals receiving HAART and diagnosed with either lymphoma or Kaposi's
      sarcoma receiving combination chemotherapy agents, which include the vinca alkaloids and
      taxanes, will be eligible for this study.
