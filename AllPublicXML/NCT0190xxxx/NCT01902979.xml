  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the most important determinants of quality of life and function. People
      with lumbar spinal stenosis may be at increased risk of obesity given walking limitations.
      Spinal stenosis is a very common degenerative condition in people over 45. People with this
      condition have pain and numbness in the legs during walking, and therefore avoid physical
      activity. Lack of physical activity is related to weight gain and increased risk of chronic
      disease. Objective: The objective of this project is test a new e-health (online) pedometer
      and nutrition intervention aimed at promoting weight loss and increasing physical activity in
      overweight and obese individuals with spinal stenosis. Methods: The investigators will
      recruit 88 people with lumbar spinal stenosis who are overweight or obese. Half of these
      people will receive the 12-week intervention, and the other half will receive usual care (no
      intervention). In Weeks 1 and 6, people in the intervention group will meet with a Registered
      Dietitian and an Exercise Physiologist for personalized sessions. They will receive a
      pedometer and instructions on how to log in to the e-health site
      (https://sspanli.mtroyal.ca). They will wear the pedometer daily and log in to the website
      each week for a nutrition education session, a weekly step goal, and tips. The investigators
      will look to see whether people in the intervention group show greater change in physical
      activity, body composition and quality of life compared to the individuals who received usual
      care. Relevance: The increasing number of people with spinal stenosis represents a huge
      health care burden in Canada. This intervention could provide a new treatment option that
      would increase mobility, quality of life, and potentially alleviate the need for expensive
      treatments like surgery. E-health interventions provide an opportunity for patients to take
      an active role in their own health, and promote behaviour changes that will result in
      healthier Canadians less likely to access care in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will be at least 45 years of age and will have received a diagnosis of
             lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) by a spine surgeon who has both examined the patient and
             reviewed imaging results (MRI or CT). All subjects will be required to have a BMI of
             25 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) and to have maintained a stable body weight for the
             previous 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any co-morbid conditions that would make participation in a walking program medically
             inadvisable.

          -  subjects currently participating in a diet or lifestyle intervention for weight loss
             or who are on medications known to influence bodyweight or glucoregulation (including
             antidepressants, sibutramine orlistate, insulin and metformin), will be excluded.

        If participants are scheduled for any type of surgery that could impact mobility during the
        intervention period, they will be removed from the study.
