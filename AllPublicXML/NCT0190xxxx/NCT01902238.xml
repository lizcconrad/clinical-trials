  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, including insulinoma, increasingly are being encountered in
      clinical practice. Management of pancreatic NET is challenging because most are asymptomatic
      but may have malignant potential, and surgical resection of pancreatic neoplasm is associated
      with substantial morbidity of 20%-40% and a mortality rate of 2%. Management strategy needs
      to be individualized, applying a risk-benefit analysis to each patient. Recently, pancreatic
      tissue ablation by EUS-guided injection of ethanol or other chemotherapeutic agents can be
      performed safely, with few procedure-related complications. Levy et al. demonstrated that
      EUS-guided ethanol ablation for insulinoma was both safe and feasible, and symptomatic
      improvement was achieved in 8 of 8 patients (100%). However, previous study have included
      only a small number of patients and evaluated only short-term outcomes. In addition, lipiodol
      permits the drug to concentrate in the tumor. To obtain an embolic effect and prevent washout
      of the ethanol, ethanol/lipiodol mixture is administered into the tumor. The present study
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided ethanol-lipiodol ablation for the treatment of
      pancreatic NET

    <description>By using 3D-volumetric analysis, the optimal volume of ethanol is calculated by computer estimation of areas on each axial image, using EUS software permitting volume calculation. After calculating optimal ethanol volume by 3D volumetric analysis, we advance the needle into the tumor and inject estimated volume of ethanol/lipiodol (1:1 mixture), typically 1 to 1.5 ml.</description>
