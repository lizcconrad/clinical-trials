  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential group
      study. The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of single
      doses of ME1100 inhalation solution (orally inhaled arbekacin). The secondary objective is to
      determine the systemic exposure to, and urinary elimination of, ME1100.
