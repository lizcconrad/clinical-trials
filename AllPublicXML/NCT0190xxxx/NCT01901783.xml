    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the clinical and histologic results of ridge augmentation
      with and without primary closure over the barrier membrane. The hypothesis is that there will
      be no difference in crestal ridge width between the two groups.

      A maximum of 30 patients will be selected that meet the following criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria

        1. At least a one tooth area with a ridge defect, treatment planned to receive a dental
           implant. The site must be bordered by at least one tooth.

        2. Healthy person that is at least 18 years old.

        3. Patient understands and signs an informed consent approved by the University of
           Louisville Human Studies Committee.

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Patients with debilitating systemic diseases, diseases that affect the periodontium, or
           psychological problems that would interfere with treatment.

        2. Previous head and neck radiation or chemotherapy within the previous 12 months.

        3. Patients with known allergy to any of the materials that will be used in the study.

        4. Smokers.

        5. Patients who need prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures.

        6. Patients on long-term steroid therapy or oral bisphosphonates &gt; 3 years or any IV
           biosphosphonates.

        7. Patients who are pregnant.
