  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental plaque, known as dental biofilm, is implicated as the primary etiological agent
      responsible for oral inflammatory diseases. Matured form of dental plaque plays a major role
      in the pathogenicity of gingivitis; if not managed in early stages it results in a cascade of
      events leading to the destruction of periodontal tissues.

      Effective plaque control techniques have been suggested that maintain dental biofilm at
      levels compatible with oral health and is the cornerstone for all preventive strategies to
      control oral diseases particularly gingivitis. To clean teeth and ensure effective plaque
      control, different mechanical means have been in use since centuries. However because of an
      inadequacy in plaque removal, different antimicrobial and antiplaque agents have been
      introduced in oral-care products.

      The use of dentifrices has been recommended over the years as the ultimate way of preventing
      the incidence of oral diseases. Dentifrices have the anti-plaque and the anti-gingivitis
      capabilities due to their composition. Toothpastes and to a lesser extent toothpowders are
      common oral-care products used to eliminate plaque and other deposits from tooth surfaces.
      Existent literature has focused more on toothpaste and mouth rinse and derelicts toothpowder
      despite its difference owing to the absence of humectants. With the intention to advance the
      knowledge on this issue as well as close the research gap, this study was conducted to
      evaluate the efficacy of toothpowder in alleviating gingivitis, controlling dental plaque,
      and inhibiting extrinsic stains.

      A single-blind, parallel arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the efficacy of
      toothpowder against toothpaste through oral hygiene parameters of plaque and stain deposits
      on teeth and gingival inflammation. Plaque Index, Lobene Stain Index and Gingival Index were
      used as measures of oral hygiene.

      The current RCT revealed that toothpowder and toothpaste were equally effective in both
      treatment and control groups from clinical perspective however toothpowder showed a
      statistically significant effectiveness as compared to toothpaste. Toothpowder, composed of
      calcium carbonate and essential oils, has demonstrated to be statistically more effective
      than toothpaste in controlling extrinsic dental staining, dental plaque and gingival
      inflammation.

      A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted during November 2010 and October
      2011. After screening and consent, eligible subjects received mechanical periodontal therapy.
      Subjects were then randomized to Test group and Control group at a 1:1 ratio. The test group
      was provided tooth powder and a control group received toothpaste. Healthy subjects with
      plaque induced gingivitis and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited from the
      Department of Periodontology, Fatima Jinnah Dental College Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.77
      subjects with gingivitis were randomized to test group and 77 subjects to the control group.
      Therefore, to complete the randomized controlled trial, a total of 154 subjects were
      recruited and randomized.

      Outcome measure gingivitis was measured through plaque index, gingival index and Lobene stain
      index.

    <description>Gingival Index (Löe and Silness, 1963) modified by Talbott et al. (1977) was used for the assessment of the gingival condition and record qualitative changes in the gingiva. Its scores (0 to 3) recorded the marginal and interproximal tissues separately. The criteria are: 0= normal gingiva, 1= mild inflammation - slight change in color and slight edema but no bleeding on probing, 2= moderate inflammation - redness, edema and glazing, bleeding on probing and 3= severe inflammation - marked redness and edema, ulceration with a tendency to spontaneous bleeding.</description>

    <description>Quigley-Hein (Tuersky) Index was used for plaque deposits. This index is based on the visually check of non-restored surface of all the teeth except third molars; this is done on a scale from score 0 to score 5. An index for the entire mouth is determined by dividing the total score by the number surfaces examined. The criteria for scoring are: 0 = no plaque, 1 = separate flecks of plaque, 2 = continuous band of 1 mm, 3 = &gt;1mm and &lt;1/3 of tooth surface, 4 = &gt;1/3 and &lt;2/3 and 5 = &gt;2/3 of tooth covered with plaque</description>

    <time_frame>November 2010 - October 2011 (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Lobene index based on the intensity and area of stains covered on the labial surfaces of the anterior teeth was used. Buccal surfaces of teeth are divided into two gingival crescent and body. In this index intensity and area measured on gingival crescent and body separately and also in combination by multiplying intensity and area. An index for the entire mouth is determined by dividing the total score by the number surfaces examined</description>
