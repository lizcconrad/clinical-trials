  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the red blood cell (RBC) and plasma concentrations
      of folate in subjects treated with drospirenone (DRSP)/ethinyl estradiol (EE) plus
      levomefolate calcium (L-5-MTHF) at 24 weeks with respect to basal determination.

      Increased intake of folic acid (synthetic form of the naturally occurring B-vitamin) before
      and in the first few weeks of pregnancy has been shown to reduce certain types of birth
      defects. This is important for women who may become pregnant following discontinuation of
      oral contraception. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, Mexican female subjects requesting contraception

          -  Age &gt;/=18 to &lt;/=45 years (inclusive); smokers must not be older than 30 years at the
             time of informed consent

          -  Normal or clinically insignificant cervical smear not requiring further follow-up; a
             cervical smear has to be taken at the screening visit, or a normal result has to be
             documented within the previous 6 months. Human papilloma virus (HPV) testing in
             subjects with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) can be used
             as an adjunctive test. Subjects with ASCUS can be included if they are negative for
             high-risk HPV strains.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation (less than 6 months since delivery, abortion, or lactation
             before start of treatment)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m2

          -  Hypersensitivity to any ingredient in the study drug

          -  Any diseases or conditions that can compromise the function of body systems and could
             result in altered absorption, excessive accumulation, impaired metabolism, or altered
             excretion of the study medication

          -  Any diseases or conditions that might interfere with the conduct of the study or the
             interpretation of the results

          -  Any disease or condition that may worsen under hormonal treatment according to the
             assessment and opinion of the investigator.

          -  Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding

          -  Abuse of alcohol, drugs or medicine (eg, laxatives)

          -  Any medication that could result in excessive accumulation, impaired metabolism, or
             altered excretion of the study drug
