      DLBS1033 is bioactive protein fraction which extracted from Lumbricus rubellus earthworm.
      This earthworm comes from Pengalengan, West Java, Indonesia. DLBS1033 possesses 8 major
      proteins with molecular weight below 100 kDa, so its named as Lumbricus Low Molecular weight
      Proteins (LLP). This enzyme can be transported to the bloodstream via intestinal epitel. As a
      drug that consists of serin protease enzyme, suspected that the mechanism of action of
      lumbrokinase, especially as fibrinolytic and antithrombotic. One study of DLBS1033 concluded
      that plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complex is a sensitive parameter for evaluating fibrinolytic
      effect of this drug. But, until now there is no clinical study that evaluate pharmacokinetic
      of this drug. As a pilot study, the aim of this study is to evaluate biological half life of
      DLBS1033.

    <description>Before taking the drug, blood samples will be collected from subject to assess PAP complex level, serum creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, PT and aPTT. After that, subjects will instructed to take three tablets enteric coated of DLBS1033 in front of investigator. After take the medicine blood sample will be collected on 30 minute, 60 minute, 90 minute, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour, 10 hour, 12 hour, and 24 hour to evaluate serial PAP complex. Subjects will undergo a clinical assessment including vital signs and the presence of adverse events at the time of blood sampling. On this trial, subjects are only permitted to eat food from investigator.</description>

    <description>On day 1 blood samples will be collected to assess PAP complex level, serum creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, PT and aPTT. After that, subjects will instructed to take one tablet of DLBS1033 in front of investigator. Study drug packages (that consist of 8 tablets) will dispense to the subjects at day-1 and instructed to take the drug 3 times daily 30 minutes before meals. Subjects also will instructed to record any adverse events and concomitant medication prescribed in diary card. Subjects have to take the drug on 3 days (day 1, 2, and 3). On day 4, blood sample will be collected on 0 minutes, 30 minute, 60 minute, 90 minute, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour, 10 hour, 12 hour, and 24 hour to evaluate serial PAP complex. Subjects will undergo a clinical assessment including vital signs and the presence of adverse events at the time of blood sampling.
