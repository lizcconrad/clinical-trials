  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into
      muscles of the leg(s) or of leg(s) and one arm are safe in treating children/adolescents (age
      2-17 years) long-term with increased muscle tension/uncontrollable muscle stiffness
      (spasticity) due to cerebral palsy.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Visit [V] 2) to all other visits (V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, and V11); From Day 1 of Each Injection Cycle to Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8, 1st Injection Cycle only) and Day 99 (Week 14) of the respective Injection Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well-known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (= no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for efficacy analysis that is, &quot;primary body side&quot; was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. V3 = Week 4 of 1st Injection Cycle; V4 = Week 8 of 1st Injection Cycle; V5 = Day 1 of 2nd Injection Cycle; V6= Week 4 of 2nd Injection Cycle; V7 = Day 1 of 3rd Injection Cycle; V8 = Week 4 of 3rd Injection Cycle; V9 = Day 1 of 4th Injection Cycle; V10 = Week 4 of 4th Injection Cycle; V11= Week 14th of 4th Injection Cycle = end of study visit.</description>

    <description>The GICS are global outcomes to assess the impression of change due to treatment.

    <measure>Changes in Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) of Left and Right PF From Baseline to All Other Visits, From Day 1 of Each Injection Cycle (IC) to Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8, 1st IC Only) and Day 99 (Week 14) of the Respective Injection Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Visit [V] 2) to all other visits (V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, and V11); From Day 1 of Each IC to Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8, 1st IC cycle only) and Day 99 (Week 14) of the respective IC</time_frame>
    <description>The MTS assesses spastic muscle tone by subtraction of two angles measured at different conditions of passive muscle stretch. R2 is the angle of passive range of motion with a passive movement at slow speed. R1 is the angle where a &quot;catch-and-release&quot; or clonus can be triggered at the fastest possible speed. Score values represent the measured (R2-R1) difference, that is, the dynamic tone component of the examined muscle(s). Decreases of (R2-R1) represent reductions in the dynamic component of spasticity, that is, improvement of dynamic muscle spasticity. V3 = Week 4 of 1st IC; V4 = Week 8 of 1st IC; V5 = Day 1 of 2nd IC; V6 = Week 4 of 2nd IC; V7 = Day 1 of 3rd IC; V8 = Week 4 of 3rd IC; V9 = Day 1 of 4th IC; V10 = Week 4 of 4th IC; V11 = Week 14 of 4th IC = end of study visit.</description>

The QPS total score for the observed pain frequency ranges from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always). V3 = Week 4 of 1st IC; V4 = Week 8 of 1st IC; V5= Day 1 of 2nd IC; V6 = Week 4 of 2nd IC; V7 = Day 1 of 3rd IC; V8 = Week 4 of 3rd IC; V9 = Day 1 of 4th IC; V10 = Week 4 of 4th IC; V11 = Week 14 of 4th IC = end of study visit.</description>

        <description>The Ashworth Scale (AS) is a well-known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (= no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for efficacy analysis that is, “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study. V3 = Week 4 of 1st Injection Cycle; V4 = Week 8 of 1st Injection Cycle; V5 = Day 1 of 2nd Injection Cycle; V6= Week 4 of 2nd Injection Cycle; V7 = Day 1 of 3rd Injection Cycle; V8 = Week 4 of 3rd Injection Cycle; V9 = Day 1 of 4th Injection Cycle; V10 = Week 4 of 4th Injection Cycle; V11= Week 14th of 4th Injection Cycle = end of study visit.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) was the subset of participants in the SES for whom at least a baseline value (Day 1 of the first cycle, Visit 2) of AS score of PF was available. For participants from lead-in study at least one post-baseline value was available.</population>

        <description>The GICS are global outcomes to assess the impression of change due to treatment. GICS were assessed by the investigator, by the participant (if feasible) and by parents'/caregiver (if applicable). GICS is 7-Point Likert Scale ranging from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function).</description>

        <title>Investigator's Global Impression of Change of Plantar Flexor Spasticity Scale (GICS-PF) of Left and Right PF at Day 29 (Week 4) of Each Injection Cycle</title>
        <description>The GICS are global outcomes to assess the impression of change due to treatment. GICS were assessed by the investigator, by the participant (if feasible) and by parents'/caregiver (if applicable). GICS is a 7-Point Likert Scale ranging from +3 (very much improved function) to -3 (very much worse function). For participants with bilateral pes equinus, the body side for efficacy analysis that is “primary body side” was decided by investigator at screening and was kept throughout the entire study.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 29 (Week 4) of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th injection cycle</time_frame>
        <population>The FAS was the subset of participants in the SES for whom at least a baseline value (Day 1 of the first cycle, Visit 2) of AS score of PF was available. For participants from lead-in study at least one post-baseline value was available.</population>

        <description>The MTS assesses spastic muscle tone by subtraction of two angles measured at different conditions of passive muscle stretch. R2 is the angle of passive range of motion with a passive movement at slow speed. R1 is the angle where a &quot;catch-and-release&quot; or clonus can be triggered at the fastest possible speed. Score values represent the measured (R2-R1) difference, that is, the dynamic tone component of the examined muscle(s). Decreases of (R2-R1) represent reductions in the dynamic component of spasticity, that is, improvement of dynamic muscle spasticity.

        <description>The questionnaire on pain caused by Spasticity (QPS) is a participant-reported outcome for children and adolescents (2-17 years) with cerebral palsy on spasticity-related pain. Pain intensity (from participants) and pain frequency (from parent/caregiver) to be assessed with QPS. The QPS total score for pain intensity ranges from 0 (’No Hurt’) to 10 (’Hurt Worst’). The QPS total score for the observed pain frequency ranges from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always).

        <description>The GMFM-66 is a standardized observational 66-item instrument designed and validated to measure change in gross motor function over time in participants with cerebral palsy. Score values represent the total GMFM-66 score. Total GMFM scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

        <population>The FAS was the subset of participants in the SES for whom at least a baseline value (Day 1 of the first cycle, Visit 2) of AS score of PF was available. For participants from lead-in study at least one post-baseline value was available. Therefore all participants from lead-in study were included in FAS.</population>
