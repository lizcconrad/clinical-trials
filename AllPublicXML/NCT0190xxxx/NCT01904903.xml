  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells)
      than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive
      breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the
      receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very
      aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly
      targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine,
      patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.

      Unfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and
      for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal
      heart function.

      In this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast
      cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart
      doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do
      frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us
      a detailed &quot;picture&quot; of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to
      try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will
      take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.

      We hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast
      cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on
      appropriate heart medications.

    <measure>Proportion of patients who complete planned oncologic therapy without the development of a cardiac event or asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac events are defined as any of the following:
Presence of symptoms attributable to heart failure as confirmed by a cardiologist
Cardiac arrhythmia requiring pharmacological or electrical treatment
Myocardial infarction
Sudden cardiac death or death due to myocardial infarct, arrhythmia or heart failure
Asymptomatic worsening of cardiac function defined as:
- Asymptomatic decline in LVEF &gt; 10% points from baseline and/or EF &lt; 35% corroborated by a confirmatory echocardiogram in 2-4 weeks
Planned oncologic therapy is defined as:
In the adjuvant setting: completion of 1 year total of HER2 targeted therapy. If a patient already received part of the planned HER2 targeted therapy prior to enrollment in this trial, planned oncologic therapy will be achieved when a total of 1 year is completed.
In the metastatic setting: cessation of treating regimen due to progressive disease or non-cardiac toxicity or non-cardiac death.</description>

    <measure>HER2 therapy holds attributed to proportion of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiotoxicity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Hold is defined as any delay or discontinuation of HER2 targeted therapy due to cardiac toxicity. One cycle of HER2 targeted therapy will be considered 3 weeks. One therapy hold will be defined as any 3-week HER2 targeted therapy missed dose or 1/3 if one weekly trastuzumab dose. For patients who had a hold and resumed HER2 targeted therapy, duration of treatment hold will be described.</description>
