        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adults ages 18-90 with a diagnosis of achalasia confirmed by findings on esophageal
             manometry and barium esophagogram will be eligible for the study.

          -  Eckardt score6 greater or equal to 6 or 2 or greater for dysphagia and/or
             regurgitation

          -  Symptoms less than 2 years

        Exclusion criteria:

             of endoscopy and injection;

          -  Greater than mild esophageal dilation

          -  Type 1 achalasia as defined by the Chicago classification scheme7 and/or esophageal
             diameter &gt; 3cm;

          -  Prior treatment for achalasia

          -  Use of medications that might affect LES pressure such as anticholinergics or calcium
             channel antagonists

          -  Symptom duration greater than 2 years

          -  Inability to read due to: Blindness, cognitive dysfunction, or English language

             disease or significant memory loss

          -  Pregnant and lactating females will be excluded as steroids are not thought safe for
             the fetus.
