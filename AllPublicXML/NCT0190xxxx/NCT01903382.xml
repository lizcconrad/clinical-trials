  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality is subject to cyclic variability: circadian, weekly, and seasonal. This has been
      shown for different populations, different diseases and in different countries, but not for
      surgical patients. Aim of this study is therefore to investigate the association between
      circadian, weekly, and seasonal effects time of surgery postoperative mortality of patients
      undergoing surgery and general anesthesia.
