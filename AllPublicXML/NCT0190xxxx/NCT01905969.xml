  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative gastrectomy for Stage II/III gastric cancer has
      improved disease free time and survival. However, there are still considerable number of
      patients experience relapse even after adjuvant chemotherapy. In an attempt to select
      patients who really benefit the postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, we have identified
      potential biomarkers (NF-kappaB/JNK) from cell line panel screening followed by
      immunohistochemical validation. In the present study, we further validate the significance of
      the biomarkers in a larger set of clinical samples to see if chemotherapeutic response can be
      determined immediately after surgery.

        This is a retrospective study. Data analyses are based on archived record and materials of
        gastric cancer patients whose treatment was curative surgery followed by adjuvant
        chemotherapy with S-1.
