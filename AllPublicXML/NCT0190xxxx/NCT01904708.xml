  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited genetic disorder, can cause irreversible brain damage,
      declined executive function, and autistic tendencies unless a phenylalanine (Phe) restricted
      diet is consistently maintained throughout life. Promoting anabolism, the uptake of free
      amino acids from the extracellular space, is a key component to maintaining plasma
      phenylalanine concentrations within treatment range among patients with PKU. Exercise
      promotes muscle protein synthesis and anabolism, but the effect on blood phenylalanine
      concentrations in patients with PKU has not been reported.

      Our objective is to assess the impact of an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise on
      protein oxidation and plasma amino acid concentrations, as a potential adjunctive therapy for
      patients with PKU.

      The investigators hypothesize that moderate intensity exercise decreases amino acid
      oxidation, increases muscle protein synthesis, and promotes tissue uptake of essential amino
      acids, thereby lowering plasma phenylalanine concentrations in patients with Phenylketonuria.

    <textblock>
      The indicator amino acid oxidation technique utilizes a carbon labeled isotope (L-[13C])
      tracer that is ingested orally and is measured in expired breath. This method is based on the
      theory that if one essential amino acid is deficient, all other amino acids will be oxidized
      until a break-point is reached and at that time all amino acids will be incorporated into
      muscle protein synthesis. Using a randomized crossover design the investigators plan to
      investigate the effects of an acute bout of moderate intensity treadmill exercise versus
      sedentary activities on plasma amino acids in four subjects with PKU. The long-term goal of
      this novel research is to determine if exercise could be used as an adjunctive therapy to
      improve the management of plasma phenylalanine levels and promote a normal, healthy quality
      of life among patients with PKU.

      Patient Recruitment: Four post-pubertal participants ranging from 14-17 years of age with
      classical phenylketonuria (PKU), treated at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, will
      participate in this pilot study. Participants will be recruited during their routine clinic
      visit at Doernbecher Children's Hospital Metabolic clinic.

      Study Design: This randomized crossover clinical trial will compare the effects of moderate
      intensity exercise and sedentary activities on amino acid oxidation and plasma amino acid
      pools using the indicator amino acid oxidation technique. Each participant will be studied on
      two separate occasions over a one-month period.
