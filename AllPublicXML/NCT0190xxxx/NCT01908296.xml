    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to assess the effect of multiple-dose fluvoxamine on the
      pharmacokinetics of quetiapine (FK949E) in healthy adult male subjects. The safety of FK949E
      in the population was also evaluated.

             temperature, or 12-lead ECG

          -  A deviation of the following criteria for clinical laboratory tests.

        The normal reference ranges specified at the study site will be used as the normal
        reference ranges in the present study.
