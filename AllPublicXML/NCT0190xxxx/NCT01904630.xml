  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will use exome sequencing to search for genetic predispositions for familial
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Except for certain syndromes there is today no good method for
      identifying individuals with a hereditary high risk for CRC (about 25% of the cases). There
      is currently no routine screening of the population in Norway for CRC today. Coloscopy, which
      is the most reliable method, is demanding with respect to resources, it can be painful, and
      may have complications. This project will attempt to find genetic determinants for
      identification of individuals with increased risk for familial CRC. Such methods will reduce
      unnecessary medical examination of unaffected family members, and will make it easier to
      focus health services on individuals with increased risk. This will represent a significant
      contribution towards improved health reduced death rate caused by CRC. The project includes
      research on the ethical aspects, in particular challenges related to how feedback to donors
      is handled.
