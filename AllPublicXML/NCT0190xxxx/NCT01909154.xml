      The purpose of this study is to confirm the security, and detect the effect of the local
      administration in damaged nervous tissue, of autologous bone marrow stromal cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a clinical trial phase I, single center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open prospective
      follow-up of a cohort of patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) who were treated with
      autologous stromal cells of the bone marrow administrated locally (subarachnoid and
      intramedullar) by intrathecal microinjection and three months later, by lumbar subarachnoid
      administration. The minimum follow-up duration for each patient is 12 months after the first
      administration, or until death, if it occurs it before.

    <description>Clinical evaluation of possible adverse effects is performed daily at the first week after the first administration of stem cells and weekly until the 6 months follow-up visit and then at month 9 and 12.
During the first stem cells administration (during surgery): Changes in vital signs (ECG, Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR) were evaluated
During the second stem cells administration: Changes in vital signs (BP, HR), headache and meningeal irritation were evaluated
During the first weeks, after the first and the second administrations, the possibility of meningeal irritation, headache and infectious complications were considerate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female with ages between 18 years and 60 years with of age or older functional
             sequelae chronically established by traumatic injury of the spinal cord (spinal
             segments between the vertebral bodies C6 and L1) and considered irreversible (not
             respond to any other treatment). In this study, the lesion is considered chronically
             established, when there are no signs of functional recovery after a minimum follow-up
             period of 6 months after the spinal cord injury. The upper age limit is justified by
             the low potential of in vitro expansion of bone marrow stromal cells over 60 years.

          -  Complete paraplegia, with loss of motor and sensory function below the lesion (grade A
             in the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment (ASIA) Scale .

          -  Spinal injury MRI morphologically visible, and without images that suggest spinal cord
             transection, with separation of the both ends of the spinal cord.

          -  Tracking evolutionary possibility after treatment protocol and to comply physiotherapy
             maintained throughout the follow up period.

          -  Written informed Consent according to good clinical practice (GCP) and local
             regulations, obtained before any study procedure.

          -  Hematological parameters and creatinine, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase
             (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) in normal range according to
             laboratory standards, are accepted, however, small non-significant deviations
             according to the investigator.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  Systemic disease represents an added risk to treatment

          -  Patients with questions about their possible cooperation in
             rehabilitation-physiotherapy treatments later, or negative report psychological
             assessment prior.

          -  Neuroimaging data showing spinal cord section with separation of the terminal portion
             of the spinal cord

          -  Current neoplastic disease diagnosed or treated in the previous five years

          -  Patients treated with hematopoietic growth factors or requiring stable anticoagulation

          -  Added neurodegenerative disease

          -  History of substance abuse, psychiatric illness or allergy to protein products used in
             the process of cell expansion

          -  HIV positive serology and syphilis

          -  Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C active According to the investigator's opinion if there are
             findings on physical examination, abnormal clinical test results or other medica
             relevant entries, social or psychosocial factors which might influence negatively the
             study.
