  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A database (Snapfish) has been generated at Sensimed compiling all data acquired up to now on
      healthy volunteers and patients with glaucoma. However, healthy subjects were much younger
      than glaucoma patients. Additionally, the number of glaucoma patients in Snapfish database
      was almost twice higher than the number of healthy subjects. As it is generally accepted that
      intra ocular pressure (IOP) in the aging population is higher than IOP in young adults it is
      of interest to evaluate the 24-hour IOP pattern of older healthy subjects. Furthermore,
      improving our knowledge of the &quot;healthy&quot; 24-hour IOP pattern in comparison to glaucoma
      profiles would be beneficial for management of glaucoma.
