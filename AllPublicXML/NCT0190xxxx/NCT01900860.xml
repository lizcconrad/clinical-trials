  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized double blind trial of three doses of vitamin D, 400, 4000,
      and 10,000 International Units (IU) per day, to assess the effect on bone density and
      architecture as assessed by high resolution peripheral quantitative tomography (HR-pQCT)
      measurements at the radius and distal tibia, and standard Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
      Other measures of bone and calcium metabolism will be assessed. The trial will last as long
      as three years. Approximately 300 healthy men and women, aged 50-70 years of age, will be
      recruited, and randomly assigned to one of the three doses of vitamin D. Other outcome
      variables assessed include quality of life, depression, muscle strength and balance.

  <detailed_description>

      Hypotheses being tested:

        1. It is hypothesized that vitamin D, in a dose-dependent manner, will suppress parathyroid
           hormone action, resulting in less bone turnover, and decreased cortical porosity,
           leading to improved bone strength as assessed by finite element analysis.

        2. It is hypothesized that vitamin D, in a dose-dependent manner, will increase bone
           density in the central skeleton (spine, hip), as measured by the current standard method
           of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

        3. It is hypothesized that vitamin D, in a dose-dependent manner, will have an impact on
           quality of life, including indices of depression, as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire
           and an appropriate index of depression.

      Outcomes:

      Primary outcome:

        -  bone strength as measured by HR-pQCT, including an assessment of the relative
           contribution of trabecular and cortical bone.

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  bone mineral density as measured by DXA

        -  parameters of calcium metabolism, including biochemical markers of bone turnover and DNA
           to examine possible variations in the genes that control vitamin D metabolism.

        -  quality of life score

        -  depression scale score

        -  balance, grip strength.

        -  fasting glucose and Hemoglobin A1C will also be measured.

        -  Safety will be assessed during the scheduled follow-up visits by obtaining history of
           adverse events, as well as measurements of serum and urine parameters of mineral
           metabolism as described below.

      INTERVENTION DRUG: Vitamin D3 in one of three doses Rationale: For adults under age 70 years,
      the recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report recommends a total intake of 600 IU vitamin
      D/day will provide all the vitamin D needed for bone health, and since the typical Canadian
      diet contains between 200 and 300 units of vitamin D, the subjects in the lowest dose arm of
      our study will receive 400 IU/day. The other two groups will receive 10,000 IU and 4,000 IU,
      respectively. The 10,000 IU dose is the tolerable upper intake level (TUL) recommended by
      Hathcock et al (Am J Clin Nutr 2007) and 4,000 IU is the IOM's recommended TUL.

      Calcium intake:

      All subjects will have adequate calcium intake as defined by the Institute of Medicine (total
      of 1200 mg/day). A brief dietary history will be taken and subjects will be instructed to
      take an appropriate dose of supplemental calcium if their daily intake is less than 1200
      mg/day (the IOM's Recommended Daily Allowance for this study population).

      Interim analysis (with maintenance of blinding of subjects and investigators as to treatment
      arm):

        -  planned at and of years 1 and 2, as well as the final analysis at year 3.

    <measure>Bone strength, as measured by Finite Element Analysis of High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcomes of the HR-pQCT scans are morphological parameters such as trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), bone volume ratio (bone volume / trabecular volume (BV/TV) and estimated bone strength from finite element analysis. Change from baseline measured at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bone Mineral Density as measured by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to scan the distal radius, lumbar spine and the proximal femur to obtain an areal (two dimensional) estimate of bone mineral density (aBMD). DXA is the current clinical standard for measuring bone density. From the scan of the lumbar spine and left proximal femur (~ 1 min), aBMD (g/cm2) will be used to determine a subject-specific T-score (aBMD compared to reference mean for a young healthy adult) and this value will be compared to standard World Health Organization criteria to classify each subject as normal (T-score&gt;-1), low bone density (-1 &lt; T &gt; -2.5) or osteoporotic (T score &lt; -2.5). Change from baseline will be assessed at 12, 24 and 36 months.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory or PHQ-9 questionnaire will be used (decision not made yet); measured at entry and at 3, 6 and 12 months, then annually. This is not expected to be a safety issue in recruiting healthy volunteers, but obviously could become one.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical markers of calcium and bone metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the markers identified as safety measures in &quot;other outcomes&quot; (serum and urine calcium, serum creatinine, etc), we will also obtain serum for measurement of markers of bone turnover: serum C-telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTX), and Procollagen I N-terminal Propeptide. Measurements taken at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Still to be arranged: Under-carboxylated osteocalcin and osteocalcin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The balance tests include standing with (a) two feet on the force platform with eyes open, (b) two feet on the force platform with eyes closed, (c) two feet on a foam pad with eyes open, and (d) two feet on a foam pad with eyes closed. All tests will be performed 5 times, and a blindfold will be used for all eyes-closed assessments. The total testing time is approximately 15 minutes. Measurements done at baseline and at 12, 24 and 36 months</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: changes in parameters of calcium metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main concern in safety of vitamin D consumption is the avoidance of toxicity in the form of hypercalcemia or renal damage, related to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Two of the doses in this study are generally accepted as safe. The 10,000 IU daily dose exceeds the recommended upper limit of safe, unsupervised vitamin D intake, hence, this trial includes regular clinical laboratory testing of parameters of calcium metabolism, including serum and urine calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25OH-Vitamin D. Measurements will be done at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: Parameters of glucose metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1C, and fasting glucose, and the osteocalcin measurements will address some of the potential effects of vitamin D on glucose metabolism. A full assessment of the effects of vitamin D on diabetes and glucose metabolism is beyond the scope of this proposal, but because these parameters are very easily obtained measurements they will be examined at baseline, 3, 6 , 12, 24 and 36 months.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: Peripheral Vascular Calcification, as assessed by HR-pQCT at the distal radius and tibia</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants imaging studies will be followed from baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recently, it has become apparent that the HRpQCT images obtained at the distal radius and tibia include enough detail of the arteries providing blood supply to the hand and foot, that quantification of calcification of the medial layer of these blood vessels (radial and ulnar arteries, anterior and posterior tibial arteries), may be possible. Vitamin D might play a role in vascular calcification (animal models suggest protection; vitamin D toxicity may be associated with soft tissue calcification). Consequently, the range and duration of vitamin D Dose in this protocol may allow discovery of a vitamin D effect on calcium deposition.
