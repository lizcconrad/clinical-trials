    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the effect of posaconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of RO5503781, the relative bioavailability of two new RO5503781
      formulations, and the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of RO5503781 in patients with
      solid tumors.

          -  Patients receiving oral or parenteral anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents (e.g.,
             chronic daily treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day), clopidogrel, low molecular weight
             heparin, or subcutaneous anticoagulant prophylaxis). A washout period of at least 7
             days prior to the start of study is required. Patients may receive anticoagulant
             flushes for maintenance of indwelling catheters.

          -  Patients who refuse to potentially receive blood products and/or have a
