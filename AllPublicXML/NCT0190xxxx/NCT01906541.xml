  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is a rare inherited immune defect, which is
      caused by the inability of phagocytic cells to produce reactive oxygen species due to a
      defect in the gp91phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. X-CGD patients suffer from
      recurrent and life-threatening infections and severe hyperinflammatory complications.

      The only curative treatment for X-CGD is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
      but this procedure implies severe risks and many patients lack an appropriate donor.
      Therefore alternative curative approaches are urgently needed. In this study, patients will
      be treated with gene-corrected autologous CD34+ cells, using a SIN gammaretroviral vector for
      ex-vivo gene-therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Verified diagnosis of the X-linked form of chronic granulomatous disease, with loss of
             gp91phox expression (Western Blot). Evidence of less than 5% of normal oxidase
             production in circulating neutrophil granulocytes as measured by dihydrorhodamine-
             (DHR-) and nitro blue tetrazolium- (NBT-) assay

          -  History of severe chronic infections with life-threatening course or severe steroid-
             sensitive or steroid insensitive granulomatous disease, with necessity of inpatient
             treatment, without sustained improvement even under maximum conservative treatment
             measures
