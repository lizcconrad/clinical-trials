  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to set up tools that will serve as quality tracers for cryopreservation
      procedures.

      To meet this objective, we have chosen to develop reference samples (sentinel cells) that, in
      the medium term, can be used as controls to guarantee the quality of preservation for
      biological samples.

      The biological tools and an optimised follow-up strategy will make it possible to validate
      preservation procedures at the CRB in order to guarantee the perfect stability of samples and
      the validity of clinical studies.
