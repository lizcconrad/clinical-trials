      A multicenter registry to explore the clinical outcome of Chinese adult patients with active
      Ankylosing Spondylitis *AS* treated with adalimumab,prescribed according to the local
      label,in the real world practice
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This registry will be conducted in a non-interventional setting for AS patients using
      adalimumab in China.The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      adalimumab in Chinese AS patients in real world clinical practice.The secondary objective is
      to 1)compare the clinical outcome in patients with or without good persistence with
      adalimumab;2)investigate the predicting factors of a good clinical response after
      discontinuation of adalimumab.
