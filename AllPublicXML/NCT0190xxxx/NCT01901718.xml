  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain patients who experience breakthrough pain in the background of controlled
      persistent pain with opioids will be followed for 3 months in order to assess the safety and
      titration trends in the clinical practice setting of a novel fentanyl sublingual spray
      (Subsys™) for the treatment of breakthrough pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 100 subjects across 10 centers throughout the United States will be enrolled
      into the study. Subjects who are currently taking Actiq® for their breakthrough pain and will
      be discontinued due to lack of efficacy, poor tolerability, patient or prescriber
      dissatisfaction and meet all other study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria will be candidates to receive a sublingual fentanyl spray (Subsys™). The total
      duration of the study for each subject will be no more than 4 months.

             the last month.

          -  Are female subjects with a positive pregnancy test or who are currently lactating.

          -  Are subjects who are taking medications that are known inhibitors of the CYP3A4
