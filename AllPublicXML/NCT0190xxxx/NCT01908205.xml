  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying an investigational drug called intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon®). Syntocinon®
      has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in helping women
      breastfeed, but it has not been approved for use in children with ASD. However, there is
      previous research conducted that has indicated that after administration of oxytocin, adults
      with ASD demonstrated improvements in social cognition, and reduced repetitive behaviours and
      anxiety. There is also early research to suggest that children may also benefit in these
      areas. The purpose of this study is to test if oxytocin works to help children and
      adolescents with ASD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive data has been accumulated to suggest that central release of oxytocin is important
      for social cognition and function, as well as likely involved in anxiety modulation and
      repetitive behaviors. The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this study
      have previously documented: 1) an association between ASD and a single nuclear polymorphism
      of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the blood by enzyme
      immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in
      the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults with autism. A medication
      treatment targeting the core deficits of ASD in childhood is highly valuable because it could
      influence the developmental trajectory and make further psychosocial interventions possible.
      In this context, we propose a randomized placebo controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD.

             and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria will be established by a clinician with
             expertise with individuals with ASD. Best estimate Diagnosis will be reached using
             DSM-IV criteria, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and the Autism
             Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R).

          3. Have a Clinician's Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at
             Screening.

          4. Verbal and performance scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) ≥ 70 (both subtests of the
             Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-I or WASI-II ≥ 70).

          5. If already receiving stable concomitant medications affecting behavior, have
             continuous participation for 1 month prior to Screening (with the exception of
             fluoxetine, where a period of 6 weeks is needed), and not electively initiate new or
             modify ongoing medications for the duration of the study.

          6. If already receiving stable non-pharmacologic educational, behavioral, and/or dietary
             interventions, have continuous participation during the preceding 3 months prior to
             Screening, and not electively initiate new or modify ongoing interventions for the
             duration of the study.

          7. Have normal physical examination and laboratory test results at Screening. If
             abnormal, the finding(s) must be deemed not clinically significant by the Treating
             Clinician.

          8. Ability to speak and understand English sufficiently to allow for the completion of
             all study assessments.

          9. Ability to obtain written informed consent from the participant, if developmentally
             appropriate. If a participant does not have the capacity to consent, ability to obtain
