      This trial is a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial
      comparing a treatment algorithm consisting of a limited number of clinical parameters, rapid
      molecular viral diagnostics, and serum procalcitonin testing to standard of care for
      directing antibiotic use in patients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection.
      The reduction in antibiotic use in those subjects randomized to the treatment algorithm
      compared to those randomized to standard care will be determined.

      This is trial is a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial
      comparing a treatment algorithm consisting of a limited number of clinical parameters, rapid
      molecular viral diagnostics, and serum procalcitonin testing to standard of care for
      directing antibiotic use in patients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection.
      The reduction in antibiotic use in those subjects randomized to the treatment algorithm
      compared to those randomized to standard care will be determined. In addition, the added
      benefit of viral diagnosis to that of serum procalcitonin alone in reducing antibiotics will
      be determined. Lastly, antibiotic related complications and clinical outcomes to determine
      the safety of this approach at 30 days and 3 months in the standard care and intervention
      group will be evaluated. Analysis of the composite adverse event outcome (death, intensive
      care unit transfer, disease specific complications and recurrent respiratory tract infection
      requiring hospitalization) will serve as the principle safety analysis for the study. In
      addition, each adverse outcome will be examined individually as well as lesser adverse
      outcomes including antibiotic prescriptions, time to return to baseline health, patient
      reported outcomes and functional status at 30 days and 3 months. Physicians will be queried
      to determine factors which drive antibiotic prescriptions and potential barriers to
      implementing antibiotic reduction algorithms. These data will be used to design a phase III
      clinical trial with the intent to demonstrate that physicians in the US will respond
      appropriately to this information and that antibiotic use can be significantly and safely
      curtailed.

    <description>The primary patient-level outcome is the number of days on antibiotics after randomization. The primary null hypothesis is that the distribution of the number of days on antibiotics is identical for the standard-of-care versus intervention arm, where the latter includes those patients for whom the PCT-intervention recommendation was overruled by the care team.</description>

    <description>The secondary analyses will compare the following outcome variables between the intervention and the standard care group. Outcome variables will include total antibiotic related complications, length of hospitalization, a composite of 30 day and 3 month adverse events (death, ICU transfer, disease specific complications [development of pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema or ARDS] and recurrent LRTI requiring hospitalization).</description>
