  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BRAVO study seeks to determine if dietary supplementation with omega-3 highly unsaturated
      fatty acids (omega-3 HUFAs) reduces the risk for serious suicidal behaviors, suicidal
      thinking, negative emotions, and symptoms associated with suicide risk, in a Veteran and
      non-Veteran population that is at risk for suicidal behaviors. This study seeks to evaluate
      the efficacy of omega-3 HUFAs among a representative population of US Veterans and
      non-Veterans already receiving appropriate medical care so that if successful, these results
      can be readily applied to broader populations in the US.

      The BRAVO study seeks to determine if dietary supplementation with omega-3 highly unsaturated
      fatty acids (omega-3 HUFAs) reduces the risk for serious suicidal behaviors, suicidal
      thinking, negative emotions, and symptoms associated with suicide risk, in a Veteran and
      non-Veteran population that is at risk for suicidal behaviors. Changes in cognitive processes
      specific to suicide risk will be evaluated, including implicit associations, response
      inhibition and sustained attention. Sub-analyses will evaluate efficacy in reducing
      depressive symptoms, alcohol and nicotine use among Veterans and non-Veterans with
      concomitant significant depressive symptoms, and alcohol and nicotine use disorders. In
      addition, a sub-study will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate
      the neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects of the omega-3 HUFAs. This study seeks
      to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 HUFAs among a representative population of US Veterans
      and non-Veterans already receiving appropriate medical care so that if successful, these
      results can be readily applied to broader populations in the US.
