  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective randomized double-blind study is to evaluate the added
      analgesic value of clonidine to the conventional local bupivacaine wound infiltration in
      posterior spine surgery.

    <textblock>
      Patients candidates to posterior spine surgery (Micro-discectomy, Lumbar laminectomy with or
      without fusion, cervical laminectomy) are asked to participate to this prospective study.
      After verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients consenting to enter the
      study are randomly assigned to one of the following subgroups: 1-Pre-incisional wound
      infiltration with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. 2- Pre-incisional wound infiltration with 150
      μg of clonidine with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. Demographic parameters, co-morbidities and
      other pre and per operative medical data are noted. In the post-operative period, patients
      received a standardized post-operative analgesic protocol (NSAI and paracetamol). Patients
      are asked to fill their pain diary using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from day 0 till day 8
      after surgery. Morphine rescue consumption is noted. Finally, the percentage of global
      subjective patient satisfaction regarding the post-operative wound pain is noted from 0 to
      100.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Area under curve</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of surgery till the 8th postoperative day (9 days and 8 nights=200h</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is assessed on numeric rating scale (NRS) 8times/day during the first 3 days, 3times/day during the next 6days and one mean value during the night. The mean intensity of daily pain is obtained from the different values mentioned during day and night corrected by the duration covered by every value. It may vary from 0 to 10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under Curve (AUC) of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Calculated at Day 0-2, Day3-5, Day6-8 and all along the follow-up from Day0 till Day8</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC during an interval (in days) is calculated by adding the different values of pain assessed during day and night multiplied by the duration (in hours) of sufferance from this amount of pain. The AUC during an interval is proportional to the mean intensity of pain suffered during the same interval. It is expressed in pain unit multiplied by hour</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily rescue opiates consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>From the day of surgery till the 3rd postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>The unit of rescue opiates consumption equals the administration of 5mg of morphine subcutaneously. The minimum interval between 2 rescue opiates consumption is 6 hours. Thus, the rescue opiates consumption may vary from 0 to 4/day.</description>

    <measure>Global subjective patient satisfaction of post-operative wound pain control</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at the end of follow-up on Day 8</time_frame>
