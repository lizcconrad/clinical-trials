      This study is to confirm the potential effects and assess the safety of a new bio-product
      Pegylated Recombinant Consensus Interferon Variant Solution for Injection (PEG-IFN-SA) and
      Ribavirin（RBV） in the treatment of Chronic hepatitis C who have not been previously treated
      with Interferon.

    <textblock>
      Total 720 subjects are divided into two groups and treated separately according to the HCV
      genotype（genotype 2,3 and non-genotype 2,3). With 2:1 ratio between experimental group and
      positive-control group (Peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) plus RBV), 216 subjects for genotype
      2,3 and 504 subjects for non-genotype2,3 will be enrolled. Accordingly, PEG-IFN-SA once
      weekly and RBV twice a day (bid) are given for 24 weeks and 48 weeks respectively to the HCV
      genotype 2,3 and the HCV non-genotype 2,3 .
