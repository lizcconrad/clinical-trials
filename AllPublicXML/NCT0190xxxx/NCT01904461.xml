    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study is to prove:

        -  the equivalence of the number of post-operation hemorrhages, and maybe a decrease of the
           number of secondary hemorrhages

        -  the decrease of pain and quicker re-feeding

        -  an easier haemostasis

        -  the simplification of the tonsillectomy surgical kit

        -  the decrease of dissection time
