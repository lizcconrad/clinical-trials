      The objective of this study is to investigate the acceptance, intake, and compliance of
      protein enriched bread and protein enriched yoghurt drinks in elderly patients in two real
      life settings (short term; hospital, and longer term; rehabilitation home).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence rates of protein-energy malnutrition in elderly are high. In order to prevent loss
      of muscle mass and remain physically independent, it is utmost important for elderly to
      maintain their body protein mass. A sufficient protein supply according to their needs is
      therefore highly important. Especially for frail elderly, it is not easy to realize an
      increased protein intake by simply eating more. It is hypothesized that protein enriched food
      products that fit in a habitual diet (dairy and bread), result in a higher protein intake
      compared to regular products.
