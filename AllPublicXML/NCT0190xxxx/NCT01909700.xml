      Objectives: To evaluate whether the use of single incision un-anchored small mesh implants is
      feasible, safe and effective for women with moderate pelvic organ prolapse.

      Design: Patients diagnosed with moderate pelvic organ prolapse were enrolled to undergo a
      single incision un-anchored mesh operation. Follow-up was 4 to 23 months. The outcome
      measures for this study were the operative safety and post-operative pain, adverse effects
      and anatomical as well as functional cure.

      Setting: The operations were performed under general anesthesia according with the reported
      surgical techniques at university and private hospitals.
