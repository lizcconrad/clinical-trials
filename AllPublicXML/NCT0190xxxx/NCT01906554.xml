  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eggs contain an essential nutrient called choline and adequate levels of choline are required
      for good health. Studies in mice have demonstrated that high levels of choline may increase
      risk of heart disease through a process that involves the breakdown of choline by gut
      bacteria. Previous research did not show that human consumption of eggs increases risk of
      heart disease. This study is designed to investigate whether the number of eggs in the diet
      affects blood and urine markers for heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diets low in choline have adverse health consequences, while observations in humans and
      experiments in mouse models suggest that a diet containing too much choline or
      phosphatidylcholine may activate inflammatory pathways and increase cardiovascular disease
      risk through bacterial conversion of choline to trimethylamine (TMA) and its subsequent
      oxidation to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver. What is unclear is whether choline
      and phosphatidylcholine in eggs is a source of TMAO formation, and if so how many eggs must
      be eaten before enough TMAO is generated to cause increased oxidized LDL (a biomarker for
      atherosclerosis mechanisms). We hypothesize that TMAO will only be formed from eggs when very
      large quantities are ingested and that TMAO formation will vary greatly between individuals
      for any given dietary exposure. This variability will be determined by 1) the dose at which
      dietary choline or phosphatidylcholine exceeds the absorptive capacity of the volunteer's
      small intestine and therefore spills into large intestine where gut bacteria have access to
      it and 2) the bacterial populations that constitute the volunteer's microbiome.
