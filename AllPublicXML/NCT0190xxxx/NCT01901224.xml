  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if taking Metformin improves
      walking ability in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD the arteries
      (blood vessels) in the legs are narrowed because of the build up of plaque. The leg muscle
      can hurt in patients with PAD and this is usually described as a cramp or tiredness. This
      pain is called intermittent claudication. Metformin is an FDA approved medication for the
      treatment of diabetes. The investigators believe that Metformin may help your leg muscles
      work better.

      The investigators will enroll up to 100 subjects in order to find 60 subjects with PAD at
      Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis that affects more than
      7 million adults in the US. The prevalence of PAD increases with age and is estimated to be
      15 20% among individuals 65 years of age and older. Patients with PAD have limited functional
      capacity; they walk more slowly and have less walking endurance than persons who do not have
      PAD, irrespective of whether they have classic symptoms of intermittent claudication or
      critical limb ischemia. This functional impairment adversely affects quality of life.
      Although flow limitation due to atherosclerotic stenosis is necessary for the development of
      symptoms in PAD, the lack of correlation between walking capacity and the degree of
      hemodynamic compromise raises the possibility that alternative mechanisms contribute to
      functional limitations in these patients. Putative mechanisms include inadequate skeletal
      muscle glucose uptake, altered skeletal muscle energetics, and impaired vasomotor tone and
      nutrient delivery mediated by endothelial dysfunction. Metformin, via AMPactivated protein
      kinase (AMPK)-dependent and independent mechanisms, can favorably affect skeletal muscle
      metabolic functions including glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial function,
      and consequently cellular energetics, and it also may have a direct salutary effect on
      vascular function via regulation of nitric oxide synthase. It is intriguing, therefore, to
      consider the possibility that metformin would improve skeletal muscle metabolic and vascular
      function in older patients with PAD and translate into functional benefits. Accordingly, the
      investigators seek to elucidate molecular mechanisms through which metformin affects skeletal
      muscle energetics and hypothesize that metformin will lead to advantageous metabolic,
      vascular, and physical functional changes in older patients with PAD.

    <measure>Percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will undergo percutaneous skeletal muscle biopsy from the gastrocnemius muscle at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with metformin or placebo. We will evaluate changes in candidate gene expression linked to mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic function in skeletal muscle, mitochondrial morphology and function, and levels of cellular metabolites related to oxidative metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In parallel, using 31P MRS, we will measure PCr content and PCr recovery time at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with metformin or placebo as an in vivo measure of mitochondrial function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in brachial artery diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using high resolution B mode ultrasonography, we will measure flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the brachial artery, a measure of nitric oxide bioavailability. In addition, using a novel technique employing endothelial cell biopsy, we will determine changes in levels of eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS, AKT, phosphorylated AKT, NADPH subunit p47phox, nitrotyrosine formation, and protein sulfenation in isolated endothelial cells derived from endovenous biopsy at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with metformin or placebo as complementary ex vivo measures of endothelial function.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise treadmill testing</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will obtain pilot data to determine whether 12 weeks of treatment with metformin compared with placebo improves exercise capacity in older patients with PAD. Assessment of functional capacity will include maximal treadmill walking time, pain-free treadmill walking time, oxygen consumption, and the six minute walk test. We anticipate that our investigations will identify a novel role for metformin for the treatment of symptomatic PAD that will form the basis of a future larger scale clinical trial, and will uncover mechanisms that may foster development of new therapies for this prevalent disease in older persons.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner to 1) metformin 1000 mg twice daily or 2) matching placebo twice daily. In order to avoid gastrointestinal side effects, the starting dose of metformin will be 500 mg twice daily. After one week, the dose will be increased to 1000 mg twice daily (as two 500 mg tablets twice daily). In order to maintain blinding during the titration period, individuals randomized to placebo will receive one placebo tablet twice daily for one week, followed by an increase to 2 placebo tablets twice daily. Subjects will be instructed to take medications with breakfast and with dinner. All outcome measurements will be made at baseline and 12 weeks following randomization.</description>
