  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market clinical investigation is to complete preliminary evaluation
      on whether or not concomitant renal denervation with the EnligHTN™ Renal Denervation System
      and cardiac ablation will result in improved outcomes as compared to ablation alone in
      patients with uncontrolled hypertension being treated for Atrial Fibrillation
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post market, prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized study of the EnligHTN™ Renal
      Denervation System in conjunction with atrial fibrillation ablation. Up to one hundred
      subjects with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled hypertension will
      be enrolled in the study. All subjects will undergo cardiac ablation for the treatment of
      atrial fibrillation. Per the 2:1 randomization, a minimum of 50 or 2/3 of the total patient
      cohort will also undergo renal artery ablation. Subjects will be followed up to years (2)
      years post procedure.
