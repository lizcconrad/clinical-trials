      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer and from healthy participants
      in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood samples from patients with prostate cancer
      and from healthy participants to identify a polymorphism that may help in the study of
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of the D104N COL18A1 polymorphism in patients with prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of this polymorphism in African-American patients with prostate
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study.

      DNA is extracted from preexisting serum samples and polymerase chain reaction is performed to
      determine the genotype pattern.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients and 250 healthy participants will be accrued for
      this study.
