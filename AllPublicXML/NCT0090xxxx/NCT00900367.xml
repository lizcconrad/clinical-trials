      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about nutrition-related changes that identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors predict a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at nutrition-related biomarkers in predicting
      breast cancer risk in women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To complete characterization of metabolic serotypes based on the metabolome, and to
           adapt these profiles for human epidemiological studies.

        -  To determine the extent to which metabolic profiles that are reflective of or
           independent of long-term caloric intake predict breast cancer risk in nested
           case-control studies.

        -  To identify critical serum metabolites.

      OUTLINE: Laboratory studies, including metabolome profiling by high performance liquid
      chromatography; and small molecule identification by mass spectroscopy, are performed on
      previously collected blood samples.

  <biospec_descr>
    <textblock>
      we have only plasma, NHS has DNA samples.

      Study is nested case control, so retrospective with respect to individual inclusion,
      prospective with respect to sample collected before disease. Enrollment is approximate as it
      includes samples that will be drpped, eg for QC resons
