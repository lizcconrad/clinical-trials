      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known
      whether whole-breast radiation therapy is more effective when given with or without
      additional radiation therapy to the tumor in treating patients with ductal carcinoma in situ.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying breast-conserving surgery followed by
      whole-breast radiation therapy to see how well it works when given with or without additional
      radiation therapy to the tumor in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate and compare local recurrence-free survival of women with ductal breast
           carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast
           irradiation with vs without a radiation tumor bed boost.

      Secondary

        -  Compare relapse-free survival between the two arms.

        -  Compare overall survival.

        -  Compare acute and late toxicities.

        -  Compare cosmetic results and quality of life.

        -  Identify patients at risk for late toxicities using a biological test.

      Tertiary

        -  Store blood samples at the CEPH (French Center of the Human Polymorphism Center) for
           polymorphism analyses.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. All patients undergo breast-conserving surgery (after a
      single intervention or second excision) with a margin ≥ 1 mm. A superficial or deep margin is
      acceptable if the surgery has left the skin tissue or the fascia pectoral muscle,
      respectively. Twelve weeks later, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo whole breast irradiation (WBI) once daily, 5 days a week for 5
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo WBI as in arm I. Patients also undergo a radiation tumor bed
           boost once daily for 8 fractions (weekdays only) over 2 weeks.

      Quality of life will be assessed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually for 10 years.
