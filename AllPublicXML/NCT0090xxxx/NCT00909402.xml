    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-833923
      administered in combination with Cisplatin and Capecitabine as first-line therapy in subjects
      with inoperable metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal or esophageal adenocarcinomas.
