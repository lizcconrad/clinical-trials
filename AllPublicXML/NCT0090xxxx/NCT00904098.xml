    <textblock>
      Females 18 years of age or older with at least one year history of menstrual migraine (MM)
      headaches participated in a Phase 4 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of frovatriptan
      when used at the early stage (International Headache Society [IHS] Grade 1) of MM compared
      with patients' current treatment.

    <description>This study employed a prospective, non-randomized, open-label single-sequence design. The study was conducted in two phases:
A Usual Care phase (approximately 1 month in duration) included one menstrual period during which female patients treated all episodes of migraine headaches using their current treatment (referred to as the Baseline phase in the protocol)
An Acute Treatment phase (approximately 1 month in duration), following the Usual Care phase, included one menstrual period during which female patients used frovatriptan 2.5 mg to treat all episodes of migraine headache when their headache reached IHS Grade 1. If needed, a second dose of frovatriptan 2.5 mg was administered; however, this second dose could not be administered within 2 hours of the initial dose (i.e., there must have been at least 2 hours between doses of frovatriptan). The total daily dose of frovatriptan was not to exceed 3 tablets over a 24-hour period.</description>
