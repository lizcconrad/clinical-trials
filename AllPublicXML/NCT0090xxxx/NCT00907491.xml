  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is part of the defense mechanism to protect the lung from foreign particles and remove
      secretions from the airways. However, at times it becomes a bothersome, annoying symptom that
      interferes with the quality of life, sleep pattern and exercise tolerance of the patient.

      People with respiratory infection, asthmatic patients and CF patients suffer from a multitude
      of pathologies of airways and are often inflicted with chronic cough.

      Treatment of cough in these patients consists of many types of expectorants, cough
      suppressors, secretion modifiers, inhaled bronchodilators etc. In addition, chest physical
      therapy (PT) is often prescribed as part of the treatment regime.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and validity of novel cough
      counting device based on the WIM Technology.
