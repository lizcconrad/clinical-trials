      RATIONALE: Studying samples of sputum and tissue in the laboratory from patients with
      dysplasia or cancer and from normal volunteers may help doctors identify and learn more about
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in patients with respiratory tract
      dysplasia or lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or aerodigestive tract cancer and in normal
      volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine intermediate biomarkers of premalignant respiratory epithelial lesions, such
           as genetic mutations or altered growth factor expression, in patients with dysplasia of
           the respiratory epithelium or lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or aerodigestive tract
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Establish a tissue repository of normal and dysplastic respiratory epithelium from
           endobronchial forceps and brush biopsy tissue from these patients and from normal
           volunteers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to presence of extensive and severe dysplasia of
      the respiratory epithelium (yes vs no).

      Participants undergo sputum cytology, white-light (with or without fluorescence)
      bronchoscopy, and endobronchial biopsies. Participants also undergo endobronchial brushings
      and bronchial secretion collection and possibly bronchoalveolar lavage. Collected samples are
      processed by hematoxylin, eosin, and immunohistochemical staining and analyzed for specific
      biomarkers. Unused samples are stored in the tissue bank.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 participants will be accrued for this study.
