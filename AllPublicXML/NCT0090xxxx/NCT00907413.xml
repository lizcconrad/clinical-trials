  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a phase III double arm, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical
      trial comparing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting plus
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) versus ERCP with stenting alone in adult patients with
      unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.

      The study objectives are to investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in
      increasing the survival time of patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma and to assess
      the effect of PDT on both cholestasis and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

    <description>Photodynamic Therapy is a new therapeutic approach that specifically targets neoplastic cells. This therapy has been used in other tumors as a local treatment and involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent followed by activation of the agent by illumination with non-thermal light of a specific wavelength, resulting in cell death from direct cytotoxicity and ischemic necrosis. Cytotoxicity is directly proportional to tissue oxygenation.</description>

               -  Patient's creatinine ≤ 3 mg/dL within 30 days of treatment

          -  Patient has the ability to understand and the willingness to comply with the study
             procedures and provide written informed consent to participate in the study
