      Background/Aims: The Periotest® method represents a technique for objective tooth mobility
      assessment. The aims of this study were: 1. receiving information about normal Periotest®
      values in vertical and horizontal dimension on periodontally healthy teeth for individuals
      aged 20-35, 2. investigating the reliability of the Periotest® method in terms of
      intra-serial and inter-serial reproducibility before splinting and with an applied dental
      trauma splint, 3. evaluating the splint effect of two different wire-composite splints in
      vivo.

      Materials and Methods: On periodontally healthy dental students (n=33; mean age 24.7 years)
      Periotest® values were measured on reproducible measuring points, in vertical and horizontal
      dimension and before splinting and after splint insertion. Three readings were taken per
      serial to observe the intra-serial reproducibility, and for testing inter-serial
      reproducibility three serials were measured (Friedman-test; P ≤ 0.001). Two different
      wire-composite-splints (1 = Dentaflex 0.45 mm, 2 = Strengtheners 0.8x1.8) were inserted, the
      Periotest® values were measured and the splint effects were calculated and compared
      (Whitney-Mann-U-test; P ≤ 0.001).
