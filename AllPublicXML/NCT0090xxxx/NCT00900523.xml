      RATIONALE: Measuring the amount of prostaglandin metabolite in urine samples and studying
      tissue samples in the laboratory from patients with ovarian cancer may help doctors identify
      and learn more about biomarkers related to ovarian cancer and may help the study of cancer in
      the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is measuring the amount of prostaglandin metabolite in urine
      samples from patients with ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the level of prostaglandin E_2 metabolite (PGE-M) in 24-hour urine samples
           collected prior to surgery or chemotherapy from patients with ovarian cancer.

        -  Determine cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression by western
           blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ovarian tumor tissue samples and matched normal
           ovarian tissue samples, if available, from these patients.

        -  Correlate urine PGE-M levels with corresponding tissue COX-1 and COX-2 levels in urine
           and tissue samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients submit 24-hour urine specimens prior to surgery for evaluation of urinary levels of
      prostaglandin E_2 metabolite (PGE-M).

      Patients also undergo assessment of tissue obtained at the time of surgery, including ovarian
      tumor tissue, normal surface ovarian epithelium tissue (if available), and fixed tissue
      embedded in a paraffin block. Tissue samples are analyzed by western blot and IHC for
      cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 expression.
