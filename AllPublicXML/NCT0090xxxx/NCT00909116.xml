    <textblock>
      Obstructed Defecation Syndrome (ODS) describes a condition which is characterized by chronic
      constipation. The symptoms of ODS include abdominal pain or cramping, irregular bowel
      frequency and the feeling of not having emptied the rectum. ODS is usually associated with
      internal rectal prolapse and/or rectocele. For surgical treatment of ODS, a plethora of
      surgical techniques have been described with no one method having been assessed as a gold
      standard.

      A new surgical procedure - Transtar - has been introduced in Europe recently. The goal of
      this registry is to assess safety, effectiveness and patient quality of life, associated with
      Transtar for chronic constipation due to morphological changes, such as internal rectal
      prolapse and rectocele.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with obstructed defecation, fragmented defecation or incomplete evacuation as
             a presenting symptom documented by a standardized symptom score

          -  confirmed internal rectal prolapse or rectocele on dynamic defecography

          -  adequate external sphincter on rectal digital examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any other surgical procedure than STARR for ODS

          -  Subjects in whom STARR is not performed with the Contour Transtar stapler

          -  Subjects with a physical or psychological condition which would impair participation
             in the registry.
