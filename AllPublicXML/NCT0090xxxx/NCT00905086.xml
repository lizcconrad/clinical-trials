      RATIONALE: Gathering information about psychological and social adjustment after radiation
      therapy in patients with cancer may help doctors plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying psychosocial adjustment after radiation therapy in
      patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, or prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe psychosocial adjustment after radiotherapy in patients with stage I, II, or
           III breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer.

        -  To determine if cognitive appraisal of health predicts psychosocial adjustment of these
           patients after radiotherapy.

        -  To examine whether social support moderates the relationship between cognitive appraisal
           of health and psychosocial adjustment of these patients after radiotherapy.

        -  To examine whether self-efficacy for coping with cancer moderates the relationship
           between cognitive appraisal of health and psychosocial adjustment of these patients
           after radiotherapy.

        -  To measure the effect of symptom distress, uncertainty, medical factors, and personal
           factors on cognitive appraisal of health of these patients before ending radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Two weeks before completing planned radiotherapy, patients undergo assessment of
      stress appraisal and other factors predictive of post-radiotherapy psychosocial adjustment.
      Patients complete psychosocial assessments, including measures of patient perceptions of
      their illness (i.e., cognitive appraisal) and of the factors influencing their perceptions
      (i.e., uncertainty by the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale-Community Form; symptom
      distress by the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form; and comorbidity by the Charlson
      Comorbidity Index). Measures of patient social support and self-efficacy for coping are also
      assessed. At 1 month after completion of radiotherapy, patients undergo repeat assessment of
      stress appraisal and psychosocial adjustment.
