      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      administration of Oxycyte in patients with severe non-penetrating traumatic brain injury
      (TBI).

      In the first dose level (Cohort 1), 11 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 1.0
      mL/kg Oxycyte (0.6 g/kg; n=8) or NS (n=3). A total of 8 patients received Oxycyte. The Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the safety data for patients in Cohort 1 through Day
      14, and approved escalation to the next dose.

      In Cohort 2, 18 patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either 2.0 mL/kg Oxycyte (1.2
      g/kg; n=12) or NS (n=6). The DSMB will then review the safety data for all patients in Cohort
      2 through Day 14 and either approve escalation to the highest dose or remain at the current
      dose. If remaining at the current dose level (Cohort 2) an additional 50 patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to Oxycyte (n=25) or NS (n=25) and treated.

      If escalation occurs to Cohort 3, 18 patients would be randomized 2:1 to Oxycyte (n=12) or NS
      (n=6) to receive the 3.0 mL/kg dose. The DSMB would again review the safety data and decide
      whether to treat an additional 50 patients at this dose or to decrease the dose back to 2.0
      mL/kg. This group would be randomized 1:1 to receive Oxycyte (n=25) or NS.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, single dose, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Oxycyte in patients with severe non-penetrating
      Traumatic Brain Injury administered in conjunction with 50% to 80% oxygen and standard of
      care treatment.

      At each dose level, patients receiving Oxycyte will be compared to a control group of
      patients who will receive Normal Saline (NS); all patients will receive 50% oxygen or
      greater, if per standard of care for a particular patient based on his / her condition, up to
      a maximum of 80%.

      Ischemic brain damage is found in 80% of patients who die from severe head injury and studies
      have shown that early, transient cerebral hypoperfusion of unknown origin is present in about
      40% of these patients. In several early research studies, it is documented that about
      one-third of severe head injured patients have reduced brain oxygen tension (&lt;25 mm Hg)
      especially during the first 6 to 12 hours following severe head injury. In this group of
      patients with low brain oxygen, the clinical prognosis is poor with death being a frequent
      outcome.

      Based on a belief that increased brain oxygen levels would prove beneficial in the TBI
      patient, it is theorized that perfluorocarbon-enhanced oxygen delivery may provide the same
      or greater benefit. PFCs are especially attractive in this setting for several reasons;
      first, because they transport oxygen without the need for erythrocytes and hemoglobin and can
      thus perfuse and oxygenate &quot;peri-contusional&quot; brain tissue in which it has been shown that
      capillaries are so narrowed as to impede red blood cell (RBC) transport; secondly,
      perfluorocarbon (PFCs) actually increase oxygen transport and oxygen tension in the tissues,
      which cannot be achieved with normobaric hyperoxia alone.

          -  Male or female 18 - 70 years of age (inclusive) at the time of study entry

          -  Weight â‰¥45 kg

          -  Able to begin the infusion of study drug within 12 hours of injury

          -  Evidence of severe non-penetrating traumatic brain injury by clinical evaluation,
             clinical indication for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, Glasgow Coma Scale
             (GCS) assessment (4-8 prior to randomization, obtained any time prior to dosing and
             including patients who deteriorate to severe TBI after arrival in the hospital, not
             including times when the patient is pharmacologically paralyzed for management or
             treatment) and with definite anatomic signs of injury on head CT scan (e.g., Marshall

          -  At least one reactive pupil at screening. Just prior to study drug administration
             pupil reactivity must be confirmed again. If the patient is in the peri-postoperative
             period at that time and reactivity is difficult to assess due to small pupil size, the
             Investigator will determine if the patient is eligible based on clinical presentation.

          -  If a patient, due to his or her injuries is unable to provide written informed
             consent, then written consent may be obtained by an appropriate surrogate decision
             maker in accordance with preapproved procedures in compliance with local regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:
