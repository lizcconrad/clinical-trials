      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a Lapatinib plus Caelyx combination
      therapy as an effective and safe therapeutic regimen with a favourable cardiotoxicity
      profile, in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer following failure of prior trastuzumab.

          -  History of other malignancy; patients who have been disease-free for 5 years

          -  Concurrent cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic
             therapy) or concurrent treatment with an investigational drug or participation in
             another clinical trial
