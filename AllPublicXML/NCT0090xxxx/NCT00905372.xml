  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related degenerative disorder of the brain, characterized
      by progressive decline in cognitive function and ability to perform activities of daily
      living, and ultimately can lead to death due to complications of the disease. AD is thought
      to be caused by an excess of A-Beta amyloid, a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid
      plaques. Treatments that slow the synthesis or deposition of A-Beta amyloid, or that increase
      clearance, might be expected to slow the progression of AD.

      LY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized anti-A Beta peptide immunoglobulin G-1 (IgG1)
      monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of AD. The primary hypothesis being
      tested is that LY2062430 will slow cognitive and functional decline in AD as compared with
      placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 19 months. Patients taking
      approved AD medications may participate in this study and continue taking these medications
      during the study.
