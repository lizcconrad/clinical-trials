      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide
      when given together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in treating patients with
      recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Phase I - Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when combined with fixed dose
           pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with recurrent ovarian
           epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      Phase II - Define the best overall response induced by lenalidomide in recurrent ovarian
      cancer patients

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary information on toxicity, response, and time to progression
           (duration of response) of these patients.

        -  Progression free survival

      Phase I OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide. Patients receive oral
      lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II OUTLINE: The phase II component will include patients with measurable disease per
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria treated at lenalidomide 10 mg
      days 1-28 days of a 28 day cycle (Maximum Tolerated Dose from phase I) with liposomal
      doxorubicin 40 mg/m^2 to determine efficacy and safety of the combination therapy. (Effective
      with April 2010 revision)

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

    <measure>Phase 1 - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Lenalidomide When Combined With Fixed Dose Liposomal Doxorubicin in Women With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>1 cycle (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reflects the highest dose of Lenalidomide when combined with fixed dose Liposomal Doxorubicin at which no more than one out of 6 participants experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1 - Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 5 weeks of starting treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DLT is defined as the inability to complete cycle 1 and/or begin cycle 2 within 7 days of the planned start due to a grade 4 or greater hemtologic toxicity or a grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity. Grading was based on Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 4.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2 - Number of Subjects Achieving a Partial or Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after starting treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Partial response is defined as:
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. To be assigned a status of partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four weeks after the criteria for response are first met.
Complete response is defined as:
The disappearance of all target lesions. To be assigned a status of complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four weeks after the criteria for response are first met.</description>

    <description>Progression is defined as:
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s).</description>
