      The Eu-IGFD is a descriptive, multicenter, observational, prospective, open-ended, non
      interventional, post-authorisation surveillance registry. The purpose of this study is to
      collect long-term safety information on the use of recombinant DNA-derived human Insulin-like
      Growth Factor-1 (rhIGF-I) Increlex® replacement therapy for the treatment of children with
      growth failure.

      Surveillance registry, defined as a post-authorisation observational registry, called the
      Eu-IGFD {European Increlex® (Mecasermin [rDNA Origin] Injection) Growth Forum Database} which
      is intended primarily to monitor the safety of Increlex® replacement therapy in children with
      growth failure and secondly to follow the effectiveness of this treatment. Patients who have
      already started Increlex® therapy before entering this observational registry may be included
      in this registry and data will be collected retrospectively.

      The countries participating in this registry are Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
      The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.
