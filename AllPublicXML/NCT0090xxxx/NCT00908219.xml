  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using Bevacizumab in the
      prevention of recurrent malignant ascites.

      Ascites is a debilitating and unpleasant complication of several types of cancer. Animal and
      laboratory studies have shown that tumor cell production and/or increases in the amount of
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a major cause of the formation of malignant
      ascites. Therefore, giving patients with malignant ascites a drug that targets and
      neutralizes VEGF should prevent the recurrence of malignant ascites following paracentesis (a
      procedure to remove fluid from the abdominal cavity).

      All subjects will be treated with an intravenous infusion of the experimental drug
      (Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for a total of twelve (12) weeks on study. The primary
      endpoint will be time to the need for repeat abdominal paracentesis after the start of
      therapy. Secondary endpoints will include an analysis of the mean number of paracenteses
      required in each subject over the course of 3 months, determination of the repeat
      paracentesis response rate (proportion of subjects who have a doubling in baseline time to
      repeat paracentesis) and an assessment of the effect of treatment on quality of life using a
      subject questionnaire.
