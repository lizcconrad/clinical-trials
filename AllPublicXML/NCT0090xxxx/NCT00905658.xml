      RATIONALE: Learning about the effect of nutritional supplements on quality of life in
      patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer may help doctors plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying nutritional supplements to see how well
      they work in improving quality of life during first-line chemotherapy in patients with
      metastatic gynecologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Measure quality of life (QLQ-C30) at week 18 in patients with metastatic gynecological
           cancer receiving systematic nutritional supplements during first-line chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Study the maintenance or improvement of intake and nutritional status.

        -  Study the quality of life during chemotherapy.

        -  Evaluate tolerance and compliance to treatment with nutritional supplements.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of and the tolerance to chemotherapy.

        -  Measure the overall survival over 18 weeks.

        -  Analyze the cost-effectiveness of different strategies of nutritional care.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are monitored via standard follow-up assessments every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive nutritional supplements and are monitored via standard
           follow-up assessments every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive nutritional supplements and are monitored via standard
           follow-up assessments every 3 weeks with additional biweekly assessments completed at
           home by a service provider.
