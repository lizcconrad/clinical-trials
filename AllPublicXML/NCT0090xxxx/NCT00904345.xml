  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase II trial to characterize the clinical outcome of standard of
      care, cetuximab concurrent with radiation, in a special population (head and neck cancer
      patients who cannot tolerate concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to advanced age, poor
      performance status or concurrent illness), and to determine if biomarker response to a
      loading dose of cetuximab is predictive of that outcome.

      Primary Objective 1: Determine changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling and novel
      phosphoproteins following a loading dose of cetuximab in patients who are poor candidates for
      chemoradiation (age =70 years or with significant co-morbidities) and are therefore treated
      with cetuximab with radiation.

      Primary Objective 2: Characterize clinical outcomes, including local recurrence,
      progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients, and correlate these
      clinical outcomes with the changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling, and novel
      phosphoproteins.

      Primary Objective 3: Describe the toxicity, in particular mucositis/dysphagia, of this
      regimen.

      Secondary Objective 1: Conduct normal mucosa EGFR assessment for comparison with tumor
      sample.

      Secondary Objective 2: Correlate HPV presence and titer with p53 status and clinical outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically-confirmed, previously untreated, clinically
             accessible (without general anesthesia) locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of
             the larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, or nonresectable head and neck
