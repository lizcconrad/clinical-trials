          -  Male or female subjects, 20 years of age or older at screening visit.

          -  Subjects must meet DSM-IV/COWS1,2 criteria for opiate dependence. (COWS total score
             ≥5)

          -  Subjects must have a positive urine drug screen (dipstick test) for an opiate or
             morphine at study entry

          -  Subject is seeking treatment with the desire to discontinue opiate use as an initial
             goal but willing to consider and accept longer treatment if necessary.

          -  Subject is in good physical health or, if he/she has a medical condition needing
             ongoing treatment, must be in the care of a physician who is willing to take
             responsibility for such treatment and work with the study physician. Study physicians
             able to manage the subject for his/her general medical condition, may be assigned this

          -  Subjects have clinically significant liver disease.

          -  Subjects who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or
             naloxone.

             tobacco) to the point of requiring immediate medical attention.

          -  Subjects received methadone treatment within the last 30 days since screening visit.

          -  Subjects have any pending legal action that could prohibit continued participation.

          -  Subjects have participated in other clinical studies within the past 30 days.
