    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of escitalopram after 12 weeks of
      treatment in patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), to evaluate proportion of patients
      who respond to escitalopram during the treatment period, and to evaluate safety of
      escitalopram.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in Russia, as an open-label, uncontrolled, one arm trial. The
      patients will receive escitalopram for 12 weeks. Start and maintenance dosages as well as
      dose titration will be left to the investigators' decision (5 to 20 mg/day), in accordance
      with the national Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC).
