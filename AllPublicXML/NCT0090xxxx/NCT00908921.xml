    <description>The treatment period is 16 weeks with 5 visits: at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16. At every visit if Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) &gt;7.0mmol/L the Glimepiride dosage is increased from 1mg to 2mg or 2mg to 4mg.
At every visit if FBG&lt;3.9mmol/L the Glimepiride dosage is decreased from 4mg to 2mg or 2mg to 1mg.
Patients who have been on 4mg for 4 weeks and FBG&gt;11.0mmol/L at visit, another treatment can be added at the physician's discretion.</description>
