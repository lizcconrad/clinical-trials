  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients who are undergoing
      Biventricular (BiV) Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) implantation in whom
      optimization of atrioventricular (AV) delay is not possible due to prolonged
      inter-atrial/intra-atrial delay. These patients would benefit from left atrial pacing, and if
      a significant number of patients fall into this group, it may be beneficial to develop a left
      atrial lead.

      This is a prospective observational study. Patients referred for BiV-ICD implantation or
      upgrade will be implanted as is routinely done, with the following modifications:

        -  Electrical readings will be taken at various points in the procedure.

        -  The RA lead will temporarily be placed on the atrial septum for these readings (normally
           it is actively fixed to the RA appendage wall). The final RA lead position will be
           actively fixed to the RA appendage wall as is standard practice.

        -  The CS lead will be placed in the proximal coronary sinus for these readings prior to
           passing it distally to pace the LV.

        -  Patients will undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 30 days post-procedure. This
           will be coordinated to coincide with their standard 30-day follow-up appointment.

      Conduction times between the left atrium and right atrium (inter-atrial conduction time) will
      be measured at the time of implant, and left atrial contraction time will be measured by TTE
      at the follow-up appointment. For patients in whom the inter-atrial conduction time plus the
      left atrial contraction time is greater than the right-atrial to right-ventricular conduction
      time, it is not possible to optimize the AV delay. The proportion of patients who fall into
      this group will be the main endpoint of the study. Patients will be followed for this study
      until their follow-up appointment and TTE at 30 days post-implant. The total sample size of
      this study will be 50 patients. We expect to consent approximately 75 patients, expecting
      that 1/3 will not meet all entrance criteria or will withdraw early.
