      The objective of this study was to compare the single-dose relative bioavailability of
      Ranbaxy and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical (Topamax®) 25 mg topiramate tablets following a 50 mg
      dose under fed conditions.

      This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover, relative bioavailability
      study performed on 18 healthy adult male volunteers. A total of 17 subjects completed the
      clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before
      dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw. Subjects were to return for the 48-, 72-, 96- and
      120-hour blood draws. Both periods were separated by a washout period of 14 days.

             least 52 kg, who are within 15% of their ideal weights (Table of &quot;Desirable Weights of
             Adults&quot;, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983).

          2. Only medically healthy subjects with clinically normal laboratory profiles were

             CYP (cytochrome P450) enzymes within 10 days of study start.

          4. Subjects who had used any drugs or other substances known to be strong inducers of CYP
             (cytochrome P450) enzymes within 28 days of study start.

          5. Subjects who, through completion of the study, would have donated in excess of:

               -  500 mL of blood in 14 days, or

               -  500- 750 mL of blood in 14 days (unless approved by the Principal Investigator),

               -  1000 ml. of blood in 90 days,

               -  1250 mL of blood in 120 days,
