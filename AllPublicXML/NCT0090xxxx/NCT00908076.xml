    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Amitiza (lubiprostone), a drug proven to be safe
      and effective for chronic constipation, will also improve constipation symptoms in
      Parkinson's Disease patients. We will also evaluate the impact of the drug on changes in
      bowel movement consistency, quality of life and motor symptoms.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects about one million people in the United States. It is a
      common neurological condition that is clinically defined by rigidity (muscle stiffness),
      bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and tremor. Parkinson's Disease , however, reveals
      numerous non-motor symptoms that have been underemphasized. Problematic symptoms include
      varying degrees of dementia, psychosis, diminished assertiveness and confidence, general
      fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, problems with blood pressure, sweating, and bladder,
      and a common yet difficult to define sense of &quot;not feeling well&quot;.

      A commonly missed symptom in Parkinson's patients is constipation. Constipation can be
      difficult to treat with current medications available and many are ineffective. Levodopa and
      dopamine agonists drugs are useful for motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease but have no
      effect on constipation. Laxatives and enemas provide limited relief with bothersome side
      effects. Even fewer drugs have been studied targeting the constipation problem specifically
      in the Parkinson's Disease population. Lubiprostone (AMITIZA) is a new medication that has
      been studied in the general population for the treatment of chronic constipation. It has been
      shown to be a safe and effective medication with few side effects. Lubiprostone has not yet
      been studied in the Parkinson's Disease population. We hope to show that this medication can
      be safe and effective for constipation in PD patients as well.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Subjects must be diagnosed with PD according to conventional criteria.

          -  2. Subjects must report having constipation and fulfill Rome III criteria19 for
             chronic constipation: at least 3 months, in the last 6 months with two or more of the
             following: i. Less than 3 SBM's per week ii. Straining with defecation more than 25%
             of the time iii. Lumpy or hard stools with defecation more than 25% of the time iv.
             Sensation of incomplete evacuation with defecation more than 25% of the time v.
             Sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage with defecation more than 25% of the
             time vi. Use of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation more than 25% of the time

          -  3. Patients will be encouraged to use only lubiprostone for constipation. If they use
             any other agents they will need to record this use in their diary; any BM that occurs
             within 24 hours of the other agent used will be recorded, but not be counted as a SBM.

          -  4. Patients or patients' caretaker(s)/ legal guardian must be able to read,
             understand, and accurately record data into the diary to guarantee full participation
             in the study.

          -  5. Patients over the age of 50 must have had a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy within 5
             years.

          -  6. Patients or patient's caretaker(s)/legal guardian must be willing and able to
             provide informed consent before beginning the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             bowel transit. Subjects with constipation secondary to any other documented cause.

          -  Planned use of drugs or agents during pretreatment phase onward that affect
             gastrointestinal motility and/ or prescription including laxatives including stool
             softeners (patients experiencing significant constipation may use a laxative as rescue
             medication if needed); antidiarrheals (in case of significant diarrhea loperamide may
             be used if needed); antacids containing magnesium or aluminum salts (only calcium
             containing ones are allowed); anticholinergics, antispasmodic agents (e.g., Librax,
             Donnatal, dicyclomine); erythromycin and other macrolides; octreotide; ondansetron or
             other 5-HT3 antagonists; opioids/narcotic analgesics; prokinetics (metoclopramide);

             for at least 1 month before treatment); calcium antagonists (allowed if constant doses
             for at least 1 month before treatment).

          -  Subjects with any significant cardiovascular, liver, lung, renal, psychiatric or
             neurological diseases (not including PD).

          -  Patients with previous allergic reaction or lack of tolerability to lubiprostone.

             post-menopausal or who are not currently using or complying with a medically approved
             method of contraception). Lubiprostone has not been studied in pregnant women and
             should only be used during a pregnancy if the potential benefits justify the potential
             risk to the fetus. Women should have a negative pregnancy test before beginning
             treatment with lubiprostone and need to practice effective contraceptive measures

The primary efficacy data will be analyzed using Student’s t-test with unequal variances as the difference from baseline in SBM comparing cases and controls, using last observation carried forward for missing data in the intent-to-treat population.</description>
