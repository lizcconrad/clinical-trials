      The investigators designed an experimental, randomized by parallel groups, stratified
      according to previous treatment, open-label study evaluating the superiority of the
      combination of whole lung lavage/inhaled GM-CSF versus whole lung lavage alone in patients
      with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The primary efficacy objective is the total resolution
      of the pulmonary involvement. PAP patients matching the enrolment criteria will enter the
      study. If requiring the first WLL, they will be randomized to receive WLL (1st level control
      group) or WLL/followed by inhaled GM-CSF, according to an acute (12 weeks) followed by
      maintenance (6 months) schedule (1st level treated group).

      Background:

      Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disorder characterized by accumulation of
      lipoproteinaceous material within alveolar spaces, leading to respiratory failure. Whole lung
      lavage (WLL) is the current therapeutic option, but it may induce complete resolution of the
      disorder only in 30% of patients. Based on PAP pathophysiology, a few pilot studies dealing
      with administration of rGM-CSF (Sargramostim) to patients either s.c. or aerosolized have
      been performed, with hopeful results.Objectives. We designed an experimental, randomized by
      parallel groups, stratified according to previous treatment, open-label study looking at
      evaluation the superiority of the combination WLL/inhaled GM-CSF vs WLL alone in PAP
      patients. The study also includes a side, observational section. The primary efficacy
      objective is the total resolution of the pulmonary involvement in all treated patients. The
      study includes some secondary efficacy objectives as well: avoidance of disease recurrence,
      avoidance of respiratory infections, investigation of biomarkers predicting the disease
      outcome, effect of treatments on underlying pathophysiology of PAP.

      Methods:

      PAP patients matching the enrollment criteria will enter the study. 1) If requiring the first
      WLL, they will be randomized to receive WLL (1st level control group) or WLL/ followed by
      inhaled GM-CSF, according to an acute (12 weeks) followed by maintenance (6 months) schedule
      (1st level treated group). 2) PAP patients requiring the second WLL: a) the 1st level control
      group subjects will be randomized to receive WLL alone (2nd level control group) or
      WLL/GM-CSF (2nd level treated group); b) the 1st level treated group will receive WLL/GM-CSF
      (1st level re-treated group). 3) PAP patients requiring the 3rd WLL will receive WLL/GM-CSF
      (2nd level re-treated group). 4) PAP patients not requiring additional WLL, but with
      persistent lung abnormalities will receive the course of inhaled GM-CSF (Residual disease
      treated group). At scheduled time, the PAP patients will be evaluated by questionnaire,
      respiratory function testing, CT-assisted lung profusion score, severity score, quality of
      life form, clinical chemistry.

      Expected results:

      We plan to identify the best treatment schedule for PAP patients. We will be able to identify
      the optimal sequence of the treatments (i.e., WLL + short-term inhaled GM-CSF or WLL +
      short-and long-term inhaled GM-CSF) and the optimal treatment in case of recurrence.

    <description>Acute treatment: the PAP subjects will receive inhaled rGM-CSF (Sargramostim, Leukine) at the dose of 250 mcg/24 hours. The acute treatment will be accomplished in 12 weeks, for 7 consecutive days every second week (thus, 6 weeks on and 6 weeks off). For those PAP patients receiving the GM-CSF for the first time (1st and 2nd level treated groups), the treatment will be performed by 1 week run-in, after discharge from the ICU, in the Respiratory Disease Department (during this period PAP patients usually receive e.v. corticosteroids, and oral antibiotics). After the run-in period, the patient is discharged and inhalation treatment will continue at home.
Maintenance treatment: 17 weeks after the WLL (4 weeks after the completion of the acute treatment), the PAP patient will start the maintenance treatment. He/she will receive inhaled GM-CSF at the dose of 250 mcg/daily for 2 consecutive days every 14 days (2 days on and 12 days off) for a period of 6 month</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First step: only autoimmune PAP subjects will be included

          -  Second step (eligibility for the WLL):

               -  presence of persistent or progressive respiratory failure (PaO2 at rest &lt; 60 mm
                  Hg)

               -  absence of respiratory failure at rest, but evidence for exertional

               -  desaturation &lt; 90% or &gt; 5 percentage points using the modified Bruce's protocol
                  (5)

               -  careful evaluation of conditions contraindicating the WLL (see below)

               -  discussion with the patient about cost-effectiveness of the procedure and
                  signature of the standard informed consent. Points a) and b) will be evaluated
                  over a period of 3 months, to avoid spontaneous improvement or resolution.

        (The former happens in 10% of cases falling in point b): in the case of fluctuation of
        saturation values around the threshold value, the procedure will be delayed until values
        are stable; the latter happened in 2/51 autoimmune PAP patients from our series, and the
        complete resolution occurred within the first 2 months from the diagnosis.)

          -  Third step (eligibility for the study): this step will be accomplished essentially by
             evaluation of the presence of conditions contraindicating the GM-CSF inhalation and
             upon ad hoc informed consent obtained from the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic lung disease associated with already existing respiratory failure (such as
             pulmonary emphysema or fibrosis)

          -  chronic heart failure or ischemic heart disease

          -  active pulmonary embolism

          -  progressive cancer

          -  other severe metabolic conditions

          -  secondary PAP

          -  previously experience of severe and unexplained side-effects during aerosol delivery
             of any kinds of agents
