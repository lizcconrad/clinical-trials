      This research study will evaluate the effects of aspirin and dipyridamole alone and in
      combination on the blood flow in the vessels of the legs. We will examine how these
      medications are able to inhibit the clotting of platelets in the vessels of patients with
      PAD, and thereby affect the blood flow in the legs. Platelets are cells in the blood that
      have the ability to adhere to each other to form clots.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dipyridamole has been reformulated to guarantee systemic bioavailability and steady state
      levels compatible with inhibition of platelet aggregation ex vivo (1). This newly formulated
      dipyridamole has been shown to roughly equal in efficacy to low dose aspirin in the secondary
      prevention of stroke and the drug combination seems roughly additive (2). The present study
      is designed to explore two potential mechanisms which have been linked to dipyridamole action
      on the vessel wall; modulation of vascular eicosanoid generation and prevention of oxidant
      stress (3). We shall address the hypothesis that dipyridamole affects these systems in
      patients with PAD. These individuals have disordered platelet-vascular interactions, as
      reflected by increased generation of thromboxane, an index of platelet activation and of
      prostacyclin, probably a homeostatic response to traumatic and chemical stimulation of the
      endothelium (4,5). Furthermore, we shall assess the functional consequences of dipyridamole
      action, alone and in combination with aspirin compared with aspirin alone on local
      measurements of flow and oxygenation, including exercise tolerance, Doppler Ultrasound and
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Lipid peroxidation will be quantified based on mass
      spectrometric analysis of the major urinary isoprostane, 8,12-iso-iPF2a-VI (6,7).
