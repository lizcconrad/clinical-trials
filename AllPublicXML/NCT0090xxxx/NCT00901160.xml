  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Can a post-operative analysis using a simple blood test (Thromboelastography(TEG®)) and
      Platelet Mapping Assay (PMA™) be able to detect the occurence of clotting or bleeding
      complications in patients on blood thinning (anti-platelet) agents?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred patients coming for surgery who are taking anti-platelet medications will be
      enrolled in this study as a pilot, to determine the feasibility for a larger study. A simple
      blood test for clotting function will be done after surgery. Patients will be assessed daily
      during their hospital stay to determine if they have any clotting or bleeding complications.
      For analysis, groups will be divided into normal and increased or decreased ability to make a
      blood clot based on the TEG® and PMA™ test done. Complications will be recorded for each
      group and analyzed to determine if there is any difference between groups.

    <description>Blood will be taken from patients who are on anti-platelet medication and are having surgery that requires an overnight stay. This is a pilot study to see if Thromboelastography® and Platelet Mapping Assay™ will be able to predict if a patient is at risk for a bleeding or a clotting problem after surgery.</description>
