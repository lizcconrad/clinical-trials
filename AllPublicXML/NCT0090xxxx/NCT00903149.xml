  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a cost and time effective intervention in a
      previous RCT for preterm infants and their parents can reduce the parents experience of
      concern and stress, and improve the childrens development in various aspects at three years
      of corrected age.

      Hypothesis 1: The preterm born children of parents who were enrolled in the earlier RCT have
      a higher developmental level then preterm children of parents who received the usual
      treatment.

      Hypothesis 2: Parents who who were enrolled in the earlier RCT will have a lower level of
      stress and concern then parents who received treatment as usual.

      A previous RCT by Ravn (NCT00245843) investigated if the MITP could sensitize the mothers
      toward the babies signals and thereby increase the quality of joint attention. The study
      followed the children for 1 year.

      This study is a follow-up to the above mentioned RCT. It investigates whether the effect of
      the RCT is present at three years corrected age.

      The research questions are:

        1. Can a psychoeducative program like the MITP influence the childrens` development in
           various aspects?

        2. How did the MITP influence the parents experience of concern and stress three years
           later?

        3. Were there any differences by the groups? a) Preterm intervention group b)Preterm
           control group c) Full term control group

      The questionnaires to be used in this observational study are:
