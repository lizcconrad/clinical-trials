      This study will investigate and contrast the effects of two psychological treatments for
      adults with autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a cognitive
      remediation intervention that aims to help adults with problems in thinking, planning, and
      socialization. Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) is an individual supportive therapy that
      aims to help adults learn about their condition, manage their emotions and stress, improve
      their social skills, and cope with everyday problems.

    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by marked impairments in social and
      non-social cognitive ability that persist well into adulthood and contribute to significant
      functional disability. The treatment of ASD has focused almost exclusively on children, and
      few empirically supported interventions are available to address the core cognitive and
      functional challenges individuals with ASD face as they transition to adulthood. This study
      will investigate and contrast the effects of two psychological treatments for adults with
      autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a cognitive remediation
      intervention that aims to help adults with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization.
      Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) is an individual supportive therapy that aims to help
      adults learn about their condition, manage their emotions and stress, improve their social
      skills, and cope with everyday problems.

      Participation in this study will last 30 months. Potential participants must be able to
      attend weekly treatment sessions in Pittsburgh, PA.

      The study design is a 30-month (2.5 years) randomized-controlled trial, where eligible
      participants will be randomized to the CET or EST study treatments. Participants will be
      treated with the study interventions for 18 months, and then followed for 12 additional
      months to assess the lasting impact of the study interventions. All participants will
      complete cognitive, clinical, and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging) assessments prior
      to starting the study treatments and then at specified intervals thereafter to evaluate the
      impact of the study treatments on cognition, adaptive function, and the brain.

    <description>This research treatment aims to help with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization. Participants begin with cognitive training using computer software programs. They also participate in a small social-cognitive group to learn about their condition and how to act wisely in social situations by developing the abilities needed to understand another person's perspective, evaluate social contexts, and be foresightful.

    <description>This research treatment uses individual supportive therapy to help adults learn about autism spectrum disorder, manage their emotions and stress, improve their social skills, and cope with everyday problems. Participants will learn about the impact of stress on their lives, and how to identify their own early cues of distress and apply effective coping strategies.
