  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the generation of inflammatory mediators negatively
      influences arterial wall remodeling and the endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in the
      coronary and systemic arterial systems. In fact, the intensity of the inflammatory
      upregulation is strongly related to the incidence of recurrent coronary events. The
      investigators previously demonstrated that high dose potent statins can rapidly reduce plasma
      levels of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins and inflammatory activity in subjects during ACS. In
      addition, such statin treatment attenuates the post-discharge endothelial dysfunction of
      these patients. By inference, it is plausible to hypothesize that these beneficial effects
      during ACS may be intensified by an additive lowering of plasma cholesterol through the
      treatment with ezetimibe. So far, data is unavailable to verify this assumption. In parallel,
      data from animal models have suggested that both statins and ezetimibe may reduce insulin
      sensitivity by their effect on cholesterol content and, by this way, on insulin signaling in
      liver cells. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the role of the addition
      of ezetimibe upon statin treatment on stress-induced insulin resistance and on the
      time-course of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and
      its late effect on endothelium-dependent arterial dilation.
