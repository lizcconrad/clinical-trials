  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathlessness is an extremely common and uncomfortable symptom that is reported in more than
      two-thirds of persons with tetraplegia. This disordered pulmonary function is due to
      respiratory muscle paralysis or to sympathetic denervation results in a restrictive
      impairment and airway hyperreactivity, respectively. These restrictive and obstructive
      dysfunctions have been associated with the symptom of breathlessness. However, mechanisms
      contributing to dyspnea in persons who have tetraplegia are not well understood. It has been
      demonstrated that persons with tetraplegia have an increased prevalence of breathlessness and
      may have an altered breathing pattern. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      breathing pattern at rest and measure the changes in breathing after a bronchodilator
      treatment (a medicine commonly used to treat asthma that relaxes and opens up airways). The
      determination of breathing pattern is done by measuring the movements in the chest wall while
      breathing. This design will elucidate differences in breathing patterns between those with
      tetraplegia and controls, as well as demonstrate the effect of bronchodilatation on motor
      drive and timing. Knowledge of the intraindividual variability and mean values of the
      components of the breathing pattern will improve our understanding of breathlessness in these
      individuals.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate mechanisms of dyspnea in tetraplegia. This goal will be
      accomplished by completing the following specific objectives:

        1. To noninvasively assess dyspnea, motor drive, and respiratory timing during prolonged
           periods of resting breathing.

        2. To determine if relationships exist between these breathing pattern components and
           dyspnea.

        3. To determine if the relationships among respiratory timing, drive, and dyspnea are
           altered by a bronchodilator and over its duration of action.

      These specific objectives will be used to test the hypotheses that:

        1. During prolonged periods of resting breathing, respiratory timing will be altered and
           motor drive will be increased and less variable than in able-bodied controls.

        2. There will be a positive association between motor drive and dyspnea.

        3. Improving respiratory mechanics by bronchodilator administration will reduce drive,
           normalize timing and lessen dyspnea over the duration of action of the drug.

      Completion of the proposed studies will expand our existing knowledge of ventilatory control
      in persons with tetraplegia and relate these changes to dyspnea, a common and distressing
      clinical problem in these individuals. These studies will also provide a better
      characterization of breathing patterns and their intrasubject variability in persons with
      tetraplegia. Currently, the only information regarding breathing patterns in tetraplegia are
      of limited duration (15-30 minutes). If this pilot study reveals significant relationships
      between motor drive, timing, and dyspnea, compiling &quot;normative&quot; data for breathing patterns
      from large numbers of individuals with tetraplegia may be useful in evaluating dyspnea in
      different clinical settings.
