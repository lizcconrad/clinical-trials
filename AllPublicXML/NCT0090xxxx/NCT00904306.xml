      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 6-month
      chromium picolinate (CrPic) treatment trial in binge eating disorder (BED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating (i.e., the consumption of unusually large amounts of food with a sense of loss
      of control) is a common problem with serious public health implications in large part due to
      its role in obesity. Binge eating leads to weight gain and is common in overweight
      individuals. Current treatments for binge eating disorder (BED) are inadequate, and previous
      randomized treatment trials have suffered from high drop out rate due to the adverse effects
      of pharmacological agents. Chromium picolinate is a dietary supplement that has been shown to
      reduce symptoms of depression and appetite regulation problems in patients with atypical
      depression; chromium picolinate also affects insulin regulation and has been shown to improve
      glucose levels in patients with type-2 diabetes. This pilot study will evaluate the effect of
      chromium picolinate on binge eating, mood, body weight, and glucose regulation in overweight
      individuals with BED.

          3. Is psychiatrically stable (e.g., no current suicidal or homicidal intent or other
             psychiatric condition that requires acute intervention).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 24.9 kg/m^2 (underweight or normal weight) or â‰¥ 40 kg/m^2

          7. Current use of medications known to significantly influence appetite or weight [i.e.,
             over-the-counter appetite suppressants that contain phentermine or sibutramine,
             atypical antipsychotic agents with high weight gain liability (such as olanzapine,
             risperidone, etc), prednisone, etc.];
