      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether the cellular localization of BRCA1 can predict how patients with
           pancreatic cancer will respond to cytotoxic agents (e.g., fluorouracil or gemcitabine
           hydrochloride) or radiotherapy.

        -  To identify pre-treatment markers that can be used to correlate with clinical outcomes
           of survival and recurrence.

        -  To determine if a method of extracting and identifying secreted cytokines and growth
           factors from biopsy tissue can now be applied to the pancreatic cancer population.

      OUTLINE: Tissue samples from biopsies performed during pancreatectomy are collected from the
      Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center Human Tissue Acquisition Core for laboratory biomarker
      studies. Proteins secreted by cancer cells and/or cancer-associated cells are studied by
      extracting and identifying secreted cytokines and growth factors from biopsy tissue. The
      integrity of the DNA repair pathway in pancreatic cancer is analyzed by Rad51 and
      phosphorylated DNA-PK foci formation. Markers are correlated with clinical outcome.

      Patients are followed for recurrence, relapse, and death from disease.

    <description>Using material that is already being acquired as a component of clinical care (only that which is excess after routine clinical care), we will determine if pre-treatment markers can be used to correlate with clinical outcomes of survival and recurrence. Examples of such markers include studying if the integrity of DNA repair pathway in pancreatic cancers, analyzed by Rad51 and phosphorylated DNA-PK foci formation, correlates with tumor response to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and overall survival. The markers targeted are proteins secreted by cancer cells and/or cancer associated cells.</description>
