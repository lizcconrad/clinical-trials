      The hypothesis of this study is: sleep disordered breathing (SDB), specifically, obstructive
      sleep apnea, is associated with poorer glucose in the existing type 2 diabetic condition.

      In an exploration of this hypothesis, the investigators hope to provide evidence linking SDB
      to increased severity of disease in the type 2 diabetic patient. By doing so, the
      investigators ultimately seek to support investigating the use of SDB interventions as an
      additional method of care in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
