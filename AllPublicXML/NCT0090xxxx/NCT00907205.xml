  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SF1126 in patients
      with advanced or metastatic tumors by assessing the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and
      defining the maximum tolerated dose given twice per week for 4 weeks and ultimately define a
      recommended phase II dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SF1126 is a conjugate containing a vascular targeted pan-PI3K inhibitor that selectively
      inhibits all PI3K class I isoforms and other key members of the PI3K superfamily, including
      mTORC1/2, DNA-PK, PLK-1, CK2, ATM and PIM-1. SF1126 is designed to inhibit both angiogenesis
      and cell proliferation by targeting and binding to specific integrins such as αγβ3 that are
      expressed on the surface of new tumor vasculature and within the tumor compartment. In
      preclinical xenograft models SF1126 has demonstrated broad activity as a single agent;
      synergy with commonly used chemotherapy agents, targeted agents, and radiation; and has been
      shown to reverse resistance mediated through the PI3K/PTEN pathway.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To qualify for enrollment, all of the following criteria must be met:

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  At least 18 years old.

          -  Accrual will be limited to patients with tumor types that in the opinion of the
             investigator is known to have PTEN loss or PI3 Kinase mutations potentially important
             in the biology of their cancer.

          -  Only patients with histologically confirmation of advanced solid malignant tumor which
             is refractory to standard therapies or which no standard therapy exists.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; or = 12 weeks.

          -  Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if: they are
             non-childbearing potential, had a hysterectomy, had a bilateral oophorectomy
             (ovariectomy), had a bilateral tubal ligation, post-menopausal or childbearing
             potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and agrees to protection
             by IUD, vasectomized partner, complete abstinence, double barrier contraception.

          -  male patients with childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception
             while on study.

             &lt; 160mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless treatment was completed at least 4
             weeks before entry, and stable without steroid treatment for at least 4 weeks.

             or = 50mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation.
