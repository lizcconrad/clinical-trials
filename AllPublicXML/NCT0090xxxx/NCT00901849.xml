  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of combining two drugs, Tarceva (an anti-EGFR
      agent), and Rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), in children with progressive low-grade gliomas who
      have failed initial conventional treatment. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of this
      drug regimen, the potential efficacy of the regimen will be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children less than 21 years of age, with or without neurofibromatosis, with recurrent
             low-grade gliomas.

          -  patients with or without NF1 must have failed some form of conventional therapy,
             radiotherapy, or chemotherapy (carboplatin/vincristine) to be eligible, including
             those treated wtih initial surgery. Patients do not have to have received radiotherapy
             to be eligible.

          -  children with all types of histologically proven low-grade gliomas will be eligible;
             re-operation at the time of recurrence is not mandatory for entry on study.

          -  patients with intrinsic brain lesions, believed neuroradiographically consistent with
             a low-grade glial tumor, with neurofibromatosis type 1 can be treated without
             histological confirmation.

          -  patients without neurofibromatosis type 1 must have histological confirmation of a
             low-grade glial tumor prior to entry on study.

          -  patients must have a Karnofsky score of greater than or equal to 50% for children
             greater than 10 years of age, or a Lansky score of greater than or equal to 50% for
             patients less than 10 years of age.

          -  patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are able to use a
             wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for purposes of assessing performance score.

          -  patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  patients must be able to swallow medication in tablet form.

          -  patients must have adequate organ function, including: peripheral ANC of greater than
             1,000/microliters; a platelet count of greater than 100,000/microliters; hemoglobin of
             greater than 8 gms,dl (pRBC transfusions of allowed to maintain hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl)

          -  patients must have adequate renal function, which is defined as a normal serum
             creatinine for age

          -  patients must have adequate liver function, as defined as a total bilirubin or less
             than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for age, and an SGPT (ALT) of less than 2.5
             times the upper limit of normal for age

          -  patients must have had a MR scan within 3 weeks of starting treatment

          -  all patients, and/or their parents or legal guardian, must sign a recent informed
             consent

          -  all institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human study must be met.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients must not have any other active tumors.

          -  pregnancy or breast feeding is an exclusion criteria, as the potential mutagenicity
             and cytotoxicity of these drugs in developing fetuses are unknown. A pregnancy test
             must be obtained in females who are postmenarchal. Males or females of reproductive
             potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective
             contraceptive method.

          -  patients with uncontrolled infection are excluded.

          -  patients who have previously received Tarceva or Rapamycin are excluded.

          -  patients on antiepileptics and/or corticosteroids are allowed on study as long as they
             have been on a stable or weaning dose for 7 days prior to study initiation (defined as
             first day of treatment).
