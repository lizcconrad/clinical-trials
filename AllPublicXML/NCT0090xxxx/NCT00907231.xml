      This is a multi-center study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Troponin I assay in the
      Biosite Triage Cardio3 Panel at the point-of-care (POC) in adults presenting to the emergency
      department with possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

        Approximately 400 adults presenting to the ED with possible AMI will be enrolled.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older at time of enrollment

          -  Presenting to the ED within 6 hours from onset of chest discomfort (pain, pressure,
             tightness, etc) consistent with a possible diagnosis of AMI or ACS and with an initial
             ECG non-diagnostic for injury (or injury equivalent resulting in emergent reperfusion
             therapy). (NOTE: Subjects who have chest discomfort that is episodic or stuttering in
             nature may be included if the ED presentation is within 6 hours of symptom onset.)

          -  Experiencing at least 30 minutes of chest pain or other anginal equivalent symptoms.
             (Note: Subjects who have symptoms of shorter duration due to pharmacologic
             intervention may be included.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient (or Legal Representative) unable or unwilling to provide written informed
             consent.

          -  Patient unwilling or unlikely to comply with study procedures, including
             protocol-specified blood sampling or telephone follow-up at 30 days and 6 months.

          -  Vulnerable populations as deemed inappropriate for study by site principal
             investigator.

          -  ST-elevation or other ECG criteria that result that is diagnostic for AMI and results
             in patient being sent for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) or being treated
             with thrombolytics6.

          -  Pulmonary Edema requiring CPAP, BIPAP, or mechanical ventilation

          -  Tachyarrhythmias (SVT, V-Tach, rapid atrial fib)

          -  End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis

          -  Cardiac Arrest prior to arrival

          -  Implantable Defibrillator firing prior to arrival

          -  Hemodynamically unstable patients

          -  Trauma injury to the chest
