  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate how quickly and to what extent the 14-Carbon
      labeled SAM-531 is absorbed into the bloodstream, converted and eliminated from the body
      after oral administration in healthy male subjects. As 14-Carbon labeled SAM-531 is
      radioactive, this enables the compound to be traced in blood, urine and feces.
