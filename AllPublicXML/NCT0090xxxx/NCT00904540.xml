      Patients with acute or chronic Lower Back Pain (LBP) participated in a Phase IV clinical
      trial to assess the effectiveness of Lidoderm administered once daily (q24h) for 2 weeks in
      the treatment of acute and chronic LBP.

    <description>Patients participated in a 6-week treatment period. Commercially available Lidoderm (lidocaine patch 5%) was provided to patients with up to four patches applied topically once daily (q24h) to the area of maximal peripheral pain. Patients were stratified into the following groups at enrollment: acute (&lt;6 weeks) LBP, subacute (6 weeks to &lt;3 months) LBP, short-term chronic (3 months to 12 months, inclusive) LBP, and long-term chronic (&gt;12 months LBP)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-radicular LBP pain for

             ≤12 months (non-radicular defined as LBP that does not radiate below the mid-buttock
             and with no sensory symptoms in the leg)

          -  Had LBP as the primary source of pain. Patients may have had mild to moderate spinal
             stenosis and no radicular symptoms

          -  Had an average daily pain intensity score of &gt;4 on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being no
             pain and 10 being pain as bad as the patients have ever imagined (Question 5 of BPI)
             within 24 hours prior to the screening visit.

          -  Had a normal neurological examination, including:

               -  Motor strength

               -  Sensory testing (light touch, pinprick, and vibration)

               -  Deep tendon reflexes

        Patients were eligible for participation in the long-term chronic (&gt;12 months) group of the
        study if they also:

          -  Had LBP for greater than one year. Patients may have had any of the following: lumbar
             degenerative disc disease, internal disc disruption, mild-to-severe spinal stenosis,
             degenerative scoliosis and spondylolisthesis, facet arthropathy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a history of greater than one back surgery or one back surgery within 3 months of
             study entry

          -  Had severe spinal stenosis and radicular symptoms

          -  Had any other chronic pain condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             have interfered with patient assessment of LBP relief

          -  Had received an epidural steroid/local anesthetic injection within 2 weeks prior to
             study entry

          -  Had received trigger point injections within 2 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Had received Botox Injections within 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Were taking a lidocaine-containing product that could not be discontinued while
             receiving Lidoderm

          -  Were taking class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., mexiletine, tocainide)

        Patients were excluded from participation in the long-term chronic (&gt;12 months) group if
        they also:

          -  Had an undefined spinal diagnosis

          -  Had a history of lumbar spine surgery within 6 months prior to study entry
