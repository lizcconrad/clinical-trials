      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with
      cancer and blood from healthy participants may help doctors learn more about changes that may
      occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at cancer-related protein biomarkers in the blood
      and tumor tissue of patients with cancer and in the blood of healthy participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify tumor antigens that induce a humoral response in patients with cancer.

        -  Identify tumor-secreted proteins by special analysis in culture, and evaluate their
           expression patterns in tumors and preneoplastic lesions to further assess their
           potential specificity.

        -  Determine serum positivity and specificity of potential markers for early detection of
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients and healthy participants undergo blood collection. Patients with suspected or newly
      diagnosed disease undergo a second blood collection between 4-10 weeks after surgery (but
      before any additional cytotoxic therapy or radiotherapy) provided they had a surgical
      resection with negative margin. All patients are asked questions about family history of
      cancer, the development of their cancer, other medical history, past and present smoking
      history, and menstrual period for females.

      DNA is extracted from the blood and from patient tumor tissue samples obtained during
      surgery. Immunohistochemistry (including polymerase chain reaction) and in situ hybridization
      are used to analyze protein expression patterns, after proteins are identified by mass
      spectrometry and amino acid sequencing.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,150 patients and 1,200 healthy participants will be accrued
      for this study.

        The laboratory will apply technologies for protein analysis to the detection and
        identification of proteins secreted by tumor cells and protein antigens that induce a
        humoral response in tumors. The initial targeted tumor types for the identification of
        potential biomarker proteins are: Colon, esophagus, ovary, lung, breast and liver
