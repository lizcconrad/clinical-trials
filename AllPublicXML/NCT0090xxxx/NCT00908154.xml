  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1014802 is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker and an effective anticonvulsant in
      animal models.

      This study is being conducted to obtain information regarding the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of GSK1014802 administered for up to 28 days in healthy
      male or female subjects. In addition, the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK1014802 will be investigated.

      This study, previously posted by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), was transitioned to Convergence
      Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., which spun off from GSK. Convergence Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., has now
      been acquired by Biogen.
