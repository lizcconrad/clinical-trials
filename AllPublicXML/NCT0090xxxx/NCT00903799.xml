    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the symptomatic efficacy and the impact on the
      utilization of healthcare resources of a treatment by gastric electrical stimulation (ENTERRA
      ®) in patients with refractory nausea and/or vomiting leading to a nutritional impairment.
      Eligible patients will be those with refractory symptoms either idiopathic, postsurgical or
      due to diabetes mellitus. The duration of the study will be 28 months for each patient.

      After a run-in period of 4 months during which a prospective assessment of healthcare
      resources utilization and of the severity of the symptoms will be obtained, patients will be
      implanted. The follow-up period after implantation of the device will last 24 months in every
      patients and will be divided in two parts: a) After the first postoperative month during
      which the device will remained on the &quot;OFF&quot; position, the first phase of the study will be a
      randomized double-blind cross-over study with 2 periods of 4 months during which the device
      will be activated or not. After the 9th month of follow up, the trial will be an open trial
      and the device will be activated in all patients.

      During the whole trial, patients will record all types of healthcare resources utilizations
      (hospitalizations, drug treatments, endoscopic procedures…) while the symptomatic efficacy of
      the treatment will be assessed by standard questionnaires at the following visits scheduled
      at 1, 5, 9, 12, 18, 24 months. The glycemic control will be determined at each visit in
      diabetic patients. A delayed gastric emptying will not be a selection criteria but we have
      planned to analyze the clinical results of the treatment in taking into account a delayed or
      normal gastric emptying during the pre-implantation period. Moreover, gastric emptying
      studies have been scheduled at 5, 9, 12 and 24 months to test the impact of gastric
      electrical stimulation on gastric emptying.
