      SEYLE is a health promoting program for adolescents in European schools. Its main objectives
      are to lead adolescents to better health through decreased risk-taking and suicidal
      behaviors, to evaluate outcomes of different preventive programs and to recommend effective
      culturally adjusted models for promoting health of adolescents in different European
      countries. Because of the significance of the SEYLE program and the importance of suicide
      research, Israel is honored to take part in this program and be a collaborator in it's
      implementation and research.

    <textblock>
      In this health promotion program, a pilot intervention study will be implemented to assess
      the effects of three different health promoting / suicide prevention programs in 11,000
      students across 11 European countries (Sweden, Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary,
      Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain): 1. A general health promotion program
      targeting students' awareness on healthy/unhealthy behaviours and students' self-efficacy in
      diminishing unhealthy behaviours; 2. ProfScreen - screening by professionals of at-risk
      students through a questionnaire. For adolescents identified as high risk (screen positives)
      the program includes referral to mental health treatment and ensuring compliance. 3. QPR
      (Question, Persuade &amp; Refer) - a gatekeepers' program, training all adult staff at schools
      (teachers, counselors, nurses etc.) and parents on how to recognize &amp; refer a student with
      risk-taking behaviours or suffering from mental illness to mental-health help resources.

      Each of these prevention programs uses a different active component in order to be
      successful. The first prevention program empowers the students by increasing their
      self-efficacy. The second prevention program (ProfScreen) empowers mental health professional
      in identifying subjects at risk. The third program (QPR) empowers teachers and parents in
      at-risk case finding and referring to mental health facilities. The registration of the
      complete RCT is available on the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00000214).

    <description>QPR intervention (Question, Persuade &amp; Refer): The QPR prevention program will be used in two modules, one for school staff and one for parents. According to the US Surgeon General's National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (2001), &quot;key gatekeepers&quot; are &quot;people who regularly come into contact with individuals or families in distress&quot; and gatekeeper training has been identified as one of a number of promising prevention strategies.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Awareness program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The awareness programme is comprised of a leaflet, six posters and four seminars. The seminars are made up of one introductory lesson, and two interactive follow-up lessons with role play and one final meeting as a closing/debriefing lesson.</description>

    <description>The program's primary objective is to help young people and their parents through the early identification of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Screening strategies are based on the valid premise that suicidal adolescents are under-identified, suffer from an active, often treatable mental illness such as depression and exhibit identifiable risk factors (Gould et al. 2003). A potential shortcoming of screening programs is that asking about suicide could increase suicidal ideation and behaviour. About this issue a recent study (Gould et al . 2005) on over 2300 students reported no evidence of iatrogenic effects of suicide screening and that screening in high schools is a safe component of youth suicide prevention efforts.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group will comprise 250 subjects. After the baseline assessment, subjects will be randomized in one of the three intervention arms or in the control group. Individuals in the control group will undergo the same baseline and follow-up evaluations as subjects in the intervention arms and will receive the same leaflet about healthy lifestyles with information about the possibility to seek help for unhealthy, suicidal behaviour and mental health problems. In this arm, no additional intervention will be performed although the possibility of seeking help from mental health resources will be available.</description>
