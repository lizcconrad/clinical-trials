      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about the affect of body mass index on the way anticancer drugs work in
      the body. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying body mass index in younger patients receiving
      prednisone/prednisolone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and pegaspargase for high-risk acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetics of prednisone/prednisolone, vincristine, and
           daunorubicin hydrochloride among obese, middle-weight, and underweight children aged 10
           to less than 20 years of age undergoing induction therapy for high-risk acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  To examine the relationship between the above parameters and response status as defined
           by early response and induction failure.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to body mass index
      (BMI) (≥ 95^th percentile [obese] vs 10^th to 95^th percentile [normal or at risk for
      overweight] vs ≤ 10^th percentile [underweight]).

      Patients receive anticancer therapy as prescribed by their treating clinicians. Patients
      receive prednisone/prednisolone orally twice on either day 1 or day 8. Patients also receive
      daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and vincristine IV once on the same day.

      Blood samples are obtained on either day 1 or day 8** of induction therapy for
      pharmacokinetic analysis of prednisone, daunorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine activity
      levels.

      Blood samples are analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
      ultrafiltration, a Nessler reaction, ELISA, and liquid chromatography using reverse-phase
      chromatography, fluorescent detection, and solid-phase extraction.

      Demographic information, including ethnicity, is also collected. Weight and height is
      recorded at diagnosis and on the day pharmacokinetic assessment of vincristine, prednisone,
      and daunorubicin hydrochloride begins.

      NOTE: **Patients who are being sampled on day 8 of induction therapy and who have received
      intravenous corticosteroid therapy in the first week of induction must have received at least
      six oral prednisone/prednisolone doses prior to the morning prednisone/prednisolone dose on
      day 8.
