      This is multi-center, international observational study of subjects receiving CHOP-14 or
      CHOP-21 (with or without Rituximab) for the treatment of NHL. Approximately 100-150 sites
      will contribute information on subjects treated at their institution.

      This is a multi-center, international observational study of subjects receiving CHOP-14 or
      CHOP-21 (with or without Rituximab) for the treatment of NHL. Approximately 100-150 sites
      will contribute information on subjects treated at their institution.

      To avoid geographical bias, sites will be selected to represent the spread of subjects in
      each country. Each site will be initially limited to 5 retrospective subjects and 10
      prospective subjects (15 subjects per site) but sites may be asked to contribute further
      subjects to approximately 10 retrospective subjects and 20 prospective subjects.

      Retrospective subjects may include any subject that has completed all cycles of chemotherapy
      treatment prior to date of site initiation. Prospective subjects which may be considered for
      the study are any subject planned for CHOP-14 or CHOP-21 (with or without Rituximab)
      treatment after the site initiation visit.

        Subjects greater than or equal to 18 years old. Subjects diagnosed with any histological
        type of NHL (including both chemotherapy naïve and pre-treated subjects). Subjects planned
        to receive a minimum of 3 cycles of CHOP-14 or CHOP-21 with or without Rituximab (for
        subjects enrolled retrospectively, eligibility should be assessed on the profile at time of
        planning treatment, where treatment initiates on or after 01 Jan 2005, with specific focus
        on planned chemotherapy and not outcome or number of delivered cycles) . Before any
        study-specific procedure, the appropriate written informed consent must be obtained for
