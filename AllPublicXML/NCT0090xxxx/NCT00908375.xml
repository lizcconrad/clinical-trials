    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether pregabalin is effective in reducing the pain
      in patients who present with radicular pain due to a herniated disc, spinal stenosis or
      failed back surgery syndrome.

      Although the efficacy of pregabalin has been demonstrated in several pain states and it is
      approved by the FDA for use in post herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia
      there are few studies of its efficacy in patients with radicular pain from herniated disc,
      spinal stenosis or failed back surgery syndrome. This study was conducted to evaluate the
      efficacy of pregabalin in these pain states.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry disability index (ODI) is a tool to measure a subject's functional disability. The Oswestry disability index consists of 10 questions with a Likert 0-5 scale. Each individual score is converted into a percent which represents the &quot;percent disability.&quot; There are five tiers, 0-20% (minimal disability), 21%-40% (moderate disability), 41%-60% (severe disability), 61%-80% (crippled), 81%-100% (i.e. bed bound). We report the Oswestry disability scores at 3 weeks.</description>

Each individual score is converted into a percent which represents the &quot;percent disability.&quot; There are five tiers, 0-20% (minimal disability), 21%-40% (moderate disability), 41%-60% (severe disability), 61%-80% (crippled), 81%-100% (i.e. bed bound).
