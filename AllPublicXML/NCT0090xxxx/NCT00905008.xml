      The FReIburger STent Registry (FRIST) is designed to determine the long term safety and
      efficacy of Drug Eluting Stents (DES) in a &quot;real-world&quot; patient population requiring stent
      implantation.

      FRIST included patients treated with DES and bare-metal stents (BMS) in the University
      Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, according to a non-restrictive inclusion criterion, in which
      virtually all consecutive patient subsets were considered eligible.

    <description>All interventions were done according to current practice guidelines. The operator was responsible for the decision to choose a specific treatment strategy. Angiographic success was defined as residual stenosis &lt;30% by visual analysis in the presence of TIMI 3 flow grade. The patients were prescribed aspirin plus clopidogrel 75 mg per day, after a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg, before or during the index coronary intervention. After procedure, all patients were advised to maintain lifelong use of aspirin. The use of clopidogrel (75 mg per day) was always adapted according to guideline recommendations. Heparin was infused throughout the procedure to maintain an activated clotting time of at least 250 sec. The administration of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker was encouraged, unless in existing contraindications.</description>

        FRIST (FReIburger STent) is a single-centre, long-term stent registry in a high volume
        tertiary referral cardiovascular centre. FRIST included patients treated with drug-eluting
        stents and uncoated stents at the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, according to
        non-restrictive inclusion criterions, in which virtually all consecutive patient subsets
        were considered eligible.
