  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II, multi-center, 3 part, staggered cohort, open-label and double blind, randomized,
      placebo controlled study involving 3 age-determined cohorts (Cohort 1: between 12 and 17
      years old; Cohort 2: between 6 and 11 years old; Cohort 3: between 1 and 5 years old). Daily
      dosing with eltrombopag will begin with 5 patients in the oldest age cohort in an open label
      fashion, and a review of safety, pharmacokinetic and platelet count data will be performed
      regularly. If no safety concerns are identified after 12 weeks, 18 additional patients will
      be randomised to placebo or eltrombopag (2:1 randomisation). After 7 weeks of randomized
      treatment, all patients will receive eltrombopag in an open label fashion. The total duration
      of treatment with eltrombopag will be 24 weeks. If at the time of the aforementioned 12 week
      review of the first 5 patients no safety issues are identified, dosing will begin in the next
      lower age cohort with an initial group of 5 patients. The same procedure will be followed in
      terms of safety review and subsequent enrolment and randomisation of the additional patients.
      Initiation of the younger age cohort will take place once data from the previous has been
      evaluated. Doses will be adjusted according to platelet counts and tolerability. The study
      will include a review of the safety data by a Data Safety Monitoring Board.

          -  Subjects with known inherited thrombocytopenia (e.g. MYH-9 disorders)

          -  Subjects treated with drugs that affect platelet function (including but not limited
             to aspirin, clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs) or anti-coagulants for &gt;3 consecutive days
             within 2 weeks of Day 1.

          -  Subjects who have previously received eltrombopag or any other thrombopoietin receptor
             agonist.

          -  For female subjects who have reached menarche status, an inability or unwillingness to

        <description>The weighted mean platelet count is defined as the area under the platelet-time curve divided by the duration of the treatment (12 weeks). Based on the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, the weighted mean platelet count is the sum of the Baseline count plus the age cohort plus the treatment. Baseline was defined as the platelet count taken on Day 1 or within 48 hours prior to the first dose of treatment.</description>

        <title>Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments for Eltrombopag for Cmax and Ct During Part 1, 2, and 2/3.</title>
        <description>The maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and the concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ct) data were collected to estimate primary model-based PK parameters. PK samples were collected within 3 hours prior to dosing and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after dosing. Doses were normalized to 50mg for comparison. PK samples were collected at each on-treatment visit during Part 1, Part 2, and Part 2/3. The concentration data were pooled across visits to identify population PK and variability parameter estimates and covariate effects. From the final model, a single value of Cmax and Ct were estimated for each subject, and geometric mean (95% CI) values are presented for each cohort for a 50mg dose.</description>

        <description>The maximum duration for which a participant continuously maintained a platelet count &gt;=50 Gi/L in the absence of rescue treatment was calculated and summarized during the 24 weeks of eltrombopag treatment in Part 2. Participants with non-weekly assessments were assumed to have maintained a positive response for each week between two assessments that had positive responses. If a particpant achieved a positive response at an assessment and then achieved a negative response at the next assessment, then it was assumed that the participant had achieved a positive response for one day. Excludes periods from initiation of rescue medication until platelet count falls to below 50Gi/L, irrespective of platelet count</description>

          <description>Participants who discontinued (dis) or had a sustained reduction (red) of a Baseline (BL) ITP medication for at least one day during the period of Day 1 of Part 2/3 to the last dose of study medication +1 day are reported. The denominator is the number of subjects taking an ITP medication at baseline. For participants randomized to placebo in Part 2, BL is defined as Week 7 of Part 2. For participants randomized to eltrombopag in Part 2, BL is defined as Day 1 of Part 2. A sustained reduction is defined as reduction for 4 weeks or more. An attempted reduction or discontinuation is a decrease in the dose or frequency from the BL dose or frequency of an ITP medication for at least one day during the period Part 2/3 Day 1 to the last dose of study medication + 1 day.</description>

        <title>Kids’ ITP Tool (KIT) Questionnaire Total Score at Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, and Week 24 as Assessed Using the KIT Questionnaire During the Dose Finding Period, Part 1</title>
        <description>The KIT questionnaire measures the impact on the quality of life determined by the participant and the guardian by self reported outcomes at Baseline or the Screening Visit, after 6 weeks of treatment, after 12 weeks of treatment and at the end of treatment or withdrawal from the study. The KIT total score is calculated from the scores of each of the individual questions from Q1 – Q26 (excluding any answer that is ‘Not applicable’). The code list used for the individual question scores is: 1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always and 9 = not applicable. The range of values the total score can take is 0 (worst) to 100 (best). For subjects under the age of six, the family questionnaire (parental proxy) has been used.</description>

        <title>Kids’ ITP Tool (KIT) Questionnaire Total Score at Baseline and Week 6as Assessed Using the KIT Questionnaire During the Randomized Period, Part 2</title>
        <description>The KIT questionnaire measures the impact on the quality of life determined by the participant and the guardian by self reported outcomes at Baseline or the Screening Visit, after 6 weeks of treatment or withdrawal from the study. The KIT total score is calculated from the scores of each of the individual questions from Q1 – Q26 (excluding any answer that is ‘Not applicable’). The code list used for the individual question scores is: 1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always and 9 = not applicable. The range of values the total score can take is 0 (worst) to 100 (best). For subjects under the age of six, the family questionnaire (parental proxy) has been used.</description>

        <description>The WHO Bleeding Scale is a measure of bleeding severity with the following grades: Grade 0 = no bleeding, Grade 1 = petechiae, Grade 2 = mild blood loss, Grade 3 = gross bleeding and Grade 4 = debilitating blood loss. The WHO grades were dichotomized into the following categories: no bleeding=Grade 0; any bleeding=Grades 1 to 4; no clinically significant bleeding=Grades 0 to 1; clinically significant bleeding=Grades 2 to 4. For participants randomized to Placebo in Part 2, Baseline defined as Week 7 of Part 2. For participants randomized to Eltrombopag in Part 2, Baseline defined as Day 1 of Part 2.</description>

The WHO grades were dichotomized into the following categories: no bleeding=Grade 0; any bleeding=Grades 1 to 4; no clinically significant bleeding=Grades 0 to 1; clinically significant bleeding=Grades 2 to 4. For participants randomized to Placebo in Part 2, Baseline defined as Week 7 of Part 2. For participants randomized to Eltrombopag in Part 2, Baseline defined as Day 1 of Part 2.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X,X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the ITT Population.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Bleeding, no Clinically Significant Bleeding and Significant Bleeding as Assessed Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale During Part 2/3</title>
        <description>The WHO Bleeding Scale is a measure of bleeding severity with the following grades: Grade 0 = no bleeding, Grade 1 = petechiae, Grade 2 = mild blood loss, Grade 3 = gross bleeding and Grade 4 = debilitating blood loss. The WHO grades were dichotomized into the following categories: no bleeding=Grade 0; any bleeding=Grades 1 to 4; no clinically significant bleeding=Grades 0 to 1; clinically significant bleeding=Grades 2 to 4. For participants randomized to Placebo in Part 2, Baseline defined as Week 7 of Part 2. For participants randomized to Eltrombopag in Part 2, Baseline defined as Day 1 of Part 2.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline of Part 2/3 through Follow-up</time_frame>
        <population>ITT Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X,X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the ITT Population.</population>

            <title>Part 2/ 3 (Eltrombopag Period) Cohort 1</title>
            <description>All participants aged between 12 and 17 years and completing Part 2 of the study received an Open-Label treatment of eltrombopag administered as a tablet in Part 2/3. Particpiants who received placebo in Part 2 received 24 weeks of treatment of eltrombopag starting at 37.5 mg QD up to Week 31 of the study. Participants who received 7 weeks of eltrombopag treatment in Part 2 received an additional 17 weeks of treatment to complete a total of 24 weeks continuing at the same dosage at the end of Part 2. The maximum dose allowed was 75 mg daily. All participants enrolled in the study underwent individual dose titration based upon platelet response.</description>

            <description>All participants aged between 6 and 11 years and completing Part 2 of the study received an Open -Label treatment of eltrombopag administered as a tablet in Part 2/3. Participants with difficulty swallowing a tablet in Part 2 were administered eltrombopag as a dry powder for oral suspension in Part 2/3. Particpiants who received placebo in Part 2 received 24 weeks of treatment of eltrombopag based on body weight up to Week 31 of the study. Participants with a body weight of &lt;=27 kg received 25 mg QD and participants with a body weight of &gt;=27 kg QD received 50 mg QD. Participants who received 7 weeks of eltrombopag treatment in Part 2 received an additional 17 weeks of treatment to complete a total of 24 weeks continuing at the same dosage at the end of Part 2. The maximum dose allowed was 75 mg daily. All participants enrolled in the study underwent individual dose titration based upon platelet response.</description>

Participants randomized to receive eltrombopag for 7 weeks in Part 2 continued receiving eltrombopag for an additional 17 weeks in Part 2/3 (for a total of 24 weeks of treatment) up to Study Week 24. Participants randomized to receive placebo for 7 weeks in Part 2, received 24 weeks of eltrombopag in Part 2/3 (for a total of 24 weeks of treatment) up to Study Week 31.</description>

        <title>Mean Respiratory Rate at Baseline and Maximum Post-Baseline Visit During Part 2/3</title>
        <description>Respiratory rate was measured at the following scheduled time points: Screening, Day 1, each week from Week 1 to Week 24, and at each Follow-up Weeks 1-4. Baseline is defined as the value obtained on Day 1 of treatment. The maximum post-Baseline visit included any scheduled and unscheduled post-Baseline assessment. Participants randomized to receive eltrombopag for 7 weeks in Part 2 continued receiving eltrombopag for an additional 17 weeks in Part 2/3 (for a total of 24 weeks of treatment) up to Study Week 24. Participants randomized to receive placebo for 7 weeks in Part 2, received 24 weeks of eltrombopag in Part 2/3 (for a total of 24 weeks of treatment) up to Study Week 31.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants for the Indicated Urinalysis Parameters Tested by Dipstick at Baseline and Week 24 During the Dose-Finding Period, Part 1</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters included: urine protein (UP), urine glucose (UG), urine ketones (UK), urine occult blood (UOB), and pH. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. UP was categorized as missing (MS), no result (NR), negative (Neg), Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+. UG results were categorized as MS, NR, Neg, normal, 5, 15(1+), 30(2+), 60(3+), 110(4+)UK parameters were categorized as as MS, NR, Neg, Trace(5), Small(15), Moderate(40), Large(80), Large(160). UOB parameters were categorized as MS, NR, Neg, 1+, 2+, 3+, Non haemolysed trace, and haemolysed trace. PH results were categorized as MS. NR, normalresult, Neg, and range of pH (from 5-9in increments of 0.5). Data for indicated parameters was reported at Baseline (BL) and Week 24 (W24). The Baseline value was the measurement taken at Day 1.</description>

            <description>Participants (par) aged between 1 and 17 years (Cohort 1 age group: 12 to 17 years, Cohort 2: 6 to 11 years and Cohort 3:1 to 5 years) received eltrombopag for 24 weeks. The starting dose for Cohort 1 was 25 mg, and par of East Asian ancestry received 12.5mg QD. For Cohort 2 starting dose was based on the body weight. Par with a bodyweight of &lt;27 kg received 12.5 mg QD, par with a body weight of &gt;=27 kg received 25 mg QD; par of East Asian ancestry with a body weight &lt;27 kg received 12.5 mg QD, and with a body weight of &gt;=27 kg received 25 mg QD. For Cohort 3, the starting dose was 0.7 mg/kg QD and 0.5 mg/kg/day for par of East Asian ancestry and the dose calculations were based on the body weight. The maximum dose allowed for all Cohorts was 75mg daily. For all par, individual dose titration was allowed based upon platelet response.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants for the Indicated Urinalysis Parameters Tested by Dipstick at Baseline and Week 7 During the Randomized Period,Part 2</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters included: urine protein (UP), urine glucose (UG), urine ketones (UK), urine occult blood (UOB), and pH. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. UP was categorized as missing (MS), no result (NR), negative (Neg), Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+. UG results were categorized as MS, NR, Neg, normal, 5, 15(1+), 30(2+), 60(3+), 110(4+)UK parameters were categorized as as MS, NR, Neg, Trace(5), Small(15), Moderate(40), Large(80), Large(160). UOB parameters were categorized as MS, NR, Neg, 1+, 2+, 3+, Non haemolysed trace, and haemolysed trace. PH results were categorized as MS. NR, normalresult, Neg, and range of pH (from 5-9in increments of 0.5). Data for indicated parameters was reported at Baseline (BL) and Week 7 (W7). The Baseline value was the measurement taken at Day 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants for the Indicated Urinalysis Parameters Tested by Dipstick at Baseline and Week 24 During the Eltrombopag Open-label Period, Part 2/3</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters included: urine protein (UP), urine glucose (UG), urine ketones (UK), urine occult blood (UOB), and pH. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. UP was categorized as missing (MS), no result (NR), negative (Neg), Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+. UG results were categorized as MS, NR, Neg, normal, 5, 15(1+), 30(2+), 60(3+), 110(4+)UK parameters were categorized as as MS, NR, Neg, Trace(5), Small(15), Moderate(40), Large(80), Large(160). UOB parameters were categorized as MS, NR, Neg, 1+, 2+, 3+, Non haemolysed trace, and haemolysed trace. PH results were categorized as MS. NR, normalresult, Neg, and range of pH (from 5-9in increments of 0.5). Data for indicated parameters was reported at Baseline (BL) and Week 24 (W24). The Baseline value was the measurement taken at Day 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Change in Visual Acuity and a Change Due to Worsening of Cataracts During Part 1</title>
        <description>The visual acuity assessment was performed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist under the guidance of an ophthalmologist. Visual acuity is defined as acuteness or clearness of vision. The number of participants with a change in visual acuity and worsening visual acuity due to cataracts since Baseline are presented for Part 1 Follow-up Visits at 3-months (FU3) and at 6-months (FU6). Change in visual acuity since Baseline is displayed under the left eye but applies to both eyes. Change in visual acuity (VA) is categorized as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Change due to cataracts is categorized as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</description>

The starting dose for cohort 1 was eltrombopag 25 mg, (East Asian ancestry: 12.5mg, QD). For cohort 2 starting dose was based on the body weight (Weight &amp;lt;27 kg: 25 mg QD, Weight &amp;gt;=27 kg: 50 mg QD; east Asian ancestry subjects Weight &amp;lt;27 kg: 12.5 mg QD, Weight &amp;gt;=27 kg: 25 mg QD). For cohort 1 and 2 maximum dose allowed was 75mg. For cohort 3 starting dose was 0.7 mg/kg, QD and the dose calculations were based on the body weight. For all participants individual dose titration was allowed based upon platelet response.</description>
