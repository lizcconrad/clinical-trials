      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about cancer and the development of drug resistance in patients.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining tissue samples from patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia to learn more about drug resistance in these patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Ascertain whether assessments of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) status using the accumulation
           assay find greater than 10% positive specimens among 30 specimens (collected from
           patients with acute myeloid leukemia enrolled on clinical trial ECOG-E3999) found to be
           negative using only the efflux assay.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Cryopreserved bone marrow specimens are examined for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) by the
      accumulation assay and the efflux assay using DiOC_2 dye. Flow cytometry is used for
      measuring activity in both assays.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 specimens will be accrued for this study.
