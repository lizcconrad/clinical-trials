  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have an inborn error in the metabolism of the amino acid
      phenylalanine (Phe) and thus must follow a strictly controlled protein-restricted diet from
      early infancy. This protein-restricted diet is devoid of natural dietary sources of n-3 long
      chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), such as eggs, meat, milk or fish. Therefore,
      blood concentrations of n-3 LC-PUFA, especially of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are reduced in
      PKU children compared to healthy controls. DHA availability is considered important for
      optimal neurological function. Previous studies have shown that neural function of PKU
      children is improved by high dose supplementation of fish oil providing DHA, as shown by
      significant improvements of both visual evoked potential latencies and of fine motor skills
      and coordination, but no dose response relationship has been established so far.

      This multicentric double-blind randomized trial aims at determining quantitative DHA
      requirements for optimal neural function in PKU children. Patients with classical PKU from
      several major treatment centers in Europe will be randomized to receive between 0 and 15 mg
      of DHA per kg body weight daily for a duration of 6 months. Biochemical (fatty acid
      composition of plasma phospholipids, lipoprotein metabolism and metabolic profiles), and
      functional testing (visual evoked potentials, fine motor skills, cognitive function and
      markers of immune function) will be performed at baseline and after 6 months. Intake per kg
      body weight will be related to outcome parameters and thus a possible dose response
      relationship will be defined. The results from this study are expected to contribute to the
      improvement of the diet of PKU patients, but they also have the potential to help defining
      quantitative DHA needs of healthy children.

      The primary hypothesis is that supplementation with DHA improves visual function in children
      with PKU.
