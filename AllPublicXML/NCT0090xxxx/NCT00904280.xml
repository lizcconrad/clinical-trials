        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject enrolled in this study must have been previously randomized and dosed in

             exit visits for these studies.

          -  Males or females, age 18 and 75 years, inclusively.

          -  The subject continues to have chronic moderate to severe back or cancer pain that

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject experienced any serious drug related adverse events in studies EN3202-016
             or EN3202-019.

          -  The subject withdrew from EN3202-016 or EN3202-019 for a reason other than lack of
             efficacy.

          -  Subjects with known allergies to opiate-class narcotic agents (morphine, codeine,
