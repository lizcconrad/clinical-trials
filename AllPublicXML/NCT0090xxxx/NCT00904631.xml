      Name of Device: Eraser Tattoo Removal Device

      Device Description: The Eraser device is a mechanical device, resembling tattoo devices but
      with an innovative mechanism for dripping treatment fluid over reciprocating needles and
      returning used fluid into a reservoir chamber. The device is intended for removal of tattoos.

      Objectives: This study is a continuation of a previous feasibility study, which tested the
      ability of the device to remove tattoos from small skin areas. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Eraser Tattoo Removal system for removal of
      skin tattoos in their entirety.

      Subject Population: 20 patients in the medical center. Subject enrollment will include (i) a
      variety of tattoo colors (multiple colors) (ii) a variety of tattoo composition, contour
      lines and shadings (iii) Subjects with different skin colors (white, tanned, dark, etcâ€¦) (iv)
      professional and amateur tattoos.

      Structure: A prospective, non-randomized, open, clinical study designed according to FDA
      guidelines; ISO 14155: standard for clinical studies of medical devices; and the procedures
      of the Israeli Ministry of Health for clinical studies.

      After informed consent is signed, demographic details and medical history will be taken and a
      physical examination performed. Subjects will be treated with the Eraser device, using
      salicylic acid (5%) as washing fluid. The skin will be examined by a physician and the tattoo
      area will be photographed. The Eraser device will be used to remove the tattoo from the
      entire tattoo area (up to 30 minutes in a single session). An absorbent bandage will be put
      on the treated area for one-hour post treatment. After Care Treatment, based on a
      Dermatologist's consultation, will be performed on a case-by-case basis (for example, use of
      antibiotic ointments in case of infection). All subjects must refrain from exposure to the
      sun for 90 days following each treatment.

      Follow-up: The subject will return for follow-up at one week, two weeks, 1 month and two
      months (if tattoo removal and skin healing is complete), or up to six months (if skin
      healing/ tattoo removal are not complete by two months), or until the healing of the tattoo
      removal site is completely resolved or until the investigator determines that additional
      treatments will provide no further benefit to the patient. In each follow-up visit, a
      physician will perform a physical examination, check the skin over and around the treatment
      area, and take photographs of the treated area. Images from last follow-up will be compared
      with images of the same site taken before the removal procedure, for evaluation of treatment
      efficacy and safety.

      Repeat treatments: if tattoo removal is not complete, up to two additional treatments will be
      performed, based on the investigator's discretion. After each treatment, follow-up will
      continue as described above.

      Blinding: Non-Applicable Concurrent Control: There is no concurrent control group in this
      study. Images of tattoos before treatment will serve as the reference measure, to which
      images of healed skin, several weeks after tattoo removal, will be compared.

      Sample Size: 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Primary Effectiveness Variables: The
      primary measure of effectiveness will be the pigment clearance, as evaluated by image
      comparison on a 1-5 analog scale (5 - 81-100% clearance- excellent removal; 4 - 61-80% - good
      removal; 3 - 41-60% - moderate removal; 2 - 21-40% - fair removal; 1 - 0-20% - poor removal).
      Effectiveness will be calculated for the total study group and for individual sub-groups
      (skin type, pigment colors, etc.). Effectiveness will be analyzed separately for the area
      affected (percentage of treated area that showed any reaction to treatment) and for the
      change in color brightness (if, due to technical reasons, part of the tattoo showed a major
      effect, this area will be evaluated for the change in color brightness). For both analyses,
      the same scale will be used.

      For safety assessment, the rate of systemic and dermatologic adverse events will be
      calculated and reported. The data will be listed by type of event and by severity.
      Specifically, textural change, hypo- and hyper- pigmentation will be followed and their rates
      calculated.

      Data Analysis: For this clinical study, descriptive statistics will be used. Successful
      treatment will be a result of 3 or more (at least, moderate tattoo removal) on the brightness
      change scale.
