      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To ascertain whether the quantitative assessment of enhancing synovial volume and
           perfusion indices on serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination are useful
           indicators of responsiveness to treatment in early Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) using
           biologic therapy and Methotrexate (MTX) compared with Methotrexate(MTX) alone.

        2. To assess the cost-effectiveness of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blockers compared with
           Methotrexate(MTX) monotherapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA).

      This was a 24-week open-label randomized study. Forty patients are randomly assigned to
      receive either combination infliximab plus Methotrexate(MTX) (n=20) or Methotrexate(MTX)
      alone (n=20)

      All participants received oral Methotrexate(MTX), starting at 7.5 mg/week. In patients with
      persistent tender or swollen joints, the dose was escalated in a graduated manner (2.5
      mg/week every 1-2 weeks) to 15 mg/week by week 4 or 20 mg/week by week 8 Patients in
      combination group receive infliximab 3mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 8 week thereafter.
      Comprehensive assessment will be made on week 0, 12, 24.
