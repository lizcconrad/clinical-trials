  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called sarcoma. Because there is no standard treatment for the
      patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in
      all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research
      study using special immune cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting
      disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from diseases
      caused by germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which
      stops them from growing or exerting their toxic effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes,
      are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells
      or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat
      patients with cancers: they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure
      most patients. We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. We now want to see if we can put a
      new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new
      gene that we will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition it contains CD28, which stimulated T
      cells and make them last longer. In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators
      found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the
      T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy
      before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically
      chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of patient's
      lymphocytes first should allow the T cells we infuse to expand and stay longer in your body,
      and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively. We will use fludarabine or the
      combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine as the chemotherapy agents for
      lymphodepletion. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly
      used for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to
      find the largest safe dose of chimeric T cells, and to see whether this therapy might help
      patients with sarcoma. Another purpose is to see if it is safe to give HER2-CD28 T cells
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the cells have a new gene in them the patient will be followed for a total of 15
      years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.

      When the patient is enrolled on this study, they will be assigned a dose of HER2-CD28 T
      cells. Depending on which dose level they are assigned, they will receive one of the
      following:

      HER2-CD28 T cells and fludarabine (patient will receive fludarabine for 5 days followed by
      injection of HER2-CD28 T cells)

      OR

      HER2-CD28 T cells, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (patient will receive cyclophosphamide
      for 2 days and then will receive fludarabine for 5 days before receiving the HER2-CD28 T
      cells).

      The HER2-CD28 T cells will be given into the vein through an IV line. The injection will take
      between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for
      1 to 4 hours.

      Each patient will be followed for 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion for evaluation of
      toxicity. They will have standard tests and procedures as well as research blood draws.

      If the patient has stable disease (the tumor did not grow) or there is a reduction in the
      size of the tumor on imaging studies after the T-cell infusion, they can receive additional
      doses of the T cells at 6 to 12 weeks intervals. For the first two subsequent HER2-specific
      T-cell infusions, patients will be able to receive additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy
      according to their dose levels.
