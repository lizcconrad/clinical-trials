  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since June 2007, raltegravir has been available in Switzerland within a named patient program
      for patients who have virologic failure, triple class experience and resistance, and no other
      treatment options. This proposal has been designed to evaluate efficacy and safety data among
      patients who receive raltegravir within the routine clinical practice in Switzerland and who
      participate in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. This is a combined retrospective analysis of
      patients who already received raltegravir and a prospective part of patients who enter the
      named patient program and will be followed up in a standardized way. In the prospective part,
      patients will also be able to receive raltegravir in case of intolerance to their current
      medication with virologic suppression.

      The analysis will primarily use descriptive statistics. In addition, we will assess the
      duration of virologic response and focus on predictors of HIV RNA suppression during a
      follow-up of at least 6 months. In the prospective part, we will assess trough plasma levels
      of raltegravir and other antiretrovirals. In patients who will develop virologic failure,
      genotypic and phenotypic resistance to raltegravir (and other antiretrovirals) will be
      performed to characterize the evolution of resistance during the raltegravir-containing
      regimen.

        The Swiss HIV Cohort study is a nationwide observational cohort existing for more than 20
        years and is representative of the HIV-infected population in Switzerland (approx. 50% of
        HIV-infected patients in Switzerland, participate in this study). All patients must sign an
        informed consent to participate in this study.

        The study population enrolled in the current &quot;Raltegravir in the SHCS&quot; study, is a subgroup
        of patients, that has to go on Raltegravir within the Swiss HIV Cohort study.
