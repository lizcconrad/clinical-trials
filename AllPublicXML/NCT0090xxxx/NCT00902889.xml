  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, controlled phase I study, which evaluates safety and efficacy of
      stimulation of lower caudal two contacts (GPI) vs. upper cranial two contacts (GPE) in
      Huntington´s disease (HD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 6 HD patients will be selected out of an existing larger HD patient cohort upon
      careful evaluation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria at month 0. Patients will be
      recruited if no significant cognitive deterioration is observed between month 0 and month 3.
      The preoperative clinical status will be evaluated twice including the United Huntington
      Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), neuropsychological, neurophysiologic and neuroradiological
      assessments. At 4 weeks postoperatively an extensive evaluation of effects and side effects
      of every single contact of the bilateral quadripolar electrodes takes place.

      All patients will receive a stereotactic placement of bilateral stereotactic insertion of two
      quadripolar electrodes into the Globus pallidus, two contacts reaching the GPE, two the GPI
      within both hemispheres. Surgery will be done under general anesthesia, The implantation of
      the stimulator (Kintera®) will take place in the same procedure. Postoperatively patients
      will be monitored at three and six months and regularly up to 60 months with a battery of
      clinical, neuropsychological, psychiatric, neurophysiological and neuroimaging tests.

      We expect that this trial will provide a rational basis to conclude about the efficacy,
      safety, reproducibility and long-term effects of pallidal Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) on
      motor symptoms of HD.
