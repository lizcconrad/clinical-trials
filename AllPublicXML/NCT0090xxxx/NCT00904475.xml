    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe chronic Low Back Pain (LBP) despite current analgesic
      treatment participated in a Phase IV clinical trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the
      lidocaine patch 5% compared to placebo in treating moderate to severe chronic LBP.
