      The purpose of this study is:

      I. To measure MP optical density (MPOD) spatial profiles in two groups (experimental and
      placebo) of 50 subjects each (N = 100), during an L + Z supplementation period of 12 months.

      II. To test the hypothesis that increases in MP (via 12 mg daily L + Z supplementation) will
      result in significantly improved visual performance under disability glare conditions.

      III. To test the hypothesis that increases in MP (via 12 mg daily L + Z supplementation) will
      result in significantly reduced photostress recovery times.

      IV. To test the hypothesis that increases in MP (via 12 mg daily L + Z supplementation) will
      result in improved contrast enhancement.

             tests of the study.

          -  Any condition likely to interfere with normal gastro-intestinal absorption of
             xanthophylls.

          -  Current use of xanthophyll containing supplements

          -  Use of xanthophyll containing supplements in the past 6 months

          -  Blood donation during the last 3 months.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to xanthophylls.

          -  Regular intake of medications or supplements, which the principal investigator deems
             likely to confound the study outcomes.

          -  Suspected lack of compliance with any requirements of the study.

          -  Childbearing potential and unwillingness to refrain from acceptable anticonceptive
             measures (not including abstinence).
