  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects
      with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older who have the G551D mutation in the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Ivacaftor is a potent and selective
      CFTR potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein.
      Potentiators are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties
      of the channel in the presence of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 3 study in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) age 12 years and older who
      have a G551D-CFTR mutation and percent predicted forced expiratory volumn in 1 second (FEV1)
      between 40% and 90%.

      Based on in vitro studies and pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety profiles,
      ivacaftor was selected for clinical development as a possible treatment for patients with CF.
      Patients with the G551D mutation were the targeted population for this study because
      ivacaftor is a potentiator of the gating function of the CFTR protein, and the most prevalent
      mutation with a gating defect in CF is the G551D mutation.

      This study was designed to further evaluate the efficacy of ivacaftor in subjects with CF who
      have a G551D-CFTR gene mutation and to evaluate safety in this population over a longer
      period than previously studied.

    <time_frame>baseline through 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R is a health-related quality of life measure for subjects with cystic fibrosis. Each domain is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A difference of at least 4 points in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R is considered a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline through 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sweat chloride (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) test is a standard diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF), serving as an indicator of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline through 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (intravenous, inhaled, or oral) for any 4 or more of signs/symptoms such as change in sputum; new or increased hemoptysis; increased cough or dyspnea; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; temperature above 38 degrees C; anorexia or weight loss; sinus pain/tenderness and discharge; change in physical examination of the chest; decreased pulmonary function by 10%; and radiographic changes indicative of pulmonary infection.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As malnutrition is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption, body weight is an important clinical measure of nutritional status.</description>
