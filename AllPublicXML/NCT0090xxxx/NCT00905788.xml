  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the studies, about 80% of patients undergoing in vitro
      fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) reach to the embryo transfer
      process, but only a few of them become pregnant.

      The cause of this difference can be due to some factors such as the endometrial receptivity,
      quality of transferred embryos and embryo transfer technique. Retained or expelled embryo(s)
      following embryo transfer is (are) one of the factors which may be effective on outcome. The
      purpose of this randomized clinical trial study is &quot;Lowering embryo expulsion following
      embryo transfer to improve outcome.&quot;

  <detailed_description>

      A total of 134 infertile women who undergo IVF or ICSI treatment cycle at Royan Institute
      (Infertility and Reproductive Medicine Research Centre) will enroll in this prospective
      randomized clinical trial study and will randomly be divided into two groups of 67 patients.
      This study has been approved by Royan ethics committee and written consent will be obtained
      from each patient. The patients with frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle and those with
      oocyte donation cycle, the women with uterine abnormality and the subjects with submucosal
      and intramural myoma, will be excluded from this study.

      After the ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval, The IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (ICSI) procedures will be performed to produce the embryos.

      Embryo transfer will be done only by one skilled physician. The patients will be divided into
      two groups of A and B by computerized randomly chart. In group A, the prevention technique of
      embryo expulsion will be carried out following embryo transfer, but no intervention will be
      performed in group B (control group).

      After 2 weeks, the patients will be tested for serum Î²-hCG for assessing the pregnancy. The
      clinical pregnancy will be clarified by the number of women with gestational sacs on
      transvaginal sonography at 4-6 weeks of gestation. In the calculation of implantation, the
      number of gestational sacs will be considered.
