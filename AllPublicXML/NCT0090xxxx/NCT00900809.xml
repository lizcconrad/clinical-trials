  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NK cells from patients with malignant diseases are often functionally impaired. Their
      function cannot be fully restored through ex vivo expansion and cytokine activation. In
      addition, the in vivo administration of cytokines not only expands NK cells but expands
      polyclonal T cells with no tumor specificity and no known effects.

      The utilization of Neukoplast™, as a form of adoptive immunotherapy, offers several
      advantages. Neukoplast™ represents a uniform cell population with a well-characterized
      immunophenotype, confirmed strong anti-tumor activity and are easy to grow and expand in
      culture, so that they can be made available in large numbers for therapeutic delivery.

    <description>The Neukoplast™ (NK-92) cells will be administered intravenously over 60 minutes. The starting dose of Neukoplast™ (NK-92) cells will be 1 x 10e9 ZRx-101 cells/m2 (The 3 dose levels are: 1 x 10e9 cells/m2, 3 x 10e9 cells/m2 and 5 x 10e9 cells/m2). The second infusion will only be administered after 24 hours if no unacceptable or dose limiting toxicities side effects due to the infusion of Neukoplast™ were encountered after the first infusion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory/relapse acute myeloid leukemia. Patients must not have
             received radiotherapy, chemotherapy (with the exception of hydroxyurea which must be
             discontinued 72 hours prior to therapy) or biological therapy within the preceding 2
             weeks of the planned first Neukoplast™ cell infusion and must have recovered from any
             adverse events due to prior administered agents
