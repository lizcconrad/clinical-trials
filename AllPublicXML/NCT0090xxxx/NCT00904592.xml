      1. Title: A Study on TCM comprehensive protocol of Prevention and Control in Diabetic
           Retinopathy.

        2. Objectives of study: To evaluate the Intervention effect of integrate control protocol
           on reducing the incidence rate of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, PRP and MVL. Then
           produce a high performance, optimize, convenient, applicable and demonstrated protocol
           of integrate control with Intervention of TCM and west medicine.

        3. Study Type: Interventional

        4. Study Design: Multi-center, Randomized, Blind (Subject, Investigator, Outcomes
           Assessor), Parallel Assignment, Positive controlled clinical study.

        5. Sample size: 480 subjects , divided into test and control groups equally.

        6. Primary endpoint: incidence rate of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, panretinal
           photocoagulation
