  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance and safety of the
      intravenous blood glucose (IVBG) System relative to point of care (POC) meter performance
      when each method is compared to the Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) under various conditions
      in the operating room (OR), ICU and general ward (GW) in subjects undergoing elective or
      non-emergent surgery as well as subjects admitted to the medical/surgical ICU. POC meter
      systems are currently used in the hospital environment to measure blood glucose values. The
      YSI is an accepted reference standard for assessing POC meter accuracy.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the IVBG System as
      compared with the YSI under various conditions in the operating room (OR), intensive care
      unit (ICU) and general ward (GW) in subjects undergoing elective or non-emergent surgery as
      well as subjects admitted to the medical/surgical ICU.

      Subjects will have their glucose values collected from the IVBG System and compared with
      paired plasma glucose measurements obtained using theYSI with comparative blood samples
      collected from a CVC, an arterial line or a peripheral vein.

        -  Blood samples collected per time point: approximately 2ml for waste and1mL for glucose
           measurement. In the event that a closed blood drawing system is utilized, the waste
           would be reduced or eliminated.

        -  The comparative blood samples will be drawn manually at a maximum frequency of once
           every four hours.

        -  Sample draws not to exceed 23 per subject for the duration of the study. This includes
           18 comparative blood samples and 5 calibration samples to be draw as needed (e.g.
           recalibration). Including the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) draws described in
           section 3.1.2, there would be approximately 100 mL or 6.8 tablespoons drawn per subject.
           In the case where a closed blood drawing system is used consistently, this would be
           approximately 50 mL or 3.4 tablespoons per subject.

      POC meter blood glucose measurements will be performed at the same time as the blood sample
      draws described above.
