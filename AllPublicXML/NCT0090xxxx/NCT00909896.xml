    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy of robotic approach for staging of
      endometrial cancer as compared to an equivalent abdominal approach. The primary objective is
      to measure and compare postoperative pain at rest at several time points between two groups
      of patients undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy approach for staging of endometrial
      cancer.

      The primary objective is to measure and compare postoperative pain at rest at several time
      points (24 +/-4hours, 48 +/-4hours, and 72 +/-4hours) between the two groups of patients
      undergoing either robotic or open laparotomy approach for staging of endometrial cancer. Post
      operative Quality of Life will also be collected at several time points. The total amount of
      post operative opioid requirements during the first 24hours between patients undergoing
      either robotic or open laparotomy approach surgery. The survival status every four months for
      the first two years will be monitored, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. The primary
      endpoint is the mean difference in post operative pain VAS scores reported by subjects at
      rest at the following time points: 24+/-4, 48+/-4, and 72+/-4 hours between both groups after
      surgery has been completed.
