  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the effects that eltrombopag has on
      platelets in subjects with chronic ITP. Eltrombopag is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of low platelets in patients with chronic ITP. It is
      being further studied by GlaxoSmithKline in other conditions associated with low platelets.
      This research study is being done because eltrombopag has been shown to increase platelet
      counts in a different way than other therapies for ITP. The investigators want to further
      study how eltrombopag affects subjects and their platelets to determine how the study drug
      should best be used in ITP treatment.

    <textblock>
      The B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL/Bak) balance has been identified as an intrinsic
      mechanism that is critical in determining platelet lifespan (Mason, Cell 2007). There is
      evidence that Bcl-xL protein expression in megakaryocytes is regulated by Thrombopoietin
      (TPO) mediated activation of Akt pathways mediated by Jak2 and Stat 5 (possibly by Stat 3 as
      well). (e.g., Kozuma et. al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis). Little is known about
      the Bcl-xL / Bak axis in patients with ITP, or the effect of TPO-R stimulation on platelet
      survival in patients with ITP. The TPO effect may be a result of stimulation of
      thrombopoietin-receptor (TPO-R) signalling in megakaryocytes altering the packaging of Bcl-xl
      into platelets, or be a direct effect of platelet TPO-R stimulation as described above.
