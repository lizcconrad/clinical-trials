      For patients with stage III Lung Cancer, We propose one cycle chemotherapy using Abraxane and
      Carboplatin, followed by pulsed low-dose sensitizing Abraxane chemotherapy and daily
      Radiation. This will be followed by more hi-dose chemotherapy. We anticipate this regimen to
      target early distant microscopic spread by using one cycle of chemotherapy prior to
      radiation, and to achieve control of the disease in the lung by combining pulsed low-dose
      sensitizing Abraxane, with radiation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed NSCLC.

          -  Clinical or pathologic stage IIIA (T1-3N2M0, T3N1M0) and IIIB (Any T N3M0, T4 Any N
             M0) diseases according to the American Joint Committee of Cancer criteria.

          -  Patients with malignant pleural effusion will be excluded.

          -  The primary tumor must be radiographically measurable.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 or Zubrod PS 0 or 1.

          -  FEV1 sufficient for patients to tolerate radiation therapy, which is at the discretion
             of the radiation oncologist, usually &gt; 800 ml, but may be higher or lower depending on
             the volume of radiotherapy portal, which is a variable of the tumor extent.

          -  WBC &gt; 3000; platelet count &gt; 100,000; absolute neutrophil counts &gt; 1,500; HGB &gt; 9.0
             g/dl, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min. Laboratory
             values must be obtained &lt; 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Patients with equivocal enlargement of adrenal gland(s) on CT scan, or a few equivocal
             regional or distant lesions on any imaging studies need further imaging study (PET,
             bone scan, or others) or biopsy to rule out distant metastasis.

          -  Patients must have adequate liver functions: AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of
             normal, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is
             present in the absence of liver metastasis. Bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL.

          -  Pre-existing neuropathy must not be worse than grade I.

          -  A signed informed consent.

          -  Normal organ function including EKG findings deemed acceptable for chemotherapy by the
             medical oncologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with distant metastasis (stage IV disease).

          -  Patients without measurable disease.

          -  Patients with medical contraindication to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          -  Patients with myocardial infarction within the preceding 6 months or symptomatic heart
             disease, including angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia.

          -  Patients with bilirubin elevated above institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) must
             be excluded.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.

          -  Other serious illnesses or medical conditions
