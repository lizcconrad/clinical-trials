  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A vitamin nutriceutical, Memory XL, has been shown to provide maintenance of cognitive status
      in mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer's disease patients (2 publications by T. Shea).
      Because this nutriceutical is now patented by the Univ. of Mass., other trials at that
      institution may be considered a conflict of interest. Therefore, a study of its effects on
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients will be conducted by PI who is not affiliated with
      Univ. of Mass. or with Dr. Shea. The study hypothesis is: Memory XL will maintain or improve
      the cognitive and behavioral status of patients diagnosed with MCI during the year of
      participation in the study; normally, 10-25% of MCI patients convert to mild Alzheimer's
      dementia each year.

      This IRB-approved study is a randomized double blind study of patients diagnosed with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in the Center for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Disorders
      (CANDO) at VAMC in Oklahoma City. Dr. Shea provided the pills (nutriceutical and placebos)
      from the same batches he used in former studies of Alzheimer's disease patients (produced by
      Nutricap Labs, Farmingdale, NY). Pills were dispensed by the OKC VAMC research pharmacist,
      using a random numbering system. The PI completed five cognitive testing sessions, lasting 1
      to 1.5 hours, for each subject during the 12 months of participation in the study. Subject's
      spouse or family member completed 4 questionnaires about the subject's behavioral changes,
      and kept daily records of the times each day when the subject ingested the study pill
      assigned by the pharmacist. All subjects are patients in the VAMC memory loss clinic (CANDO)
      who are monitored by their neurologists (2 co-investigators in this study).

    <measure>Differences in Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) at 12 Months From Baseline, by Study Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) is a cognitive test with 5 domains; raw scores can be converted to percentiles for age/education levels, so individuals can be compared. Higher scores mean more competence (0-36 points converted to percentiles so different ages can be compared). Total raw scores for the 5 domains were computed so that Mean and SD of differences between first and last assessments for all subjects, by study arms (nutriceutical = XL and placebo = PL) are reported here.</description>

    <measure>Differences in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Over 12 Months, by Study Group</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline before intervention to 12 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>CDR is a rating scale for 8 aspects of behavior with 0-3 points allowed; higher scores indicate more pathology. Total minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 36 respectively.Clinician rates the patient's behavior and competence with input from family members who live with the patient. ANOVA of differences between baseline and end scores of the CDR scale are reported here, by the study arm/group.</description>

    <measure>Differences in Clock Drawing Test (CLOX) Scores Over 12 Months, by Study Group</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clock Drawing Test is a cognitive screening instrument in which subjects are to draw a clock and set a specified time. Various scoring methods can be employed using 4 to 15 points, with more points showing more competence. This study used the 8-point scoring method, so that 0-8 points could be assigned during each of the baseline and 4 assessment periods during the 12-month study. ANOVA of the differences between baseline and end scores, by study arm/group was completed.</description>

Higher scores mean more competence (0-36 points converted to percentiles so different ages can be compared). Total raw scores for the 5 domains were computed so that Mean and SD of differences between first and last assessments for all subjects, by study arms (nutriceutical = XL and placebo = PL) are reported here.</description>

            <description>Subjects diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) will take 2 Memory XL pills daily for 12 months (a vitamin nutriceutical developed by Thomas Shea, Ph.D., and patented by the Univ. of Mass.). They will be assessed cognitively each 3 months to determine if Memory XL prevents them from progressing to early dementia; 10-25% of MCI patients have been shown to convert to dementia each year. Therefore, at least 10% of patients in study would be expected to progress from MCI to early Alzheimer's dementia during the year of the study.</description>

Tests used in each arm of study are the same ones used in prior publications by the nutriceutical inventor, Dr. Shea, when he assessed mild, moderate, and severely demented Alzheimer's patients. The current study is double blind, whereas Dr. Shea's studies were open label.</description>

          <title>Differences in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) Over 12 Months, by Study Group</title>
          <description>CDR is a rating scale for 8 aspects of behavior with 0-3 points allowed; higher scores indicate more pathology. Total minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 36 respectively.Clinician rates the patient's behavior and competence with input from family members who live with the patient. ANOVA of differences between baseline and end scores of the CDR scale are reported here, by the study arm/group.</description>

        <description>IADL is a behavior rating scale using 9 domains of household and community activities, with a total score of 27 points indicating less competence than a normal function score of 9 points. Outcome measure is results of an ANOVA of the differences between baseline and end/last score, by study arm/group, to detect statistically significant differences (nutriceutical vs placebo).</description>

      <time_frame>12-month study (double-blind) of Mild Cognitive Impairment patients recruited from VAMC Neurosciences memory loss clinic.</time_frame>

        <group group_id="E1">
          <title>Nutriceutical (MemoryXL) Effects on Cognition &amp; Behavior</title>
          <description>Subjects diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) will take 2 Memory XL pills daily for 12 months (a vitamin nutriceutical developed by Thomas Shea, Ph.D., and patented by the Univ. of Mass.). They will be assessed cognitively each 3 months to determine if Memory XL prevents them from progressing to early dementia; 10-25% of MCI patients have been shown to convert to dementia each year. Therefore, at least 10% of patients in study would be expected to progress from MCI to early Alzheimer's dementia during the year of the study.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Placebo Effects on Cognition/Behavior</title>
          <description>Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects will take the placebo that has been formulated to look and taste the same as the nutriceutical being studied (Memory XL). Subjects will be cognitively &amp; behaviorally assessed each 3 months of the study, with last testing done at the end of their 12 months of pill ingestion. Tests used in each arm of study are the same ones used in prior publications by the nutriceutical inventor, Dr. Shea, when he assessed mild, moderate, and severely demented Alzheimer's patients. The current study is double blind, whereas Dr. Shea's studies were open label.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Benefits of study did not appear to outweigh subject inconvenience, so study was stopped prematurely. Also, very few 'healthy' MCI subjects were recruited from the clinic population; vast majority of MCI patients had exclusionary medical problems.</limitations_and_caveats>
