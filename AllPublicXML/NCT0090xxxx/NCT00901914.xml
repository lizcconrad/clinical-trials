             pollen seasons

          -  Sensitisation to birch pollen as demonstrated, at screening, by a positive SPT to
             birch pollen with wheal diameter greater than 3 mm and specific IgE levels &gt; 0.70 kU/L
             (birch pollen and rBet v 1)

          -  Patients asymptomatic to all other allergens during the birch pollen season

          -  RRTSS during the previous pollen season ≥ 12 out of a maximum possible score of 18

          -  Patients with an FEV1 ≥ 80% of the predicted value

          -  Female patients with no childbearing potential

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential are eligible if they are not sexually active
             or if they use a medically accepted contraceptive method and have a negative urine
             pregnancy test, and are willing and able to sign written informed consent stating that

          -  Patients having provided signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis during the birch pollen season due to
             non-birch-related allergens

          -  Patients with symptomatic allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis due to house dust
             mites

          -  Patients with symptomatic allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis due to cat or dog
             allergens, and living with these animals at home or at risk of frequent contacts with
             these animals (family, friends etc.) during the course of the study

          -  Patients who previously received desensitisation treatment to birch pollen and/or
             another Betulaceae sp. within the previous 10 years

          -  Patients with asthma (except birch seasonal asthma in which case the patient could be
             included in the study)

          -  Patients with any nasal or oral condition that could interfere with efficacy or safety
             assessments (such as nasal polyposis or oral inflammation)

          -  Patients with a past or current disease, which as judged by the investigator, may
             affect the patient's participation in or outcome of this study

          -  Any disease or condition which would place a patient at undue risk by being included
             in the study (according to the investigator's opinion)

          -  Patients with ongoing treatment by immunotherapy with another allergen

          -  Patients treated with inhaled/systemic steroids within 4 weeks prior to Screening, or
