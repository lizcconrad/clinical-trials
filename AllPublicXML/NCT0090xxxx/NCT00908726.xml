    <textblock>
      AquafolTM (Daewon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) is a microemulsion propofol that
      has been developed for eliminating lipid solvent-related adverse events of long chain
      triglyceride emulsion (LCT) propofol (Diprivan®; AstraZeneca, London, United Kingdom), such
      as infection, fat embolism, hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis. Originally, AquafolTM was
      formulated with 8% polyethylene glycol 660 hydroxystearate (Solutol HS 15, BASF Company Ltd.,
      Seoul, Korea) and 5% tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether (Glycofurol, Roche,
      Basle, Switzerland). A phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of polymeric
      vehicles of this formulation in healthy volunteers showed dose-limiting toxicity.
      Subsequently, it was reformulated with 10% purified poloxamer 188 (PP188) as a nonionic block
      copolymer surfactant and 0.7% polyethylene glycol 660 hydroxystearate as a nonionic
      surfactant. Alterations in propofol formulation may result in altered pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic characteristics.

      The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol
      microemulsion and lipid emulsion, using noncompartmental analysis and population analysis
      with mixed effects modeling.

      The Subjects fasted for 6 h before study drug administration. An 18-gauge angiocatheter was
      placed in a vein of the antecubital area. A second angiocatheter was placed in the
      contralateral radial artery for frequent blood sampling. Subjects were monitored with
      electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, and invasive
      blood pressure measurement (Datex-Ohmeda S/5;Planar Systems, Inc., Beaverton, OR) and
      Bispectral Index (BIS) (Aspect 2000; Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Newton,MA). In addition,
      the electroencephalographic activity of seven monopolar channels (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, Cz, P3,
      and P4, referenced by A2) was recorded by QEEG-8 (LXE3208, Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea).

      The subjects were stratified into three age groups (19-40, 41-64, and &gt; 65 yr), and each
      group included 10 male and 10 female volunteers. Each subject received both propofol
      formulations in a crossover fashion separated by a 7-day washout period, and the order of the
      drug administration was randomized. Subjects received both propofol formulations during 60
      min. The infusion rate was assigned according to a nonblinded, randomized design to 1.5, 3,
      6, or 12 mg/kg/hr.

      Samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube and centrifuged for 10
      min at 3,500rpm. Plasma was stored at -70°C until assay. Arterial blood samples (4 ml) were
      taken at preset intervals: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 58, 60, 62,
      66, 70, 80, 90, 120 and 150 min after administration of propofol. Venous blood samples (4ml)
      were taken at preset intervals: 180, 240, 300, 600, 720 and 1,200 min after administration of
      propofol. In addition, arterial samples were drawn when LOC (loss of consciousness) and ROC
      (recovery of consciousness) were observed.
