  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed investigation is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      Provent device in a sample of OSA patients who have either refused or been non-adherent with
      PAP treatment. Both initial efficacy (evaluated after approximately one week with Provent)
      and efficacy after approximately 5 weeks in patients who demonstrate initial efficacy will be
      assessed. A secondary objective is to assess adherence with Provent treatment during the
      5-week evaluation period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of OSA in the opinion of the
             study physician

          -  Rejection of PAP treatment or minimally adherent with PAP treatment

          -  Use of the Provent device for a specified amount of time each night during three
             consecutive nights of the trial period

          -  AHI &gt; 15, or AHI &gt; 10 with evidence of CMS-recognized symptoms or co- morbidities, on
             screening/baseline PSG

          -  Investigator believes that subject can benefit from OSA treatment

          -  Subject understands and is willing and able to comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any device that interferes with nasal or oral breathing

          -  Persistent blockage of one or both nostrils which prevents airflow in one or both

          -  Any chronic sores or lesions on the inside or outside of the nose

          -  Chronic use of nasal decongestants other than nasal steroids

          -  Current acute upper respiratory (including nasal, sinus, or middle ear) inflammation
             or infection or perforation of the tympanic membrane (may be re-considered for
             participation after the acute episode resolves)

          -  History of frequent and/or poorly treated severe nasal allergies or sinusitis which
             may interfere with the ability to use Provent

          -  Severe respiratory disorders (including respiratory muscle weakness, bullous lung
             disease, bypassed upper airway, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, etc.).

          -  Narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, chronic insomnia, restless legs syndrome, REM
             sleep behavior disorder or any other diagnosed or suspected sleep disorder other than
             OSA that could affect the likelihood of apneas/hypopneas during a PSG.

          -  Periodic limb movement arousal index (PLMAI) &gt; 10 on the screening/baseline PSG.

          -  Current use of diurnal or nocturnal supplemental oxygen

             ventricular tachycardia or bradycardia if &lt; 30 beats per min for a 10-second run or
             previously undiagnosed and untreated atrial fibrillation or Mobitz II or third-degree
             heart block)
