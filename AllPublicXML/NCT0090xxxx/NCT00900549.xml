  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a major health problem in Canada. Recent advances in medical and device
      therapy have helped to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with this problem.
      Among these treatments, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has very recently been shown
      to be effective to improve functional class, quality of life and exercise tolerance of the
      patients with the most severe symptoms of heart failure and a prolonged duration of the QRS
      on the 12-lead Electrocardiography (ECG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resynchronization of the failing ventricle is currently achieved by pacing the left and right
      ventricles simultaneously with specialized electrodes and a cardiac stimulator. However,
      controversy persists concerning the optimal configuration for cardiac pacing in these
      patients. Right ventricular pacing alone has been shown to be deleterious in some patient
      populations. The benefits of biventricular pacing in heart failure patients may be due
      primarily to left ventricular stimulation and may, in some patients, be decreased by the
      presence of simultaneous RV stimulation. Preliminary data from our own animal work suggest
      that in the majority of cases, LV stimulation alone is better than RV stimulation, and that
      BiV stimulation represents an intermediary situation between LV and RV stimulation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients are eligible if they undergo an ICD implantation or replacement

          -  They have a documented LVEF ≤ 35% measured in the previous 6 months (without major
             clinical subsequent event, such as heart surgery, since the LVEF measurement)

          -  If measured by echocardiography, the LV end-diastolic diameter must be ≥ 60 mm

          -  The duration of the QRS is &lt; 120 ms

          -  They are in sinus rhythm

          -  They cannot walk more than 400 meters during the screening 6-minute walk test (the
             patients must be limited by heart failure symptoms)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an indication for permanent ventricular pacing or with chronotropic
             insufficiency defined as follow:

               -  Any condition where the treating physician believes it would not be acceptable
                  for the patient to have his device NOT programmed with the SENSOR at ON for the
                  duration of the study

               -  Second or third degree AV block, either persistent or intermittent

               -  Patients with a pacemaker or an ICD who are paced in the ventricular chamber more
                  than 5% of the time

          -  Patients with LV dysfunction associated with a reversible cause such as post-partum
             cardiomyopathy, tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, acute myocarditis or acute toxic
             cardiomyopathy (including acute alcoholic)

          -  Patients who had a myocardial infarction within the past 6 weeks* defined by 2 of the
             3 following conditions:

               -  Prolonged chest pain

               -  ECG changes suggesting of AMI

               -  Cardiac enzymes elevation more than twice the local upper limit of normal)

          -  Patients who had cardiac surgery within the past 6 weeks*

          -  Patients with moderate or severe cardiac valve stenosis (aortic, mitral, pulmonary or
             tricuspid)

          -  Patients with an inability or a limitation to walk for reasons other than heart
             failure symptoms (e.g., angina, intermittent claudication, severe lung condition or
             arthrosis)

          -  Patients with severe coexisting illnesses making survival &gt; 6 months unlikely

          -  Patients who are pregnant and/or nursing.

          -  Patients with inability or unwillingness to consent or comply with follow-up
             requirements

          -  Patients participating in another study

        The 6-week period is calculated prior to the beginning of the baseline evaluation and not
        the implant procedure itself. This difference comes from the fact that the protocol
        includes a delay of 2 to 8 weeks between the implant procedure and the actual beginning of
        the patient's evaluation.
