      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether bladder compliance is
      significantly lower in men who undergo prostatectomy for recurrence following primary
      radiation therapy than in men who undergo prostatectomy as primary treatment.

      The secondary objective is to examine the quality-of-life items addressed in the UCLA
      Prostate Cancer Index for differences between the two populations. The investigators will
      also look at secondary objective urodynamic measures, such as bladder capacity, to assess for
      a difference.

      Study Participation:

      You will come to the urology clinic for 1 visit. At this visit, a video urodynamics test will
      be performed. The urodynamics test is used to check bladder and urinary function using
      pressure and volume measurements with x-ray images.

      Pressure-monitoring catheters will be inserted into your bladder and rectum, and your bladder
      function will be checked as the bladder is slowly filled with fluid. Measurements will then
      be made of your bladder capacity (the volume of urine the bladder can hold), bladder and
      abdominal (stomach) pressures, and bladder compliance (the bladder's ability to hold urine)
      throughout the course of this study. This procedure will take about 90 minutes to complete.

      After the urodynamics test is completed, you will complete a questionnaire about your urinary
      function and your quality-of-life (regarding daily living after surgical treatment for
      prostate cancer). The questionnaire will take about 30 minutes to complete.

      If you have had urodynamic testing with Dr. Westney within the past year, we would like your
      consent to use the data from that test, and also for completion of the questionnaire
      mentioned in the previous paragraph. You will complete this informed consent and
      questionnaire being sent with a return envelope and will not need to come to the urology
      clinic for a visit.

      Length of Study:

      Once you have completed the urodynamics testing and questionnaire, your participation on this
      study is complete.

      This is an investigational study. The video urodynamics test is approved by the FDA and
      commercially available. Up to 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled
      at M. D. Anderson.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Men, seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center, who underwent radical prostatectomy as the
        first-line treatment for their prostate cancer or underwent salvage prostatectomy for
        recurrence after first-line radiation treatment; or underwent prostatectomy at least one
        year prior to study entry date or received perioperative (or peri-XRT) chemotherapy or
        hormone therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men who have undergone radical prostatectomy, via an open or minimally invasive
             approach, as primary treatment for a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

          2. Men who have undergone salvage prostatectomy for recurrence after first-line radiation
             therapy for prostate cancer.

          3. Men who underwent prostatectomy at least one year prior to study entry date. Men who
             received perioperative (or peri-XRT) chemotherapy or hormone therapy are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Men who underwent other primary or secondary treatments for prostate cancer--hormone
             therapy as only treatment, cryosurgery, adjuvant radiation after prostatectomy

          2. Men with a history of neurogenic bladder, as demonstrated by previous urodynamics.

          3. Men with a history of severe outlet obstruction due to longstanding benign prostatic
             hyperplasia. This will be demonstrated objectively by documentation in the patient's
             history of preoperative AUA symptom score greater than 15 or a history of urinary
             retention or nocturia greater than 2 episodes per night.

          4. Men who underwent additional reconstructive procedures at the time of or subsequent to
             prostatectomy, including augmentation, urethral sling, or urinary diversion.
