  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to proof the concept of EP 1645 as a diagnostic tool
      for carotid artery atherosclerosis and plaque instability and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of this diagnostic agent, a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab') conjugated with
      the diagnostic radionuclide 99mTc. Safety and tolerability will be determined by adverse
      events (AEs) observed and reported upon administration of the product and the absorbed dose
      of radiation.

    <textblock>
      For the evaluation of atherosclerosis in carotid arteries up to now sonographic measurements
      of plaque burden are used. This method has advantages for investigation of carotid arteries
      since this region is easy accessible for this investigation. However, it does not allow
      evaluation of the vessels which are remote from the body surface, as, for instance, coronary
      arteries. A method for non-invasive reliable evaluation of such arteries is needed. Also the
      distinction between vulnerable and stable plaque has a great clinical relevance. A
      quantifiable method for the determination of the effects of new therapeutic approaches would
      be highly appreciated.

      It is expected, that the new antibody fragment with its radioactive linkage will allow
      displaying an image of the activity distribution of the disease. Due to the fact that only
      patients with atherosclerotic changes in carotid arteries allow comparing the activity and
      the clinical signs of disease, this proof of concept study (phase II study) will be performed
      in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

The study results of this proof-of-concept-study will be compared purely with descriptive methods in order to create a consistent set data which can be used for a valid case number estimation for a future phase II trial.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male and female with either symptomatic (&gt; 60%) or asymptomatic (&gt; 80%) carotid artery
             stenosis between 50 and 80 years of age

          -  Symptomatic stenosis of the A. carotis interna is defined as occurence of focal
             ischemic symptoms in the area of the supplying vessel, occurence of a transischemic
             attack (TIA), occurence of focal neurologic dysfunction or unilateral blindness.

          -  informed consent in accordance with ICH GCP and § 40 AMG and StrahlSchV

          -  sonography status from the patient is present (printout is available)

          -  patients available for carotid surgery within 3 months after diagnosis of carotid
             artery stenosis

          -  In patients with bilateral disease, only the stenosis considered for surgery will be
             included in the endpoint evaluation.

             investigator

             bilateral tubal ligation)

          -  Patients presenting clinical signs of severe systemic infection (CRP &gt; 50 mg/dl)
