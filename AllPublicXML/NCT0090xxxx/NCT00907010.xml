      Objective: Evaluate the muscular strength in the ageing process and identify the changes
      between the abdominal muscles, upper and louver edges.

      Method: 48 individuals participated in this study, being divided into four groups according
      to the age: (G1) 11to 18 years old, (G2) 20 to 26 years old, (G3) 45 to 60 years old and (G4)
      66 - 82 years old. The excluding criterion included people who work out more than three times
      a week, severe arthrosin, stroke, significant cognitive deficit , obesity, use of ortheses
      for louver members or any break, with or without metallic implant. The evaluation instruments
      used were: (1) Esfigmomanômetro (EM), (2) Trunk flexor in the supine position,, (3) Jamar
      Dinamômetro and (4) Preston Pinch Gauge Dinamômetro.

      Forty-eight subjects participated voluntarily in this work and is divided into four groups of
      12 participants with 6 men and 6 women: (G1) 11 to 18 years (G2) 20 to 26 years (G3) from 45
      to 60 and (G4) 66 to 82 years, selected in dependency of Unifran and residences of the city
      of Franca, Sao Paulo - Brazil. To evaluate muscle strength, a BD sphygmomanometer was used to
      analyze the strength of flexors and extensors of the knee. The Jamar Dynamometer was used to
      assess the functional integrity of the upper and Preston Pinch Gauge Dynamometer for
      evaluation of gripper hands.
