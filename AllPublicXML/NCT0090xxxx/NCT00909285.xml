  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made by clinical, neuropsychological, and
      neuroimaging assessments. Routine structural neuroimaging evaluation is based on nonspecific
      features, such as atrophy, which is a late feature in the progression of the disease.
      Therefore, developing new approaches for early and specific recognition of Alzheimer disease
      at the prodromal stages is of crucial importance.

      In the present study the investigators would like to examine if combined treatment with TMS
      and cognitive training (CoTra) for several weeks can produce a sustained improvement in
      cognitive and behavioral symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A number of in
      vivo neuroimaging techniques, which can be used to reliably and noninvasively assess aspects
      of neuroanatomy, chemistry, physiology, and pathology, hold promise.
