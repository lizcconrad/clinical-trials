      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients with soft
      tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To develop a pilot program for the collection, archiving, and experimental analyses of
           soft tissue sarcomas (STS).

        -  To obtain STS tumors from cancer patients undergoing tumor removal or core needle
           biopsies.

        -  To evaluate cellular and molecular factors involved in STS oncogenesis by studying
           samples derived from human tumor specimens.

        -  To develop an accompanying bioinformatics database of the demographics of STS patients
           from which tumor specimens are derived for experimental study.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for gene and protein expression by cDNA microarray
      analysis, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, in vitro transformation assays, RNA interference, and
      Western blot or immunoprecipitation.
