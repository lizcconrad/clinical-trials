      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of disease free survival (DFS) and distant
      disease free survival (DDFS) at 5 years in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor and
      lymph node positive breast cancer randomized between anastrozole/letrozole 5 years and
      anastrozole/letrozole 2-3 years switching to exemestane 3-2 years.

             greater than 0.2 mm according to the AJCC Breast Staging Criteria Edition 6.

          8. Patients who have had neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible. Positive lymph node
             involvement can be defined either prior of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or at the time of
             surgery following their neoadjuvant therapy. Lymph node positivity would be defined as
             the following:

               -  Pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy lymph node assessment must include identification of
                  a histological positive axillary, internal mammary or supraclavicular determined
                  by one of the following: FNA of lymph node or sentinel lymph node evaluation, or
                  complete or limited axillary dissection.

               -  For patients that have completed their neoadjuvant chemotherapy, without prior
                  documentation of a positive lymph node, lymph node positivity must be
                  demonstrated at the time of their primary surgery as defined by either:

                    -  Either sentinel lymph node or primary axillary dissection identifying a
                       positive lymph node is acceptable as per standard institutional practice
                       guidelines.

                    -  Histological evidence of a N1-N3c lymph node involvement identified at the
                       time of primary breast surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          9. Presence of occult axillary lymph node with no evidence of primary breast tumor must
             be confirmed pathologically primary breast invasive carcinoma or DCIS with
             microinvasive. And the measurement of ER, PR and HER2 must be performed on the initial
             lymph nodes or breast tumors.

         10. Bilateral, synchronous breast cancer is allowed provided at least one of the primary
             tumors meets the eligibility criteria.

             receptor expression by institutional standards.Patients who are PR positive and ER
             negative are eligible for the trial. Tumor slides should be submitted for central
             evaluation of hormone receptor status as per Section.
