      The Phase 2 trial is a single-arm investigation designed to evaluate safety, survival, and
      immune response in patients treated with an autologous tumor-derived heat shock protein
      peptide-complex (HSPPC-96) administered at 25 μg per dose injected intradermally once weekly
      for 4 consecutive weeks and monthly following standard treatment with radiation and
      temozolomide.

    <description>Patients will receive 4 weekly injections of HSPPC-96 followed by a 5th vaccine injection on the same day of the start of maintenance temozolomide administered 2 weeks (+ 4 days) following vaccine administration #4 on the same day of the start of maintenance temozolomide (Day 36). Monthly vaccine injections will then begin on day 21 (+/- 7 days) of the first 28 day temozolomide cycle (Day 56 of the study)3 weeks following vaccine administration #5 and will continue every 28 days until depletion of vaccine or progression.
Immune monitoring will be completed pre-operatively, intra-operatively, 48-hours post-surgery, prior to vaccine administration #1, at prior to vaccine administration #5 and at weeks 09, 13, 37 and 53.
The total volume of each vaccine or place provided is 0.47 mL. The total volume that should be administered is 0.4 mL (0.07 mL overage).</description>
