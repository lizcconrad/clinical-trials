      Drug/Device Information

      1) Contrast

      30 cc bolus of a low osmolar, iodinated CT contrast agent, which is FDA approved and used in
      the clinical CT Imaging procedure.

      2) Scanner

      The 64 row-multidetector row CT unit (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) is FDA
      approved for clinical CT imaging

      Research Design and Methods

      1) Primary Endpoint

      1. Diagnostic yield of tumor perfusion measurements using a contrast assisted computed
      tomography technique.

      2) Secondary Endpoints

        1. Reproducibility of tumor blood flow estimates derived by CT.

        2. Assessment of the association between tumor vascularity responses after two cycles of
           chemotherapy and subsequent best tumor response according to standard anatomic response
           evaluation criteria (RECIST).

        3. Predictive value of tumor blood flow for patient survival, compared to the predictive
           power of tumor size determinations.

    <description>Arm A Procedure
On the first required study visit, subject will undergo one SOC CT scan followed by the research component:
CTP imaging: Single bed position CTP examination, which includes injection of 30 cc of contrast agent, over the predetermined lesion from clinical scan
Subject will stand up and walk around, and then lay back down
CT Perfusion imaging: Second single bed position CTP examination, which includes injection of 30 cc of contrast agent, over the predetermined lesion from their clinical scan
Procedures will be repeated at optional second study visit ~6-8 weeks later.</description>

On the first required study visit, subject will undergo one SOC CT scan followed by the research component:

Procedures will be repeated at optional second study visit ~6-8 weeks later.</description>

    <intervention_name>CT Perfusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will be examined with a CTP Imaging protocol which comprises repeated CT-scans of the tumor over a period of 50 seconds following the injection of a 30cc bolus of an FDA-approved low osmolar, iodinated CT contrast agent using a 64 row-multidetector row CT unit (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). One scan will be acquired every 3 seconds over a 50s period at 100 kV, and 100mA tube current. With this method, a 4cm long segment of the tumor can be analyzed, and 32 images of a slice thickness of 1.25 mm reconstructed simultaneously. Images will be evaluated using standard CT blood flow software (Perfusion 2, AW, GE Health Care, Milwaukee, WI).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with any stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who will undergo imaging
             with CT of the chest with intravenous contrast as standard of care. Other imaging
             tests will be performed as clinically indicated.

          -  Patient should be receiving, or planning to receive, or have received systemic therapy
             (chemotherapy and/or novel agents) treatment with or without radiotherapy. Patients
             should not be receiving adjuvant or postoperative treatment but neoadjuvant treatment
             is allowed.

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC.

          -  At least one measurable primary or other intrathoracic/supraclavicular lesion â‰¥ 1 cm,
             according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); this lesion should
             be either proven to be malignant by biopsy or be considered malignant based on its
             evolution on previous imaging studies. A scan within 3-6 months prior to registration
             can be used as the baseline scan.

          -  Age 18 years or older and ability to provide informed consent.

          -  Subjects must use medically appropriate contraception if sexually active; women of
             childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Subjects must have normal renal function to participate. Standard laboratory testing
             to evaluate renal function will be performed prior to administering IV contrast and
             will be available as standard of care. Renal impairment is defined as a glomerular
             filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA, derived from the patients' serum
             creatinine concentration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of reproductive potential, who are sexually active but unwilling and/or
             unable to use medically appropriate contraception, or women who are pregnant or
             breastfeeding;

          -  Established allergy to iodine containing contrast media
