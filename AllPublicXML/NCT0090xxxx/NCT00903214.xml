      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. Riluzole may help slow the
      growth of tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying riluzole in women with stage I, stage II, or stage
      IIIA breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effects of glutamate receptor blockade with riluzole on cellular
           pathways important in the genesis and progression of disease in women with stage I-IIIA
           breast cancer by examining components of the mGluR1 signaling pathway in the pre- and
           post-treatment tumor samples to determine if glutamate blockade affects signaling
           through this pathway.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether treatment with riluzole affects the proliferation and apoptosis in
           a manner suggesting a potential for therapeutic effectiveness.

        -  To determine whether treatment with riluzole causes objectively measurable tumor
           shrinkage.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily on days -14 to 0. Approximately 12 hours
      after completion of riluzole therapy patients undergo standard surgery (i.e., partial or
      total mastectomy) along with sentinel lymph node biopsy (for patients with node-negative
      disease) or full axillary dissection (for patients with node-positive disease) on day 0.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional image assessment at pre- and post-treatment by Computerized
      Ultrasound Risk Evaluation (C.U.R.E.).

      Patients undergo core needle biopsy at baseline and during surgery for biomarker analysis
      (e.g., mGluR1) by IHC, western blotting, and RT-PCR. Blood samples are collected for GRM1
      polymorphism analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then
      according to standard-of-care thereafter.
