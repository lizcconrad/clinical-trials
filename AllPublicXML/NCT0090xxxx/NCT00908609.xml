      The investigators propose to validate the utility of their novel hybrid imaging technique for
      accurate diagnosis of breast lesions, and for assessing chemotherapy response of cancer
      treatment and predicting treatment efficacy. The investigators' unique hybrid technique is
      implemented by simultaneously deploying near infrared (NIR) optical sensors and a commercial
      ultrasound (US) transducer mounted on a hand-held probe, and utilizing co-registered lesion
      structure information provided by ultrasound to improve the optical tomography.

      As a result, the optical tomography assisted with US has overcome problems associated with
      intense light scattering and has provided reliable tumor angiogenesis distributions. Initial
      results with a small group of patients who underwent biopsy have shown that early stage
      invasive cancers present two-fold greater total hemoglobin concentration on average than
      fibroadenomas and other benign lesions. Initial results of advanced cancers have shown that
      the angiogenesis distribution is highly distorted and heterogeneous, and the distorted
      distributions correlate with histological microvessel density counts and can be used to
      assess chemotherapy response.

      The objective of this study is to validate the investigators' initial results that NIR light
      guided by ultrasound can improve breast cancer diagnosis and monitor chemotherapy response.

      Specific objectives of the study are:

      Objective 1: Validate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative
      predictive value of optical tomography/US for distinguishing benign and early stage malignant
      breast tumors. Approximately 300 patients who will undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy are being
      recruited to this study from the University of Connecticut Health Center and Hartford
      Hospital. The total hemoglobin concentration and blood oxygen saturation will be the measured
      indices and the biopsy results will be used as the 'gold' standard.

      Objective 2: Perform pilot studies of optical tomography/US to assess chemotherapy response
      and evaluate treatment efficacy. Patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancers
      (size greater than 3 cm) who will undergo chemotherapy will be enrolled to this study.
      Approximately, 20 to 30 patients are being recruited to the study from the University of
      Connecticut Health Center and Hartford Hospital.
