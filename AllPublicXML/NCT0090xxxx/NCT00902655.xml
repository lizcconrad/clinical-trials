    <textblock>
      Nocturia is defined as waking one or more times to void during the period between going to
      bed with the intention of sleeping and waking with the intention of arising.The
      pathophysiology of nocturia is multifactorial and can be complex. Therefore it is important
      to adopt a systematic approach to identify the possible causal factors of nocturia and to
      treat them accordingly. Patients with nocturia can be categorized as having one of the
      following three disorders: (1) nocturnal polyuria (NP) in which the voided urine volume
      during the hours of sleep exceeds 35% of the 24-hr output, (2) low nocturnal bladder capacity
      (NBC) causing a nocturnal urinary volume greater than the bladder capacity, (3) or mixed
      nocturia, a combination of the preceding two categories.

      Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), has been used for many
      years to treat diabetes insipidus and primary nocturnal enuresis.More recently, it is also
      known to be effective against nocturia with NP by decreasing night-time urine
      production.However, it may be associated with an increased risk of developing hyponatremia
      due to water retention, especially in elderly patients.In the present study, we investigated
      the safety and efficacy of oral desmopressin for the treatment of mixed nocturia in patients
      with both NP and a low NBC.

      1. Open label, prospective, multicenter study

        2. Study design

             -  screening (1-week), dose titration (1-3 weeks) and 4-weeks of treatment period

             -  open-label dose-titration periods of up to 3 wk; the patients' optimum oral
                desmopressin dose (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) was determined as the dose that decreased
                the number of nocturnal voids by ≥50% and NUV decreased by ≥20% without
                hyponatremia.

             -  If the patients did not meet the above criteria during dose titration period, they
                received the maximum tolerable dose instead of the optimum dose. -- 4-weeks of
                treatment period; Eligible patients were treated with the determined optimum
                desmopressin dose for 4-weeks.

        3. Measurements

             -  3-day frequency-volume charts

             -  sleep questionnaire

             -  body weight, blood and urine analysis,serum sodium monitoring

             -  adverse event
