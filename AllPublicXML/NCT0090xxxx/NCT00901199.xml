  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study looking at the safety of giving combination chelation with Exjade
      and Desferal to 15 patients. The hypothesis is that combination chelation is safe in
      decreasing overall iron in patients with thalassemia.

    <description>This is the cohort in the study for children ages 8-18 years old. All subjects in this arm must have Liver Iron by SQUID of between 5-15mg/g dry liver and have a documented endocrinopathy or cardiac finding (low T2* or decreased cardiac function). All subjects in this arm will receive 7 days per week of Exjade and 3-5 days per week of Desferal.</description>

    <description>Adults in this arm will have moderate iron overload,defined as SQUID of 5-15mg/g dry weight. They will also have to have a documented endocrinopathy or cardiac finding (low T2*). All subjects in this cohort will receive 7 days per week of Exjade (20-30mg/kg) and Desferal (50mg/kg)3-5 days per week.</description>

    <description>Adults with high iron overload defined as over 15mg/g dry liver. No cardiac finding or endocrinopathy necessary. Subjects in this cohort will receive Exjade 20-30mg/kg 7 days per week and Desferal (50mg/kg)5-7 days per week.</description>
