  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RT001 compared to placebo applied as a single,
      bilateral application in at least 180 subjects with moderate to severe LCLs. Subjects will be
      randomized within each site to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The safety and
      efficacy of two different doses of RT001, compared to placebo, will be evaluated.

      At least 180 adult volunteers who have provided informed consent and have met the study
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled in two (2) sequential
      cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of 72 subjects; 24 subjects per treatment group. Cohort 2 will
      consist of 108 subjects; 36 subjects per treatment group. In order to confirm the safety of
      the test articles, Cohort 2 will not be enrolled until all Cohort 1 subjects have reached Day
      14 or later with no Study Pause Criteria being observed.
