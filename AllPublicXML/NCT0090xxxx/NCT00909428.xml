  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary urgency is a key symptom of overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) and may be more
      bothersome to a patient than the symptom of urinary frequency. Unfortunately, controversy
      continues to surround the term 'urgency' and there is no good tool to evaluate the severity
      of urgency. This fact has constrained the performance of clinical research in this field. The
      cause of urinary urgency is not fully understood and may vary from patient to patient.

      Although clinicians regularly obtain measures of bladder sensation during cystometry, little
      attention has been paid to the patient experience of urinary urgency. In this study, the
      researchers will use a non-significant risk device (i.e., an Urgeometer) to measure urinary
      urgency in women with overactive bladder.

    <textblock>
      At baseline, a small catheter is placed inside the participant's bladder. The bladder is
      filled with sterile water through the catheter. As the bladder is filled, the participant is
      asked to rate their urinary urgency using the Urgeometer. The Urgeometer lever marks a
      continuous scale from 0 `no urge at all` to 100 `maximum urge which you can tolerate'. The
      testing is stopped once the bladder is filled. To minimize the chance of infection,
      participants receive one dose of oral antibiotics prior to the bladder testing.

      Following completion of the bladder test, participants will take 10mg solifenacin succinate
      (VesicareR) daily for 30 days. Afterward, participants repeat the bladder test. The change in
      participants' maximal tolerated cystometric capacity (MCC) will be measured in milliliters
      and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug.

          <description>At baseline, a small catheter is placed inside the participant's bladder. The bladder is filled with sterile water through the catheter and participants' maximal tolerated cystometric capacity (MCC) is measured in milliliters. Following completion of the bladder test, participants take 10mg solifenacin succinate (VesicareR) daily for 30 days. After 30 days of treatment, participants repeat the bladder test. Change in the MCC is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug.</description>
          <population>The primary outcome analysis population comprises only women with two valid MCC recordings (i.e., one baseline recording and one recording following 30 days of treatment with daily 10mg solifenacin succinate. The groups DOI and USI were combined for this repeated measures analysis.</population>
