  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study (Part A and Part B) that will first aim to establish the PK/PD
      relationship between exposure and lipid effects (Part A: 75 subjects), and will then confirm
      the effect using the most relevant dose(s) (Part B: ~90 subjects). Doses of 5mg, 50mg and
      150mg of GSK256073 will be administered in Part A, and the dose(s) for Part B will be based
      on the PK/PD data from Part A. Data from Part A and Part B will be combined to decrease
      overall subject numbers needed in part B. Part B of the study will include a niaspan arm for
      relative comparison of the effects of GSK256073 and niacin on lipids and flushing

    <measure>The GSK256073 Area Under Concentration-time Curve (AUC) and High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDLc) Data to Evolve the Exposure-response Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Relationship for Changes in HDLc Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 6 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The potential PK/PD relationship was to be assessed by plotting GSK256073 AUCs against HDLc. The PK/PD model that was to be used for the simulations in the study design was to be refined with the Part A observed AUC exposures and HDLc levels. However, the study was stopped for futility at the end of Part A due to lack of a compelling PK/PD relationship between GSK256073 and lipid effects that would predict success in achieving significant HDLc raising.</description>

    <measure>Average Global Flushing Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Flushing assessment was captured by participants in individual diaries provided to each study participant. Participants were instructed to return their diaries after each study visit (Week 2, Week 4, Week 6 and Week 8) where they were given a new diary for the time between visits. Flushing symptom questionnaire (FSQ) was used to measure participant reported feelings of severity associated with different types of flushing symptoms. The FSQ comprised of 11 items. The response scale combined verbal descriptors as well as a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Items 1, 2, 4 and 10 had verbal descriptors. The items 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 were rated on a 0 to 10 scale (none=0, mild=1-3, moderate=4-6, severe=7-9 and extreme=10). The total score for these items ranged from 0 (not at all) to 70 (extreme). Higher score indicated more severe flushing symptoms and 0 indicated no flushing symptoms.</description>

        <title>The GSK256073 Area Under Concentration-time Curve (AUC) and High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDLc) Data to Evolve the Exposure-response Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Relationship for Changes in HDLc Levels</title>
        <description>The potential PK/PD relationship was to be assessed by plotting GSK256073 AUCs against HDLc. The PK/PD model that was to be used for the simulations in the study design was to be refined with the Part A observed AUC exposures and HDLc levels. However, the study was stopped for futility at the end of Part A due to lack of a compelling PK/PD relationship between GSK256073 and lipid effects that would predict success in achieving significant HDLc raising.</description>

        <title>Average Global Flushing Score</title>
        <description>Flushing assessment was captured by participants in individual diaries provided to each study participant. Participants were instructed to return their diaries after each study visit (Week 2, Week 4, Week 6 and Week 8) where they were given a new diary for the time between visits. Flushing symptom questionnaire (FSQ) was used to measure participant reported feelings of severity associated with different types of flushing symptoms. The FSQ comprised of 11 items. The response scale combined verbal descriptors as well as a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Items 1, 2, 4 and 10 had verbal descriptors. The items 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 were rated on a 0 to 10 scale (none=0, mild=1–3, moderate=4–6, severe=7–9 and extreme=10). The total score for these items ranged from 0 (not at all) to 70 (extreme). Higher score indicated more severe flushing symptoms and 0 indicated no flushing symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Self Reported Assessment of Flushing</title>
        <description>Flushing assessment was captured by participants in individual diaries provided to each study participant. Participants were instructed to return their diaries after each study visit (Week 2, Week 4, Week 6 and Week 8) where they were given a new diary for the time between visits. Participants were asked to perform an assessment of their perceived flushing intensity after their completion of VAS assessment once daily after their first flushing episode (if more than one happens to occur). The scale was from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no flushing, 1 represents mild flushing, 2 represents moderate flushing, and 3 represents severe flushing.</description>

        <description>Flushing assessment was captured by participants in individual diaries provided to each study participant. Participants were instructed to return their diaries after each study visit (Week 2, Week 4, Week 6 and Week 8) where they were given a new diary for the time between visits. Participants self-assessed intensity of flushing using a 100 mm VAS once daily at the first flushing episode. The left hand side of the scale (0) represented ‘No Flushing Sensation’ and the right hand side of the scale (100) represented ‘Unbearable Flushing Sensation’. The intensity of flushing of each episode was measured in centimeters (to the nearest 1/100) from the 0 point of the scale. Data is reported for average VAS scores over 8 weeks of treatment.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Fasting Levels of Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), Glucose, Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDLc), Apolipoprotein A2 (ApoAII), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) Over 8 Weeks of Administration With GSK256073 or Placebo</title>
        <description>Blood samples for analysis of fasting levels of TC, TG, glucose, LDLc, ApoAII and ApoB was collected at Baseline (Week 0) and Week 2, 4, 6 and 8. Baseline was defined at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-Baseline value from the Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was calculated by multiplying change from baseline value with 100.</description>

        <title>Plasma PK- Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax)</title>
        <description>All participants treated with GSK256073 or placebo participated in PK sampling. Blood samples for PK analysis of GSK256073 to determine Cmax was collected at Week 2, 4, 6 and 8. For samples obtained during time windows, every attempt was made to collect three samples during each time window: pre-dose to 2 hours after dosing, 2 hours to 4.5 hours after dose, and 6 hours to 12 hours after dose. During each window, 3 samples spaced at least 30 minutes apart were collected (i.e., avoid collection from all participants at the same time within a window or only at the extremes of a time window). The first occurrence of the Cmax was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data.</description>
