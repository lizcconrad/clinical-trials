  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects
      with cystic fibrosis aged 6 to 11 years who have the G551D mutation in the cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Ivacaftor is a potent and selective
      potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein. Potentiators
      are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties of the channel
      in the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)
      activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      multicenter study of orally administered ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) 6 to
      11 years of age who have the G551D-CFTR mutation and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1) between 90% and 105% predicted (using Knudson standards).

      Based on in vitro studies and pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety profiles,
      ivacaftor was selected for clinical development as a possible treatment for patients with CF.
      Patients with the G551D mutation were the targeted population for this study because
      ivacaftor is a potentiator of the gating effect of the CFTR protein, and the most prevalent
      mutation with a gating defect in CF is the G551D mutation.

      This study was conducted in 2 parts. Part A was conducted to analyze the PK properties of
      ivacaftor and to determine the most appropriate dose to administer to subjects in Part B of
      this study. Part B explored the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor over long-term treatment in
      subjects 6 to 11 years of age.

    <description>The CFQ-R is a health-related quality of life measure for subjects with cystic fibrosis. Each domain is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A difference of at least 4 points in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R is considered a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Part A started on 05 August 2009 (signing of first informed consent). Screening evaluations were completed during Day -28 to Day -2. All subjects completing Part A were offered the opportunity to participate in Part B, which started on 12 March 2010. Screening evaluations were completed during Day -35 to Day -15 before the first dose of study drug.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Nine subjects were dosed and included in Part A. In Part B, 52 subjects were enrolled and all were randomized to ivacaftor (26 subjects) or placebo (26 subjects). A 2-week run-in period was included to establish the baseline assessments on Day 1 after ensuring that subjects were properly taking their cystic fibrosis (CF) medication regimens.</pre_assignment_details>
