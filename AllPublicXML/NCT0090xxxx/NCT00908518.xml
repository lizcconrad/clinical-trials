    <textblock>
      The progressive aging of the general population cause increase in number of extensive and
      long surgeries in older patients. Age is a risk factor for perioperative myocardial ischemia
      and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) The suggested study will deal with the
      above-mentioned complication in patients older then 65 years undergoing major non-cardiac
      surgeries.

      It has been shown that Isoflurane and sevoflurane may have a cardio-protective effect after
      cardiac surgery involving cardio-pulmonary bypass, and it was recommended that isoflurane
      should be used in these cases. A question was raised but haven't been answered yet, whether
      this cardio-protective effect exists also in non-cardiac major surgery.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the occurrence of
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction and perioperative myocardial ischemia between total
      intravenous anesthesia using propofol and isoflurane based anesthesia.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the occurrence of
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction and perioperative myocardial ischemia between total
      intravenous anesthesia using propofol and isoflurane based anesthesia.

      The suggested study is a randomized controlled study. 500 patients older then 65 years
      undergoing elective non-cardiac major surgeries will be studied.

      On the day prior to surgery the patient will take a series computerized cognitive tests
      (Mindstream® cognitive health assessment, neurotrax®, Modiin, Israel). At the holding area
      before entering the operating room (OR) the patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      study groups.

      Group 1 -IA: anesthesia will be maintained using Isoflurane carried by O2/air. Group 2 - TIVA
      : anesthesia will be maintained with propofol. The patients will be followed for 3 months
      post-operatively. Cognitive function will be assessed 7 days and 3 months postoperatively
      using computerized tests and telephone interview.
