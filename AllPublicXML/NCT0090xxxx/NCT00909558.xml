  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of natural killer (NK)
      cell and natural killer T (NKT) cell-based autologous adoptive immunotherapy in subjects with
      metastatic, treatment-refractory breast cancer, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous
      cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer or prostate cancer.

    <description>The study drug is derived from ex vivo expansion of each subject's own white blood cells and is therefore autologous.
The current study proposes a 3-course treatment of doses administered at one week intervals with monitoring at each administration plus 2 weeks after the last dose. The total study time (apheresis through last follow-up) is estimated at 15 weeks.</description>
