  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that individuals provided with 1 meal per day of portion-controlled foods
      (shakes and prepared entrees) will lose as much weight as individuals provided with 2 meals
      per day of portion-controlled foods. The study is designed to assess whether equal weight
      loss can be achieved at a lower cost to the health care system (or health care payer), with
      patients contributing some of the cost of their own treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two goals. First, it will assess the efficacy of a weight loss program, using a
      combination of counseling by peer weight coaches and portion-controlled foods. Second, the
      study will test the effect of varying the &quot;dose&quot; of portion-controlled foods provided to
      patients by randomly assigning individuals to receive half or all of the food required to
      follow a meal replacement regimen. The primary endpoint of the study will be weight change.
      Secondary endpoints will include adherence to the recommended eating plan, health-related
      quality of life, as well as changes in waist circumference and blood pressure. The provision
      of &quot;half-dose&quot; portion-controlled foods (1 meal per day) is hypothesized to be non-inferior
      to provision of &quot;full-dose&quot; (2 meals per day). The goal of non-inferiority is important
      because it can demonstrate that health care payers wishing to support weight loss programs
      can achieve equivalent results at a lower cost. All patients have the choice regarding their
      use of portion-controlled foods in the study, and no patients will be asked to leave the
      study because of non-adherence.
