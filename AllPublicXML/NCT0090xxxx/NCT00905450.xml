        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age on the date the Informed Consent Form (ICF)
             is signed and with the capacity to voluntarily provide consent.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and provide written consent on the Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved ICF and provide authorization as
             appropriate for local privacy regulations.

          -  Subjects who are candidates for cataract surgery.

          -  Subjects who are not of childbearing potential or female subjects who have a negative
             urine pregnancy test result at screening.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with all treatment and follow- up
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study drug(s) or
             their components.

          -  Subjects who have a history or presence of chronic generalized systemic disease that
             the Investigator feels might increase the risk to the subject or confound the result
             of the study.

          -  Subjects who have a severe/serious ocular condition, or any other unstable medical
             condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may preclude study treatment or
             follow-up.
