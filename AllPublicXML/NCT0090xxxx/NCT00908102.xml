      The purpose of this study is:

        -  Epidemiological part: characteristics of low back pain patients from a forestry company
           in Finland. Data is collected from occupational health databases and self administered
           questionnaires.

        -  Intervention: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of several different
           interventions in subacute low back pain (LBP) patients in occupational health (OH).

      Eligible subjects were divided into two randomised controlled trials with the name of &quot;mild&quot;
      or &quot;moderate&quot; low back pain trials (interventions) and also mild vs natural course (NC) and
      moderate vs. NC interventions.

      Pain, disability and quality of life were collected up to 2 years by self-administered
      questionnaires and sickness absences were gathered from electronical records for at least 4
      year's follow up time.

    <description>An intensive, multidisciplinary LBP rehabilitation program was carried out in a physical medicine out-patient unit at the local Central Hospital. The program included a 3-week pre-course of 1,5 hour session at 3 days per week, closely followed by a 3-week intensive rehabilitation course of 6.5 hours per day for 5 days per week. A personal graded activity training program was made for each subject and patients were later called for follow-up visit within 1 year of the initial course. Arm is included in the MOderate and Moderate vs. NC interventions.</description>
