      The purpose of this study is to determine whether maintenance renal transplant patients
      receiving Myfortic can reduce or discontinue GI prophylaxis medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GI prophylaxis is common post kidney transplant and is routinely used in patients receiving a
      variety of different immunosuppressive regimens. Cellcept and prednisone are often the
      biggest concern for GI distress and GI ulcers. Routine use of GI prophylaxis medications
      post-transplant are potentially one mental obstacle to transplant clinicians being fully
      persuaded of the GI neutral effect of myfortic in the immunosuppressive regimen. Patients
      receiving myfortic (as part of the conversion in the US02 study) are theoretically at a
      reduced risk for GI upset and development of GI ulcers. These patients are ideal candidates
      to discontinue their GI prophylaxis medications while taking myfortic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have completed the parent study, US02.

          -  Patients on GI medications.

          -  Patients currently receiving Myfortic (all dosages are allowed), neoral or tacrolimus
             with or without corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for at
             least two weeks.

          -  Patients with and/or without mild GI complaints (e.g. upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia,
             anorexia, nausea, vomiting) with or without diarrhea.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the
             inclusion period. The test should be performed at Baseline visit. If positive, the
             patient will not be included. Effective contraception must be used during the trial,
             and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the study medication.

          -  Patients who are willing and able to participate in the full course of the study and
             from whom written informed consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of graft rejection or treatment of acute rejection within 14 days prior to
             Baseline visit.

          -  Patients who have received an investigational immunosuppressive drug within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are
             pregnant and/or lactating, who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception.

          -  Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt;75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of
             &lt;1,500/mm3 and/or leukocytopenia (&lt;4,000/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt;9.0g/dL prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Presence of clinically significant infection requiring continued therapy, severe
             diarrhea or active peptic ulcer disease that would interfere with the appropriate
             conduct of the study.

          -  Evidence of severe liver disease (incl. abnormal liver profile i.e. AST, ALT or total
             bilirubin &gt;or= 3 times ULN).

          -  Abnormal physical or laboratory findings of clinical significance within 2 weeks of
             inclusion which would interfere with the objectives of the study.

          -  Evidence of drug and/or alcohol abuse.

          -  Inability to self-administer the GSRS, GIQLI and PGWBI questionnaires.

          -  Patients receiving &gt;10mg/day prednisone dose.
