  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the technical performance and clinical handling of a
      coronary catheter that includes two imaging techniques. The catheter being evaluated performs
      near infrared spectroscopy and ultrasound imaging of the coronary arteries. Near infrared
      spectroscopy is used to identify lipid or cholesterol deposits in the vessel wall and the
      ultrasound component provides structural information about the vessel. Combining multiple
      imaging techniques into a single catheter can reduce the total number of catheters required
      during treatment and the overall duration of cardiac catheterization. Both of these results
      may lead to safer procedures.
