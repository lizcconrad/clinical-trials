      This is a randomized study between two accepted techniques of mesh fixation for laparoscopic
      hernia repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study in which subjects will undergo one or two currently accepted
      techniques of mesh fixation during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Subject will undergo
      mesh fixation with either trans-abdominal sutures and metallic tacks or metallic tacks only.

      Pain will be assessed through week 12, and hernia recurrence will be assessed for 2 years
      after surgery. Subjects will complete pain questionnaires at baseline, each day during
      hospital stay, and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge. Quality of life
      questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at discharge from hospital, and during
      follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after discharge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Demographics:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  If female, negative pregnancy test

        Pre-Operative Findings:

          -  Presence of an abdominal hernia associated with previous surgical incision

          -  Midline ventral\incisional hernia demonstrated either on physical examination by
             investigators or radiologic imaging tests.

          -  CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound

          -  No evidence of incarceration, strangulation

          -  Size of hernia ≥ 4 centimeters or ≤ 20 centimeters (cross-sectional diameter)

          -  Multiple hernias cumulative size ≤ 20 centimeters in cross-sectional diameter

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pre-Operative History:

          -  Severe medical co-morbidities that prevent safe performance of laparoscopic surgery
             including coronary artery disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, etc.

          -  History of the following:

               -  Connective tissue or wound healing disorder (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)

               -  Chronic use (defined as greater than 3 months) of narcotic analgesic for pain
                  other than from the hernia that is intended to be repaired

          -  Allergy to products used in hernia repair including surgical mesh

          -  Any abdominal ventral incisional hernia previously repaired with permanent synthetic
             mesh placed inside the peritoneal cavity

          -  Loss of abdominal domain (i.e. majority of abdominal organs lie outside confines of
             the abdominal musculature and fascia)

          -  Presence of simultaneous intra-abdominal infection

          -  Simultaneous presence of a bowel obstruction

          -  History of suspected or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years.

          -  Uncontrolled anxiety, schizophrenia, or other psychiatric disorder that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with study assessments or compliance.

        Intra-operative Findings:

          -  Simultaneous performance of another surgical procedure during hernia repair other than
             acts necessary to complete hernia repair (e.g. cutting of abdominal adhesions)

          -  Intra-operative identification of full thickness injury to intestine (i.e.
             enterotomy), liver, bladder, etc.
