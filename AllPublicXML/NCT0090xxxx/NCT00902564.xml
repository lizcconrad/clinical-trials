    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of escitalopram after 8 weeks of
      treatment in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), to evaluate proportion of
      patients who respond to escitalopram during the treatment period, and to evaluate safety of
      escitalopram.

      The study will be performed in Russia, as an open-label, uncontrolled, one arm trial. The
      patients will receive escitalopram for 8 weeks. Start and maintenance dosages as well as dose
      titration will be left to the investigators' decision (5 to 20 mg/day), in accordance with
      the national Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC).
