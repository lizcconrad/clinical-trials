  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the present study are (1) to analyze baseline patient characteristics
      cross-sectionally, (2) to analyze the prognosis and its predictive factors, and (3) to
      examine longitudinal clinical course in patients with chronic respiratory failure receiving
      domiciliary NPPV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited data are available about the prognosis and its predictive factors in patients with
      chronic respiratory failure receiving domiciliary NPPV. In addition, their health status,
      psychological status and sleep quality seem to be highly disturbed due to severe respiratory
      insufficiency. Therefore, in the present study, we aim to examine (1) contributive factors to
      health status based on baseline data, (2) whether patient reported measurements such as
      health status, dyspnea and psychological status would predict patient's future outcomes, and
      (3) how they would change for 3 years as compared to physiological measurements.
