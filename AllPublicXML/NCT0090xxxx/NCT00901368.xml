      Aim of the present investigation is to demonstrate the clinical equivalence between
      fluticasone plus salmeterol 500/100 µg daily and an equipotent dose of CHF1535 in maintaining
      the same asthma control in patients adequately controlled with fluticasone plus salmeterol at
      the above mentioned daily dose.
