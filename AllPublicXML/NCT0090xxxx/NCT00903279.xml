  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate that utilization of retapamulin preoperatively will eliminate
      MRSA colonization among patients who are colonized in their nares.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced characterization of MRSA strains carried by patients and their eradication prior to
      surgery will significantly reduce healthcare costs to the VA by reducing the number of MRSA
      positive patients who need to be isolated and or closely monitored, and allow healthcare
      providers to better predict the patient's requirements. In addition, the application of
      molecular methods will facilitate faster tracking of MRSA postoperative infections.
