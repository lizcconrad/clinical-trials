  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient presenting to chronic pain clinics frequently undergo diagnostic and therapeutic
      spinal injections as part of their treatment. These procedures can cause significant level of
      apprehension in patients, which can lead to increased procedural times, increased procedural
      pain and reluctance to continue with the treatment program. It appears that certain
      interventions could reduce the anxiety and catastrophization levels and modify pain
      perception during medical procedures. The investigators therefore sought to evaluate the
      effect of a single 30 minutes information session which includes relaxation training
      administered 5 to 6 days before the nerve block procedure on patient's anxiety and
      catastrophization levels prior to the procedure and pain scores during the procedure, as well
      as the overall level of satisfaction with care received.
