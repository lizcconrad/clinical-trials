      Background: Increased total serum IgE levels are a common characteristic of atopic diseases.
      Increased cord blood IgE levels, in conjunction with a family history of atopy, are
      associated with the development of allergic diseases in children. However, little is known
      about predictors of cord blood IgE levels.

      Objective: The aim of our study was to identify predictors of cord blood IgE levels in an
      ongoing large birth cohort of infants with or without a family history of atopy.

      Methods: Blood sampling of mothers was performed just before the delivery of newborns. Cord
      blood was also collected when the child was born. Maternal and cord blood was measured for
      IgE levels and cytokines. Questionnaires were administered after birth of the infant.
