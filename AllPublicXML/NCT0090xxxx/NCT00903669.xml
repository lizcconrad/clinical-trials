    <textblock>
      The current study sought to determine the reliability of the rehabilitation protocol using
      the labial commissure angle (LCA) as an indicator of both muscle tonus and therapeutic
      success. The investigators hypothesized that this measurement would provide objective data
      regarding the efficacy of rehabilitation for these challenging patients.

      CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: In cases of peripheral facial paralysis (PFP), diminished facial
      movements and their resultant cosmetic sequelae may have significant emotional repercussions,
      in addition to producing pronounced functional deficits. Abnormal muscle proprioception and
      deviation of the nasal-labial filter may also interfere with articulation of the labiodental
      and bilabial phonemes, thus diminishing speech intelligibility. In relation to stomatognathic
      functions, weakened labial occlusion decreases intraoral pressure, thereby hindering liquid
      retention in the buccal cavity and giving rise to vestibular stasis on the paralyzed side.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the labial commissure angle (LCA) as
      an anthropometric marker for objectively assessing changes in facial muscle tonus.
