  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is convincing evidence from numerous studies using both psychophysical and
      electrophysiological approaches that olfaction is markedly reduced in Parkinson´s disease
      (PD). Data on the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in PD however, range from 45% and 49%
      in the pioneering studies of Ansari &amp; Johnson, and Ward, respectively, up to 74% in the work
      of Hawkes et al., or as high as 90% in a study published by Doty et al. Quality of life,
      safety, and interpersonal relations, as well as food behavior/nutritional intake are severely
      altered in a large proportion of patients with olfactory loss. Thus, the same can be assumed
      in patients with Parkinson's disease. If it was possible to improve olfactory function this
      would appear as a significant effect in patients with Parkinson's disease. Provided the study
      would reveal an improvement of olfactory function following therapy with rasagiline, this
      would have tremendous worldwide impact on the use of this drug. Considering the frequency of
      PD a very large number of patients would benefit from these findings, especially in terms of
      quality of life.
