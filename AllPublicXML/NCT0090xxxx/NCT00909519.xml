    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study is an 8-day treatment period, randomized, controlled, double-blind, 3
      parallel-groups, monocentric study. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of
      naproxcinod on the renal function when co-administered with furosemide in comparison to
      naproxen and placebo.
