      It is accepted that giving higher doses of chest radiation in as short a time span as
      possible improves chances of cure. In this study, the investigators propose to give an
      increased dose of chest radiotherapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer patients using
      a strategy of giving a slightly higher daily dose of radiotherapy than normal. The
      investigators hypothesize that our proposed chest radiotherapy dose will improve 2-year
      overall survival rates in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer.

      The ideal chest radiotherapy dose/fractionation scheme for limited stage small cell lung
      cancer is undefined. Strategies of radiotherapy dose intensification with minimization of
      overall treatment time are felt to improve cure rates for LS-SCLC. Hypofractionation (giving
      higher than standard daily doses) facilitates both of these goals. In this study, we propose
      to use a dose escalated hypofractionated regimen of chest radiotherapy for patients with
      LS-SCLC.
