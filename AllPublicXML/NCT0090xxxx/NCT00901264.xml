      The purpose of this study is to correlate the results of the MICK assay with short- and
      long-term results of treatments in cancer patients and evaluate the role of the MiCK assay in
      guiding chemotherapy of cancer patients.

      Identification of those patients with cancer who will or will not respond to a specific
      chemotherapy is important for making decisions regarding chemotherapy regimens as well as
      alternative management approaches. A laboratory test that could help to determine the
      sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to specific chemotherapeutic agents would
      be valuable in choosing the optimal chemotherapy regimen for that patient with an expectation
      of increasing the response rate to the therapy. Several types of in vitro assays that measure
      tumor cell survival following exposure to cytotoxic agents have been evaluated for their
      ability to predict chemotherapy outcomes. As a group, these assays are referred to as drug
      resistance assays. In a resistance assay, the surviving tumor cells can be detected directly
      by their exclusion or metabolism of specific dyes. Alternatively, since some of tumor cells
      are proliferating, their survival can be detected by measurement of DNA synthesis by
      radiolabeled precursor incorporation or demonstration of clonogenic potential by growth into
      colonies in semi-solid culture medium. In several clinical studies, these assays were useful
      in detecting drug resistance and in predicting a poor prognosis for cancer patients. However,
      these resistance assays cannot detect sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to a
      specific drug. Therefore, new methods determining drug-sensitivity of the tumor cells of an
      individual patient and, thus, capable of both predicting a positive treatment outcome and
      guiding chemotherapy, would be of significant value.

      Recently, an automated microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay for measuring drug induced apoptosis
      in tumor cells has been developed1-4. Apoptosis is a distinct mode of cell death which occurs
      under physiological conditions and yet can be induced in malignant cells by chemical and
      physical factors including antitumor drugs5-7. During the last decade, it has been recognized
      that chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumor activity by triggering apoptosis in
      susceptible tumor cells8-17. This implies that the MiCK assay for apoptosis provides a
      mechanism-based approach to studying effects of cytotoxic agents on tumor cells. Unlike
      &quot;resistance&quot; assays that measure a fraction of cells surviving drug exposure, the MiCK assay
      measures a fraction of tumor cells killed by a chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism of
      apoptosis. Therefore the MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity, rather than resistance.
      Recently the MiCK assay has been shown to predict complete remission rate and survival in
      acute myeloid leukemia patients better than clinical criteria did18-20. In a limited study,
      the MiCK assay has been used to direct chemotherapy of the leukemia patients 21.

      The MiCK assay has also been used to study drug-induced apoptosis in solid tumors, including
      neuroblastoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines22-23. More recent data accumulated by
      DiaTech has demonstrated that the MiCK assay can detect drug induced apoptosis in primary
      cultures of tumor cells isolated from patients with ovarian carcinoma, gastric carcinoma,
      metastatic breast cancer and high grade soft tissue sarcoma. The purpose of this study is to
      correlate the results of the MICK assay with short- and long-term results of treatments in
      cancer patients and evaluate the role of the MiCK assay in guiding chemotherapy of cancer
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  3.1.1 Patients with pathological diagnoses of cancer or leukemia

          -  3.1.2 Patients must have tumor which is accessible for biopsy and agree to undergo
             tumor biopsy, or drainage of malignant effusion, and the specimen must be submitted
             for MiCK assay.

          -  3.1.3 Patients for whom chemotherapy is planned.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  3.2.1 Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchymal brain or meningeal metastasis
             and tumors not accessible for biopsy.

          -  3.2.2 Patients who are pregnant. Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all
             patients of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the treating
             physician if they suspect they might have conceived a child; for females, a missing or
             late menstrual period should be reported to the treating physician. If pregnancy is
             confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient must not receive chemotherapy in this study
             and must not be enrolled into the study or, if already enrolled, must be withdrawn
             from the study. If a male patient is suspected of having fathered a child while on the
             study, the pregnant female partner must be notified and counseled regarding the risk
             to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of this study will be reported to the
             Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event. Women of child bearing potential
             are defined to include any female who has experienced menarche and has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea for more than
             12 consecutive months); these includes also females using oral, implanted, or
             injectable contraceptive hormones, mechanical devices, or barrier methods to prevent
             pregnancy.
