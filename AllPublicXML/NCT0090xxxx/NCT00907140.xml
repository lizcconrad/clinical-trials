  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), may help determine response to standard cancer therapy in patients
      with cervical cancer

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in cervical tumor heterogenity as
      measured by FDG-PET/CT imaging.
