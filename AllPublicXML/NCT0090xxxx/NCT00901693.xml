        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one eye must have EITHER a positive adenovirus test (using the Adeno
             Detector™ for Adenoviral Conjunctivitis, Rapid Pathogen Screening, Inc.) OR a positive
             clinical diagnosis assessed by the Adenoviral Clinical Diagnostic Checklist.

          -  Onset and development of ocular symptoms and/or signs of conjunctivitis ≤ 7 days prior
             to enrollment (Day 1) in either eye.

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form that has been approved by an
             Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).

          -  Must agree to comply with the visit schedule and other requirements of the study.

          -  Sub-epithelial infiltrates at the Day 1 visit in either eye.

          -  Corneal opacity or any corneal abnormality at the Day 1 visit in either eye.

          -  Contact lens wear during the course of the study. Participants requiring correction
             must have spectacles with appropriate correction.

          -  Only one sighted eye or vision in either eye not correctable to 0.6 or better logMAR
             (using ETDRS chart) at the Day 1 visit.

          -  Abnormal findings in the posterior pole of the retina or any media opacity found in a
             dilated fundus examination at the Day 1 (Screening/ Baseline) visit.

          -  Suspected fungal, herpes, Chlamydia or Acanthamoeba infection, based on clinical
             observation.

          -  History of active uveitis or iritis in either eye.

          -  History of corneal transplant in either eye.
