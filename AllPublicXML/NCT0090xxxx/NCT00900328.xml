      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tumor samples from patients with lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the correlation between c-Met expression, mutation and amplification, with
           stage and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) of the lung.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the correlation with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), EGFR
           mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression,
           mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), DUB3 expression &amp; regulation, and ALK
           translocation, with respect to survival.

        -  To determine the correlation with circulating c-Met and HGF in AC and evaluate
           prognostic implications of circulating markers in AC of lung.

        -  To determine (when available) levels of circulating Met and HGF in serum before and
           after surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected tissue samples from patients enrolled in CALGB 140202 are assessed for
      mutation analysis of c-Met, EGFR, and K-ras. DNA is examined by PCR, followed by agarose gel
      electrophoresis; gene amplification of c-Met is examined by real time quantitative PCR;
      met/HF protein in serum is examined by ELISA; and c-Met, EGFR, p53, c-CBL, DUB3 enzyme, and
      ALK, and epithelial mesenchymal transition examined by IHC.

    <description>The correlation of c-Met expression and stage will be tested using Fisher's exact test. The proportions of c-Met overexpressed in stage I and stage II or higher will be estimated as well as the confidence intervals. The correlation of c-Met expression and survival will be tested using log rank test. The hazard ratio and its confidence interval will be estimated using a Cox model with a single predictor. Summary statistics will be provided for all c-Met measures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Registration to Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 140202

          -  Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval at the institution where the
             laboratory work will be performed is required

          -  Informed consent: the CALGB does not require that a separate consent form be signed
             for this study

               -  The subject population to be studied in this protocol includes patients selected
                  from CALGB 140202; all such patients have signed a written informed consent
                  document meeting all federal, state, and institutional guidelines as part of
                  entry into that trial

               -  All samples to be studied were obtained and stored as part of CALGB 140202; the
                  material and data obtained from the patient's protocol record will be used to
                  obtain appropriate clinical information; in no instance will the patient be
                  contacted directly

               -  There should be no physical, psychological, social, or legal risks associated
                  with this study; no invasive procedures are recommended or requested

               -  All appropriate and necessary procedures will be utilized to maintain
                  confidentiality; all patients who have had samples submitted for analysis will
                  have their CALGB study number used to identify specimens

               -  This study does not require direct patient contact and no specific risk or
                  benefits to individuals involved in the trial are anticipated; it is likely,
                  however, that the information gained will substantially help similar patients in
                  the future
