  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a four month dose ranging study followed by a 24 to 48 month extension at the
      selected dose to characterize the safety and efficacy of the injectable IL-1B (interleukin 1,
      beta) antagonist canakinumab in the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) already treated on maximum dose metformin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Numerically modest lowering of HbA1c with canakinumab in combination with metformin was
    inadequate to continue patients with T2DM into Period IV of this study.

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study consisted of four periods: screening (Period I), dose-finding (Period II), intermediate (Period III),and long-term continuation (Period IV). Eligible patients were randomized for 4-month treatment of Period II. Intermediate period continued until primary analysis was completed and optimal dose was selected. Study got terminated in Period III.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 556 patients were randomized in Period II. 5 patients one in each 5, 15, 50mg Canakinumab arms and 2 in Placebo were randomized in error, but never received study treatment. All tables reflect the 551 treated patients.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>In 4-Month Dose-finding period, patients visited the clinic monthly and had 5 mg Canakinumab injected in the clinic at each visit and continued on a stable dose of metformin ≥ 1000 mg daily (or lower dose if required by local regulations). During this period, patients with consecutive morning fasting glucose &gt;200 mg/dL were treated with a daily injection of insulin glargine as add-on therapy.
The intermediate period began after patients completed their 4-month visit and lasted until the primary analysis was completed and the optimal dose was selected. Patients continued on their randomized treatment and made brief visits to the clinic every month. From this point onward, patients with consecutive HbA1c &gt;7.5% were treated with a daily injection of insulin glargine as add-on therapy.</description>

During this period, patients with consecutive morning fasting glucose &gt;200 mg/dL were treated with a daily injection of insulin glargine as add-on therapy.
The intermediate period began after patients completed their 4-month visit and lasted until the primary analysis was completed and the optimal dose was selected.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Month 4 During Dose-finding Period of the Study (Period II)</title>
        <description>HbA1c was measured by National glycohemoglobin standardization program (NGSP) certified methodology. HbA1c is an integrated measure of average glucose concentration in plasma in the last 2-3 months. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) included treatment and metformin dose group as main effects and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Insulin Area Under Curve (AUC 0-4 Hours ) Following Meal Test (Period II)</title>
        <description>A standard liquid mixed-meal challenge was done at baseline and Month 4. Patients completed each standard meal challenge with measurement of insulin prior to and after a liquid mixed meal. Sampling times were -20, -10, and -1, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 minutes relative to the start of meal. Insulin levels over 4 hrs were shown as Area Under the Curve,(AUC). AUC was calculated as: x=1 AUC ΣAx n Where Ax = AUC for the 240 min.interval, and X = 1 for the 1st interval. Model of analysis of covariance included baseline insulin AUC 0-4 hours as covariate.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all randomized patients except for mis-randomized patients who inadvertently randomized into study and did not receive study drug. Last observation carried forward method was used for patients without Month 4 data for any reason and who used rescue medication or any other glucose lowering agents other than metformin.</population>

Sampling times were -20, -10, and -1, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 minutes relative to the start of meal. The analysis of covariance included treatment and metformin dose group as main effects and baseline peak C-peptide level as a covariate.</description>

          <description>A standard liquid mixed-meal challenge was done at baseline and Month 4. A 2 hour insulin secretion rate using deconvolution was performed. The deconvolution was an algorithm that analyzed the insulin secretion rate relative to glucose and C-peptide combined. Blood samples were taken prior to and after meal at sample times: -20, -10, -1 and 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes relative to the start of the meal. The analysis of covariance included treatment and metformin dose group as main effects and baseline 2 hour Insulin secretion rate as a covariate.</description>

During this period, patients with consecutive morning fasting glucose &gt;200 mg/dL were treated with a daily injection of insulin glargine as add-on therapy.
The intermediate period began after patients completed their 4-month visit and lasted until the primary analysis was completed and the optimal dose was selected. Patients continued on their randomized treatment and made brief visits to the clinic every month. From this point onward, patients with consecutive HbA1c &gt;7.5% were treated with a daily injection of insulin glargine as add-on therapy.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Homeostatic Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA2 IR) at Month 4 (Period II)</title>
          <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta (β)-cell function. HOMA2-IR is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate insulin resistance which is the reciprocal of insulin sensitivity (%S)(100/%S)as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The analysis of covariance included treatment and metformin dose group as main effects and baseline HOMA2 IR as a covariate.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all randomized patients except for mis-randomized patients who inadvertently randomized into study and did not receive study drug. Last observation carried forward method was used for patients without Month 4 data for any reason and who used rescue medication or any other glucose lowering agents other than metformin.</population>

        <description>The Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) score, measures insulin sensitivity which is the inverse of insulin resistance. The score is calculated by the equation: 1 /(log(fasting insulin µU/mL) + log(fasting glucose mg/dL)). In normal subjects, the mean score ± SE is 0.366 ± 0.029. The analysis of covariance included treatment and metformin dose group as main effects and baseline QUICKI as a covariate.</description>
