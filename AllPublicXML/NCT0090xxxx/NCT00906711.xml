      Introduction: While growing older, it is possible to notice a decrease in the functional and
      physiological reserves in the organism which impairs the the abilities in the elderly in
      doing some tasks. A simple balance becomes a challenge.

      Objective: To evaluate the functional balance in the aging process.

      Methods: The group was formed by 48 people from 10 to 85 years old. The evaluation
      instruments are the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment
      (POMA), the Unipodal Support Test, the Functional Reach Test and the Romberg's Test.

      48 individuals of both sexes and aged between 10 and 85 years were chosen. These individuals
      were divided according to age, into four groups (each group containing 12 individuals, 6 men
      and 6 women): Group I (G1): 10 - 18, Group II (G2): 20 - 35; Group III (G3): 45 - 60, Group
      IV (G4): 65 - 85.

      The instruments used for assessment of the balance were: (1) Berg Scale - consists of 14
      items with common activities of daily life, with progressive degree of difficulty (2)
      Assessment of Gait and Balance for Performance Oriented (POMA), consists of a protocol that
      evaluates the static and dynamic balance, with operations similar to the activities of daily
      living, (3) Test Support Unipodal; (4) adapted Functional Reach Test, which assesses the
      stability in the standing position, (5) Test and Romberg Romberg's test Romberg-Barr√© or
      sensitized conducted in stable and unstable soil, and all positions were first with open eyes
      and then with closed eyes. The duration of each exposure was 30 seconds, with different
      positioning of the feet.

        The participants were selected in dependency of Unifran (University of France) and the
        homes of the neighborhood. The choice of groups was based according to the degree of
        functionality and independence in order to analyze the lack of balance in the process of
        aging.
