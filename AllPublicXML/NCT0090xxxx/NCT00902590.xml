  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to create a registry to help us learn more about urinary and other
      cancers. This will let us look at large groups of people who do and do not have this kind of
      cancer.

      The investigators will look at risk factors to learn more about how these impact cancer. The
      investigators will also look at genetic markers. These are genes that are found in a known
      place. They are often associated with a particular trait. If the gene changes in some way, it
      may predict cancer or response to treatment. The investigators will look for markers in your
      saliva.

      This registry will help us develop better methods of:

      Preventing these cancers. Diagnosing these cancers. Treating these cancers.

        A member of the patient's treatment team, the protocol investigator, or a member of the
        research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) will identify potential
        research subjects. At MSKCC the following outpatient clinics will be used to recruit UC
        cases: Urology and Genitourinary Oncology. Patients and families may also be directly
        referred to the study team by any MSKCC physician, external physician, or by the family
        itself.
