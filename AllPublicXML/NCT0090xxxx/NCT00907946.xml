  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to determine whether placement of a nephrostomy tube prior to
      definitive stone surgery and under ultrasonic or fluoroscopic guidance will reduce
      complications related to bleeding and infection compare to obtaining renal access at the time
      of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We seek to identify whether the placement of a nephrostomy tract prior to surgery versus at
      the time of PCNL will: 1. decrease blood loss and related complications, and 2. decrease
      infection-related complications by providing the ability to an accurate collection of urine
      for culture and initiating appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to definitive stone
      management. In addition, we seek to determine whether renal puncture under fluoroscopic vs
      ultrasonic guidance is associated with less blood loss. Although retrospective studies have
      shown some benefit to placing the nephrostomy tube prior to surgery in terms of decreased
      blood loss, there are no well-designed, prospective studies comparing the two treatment
      approaches. We seek to determine which treatment approach is safer, more efficacious, and
      more cost-effective through a prospective, randomized trial.

    <description>A bladder urine culture will be obtained prior to nephrostomy tube placement and antibiotic treatment will be initiated if necessary. A nephrostomy tube will be placed at least one week prior to surgery in the Vascular Interventional Radiology (VIR) suite under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. The type of imaging will be determined by the radiologist at the time of procedure and documented. A renal pelvis urine culture will be obtained at the time of nephrostomy tube placement. If the culture is positive, the patients will be treated with appropriate antibiotics for at least one week prior to PCNL. If the culture is negative, the patient will be stratified into 2 groups:
Hydronephrosis present and/or stone greater than 2cm empiric antibiotics will be initiated.
If neither of the above criteria (a.) are met, and the urine culture is negative, no antibiotics will be administered except peri-operatively according to standard protocol.</description>

    <description>A bladder urine culture will be obtained prior to surgery and appropriate antibiotic treatment will be initiated if necessary. The nephrostomy tract will be placed at the time of surgery under fluoroscopic guidance. All patients will receive empiric intravenous peri-operative antibiotics at induction. Renal pelvis urine and stone will be collected for culture and post-operative treatment will be initiated if necessary.</description>
