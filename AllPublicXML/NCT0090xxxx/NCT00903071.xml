      In this project the investigators implement and test the ability of a Personalized Physician
      Learning (PPL) intervention to improve hypertension (HT) care with the following specific
      aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Implement two versions of a Personalized Physician Learning (PPL)
      intervention and assess the ability of these interventions to improve hypertension control in
      primary care practice.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Patients of physicians who receive the REAL+PPL Intervention (Group 1)
           will subsequently have better HT control compared to patients of control group
           physicians (Group 3).

        -  Hypothesis 2: Patients of physicians who receive the SIM+PPL Intervention (Group 2) will
           subsequently have better HT control compared to patients of control group physicians
           (Group 3).

        -  Hypothesis 3: Patients of physicians who receive the REAL+PPL (Group 1) will
           subsequently have better HT control compared to patients of physicians who receive the
           SIM+PPL (Group 2).

      Specific Aim 2: Assess the cost-effectiveness of the SIM+PPL and REAL+PPL interventions,
      relative to no intervention.

      The objective of this project is to improve hypertension (HT) control by implementing two
      Personalized Physician Learning interventions designed for primary care physicians (PCPs).
      Improved HT control has long been identified as a major national health care priority because
      uncontrolled HT is a leading cause of stroke(CVA), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic
      kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD),myocardial infarction (MI), and other
      adverse health events. The cost of uncontrolled HT and its sequelae is estimated to be at
      least $100 billion dollars a year in the U.S., and there has been only minimal improvement in
      HT care in recent decades. Currently, of an estimated 68 million Americans with HT, about 42
      million remain uncontrolled.

      Personalized Physician Learning (PPL) interventions are powerful enough to change physician
      behavior and improve HT care. The PPL interventions in this project are directed to
      individual primary care physicians(PCPs) using a simple 3-step approach: (a) Analyze each
      physician's pre-intervention patterns of HT care to identify specific failures of physician
      decision making in HT care, (b) Provide each physician with a series of personalized HT
      learning cases designed to correct the failures of decision making that result in that
      physician's observed patterns of HT care. Learning cases provide iterative on-screen feedback
      of blood pressure (BP) changes in response to a sequence of changes in therapy,
      expert-generated suggestions for better HT care, and adaptive selection of subsequent cases
      until identified errors in decision making are mastered. (c) Assess intervention impact on
      the care of actual patients with HT in the post-intervention period, to assess transfer of
      learning from the simulated to the office practice environment. The PPL intervention strategy
      is based on recent work in cognitive science and learning theory and has been successfully
      applied in other research and educational settings, although it has yet to be applied to HT
      care.
