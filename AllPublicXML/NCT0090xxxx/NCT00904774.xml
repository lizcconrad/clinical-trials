  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite considerable obstetric and neonatal advances in the care of very low birth weight
      (VLBW) neonates, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to occur among 20 to 40% of
      surviving infants, and new ways for combatting this disease must be found. BPD appears to
      result from arrested lung development, but its etiology has not yet been fully established.
      Besides the role of the exposure of the immature lung to injurious factors in the development
      of BPD, a genetic susceptibility for BPD in preterm infants was recently evidenced. Taking
      advantage of new genomic technologies, the objective of the investigators' project is to
      identify predisposing human genetic variants through:

        1. a genome-wide association (GWA) study in VLBW neonates,

        2. a candidate-gene association study, including selection of single nucleotide
           polymorphisms (SNPs) found in (a) and

        3. functional studies of any SNP found to be convincingly associated with BPD in (a) and
           (b).
