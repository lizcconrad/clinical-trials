      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with or without cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at cyclooxygenase-2 expression in tissue samples
      from patients with a normal cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or early invasive
      cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels in biopsy or surgical specimens from patients
           with normal cervical epithelium, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or microinvasive
           squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Correlate COX-2 levels with histological diagnosis and parameters of invasion (i.e.,
           matrix metalloproteinase, microvessel count, and VEGF).

      OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed by immunohistochemistry for evaluation
      of cyclooxygenase-2 levels, microvessel count, and matrix metalloproteinase and VEGF
      expression.

      Medical data for study analysis is obtained by retrospective review of patient charts.
