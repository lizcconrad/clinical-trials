    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine progression free survival (PFS) in patients with
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have received no prior systemic therapy when
      treated with IMC-A12 administered every three weeks in combination with oral sorafenib
      administered twice daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresectable HCC

          -  The patient has at least one target lesion measurable according to Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Target lesion(s) must not lay within a
             previously irradiated, ablated, or chemoembolized area. If a lesion does lie in such
             an area, there must be evidence of growth on successive imaging studies, including
             tumor hypervascularity, in order for such a lesion to be considered a target lesion

          -  The patient has not received prior systemic therapy for HCC. Patients may have
             received prior embolization, chemoembolization, intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion,
             ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, or cryosurgery

          -  The patient has fasting serum glucose &lt; 160 mg/dL or below the ULN and/or hemoglobin
             A1C &lt; 7%. If baseline nonfasting glucose &lt; 160 mg/dL, fasting glucose measurement is
             not required

          -  The patient has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has brain metastases

          -  The patient has acute hepatitis
