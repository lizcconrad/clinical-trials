  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative Disease represent conditions with increased risk for
      pulmonary hypertension. However, the exact prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in these
      conditions is not known. The effects of pulmonary hypertension on the clinical picture and
      the symptoms of patients in these conditions needs also further exploration. This exploratory
      study is designed to describe the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in the population with
      such hematologic diseases, and the stages of pulmonary hypertension as well its effect on
      exercise capacity at time of diagnosis.

      For early recognition of pulmonary hypertension exercise doppler echocardiography will be
      used in all patients. Patients with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure at rest or during
      exercise (estimated by echocardiography), or with decreased exercise capacity (as a potential
      sign of pulmonary hypertension) are advised to undergo right heart catheterisation.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and six-minute walk distance measurement are performed to
      measure exercise capacity. The described work-up of patients allows precise and objective
      hemodynamic and clinical evaluation.
