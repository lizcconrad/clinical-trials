  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic neuropathy (DN), complex regional pain
      syndrome (CRPS), carpal tunnel syndrome, HIV neuropathy, idiopathic sensory neuropathy, or
      other peripheral neuropathy participated in a Phase IV clinical trial to assess the
      comparative efficacy and safety of Lidoderm monotherapy versus gabapentin monotherapy in
      treating a diverse group of peripheral neuropathic pain patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Had a diagnosis of PHN, DN, CRPS, carpal tunnel syndrome, HIV neuropathy, idiopathic
             sensory neuropathy, or other peripheral neuropathy (upon mutual agreement of the
             sponsor and investigator)

          2. Patients with PHN must have had pain &gt;3 months after rash healing

          3. Patients with DN must have had Type I or II diabetes and painful distal symmetric
             sensorimotor polyneuropathy with or without dynamic allodynia of the lower extremities

          4. Patients with CRPS must have met current IASP (International Association for the Study
             of Pain) diagnostic criteria

          5. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome must have had a diagnosis by combination clinical
             neurological examination (e.g., Phalen's and Tinel's signs), electrodiagnostic
             testing, and daily painful symptoms of at least 3 months' duration

          6. Patients with HIV neuropathy must have had HIV, subjective symptoms of painful
             peripheral neuropathy, and daily painful symptoms of at least 3 months' duration

          7. Patients with idiopathic sensory neuropathy must have had pain of at least 3 months'
             duration

          8. Reached an average daily pain rating during the baseline week of pain ratings greater
             than 4 on the 0-to-10 numerical pain rating scale (Question 5 of the BPI)

          9. Had never received an analgesic regimen that contained lidocaine or gabapentin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Had a neurological condition other than that associated with their pain diagnosis
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with their ability to
             participate in the study

          2. Were taking a lidocaine-containing product that could not be discontinued while
             receiving lidocaine

          3. Were taking class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., mexiletine, tocainide)
