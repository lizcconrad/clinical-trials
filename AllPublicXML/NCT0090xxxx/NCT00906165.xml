    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of Straumann® Bone
      Level Implant SLActive placed in healed alveolar ridge (at least 8 weeks post extraction) and
      immediately provisionalised versus the same type of implants placed in healed alveolar ridge
      but not provisionalised. In both cases the implants will be loaded at 16 weeks (final
      restorations). The outcomes will be evaluated over a 2-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single blind, and single center study. The
      total study duration for each patient should be 24 months.

      Straumann Bone Level Ø 4.1 mm SLActive implants will be placed for single tooth replacement,
      followed by either immediate provisional prosthetic loading or no provisionalised. The final
      prosthetic loading is made at 16 weeks after implant loading. The implant length will be
      selected according to the clinical indication of the site based on previous radiographic
      evaluation.

      In total 11 visits per patient are scheduled in this study. Bone level changes, implant
      success and survival rate, soft tissue changes, aesthetic outcome and adverse events (AEs)
      will be assessed.

      The study devices are CE- (Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity) marked
      products.

      One center in the United Kingdom will participate.

    <description>The Straumann® Bone Level SLActive Implant (4.1mm diameter) will be immediately provisionalized upon placement, i.e. impressions will be taken directly after implant installation in order to fabricate screw-retained resin crowns within 48 hours after implant placement. At 16 weeks, the final prosthetic reconstruction will be performed according to the standard procedure for single crown restoration.</description>

    <description>The Straumann® Bone Level SLActive Implant (4.1mm diameter) will not be immediately provisionalized, instead there will be delayed implant loading. i.e. the patient will receive a removable prosthesis if necessary and the impressions for the final restoration will be taken 12-14 weeks after implant installation. At 16 weeks, the final prosthetic reconstruction will be performed according to the standard procedure for single crown restoration.</description>
