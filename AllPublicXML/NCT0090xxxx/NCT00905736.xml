  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tennis elbow is a relatively common musculoskeletal disorder that can cause significant pain
      and disability. Treatment of the disorder is not always successful, and it often recurs or
      becomes chronic. More effective management options are required. There is evidence that
      electric microcurrent can promote tissue healing and symptom resolution in various chronic
      hard and soft tissue disorders, but few human studies have investigated its use with chronic
      tendon problems. It is an easily applied therapy with very few reports of side effects. It
      can be applied at home using a portable unit and, if it is clinically effective, may also
      prove more cost effective than other therapies.

      A clinical trial is planned to evaluate the therapy but, in the absence of relevant published
      evidence, a preliminary study is required to look for a treatment effect and inform a power
      calculation for sample size, The study is comparing the effects of two different forms of
      microcurrent treatment.
