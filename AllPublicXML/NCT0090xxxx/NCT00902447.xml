      The Human Blood Cell Disorder Tissue Bank will provide a convenient, comprehensive source of
      tissue containing populations of human blood cells from patients with various types of
      lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid proliferative diseases as well as other associated
      conditions. The tissue bank will continue to be an invaluable asset for understanding of the
      biology of multiple blood cell disorders involving several cell types as well as the
      physiology of normal cellular counterparts affected in these disorders. Internal and external
      investigators will be able to utilize this tissue to test hypotheses relating to the
      immunologic, virologic, genetic, and molecular properties of these abnormal cells as well as
      normal cells from normal unaffected family members or normal aged matched subjects to provide
      better comparisons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants or participant's Legally Authorized Representatives (LAR) must be able to
             understand and render voluntary, written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be able to contribute the required amount of blood and/or tissue without
             compromising their well-being or care.

          -  Participants must be willing to be contacted again for consideration of additional
             studies in the future, such as a blood draw or another action (e.g., bone marrow
             aspiration and/or biopsy) that would be done as part of their standard of care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are known to be anemic, with hemoglobin &lt;8.0g/dl.

          -  Patients who are known to be infected with HIV.
