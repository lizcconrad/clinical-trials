  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past two decades, the frequency of invasive fungal infections has increased
      dramatically in hospitalised patients throughout the world, and Candida has now emerged as
      one of the leading causes of bloodstream infections (BSIs). Risk-factors for invasive
      candidiasis include improvements in intensive care strategies (i.e., central venous
      catheters, mechanical ventilation, hyper-alimentation), prolonged stays in intensive care
      units (ICUs), the development of more aggressive surgical techniques, and the prolongation of
      survival of critically-ill patients. Two other important factors, observed mainly in cancer
      patients, are colonization of mucous membranes by yeasts, and neutropenia, resulting from
      increased use of antibiotics and anti-neoplastic agents, respectively. The crude mortality
      rate of candidaemia is high (38-75%), and the attributable mortality has been estimated at
      25-38%. During the past 15 years, the prevalence of infections caused by non-albicans Candida
      spp. has increased exponentially, so that these organisms now account for &gt; 50% of episodes
      of fungaemia in various surveys. The increase in invasive fungal infections, the associated
      high mortality rate, and the emergence of antifungal resistance, have all driven the search
      for more potent antifungal drugs. The aims of the present study are to investigate the
      prevalence and the epidemiology of candidaemia and to determine the antifungal susceptibility
      patterns of Candida spp. isolates from a tertiary-care hospital in Italy.
