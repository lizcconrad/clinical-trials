    <measure>Change From Augmentation Baseline for Non-Remitters in Montgomery-Ǻsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 6 - Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Augmentation Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a validated, 10-item rating scale with each item being scored on a scale from 0-6 with a total score ranging from 0-60. Lower scores indicate a decreased severity of depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change From Augmentation Baseline for Non-Remitters in the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) Total Score at Week 6 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Augmentation Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is a validated rating scale which consists of 17 items. Nine of the items are scored on a scale of 0-4 and 8 items are scored on a scale of 0-2 for a total scoring range of 0-52. A score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates increased severity of depression. In general, the lower the total score the less severe the depression.</description>

    <measure>Change From Augmentation Baseline for Non-Remitters in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Augmentation Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Designed to evaluate the extent to which illness symptoms impact a subject's life in 3 areas: work/school, social, and family/home. Each area is scored on a scale from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (highly impaired) with a total score ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Lower scores translate into less impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) consists of a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Change From Augmentation Baseline for Non-Remitters in the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A) Scale Total Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Augmentation Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BRIEF-A is a validated 75-item questionnaire composed of three scales (Global Executive Composite, Behavioral Recognition Index, and Metacognition Index). Items are rated 1 (never), 2 (sometimes), and 3 (often). There is no range for a total score. Raw scale scores are used to develop interpretive reports. Lower scores reflect better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change From Augmentation Baseline for Non-Remitters in the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) Scale Total Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Augmentation Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MAF contains 16 items scored on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (a great deal). Answers are converted to a Global Fatigue Index with total scores ranging from 1 (no fatigue) to 50 (severe fatigue). Lower scores indicate less fatigue.</description>

    <description>QIDS-SR is a validated, self-reported rating scale that contains 16 items scored on a scale from 0-3 with total scores ranging from 0 (no depression) to 27 (very severe depression). Lower scores indicate less depression.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D is a validated rating scale which consists of 17 items. Nine of the items are scored on a scale of 0-4 and 8 items are scored on a scale of 0-2 for a total scoring range of 0-52. A score of 0–7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates increased severity of depression. In general, the lower the total score the less severe the depression.</description>

        <description>Designed to evaluate the extent to which illness symptoms impact a subject's life in 3 areas: work/school, social, and family/home.

        <title>Change From Augmentation Baseline for Non-Remitters in the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A) Scale Total Score at Week 6</title>
        <description>BRIEF-A is a validated 75-item questionnaire composed of three scales (Global Executive Composite, Behavioral Recognition Index, and Metacognition Index). Items are rated 1 (never), 2 (sometimes), and 3 (often). There is no range for a total score. Raw scale scores are used to develop interpretive reports. Lower scores reflect better functioning.</description>

At augmentation baseline, randomization was stratified by Non-remitters and remitters. Non-remitters were defined as subjects who had an MADRS total score of greater than 10 at augmentation baseline. Subjects received antidepressant (escitalopram @ 20 mg/day) + an optimal dose of SPD489 (either 20, 30, or 50 mg/day) for 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D is a validated rating scale which consists of 17 items. Nine of the items are scored on a scale of 0-4 and 8 items are scored on a scale of 0-2 for a total scoring range of 0-52. A score of 0–7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates increased severity of depression. In general, the lower the total score the less severe the depression.</description>

            <description>Subjects with residual depressive symptoms after the 8-week lead-in period with antidepressant were randomly assigned to receive augmentation therapy (placebo). At augmentation baseline, randomization was stratified by non-remitters and remitters. Remitters were defined as subjects who had an MADRS total score of less than or equal to 10 at augmentation baseline. Subjects received antidepressant (escitalopram @ 20 mg/day) + placebo for 6 weeks.</description>

          <description>MAF contains 16 items scored on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (a great deal). Answers are converted to a Global Fatigue Index with total scores ranging from 1 (no fatigue) to 50 (severe fatigue). Lower scores indicate less fatigue.</description>
