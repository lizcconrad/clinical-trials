  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in appetite-regulating hormones, body
      composition (weight, body fat%), and hunger ratings in persons early in treatment with one of
      four atypical antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, aripiprazole).

    <textblock>
      Severe weight gain and glucose dysregulation are serious problems in patients treated with
      second-generation ('atypical') antipsychotics (SGA). These side effects frequently interfere
      with medication compliance and necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Although the causal
      mechanisms for weight and glucose dysregulation are not well understood, one promising area
      of investigation targets SGA-induced disturbances in appetite and in appetite-regulating
      hormones. Findings from our group (and others) demonstrate SGA treatment-related increases in
      fasting levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone, ghrelin, as well as increases in
      self-report hunger. This novel study will examine prospective changes in ghrelin and in the
      'satiety-signaling' peptide YY (PYY) as measured before and after participants consume a
      standard mixed-macronutrient meal. Data are obtained at baseline (within 4 weeks of beginning
      medication), and again 2 months and 4 months later.

        patients ages 18 to 40 years of age who are early in treatment (i.e., started treatment in
        the past month) with 1 of 4 antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, risperidone,
        ziprasidone, aripiprazole)

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meets DSM IV criteria for a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia, schizophreniform, brief
             psychotic disorder, schizoaffective disorder), bipolar disorder, or major depression
             with psychotic features;

          2. &quot;Drug na√Øve&quot; prior to most recent psychiatric diagnosis;

          3. Currently prescribed one of four atypical antipsychotic medications: olanzapine,
             risperidone, ziprasidone, or aripiprazole;

          4. Between the ages of 18 and 40, any race and either gender;

          5. Not obese (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2) (fasting and postprandial ghrelin levels are altered in
             obesity);

          6. Has negative histories for cardiovascular, metabolic, and endocrine disorders at
             screening;

          7. Is willing and able to eat animal-derived foods; and

          8. Is not exercising 3 or more times per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of medications to treat metabolic and endocrine abnormalities, corticosteroids,
             over-the-counter appetite suppressants that contain phentermine or Sibutramine;

          2. Active involvement with a weight loss program (i.e., Weight Watchers);

          3. Serious or unstable medical illness which requires ongoing treatment with medication
             (this does not include hypertension);

          4. Anemia;

          5. At serious suicidal risk;

          6. Current substance abuse or dependence;

          7. For female subjects, pregnancy or nursing (because pregnancy may influence appetite
             and because the body composition procedure involves low level X-ray exposure).

          8. Known history of mental retardation or dementia.

          9. Children and adolescents under age 18 will be excluded owing to the inherent
             confounding effects of normal growth on body weight and appetite.
