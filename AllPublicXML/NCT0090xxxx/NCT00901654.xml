      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to ACE527.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase I, single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose finding clinical
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the live attenuated, oral
      vaccine ACE527. The study is designed to evaluate 2 doses of the ACE527 in 2 cohorts. Each
      cohort will consist of approximately 18 subjects (healthy subjects), approximately 12 of them
      receiving ACE527 and approximately 6 receiving placebo.

      Within a cohort, the second dose will only be given if safety and tolerability of the first
      dose is acceptable. This assessment will be based on evaluation of data up until Day 7 by the
      Independent Safety Committee (ISC) as per written guidance. The first dose of each cohort
      will be administered during an inpatient stay. Escalation to the next dose level will be
      dependent on an acceptable safety profile of the first dose at the previous dose level, based
      on evaluation of safety data by an Independent Safety Committee (ISC). The decision to
      administer the second dose at the higher level will also require review of the safety and
      tolerability of the second dose at the lower level.

      The second dose will be administered at the outpatient clinic and the subjects will be
      observed for at least 60 minutes after vaccination prior to discharge from unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age ≥18 and ≤50 years.

          -  General good health, without clinically significant medical illness, physical
             examination findings or laboratory abnormalities, as determined by the Principal
             Investigator (PI) or PI in consultation with the medical monitor (MM) and sponsor.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test before
             immunization for female subjects of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing
             potential must not be breastfeeding and must agree to use an efficacious hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female
             subjects unable to bear children (e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy) must have
             negative pregnancy tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Working as a food handler, in child-care or as a healthcare worker with direct patient
             contact.
