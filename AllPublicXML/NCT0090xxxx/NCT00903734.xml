      The goal of this screening portion of this clinical research study is to learn if you are
      eligible to take part in a clinical research study using Tarceva (erlotinib hydrochloride)
      and either Erbitux (cetuximab), Velcade (bortezomib), or Sprycel (dasatinib).

      If the results of the screening portion of this clinical research study show that you are
      eligible to take part in one of the studies described above, the study drug that you will be
      assigned to take will depend on the results of biomarker analysis performed as a part of the
      screening tests described below. Biomarkers are chemical &quot;markers&quot; in the blood/tissue that
      may be related to how your body might react to the study drug.

      Drug Administration and Study visits for Erlotinib hydrochloride:

      If you will be taking Erlotinib hydrochloride in this study, you will take Erlotinib
      hydrochloride by mouth daily at least 1 hour before eating and 2 hours after eating. You will
      have study visits once a month. If you continue to be on study longer than 2 cycles, study
      visits may become less frequent.

      At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked to list any drugs you may be taking, including over-the-counter drugs.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may have.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests

      After the first 8 weeks on study, you will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the
      disease. You will have a CT or MRI scan every 8 to 12 weeks after that.

      You may continue taking Erlotinib hydrochloride for as long as you are benefitting. You will
      be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. If the
      disease gets worse, the study doctor may assign you to 1 of 3 studies. The study doctor will
      discuss this in more detail with you.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this screening study will be over after all of the screening tests and
      procedures described above have been completed.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 102 participants will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pathologically confirmed advanced or metastatic cancer that is
             refractory to standard therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or who have had no
             standard therapy that induces a CR rate of at least 10% or improves survival by at
             least three months.

          2. Patients must have tumor tissue available, either from an archival specimen, or from a
             recent biopsy, to be analyzed for EGFR mutation. Patients must sign consent for the
             umbrella protocol prior testing for EGFR mutation. Patients will be eligible if they
             have an EGFR-sensitive mutation, OR if they have an EGFR-resistant mutation, OR if
             they do not have an EGFR mutation, but have benefited from EGFR inhibitor therapy
             (including either &gt;/= 4 months of stable disease [SD] OR a &gt;/= partial response [PR]).

          3. Measurable or non-measurable disease.

          4. Patients must be &gt;/= 6 wks beyond treatment with a nitrosourea or mitomycin-C, &gt;/= 4
             wks beyond other chemotherapy or external beam radiation therapy (XRT), and must have
             recovered to &lt;/= Grade 1 toxicity for any treatment-limiting toxicity resulting from
             prior therapy. (Exception: patients may have received palliative low dose XRT one week
             before treatment provided it is not given to the only targeted lesions).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with uncontrolled concurrent illness, including but not limited to: ongoing
             or active infection; altered mental status or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements and/or obscure study results.

          2. Uncontrolled systemic vascular hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg,
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg on medication).

          3. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease: history of CVA within 6
             months, myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months, or unstable angina
