  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted as a phase IV, double-blind, multi-center, randomized,
      crossover trial aimed at a within-subject comparison of MULTIHANCE and GADOVIST at a dose of
      0.1 mmol/kg, in terms of qualitative and quantitative assessment of unenhanced MRI (UE MRI)
      and contrast-enhanced MRI (CE MRI) for the visualization of brain disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enroll subjects in this study if they meet the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Are willing to undergo two MRI procedures within 14 days

          -  Have confirmed or are highly suspected to have brain tumor(s) (primary or secondary),
             as determined by:

          -  clinical/neurological symptomatology;

          -  diagnostic testing, such as CT or previous MRI examinations; or

          -  have had recent surgery within 6 months and are to be evaluated for recurrence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclude subjects from this study if they do not fulfill the inclusion criteria, or if
             any of the following conditions are observed.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating females. Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:

          -  by testing on site at the institution (serum or urine bHCG) within 24 h prior to the
             start of each investigational product administration

          -  by history (i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy)

          -  post menopausal with a minimum of 1 year without menses

          -  Have any known allergy to one or more of the ingredients in the investigational
             product, or have a history of hypersensitivity to any metals

          -  Have congestive heart failure (class IV according to the classification of the New
             York Heart Association

          -  Have suffered a stroke within a year

          -  Have received or are scheduled to receive any other contrast medium in the 24 h
             preceding through the 24 h following Exam 1, and in the 24 h preceding through the 24
             h following Exam 2

          -  Have received or are scheduled to receive an investigational compound and/or medical
             device within 30 days before admission into the present study, through the 24 h
             post-administration of the second investigational product.

          -  Have moderate-to-severe renal impairment, defined as a GFR/eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min.

          -  Have been previously entered into this study

          -  Have received or are scheduled for one of the following:

          -  Surgery within three weeks prior to the first examination or between the two
             examinations

          -  Initiation of steroid therapy between the two examinations

          -  Radiosurgery between the two examinations

          -  Have any contraindications to MRI such as a pace-maker, magnetic material (i.e.,
             surgical clips) or any other conditions that would preclude proximity to a strong
             magnetic field.

          -  Are suffering from severe claustrophobia

          -  Have any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly decrease
