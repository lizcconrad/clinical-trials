    <description>Normally, for adults, 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium bromide is intravenously administered to support endotracheal intubation. If additional administration is necessary, 0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg is intravenously administered. In the case of continuous infusion, infusion is initiated at a rate of 7 Î¼g/kg/min. Dosage should be adjusted based on the age or symptom. The upper limit of this drug for the intubation is 0.9 mg/kg.</description>
