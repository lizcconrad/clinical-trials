  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if clinically relevant subsets exist in patients
      meeting the diagnosis of Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS). Subsets suggest differential
      responses to treatments and if verified, this will be important for the stratification of
      patients in clinical studies related to PBS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with the diagnosis of painful bladder syndrome (PBS) constitute two or more
      phenotypes that are distinguished by differential neurophysiological processing of sensory
      information. Further, these differing phenotypes can be predicted by the presence or absence
      of the co-morbidity fibromyalgia.
