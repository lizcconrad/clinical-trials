    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine the effect of stimulating the phrenic
      nerve to treat periodic breathing (a pattern of breathing characterized by hyperpneas
      followed by hypopneas or apneas). Clinically, these physiologic events translate into sleep
      fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced exercise capacity, and possibly
      ventricular arrhythmias.

      Stage 1 of the study is acute in nature, such that subjects will undergo the placement of a
      stimulation lead, followed by assessment of stimulation of the phrenic nerve using the lead
      for up to 2 nights of sleep. A sensing lead may also be placed during the initial implant
      procedure. Observational data will be obtained and stimulation provided using an externalized
      system connected to the study leads. Following the study, all investigational components will
      be removed from the patient.

      Stage 2 of the study is being conducted at one of the participating sites to determine the
      initial safety of chronic stimulation of the phrenic nerve in a limited number of patients
      with sleep disordered breathing. It is anticipated that data obtained in this feasibility
      study will show that the proposed intervention can modify respiration with a low incidence of
      adverse effects. The results of this trial are intended to be used to develop a subsequent
      protocol for a multi-center study of chronic phrenic nerve pacing.

    <description>In Stage 1, a stimulation lead will be introduced via standard access methods and positioned to provide stimulation. A second lead may also be placed for sensing purposes. The proximal portions of the implanted lead(s) will remain externalized such that stimulation and observation can be made using external stimulation and recording equipment. Study subjects will be observed and stimulation will be performed for up to 2 nights of sleep in a clinically supported environment. In Stage 2, a stimulation device and lead will be permanently implanted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older

          -  Patient has a demonstrated history of periodic breathing (symptoms may include sleep
             fragmentation, as reported by patient or as witnessed by another person, night arousal
             after apneic episodes, reduced exercise capacity, and daytime sleepiness)

          -  Patient is expected to be able to tolerate the procedure and remain clinically stable
             for the duration of the study (e.g. the subject is able to lie down long enough to
             insert the lead(s) without shortness of breath and the subject is able to tolerate
             instrumentation during study).

          -  Patient or their legal representative is willing and able to sign an IRB/MEC approved
             informed consent (and a privacy protection authorization in the United States)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90% on a stable FIO2

          -  Evidence of phrenic nerve palsy

          -  Temperature &gt; 38.0 degrees Celsius

          -  Inability to place catheter (e.g. previously known coagulopathy, distorted anatomy,
             etc.)

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in another study that may confound the results of this
             study

          -  Patient for whom informed consent cannot be obtained

             test within 10 days of the study procedure

          -  Patients implanted with a pacemaker, implantable defibrillator, or cardiac
             resynchronization device who are unable to tolerate turning off the device for the
             duration of the system testing procedure (based on medical judgment)

          -  Patients with severe COPD (per GOLD scale)

          -  Patients with a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the study

          -  Patients with unstable angina
