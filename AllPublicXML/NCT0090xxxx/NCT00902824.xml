      This trial will study a prime-boost vaccine approach designed mainly to induce cell-mediated
      immune (CTL) responses.

    <textblock>
      Two vaccine candidates will be used in two different prime-boost regimens: ADVAX (DNA) +
      TBC-M4 (MVA) and TBC-M4 (MVA) alone. Both these vaccines have already been tested in humans
      and both were found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. Approximately 32 volunteers (24
      vaccine /8 placebo recipients) will be included in the study.
