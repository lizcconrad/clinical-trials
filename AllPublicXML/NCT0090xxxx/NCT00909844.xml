      The purpose of the protocol is to assess the efficacy of triptorelin 11.25 mg with respect to
      the proportion of children who maintain a regression or stabilisation of sexual maturity
      until the end of the study.

    <description>The primary objective was to assess efficacy of triptorelin pamoate 11.25 mg with respect to percentage of children maintaining a regression or stabilisation of sexual maturity (based on Tanner breast [girls] or genital [boys] pubertal stage) until end of study. Study treatment lasted until end of the therapeutic period; visits for Months 36 and 48 were optional since a child may have already finished the study at a prior visit. The Final Visit only occurred if the child did not end the study by a complete visit such as at Months 24, 36 or 48. Results are presented only for percentage of girls with regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage (n=34). Since only one boy was included in the study, results for this outcome measure were listed only and no statistical analysis was performed. Please also note additional post-hoc analysis for regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage which applied the variable Last Visit on Treatment instead of Final Visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Months 12, 24, 36, 48 and Final Visit (if applicable; up to 63 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Pubic hair was measured by the Tanner method on a scale of 1 to 6. A low grade (i.e. 1) corresponds to a pre-pubertal stage and a high grade (i.e. 5 or 6) to an adult stage. Percentage of patients who had stabilisation or regression (no change in grade or a reduced grade) of Tanner pubic hair pubertal stage is reported. Study treatment was to last until the end of the therapeutic period; visits for Months 36 and 48 were optional because if the girl was already 11 and the boy already 13, they would have finished the study at a prior visit. The Final Visit was to occur only if the child did not end the study by a complete visit such as at Months 24, 36 or 48. Please also note the additional post-hoc analysis for percentage of children with a stabilisation or regression of Tanner pubic hair pubertal stage which applied the variable Last Visit on Treatment instead of Final Visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Children With a Stabilisation or Regression of Tanner Pubertal Stage at the End of the Study (Final Visit), Compared to Pretreatment (Month -6) and Baseline (Month 0)</title>
        <description>The primary objective was to assess efficacy of triptorelin pamoate 11.25 mg with respect to percentage of children maintaining a regression or stabilisation of sexual maturity (based on Tanner breast [girls] or genital [boys] pubertal stage) until end of study. Study treatment lasted until end of the therapeutic period; visits for Months 36 and 48 were optional since a child may have already finished the study at a prior visit. The Final Visit only occurred if the child did not end the study by a complete visit such as at Months 24, 36 or 48. Results are presented only for percentage of girls with regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage (n=34). Since only one boy was included in the study, results for this outcome measure were listed only and no statistical analysis was performed. Please also note additional post-hoc analysis for regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage which applied the variable Last Visit on Treatment instead of Final Visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Children With a Stabilisation or Regression of Tanner Pubic Hair Pubertal Stage at the End of the Study (Final Visit), Compared to Pretreatment (Month -6) and Baseline (Month 0)</title>
        <description>Pubic hair was measured by the Tanner method on a scale of 1 to 6. A low grade (i.e. 1) corresponds to a pre-pubertal stage and a high grade (i.e. 5 or 6) to an adult stage. Percentage of patients who had stabilisation or regression (no change in grade or a reduced grade) of Tanner pubic hair pubertal stage is reported. Study treatment was to last until the end of the therapeutic period; visits for Months 36 and 48 were optional because if the girl was already 11 and the boy already 13, they would have finished the study at a prior visit. The Final Visit was to occur only if the child did not end the study by a complete visit such as at Months 24, 36 or 48. Please also note the additional post-hoc analysis for percentage of children with a stabilisation or regression of Tanner pubic hair pubertal stage which applied the variable Last Visit on Treatment instead of Final Visit.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Children With a Stabilisation or Regression of Tanner Pubic Hair Pubertal Stage at the End of the Study (Final Visit), Compared to Pretreatment (Month -6) and Baseline (Month 0)</title>
          <description>Pubic hair was measured by the Tanner method on a scale of 1 to 6. A low grade (i.e. 1) corresponds to a pre-pubertal stage and a high grade (i.e. 5 or 6) to an adult stage. Percentage of patients who had stabilisation or regression (no change in grade or a reduced grade) of Tanner pubic hair pubertal stage is reported. Study treatment was to last until the end of the therapeutic period; visits for Months 36 and 48 were optional because if the girl was already 11 and the boy already 13, they would have finished the study at a prior visit. The Final Visit was to occur only if the child did not end the study by a complete visit such as at Months 24, 36 or 48. Please also note the additional post-hoc analysis for percentage of children with a stabilisation or regression of Tanner pubic hair pubertal stage which applied the variable Last Visit on Treatment instead of Final Visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Girls With a Stabilisation or Regression of Tanner Breast Pubertal Stage at the End of the Study (Last Visit on Treatment), Compared to Pretreatment (Month -6) and Baseline (Month 0)</title>
        <description>One primary efficacy endpoint was to assess efficacy of triptorelin pamoate 11.25 mg with respect to percentage of girls maintaining a regression or stabilisation of sexual maturity (based on Tanner breast pubertal stage) until end of study. Results reported for this primary endpoint applied the variable ‘Final Visit’ for comparison to Pretreatment and Baseline. Since it was determined that the majority of patients had a Final Visit &gt;3 months after their last injection, a post-hoc analysis of the percentage of girls with regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage was performed which applied the derived variable ‘Last Visit on Treatment’ to compare to the Pretreatment stage and to Baseline. This post-hoc analysis was judged to be appropriate since triptorelin pamoate 3-month formulation allows release of the active compound over 3 months and beyond this time, pubertal development is expected to progress.</description>
