      Identify early markers of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the fellow eye of a patient
      with CNV in the other eye due to age-related macular degeneration with the expectation of
      being able to identify patients in need of intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sub-, extra- or juxta-foveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or macular scar due to
             AMD in the non-study eye.

          -  No CNV or geographic atrophy in the study eye.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye of greater than 20/40 or better than 70
             ETDRS letters.

          -  Sufficiently clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to permit good
             quality fundus imaging of the study eye.

          -  Subjects of either sex, aged 50 years.

          -  Evidence of a signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject
             (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of
             the trial.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, laboratory tests, and other trial
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          -  Evidence of manifest CNV by FA, color photography or ICG angiography in the study eye.

          -  Any prior treatment for CNV to the study eye (excluding vitamins and AREDS formula).

          -  Significant media opacities, including cataract, which might interfere with visual
             acuity assessments, or fundus imaging in the study eye. Subjects should not be entered
             if there is likelihood that they will require cataract surgery within the following 2
             years.

          -  Presence of other causes of choroidal neovascularization in the fellow eye, including
             pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent of -8 diopters or more negative, or axial
             length of 25 mm or more), the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks,
             choroidal rupture, and multifocal choroiditis.

          -  Any progressive eye disease other than AMD (eg, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) in the
             study eye.

          -  Presence of subretinal hemorrhage, serous or hemorrhagic pigment epithelial
             detachments, subretinal fibrosis or pigment epithelial tears or rips in the study eye.

          -  Any medical condition that would interfere with the patient's ability to complete the
             trial.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in any other observational or interventional clinical study.

          -  Any treatment with an ocular or systemic investigational agent in the past 60 days for
             any medical condition.

          -  Known serious allergies to the dye used in fluorescein angiography or ICG.
