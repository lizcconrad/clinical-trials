  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a new biomaterial with an already existing treatment
      principle (Bio-Oss/Bio-Gide) with regard to their ability to preserve the dimensions of the
      alveolar ridge and to promote bone regeneration and to evaluate the early survival rate of
      dental implants placed in the augmented socket area and to assess radiographically and
      clinically changes of peri-implant soft and hard tissues.

    <textblock>
      This is prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, single center study. The total
      study duration for each patient should be 12 +/- 1 month.

      In total 13 visits per patient are scheduled in this study.

      The study devices Straumann Bone Ceramic and Bio-Oss are CE-marked, and approved by the FDA.
      The products are used within the indication.

      One center in the Inited Kingdom will participate.
