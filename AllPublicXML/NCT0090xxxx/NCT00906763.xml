  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chocolate consumption has long been associated with enjoyment and pleasure. Popular claims
      confer on chocolate the properties of being a stimulant, relaxant, euphoriant and
      antidepressant. These possible pharmacological actions might be related to various biogenic
      amines, such as serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, histamine, phenylethylamine and
      cannabinoid-like substances. Most amines are metabolized by monoamineoxidase-A (MAO-A) and
      are therefore unable to pass the blood-brain-barrier. In contrast, phenylethylamine is a
      direct dopamine releasing ingredient and as a substrate of MAO-B and due to its lipophilic
      structure even capable to pass the blood-brain-barrier. Within this line, own clinical
      observations suggested an increased chocolate consumption in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD) compared to healthy subjects and to their pre-disease state.

      In a previous study, we assessed the consumption of chocolate and non-chocolate sweets in PD
      patients and their partners (as household controls) using a self-questionnaire. Consumption
      of chocolate was significantly higher in PD patients compared to controls, while consumption
      of non-chocolate sweets was similar in both groups. Our study suggests that chocolate
      consumption is increased in PD independent of concomitant depressive symptoms measured by
      BDI-1. Although reasons for increased chocolate consumption in PD remain elusive, it may
      hypothetically be a consequence of the high content of various biogenic amines as a content
      of cocoa influencing dopamine metabolism.

      Therefore, in the present study we aim to study the effects of dark chocolate with high cocoa
      content (85%) compared to chocolate without any cocoa (white chocolate) on motor symptoms in
      PD patients as measured with UPDRS part III (motor score). The principle design of the
      intervention is similar to the standard pharmacological challenge test for studying effects
      on motor symptoms in PD (e.g. levodopa challenge test).
