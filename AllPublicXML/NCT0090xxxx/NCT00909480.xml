    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, South America and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of this clinical trial is to determine whether two insulin treatments given once
      daily are equally effective with respect to the blood glucose lowering effect in subjects
      with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin treatment with or without an
      additional anti-diabetic drug (OAD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months

          -  Stable treatment with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg metformin or maximum
             tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) with or without one other OAD (sulphonylureas,
             meglitinides, thiazolidinediones or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors) for at
             least 3 months

          -  Subject is insulin-naive (short-term insulin treatment of up to 14 days is allowed)

          -  HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) 7.0-9.0 % (both inclusive) by central laboratory
             analysis (one re-test within one week is allowed)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 35.0 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication to insulin detemir or insulin glargine according to the local
             labelling

          -  Receipt of any investigational product within 4 weeks

          -  Anticipated change of dose of any systemic treatment with products, which in the
             Investigator's opinion could interfere with glucose metabolism (e.g. systemic
             corticosteroids)

          -  Clinically significant diseases which, in the Investigator's opinion may confound the
             results of the trial or pose additional risk in administering trial product

          -  Any other condition that the Investigator feels would interfere with trial
             participation or evaluation of results
