  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who had axial lower back pain (LBP) with or without radiation present for at least 3
      months and had daily moderate to severe LBP as the primary source of pain participated in a
      Phase IV clinical trial to assess the efficacy of lidocaine patch 5% compared to celecoxib
      200 mg in treating chronic axial LBP with and without radiation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Had axial LBP with or without radiation present for at least 3 months as defined
             below:

               -  Chronic axial LBP without radiation: pain isolated to the axial low back without
                  radiation into the buttock or below

               -  Chronic axial LBP with radiation: pain that radiated to the buttock or below.
                  This patient group could include patients with radicular/neuropathic and
                  non-radicular components with leg pain component &lt;50%

          2. Had daily moderate to severe LBP as the primary source of pain

          3. Had a normal neurological examination, including:

               -  Motor strength

               -  Sensory exam in lower extremities

               -  Deep tendon reflexes

          4. Had a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without any clinically significant
             abnormalities in heart rate, rhythm, or conduction

          5. Had discontinued use of all analgesic medications (including over-the-counter [OTC]
             analgesics), glucosamine, and chondroitin prior to randomization (patients were
             allowed limited use of analgesic medications for indications other than non-study pain

          6. At the baseline visit, patients were randomized to active treatment if they had an
             average daily pain intensity score of 5 or greater (on a 0 to 10 scale) for at least 3
             days out of the 5 consecutive days immediately prior to the baseline visit; 0 was
             defined as &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 was defined as &quot;pain as bad as ever imagined&quot; as measured
             by Question 5 of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and recorded in a diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Had spinal stenosis with &gt;50% leg pain component

          2. Had any other chronic pain condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with patient assessment of LBP relief

          3. Had a history of one or more back surgeries within 1 year of study entry

          4. Had a moderate or greater hepatic impairment

          5. Had a severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min)

          8. Were taking analgesic medications that could not be discontinued during the study.
             Patients taking these medications prior to the study were required to discontinue use
             for the duration of the study. Patients using opioid analgesics at study entry were
             required to taper off these medications.

          9. Were taking long-acting opioids or opioids that could not be discontinued over the
             first 5 days of the washout period

         10. Were receiving fluconazole or lithium (secondary to drug-drug-interaction risks with
             celecoxib)

         11. Had received an epidural steroid/local anesthetic injection within 4 weeks prior to
             study entry

         12. Had received trigger point injections within 2 weeks prior to study entry

         13. Had received Botulinum Toxin (Botox) injections for LBP within 6 months prior to study
             entry

         14. Were using a lidocaine-containing product that cannot be discontinued during the study

         15. Were using any topical medication applied to the low back region

         16. Had previously failed treatment with Lidoderm analgesic patch for LBP

         17. Had previously failed treatment with celecoxib or with any two COX-2 specific
             inhibitors other than celecoxib

         18. Were taking class I anti-arrhythmic (e.g. mexiletine, tocainide)

         19. Had a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 3 years
