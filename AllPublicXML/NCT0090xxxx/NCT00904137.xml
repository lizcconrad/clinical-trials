  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type I supracondylar fractures are elbow fractures that occur in children aged 3-10 years.
      Many different treatment options exist to treat this type of fracture. The purpose of this
      study is to compare three different treatment modalities with regards to pain experienced
      during treatment, the amount of pain medication needed during treatment, and any short-term
      complications. We hypothesize that above elbow casting and long-arm splinting will result in
      less pain and have fewer complications than taping the elbow in flexion.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study either by the
      attending physician in the Emergency Department at BC Children's hospital or by one of the
      study investigators. They will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: above
      elbow cast, long arm splint, or tape. After being treated, patients will be required to fill
      in a daily pain diary describing their level of pain and how much analgesia they are
      requiring. They will also be followed by regular phone calls to track any complications of
      treatment (e.g. loosening or shifting of cast/ splint/ tape, any skin breakdown, etc.).
      Patients will be seen for follow-up at three weeks post-injury in the Orthopedics Clinic at
      BCCH to have radiographs repeated, finish their treatment, and hand in their pain diaries.

    We were unable to recruit the appropriate numbers as parents did not want to randomize their
    child for the treatments options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients aged 4-12 years who present to the Emergency department at BC Children's
             hospital with a history of elbow trauma, and are diagnosed by the staff emergency
             physician to have a Type I supracondylar fracture of the humerus (as seen on AP and
             lateral radiographs of the elbow)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with neurovascular compromise associated with the fracture

          -  a pre-existing diagnosis of metabolic or structural bone disease that predisposes them
             to fractures

          -  presence of other fractures of the ipsilateral upper extremity
