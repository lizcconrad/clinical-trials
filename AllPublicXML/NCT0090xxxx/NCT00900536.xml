      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and/or tissue in the laboratory from patients with
      kidney cancer receiving sorafenib may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA
      and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients
      will respond to sorafenib.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the DNA in blood and/or tissue samples from
      patients with primary kidney cancer receiving sorafenib on clinical trial MRC-RE05-SORCE.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the relationship between tumor genotype, expression, and patient outcome.

        -  Examine the relationship between constitutional genotype and patient outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood and/or tissue sample collection for laboratory studies. Laboratory
      studies include generation of tissue microarrays; analysis of protein expression by
      immunohistochemistry; tumor DNA extraction and whole genome amplification; detection of VHL
      or other relevant gene mutations by direct sequencing; and constitutional (lymphocyte DNA)
      genotyping by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.
