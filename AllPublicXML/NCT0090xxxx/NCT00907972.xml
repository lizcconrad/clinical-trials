  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care burdens from neurodegenerative diseases are expected to increase
      disproportionately. Increasing age also predisposes this same population to other chronic
      diseases including osteoporosis, a progressive systemic skeletal disease characterized by low
      bone mass, which leads to an increase susceptibility to fractures. In the United States, 44
      million people are estimated to be at risk for osteoporosis and low bone mass emphasizing the
      enormity of this public health problem.

      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting about 1 million
      people. Evidence indicates that Parkinson's disease patients are at a higher risk for low
      bone mineral density, which can contribute to increased fractures compared to healthy
      subjects. In fact, several risk factors of osteoporosis in patients with PD have been
      identified, including advanced stages of PD, low body mass index, inadequate sunlight
      exposure and decreased vitamin D levels. Some or all of these factors in conjunction with
      decreased immobilization that may occur with PD, put patients at increased risks for
      fractures. Few studies however have examined bone markers in PD patients. Even fewer studies
      have examined the impact of Vitamin D supplementation on bone metabolism and mineralization
      in PD patients.

      Vitamin D is an essential component in bone health, promoting calcium absorption in the gut
      and maintaining adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations, which enable normal
      mineralization of bone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's
      disease affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 50 years. There is a
      worldwide increase in disease prevalence due to the increasing age of human populations. The
      disease is characterized by tremor, stiffness of the limbs and trunk, impaired balance and
      coordination, and slowing of movements, leading to immobility and frequent falls. Patients
      also sometimes develop other symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, disturbed sleep, and
      emotional problems. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
      substantia nigra region of the brain. The cause and mechanism of continued neuron cell death
      in the substantia nigra is currently unknown.

      Epidemiological studies suggest an association between Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis,
      vitamin D inadequacy and altered bone and mineral metabolism. Accumulating evidence indicates
      that patients with Parkinson's disease are at a higher risk for fractures compared to healthy
      subjects. This could be attributed to several contributing factors including increased rate
      of falls, vitamin D deficiency, reduced body mass index and reduced bone mineral density.
