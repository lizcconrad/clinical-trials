  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010) used
      as 2-step initiation regimen and 1-step initiation regimen in Japan, over a period of 24
      weeks of treatment, followed by an extension up to Week 76.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of lixisenatide once daily
      treatment in monotherapy at Week 24 by a descriptive comparison of a 1-step initiation and a
      2-step initiation regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes in Japan.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the overall safety of lixisenatide once daily
      treatment in monotherapy at Week 52 and Week 76; to assess the effects of lixisenatide on
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction at Week 52 and Week 76, body weight, and fasting
      plasma glucose (FPG); to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-lixisenatide antibody
      development.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52, 76</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change = HbA1c value at week of assessment (Week 52/Week 76) minus HbA1c value at baseline. The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

    <description>Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from value at week of assessment (Week 52/Week 76). The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52, 76</time_frame>
    <description>Change was calculated by subtracting baseline value from value at week of assessment (Week 52/Week 76). The on-treatment period for this efficacy variable is the time from the first dose of study drug up to 1 day after the last dose of study drug or up to the introduction of rescue therapy, whichever is the earliest.

    <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from Week 4 to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8.5%, from Week 24 to end of treatment (Week 76): fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8%. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 9 centers in Japan between May 09, 2009 and January 22, 2011. The overall duration of treatment was at least 76 weeks (52-week open-label treatment; 24-week open-label extension treatment).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 75 patients were screened of which 6(8.0%) were screen failures; main reasons for screen failure:glycosylated hemoglobin being out of defined protocol range (&gt;=7% and &lt;=10%) and use of an antidiabetic agent other than a sulfonylurea or alpha-glucosidase inhibitor within 3 months prior to screening. A total of 69 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from Week 4 to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8.5%, from Week 24 to end of treatment (Week 76): fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8%. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

          <description>Routine fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) values were used to determine the requirement of rescue medication. If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) were performed. Threshold values - from Week 4 to Week 8: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;270 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (15.0 mmol/L), from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 24: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8.5%, from Week 24 to end of treatment (Week 76): fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8%. For a patient to be included in mITT population, both baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment for at least 1 efficacy variable, were required.</description>

        <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose less than 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose less than 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.The on-treatment period was the time from the first dose of study drug up to 3 days after the last dose.</description>
