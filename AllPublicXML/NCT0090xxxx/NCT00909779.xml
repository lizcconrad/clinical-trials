      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      outpatient, safety study to evaluate the long-term safety of arformoterol 15 mcg twice daily
      (BID) in the treatment of subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD. The administration of
      arformoterol in subjects with moderate to severe COPD will not result in a meaningfully
      greater incidence of respiratory death and COPD exacerbation -related hospitalizations
      compared to placebo (nebulized saline and non-long-acting beta2-agonist [LABA] COPD standard
      of care treatments). This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009,
      Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's
      name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

    <measure>Time From Randomization to Respiratory Death or First COPD Exacerbation Related Hospitalization (Whichever Occurs First).</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>COPD exacerbation: an increase in COPD symptoms that necessitated any change in baseline medication (bronchodilators,anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen therapy, etc.).Hospitalization: any inpatient admission or any emergency department visit &gt; 24 hours in duration. Hospice was considered hospitalization.COPD exacerbation related hospitalization: hospitalization that was due to 1) COPD exacerbation or 2) a COPD exacerbation preceded, or occurred concomitantly with the onset of, the event for which the subject was hospitalized.Respiratory-related death: For each death the Primary Investigator designated a 'probable cause', which was the primary condition that precipitated the terminal events that were the immediate cause of death. If a probable cause could not be ascertained, the cause of death was considered 'UNKNOWN'. Cause other than 'UNKNOWN' was categorized as either respiratory or non-respiratory. Deaths of 'UNKNOWN' cause were counted as primary events.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Incidence of Protocol Defined COPD Exacerbations.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A protocol-defined exacerbation of COPD was defined as an increase in respiratory symptoms (classically, increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and/or increased sputum purulence) that necessitates any change in baseline medication other than bronchodilators (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen therapy, etc) or causes the subject to require additional medical attention (i.e., emergency room visit or hospitalization).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Incidence of All Cause Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Survival status at the end of the study will be determined for each subject. The proportion of subjects dead and the annual event rate will be summarized by treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Incidence of Treatment Emergent AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were defined as: 1) adverse events that occurred on or after the date of first dose of study medication, 2) adverse events with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the date of first does of study medication, or 3) adverse events with both a missing start and stop date.
The frequency and percentage of subjects with TEAEs were summarized. At each level of summarization, a subject was counted only once for each AE he/she experienced within that level. The percentage of subjects having had at least 1 AE at each level was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SGRQ: Mean Change From Baseline in Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on treatment at months 3, 6 and 12 (or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ assessed health status and consisted of 3 component scores (Symptoms, Activity, and Impacts) as well as a total score. Items were scored in accordance with the developer's guidelines. Scores were expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, where 100 represented worst possible health status and 0 indicated best possible health status. The SGRQ was assessed pre-dose at baseline, months 3, 6 and 12 or the end of study (EOS). Visit 2 was defined as baseline. A change from baseline in the Total Score of ≥ 4 units is considered the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for SGRQ.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FEV1: Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on treatments at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured at Visit 1 (screening), pre- and post-albuterol administration for reversibility testing, pre-dose at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12/EOS. The best FEV1 from at least 3 acceptable maneuvers was recorded. Study baseline was defined as the Visit 2 pre-dose value. If the Visit 2 pre-dose value was missing, the last FEV1 value obtained prior to first treatment was used for baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Predicted FEV1: Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on treatments at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent predicted FEV1: measured FEV1 as a percent of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for the patients of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). Best FEV1 percent predicted was measured at Visit 1 (screening), pre-dose at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12/EOS, as described for FEV1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC): Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on treatment at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Vital capacity: the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration. Best FVC was measured at Visit 1 (screening), pre-dose at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12/EOS. The best FVC from at least 3 acceptable maneuvers was recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inspiratory Capacity (IC): Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and on treatment at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>IC: the total amount of air that can be drawn into the lungs after normal expiration.
IC was measured pre- and post-albuterol administration at Visit 1 (screening), pre-dose at baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12/EOS. IC maneuvers were done in triplicate. The mean of all recorded IC values was used for each subject at each time point. Study baseline was defined as the Visit 2 pre-dose value. If the Visit 2 pre-dose value was missing, the last IC value obtained prior to first treatment dose was used for baseline.</description>

          -  Subjects must have had at least 1 COPD exacerbation within the last year (defined as
             initiation or an increase in the dose of oral steroids or antibiotics for the
             treatment of COPD).

          -  Subjects must have a ≥15 pack-year smoking history and a baseline breathlessness

          -  Female subjects ≤65 years of age must have a negative serum pregnancy test conducted
             at Visit 1 prior to randomization. Females of childbearing potential must be using an
             acceptable method of birth control.

          -  Subjects' overall health must be sufficiently stable to complete the study

            <groups_desc>The null hypothesis is: There is 40% or higher excess risk of the primary events in the arformoterol group relative to placebo (a constant hazard ratio of 1.4).
The primary analysis was a Cox proportional hazards regression model, with treatment group, baseline smoking status, sex, age, BMI, and baseline FEV1 as covariates. The hazard ratio and 90% two-sided confidence interval for the hazard ratio (adjusted for the interim analysis) comparing arformoterol to placebo were estimated.</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>The study was powered under a one-sided alternative hypothesis, in which arformoterol is superior to placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.80 or less. To achieve 80% power, it was necessary to observe 86 total events for the primary endpoint adjusted for interim analysis. Assuming an annual event proportion of 17.3% in the placebo group and 30% lost to follow-up, we anticipated to randomize approximately 900 subjects (450 per arm).
The non-inferiority margin for the hazard ratio is 1.4.</non_inferiority_desc>
