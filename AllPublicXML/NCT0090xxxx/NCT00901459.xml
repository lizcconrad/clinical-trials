      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) to block craving for cigarettes in smokers. rTMS is an investigational
      procedure, where a device called a &quot;stimulator&quot; provides electricity to a device that creates
      a magnetic field. This device is placed against the scalp in the front of the head so that
      the magnetic field is focused on an area of the brain that is thought to be involved in
      craving for cigarettes. rTMS is an investigational procedure so therefore being tested in
      research studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Changes
      in magnetic fields during rTMS administration change electrical currents which may affect
      brain activity and function.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of rTMS on cue-induced craving in dependent
      smokers. We hypothesize that low frequency rTMS over the SFG will block cue-induced craving.
      In order to test this hypothesis, subjects will undergo three conditions:

        1. active condition: low frequency rTMS was administered over the superior frontal gyrus
           (SFG) during the presentation of smoking and control cues

        2. location control condition: low frequency rTMS was administered over motor cortex (MC)
           during the presentation of smoking and control cues

        3. frequency control condition: high frequency rTMS was administered over the SFG during
           the presentation of smoking and control cues

    <measure>Change in Craving for Cigarettes After Smoking Cues Versus Neutral Cues Using a Repeated Measure Design.</measure>
    <time_frame>Following exposure to in vivo cues</time_frame>
    <description>Cigarette craving was assessed orally during each rTMS Session, before and after each stimulus presentation and cigarette smoking with a brief version of the Shiffman-Jarvik questionnaire (14), which contained items assessing cigarette craving using the following subscale: CRAVING (&quot;urges to smoke,&quot; &quot;miss a cigarette,&quot; and &quot;crave cigarettes&quot;), MOOD (&quot;calm,&quot; &quot;tense,&quot; and &quot;irritable&quot;), AROUSAL (&quot;wide awake,&quot; &quot;able to concentrate&quot;), and HUNGER (&quot;feel hungry&quot;). The scale for the Shiffman-Jarvik questionnaire is a Likert item scale with measurements 1-Not at All; 2-Very Little; 3-A Little; 4-Moderately; 5- A Lot; 6-Quite A Lot and 7-Extremely. The change in craving for cigarettes after smoking cues versus neutral cues using the parenthetical items listed above with the subscale CRAVING were used to determine the primary outcome. A negative value represents a decrease in reported cigarette craving.</description>

        <title>Change in Craving for Cigarettes After Smoking Cues Versus Neutral Cues Using a Repeated Measure Design.</title>
        <description>Cigarette craving was assessed orally during each rTMS Session, before and after each stimulus presentation and cigarette smoking with a brief version of the Shiffman-Jarvik questionnaire (14), which contained items assessing cigarette craving using the following subscale: CRAVING (“urges to smoke,” “miss a cigarette,” and “crave cigarettes”), MOOD (“calm,” “tense,” and “irritable”), AROUSAL (“wide awake,” “able to concentrate”), and HUNGER (“feel hungry”). The scale for the Shiffman-Jarvik questionnaire is a Likert item scale with measurements 1-Not at All; 2-Very Little; 3-A Little; 4-Moderately; 5- A Lot; 6-Quite A Lot and 7-Extremely. The change in craving for cigarettes after smoking cues versus neutral cues using the parenthetical items listed above with the subscale CRAVING were used to determine the primary outcome. A negative value represents a decrease in reported cigarette craving.</description>
