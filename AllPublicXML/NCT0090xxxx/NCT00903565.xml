      The aim of this study is to enroll 785 eligible stage II colon cancer patients in order to
      validate the performance of ColoPrint in estimating 3-year relapse rate.

      Secondary objectives include comparing the objective risk assessment results from the
      prognostic profile (ColoPrint) to both the risk assessment based on the ASCO criteria, as
      well as the Investigator's independent assessment. As this is the first prospective study of
      ColoPrint, this study will also address the logistics and quality assurance of using
      ColoPrint in clinical practice.

      Patient treatment is at the discretion of the physician, adhering to National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network (NCCN)-approved regimens or a recognized alternative.

      The enrollment period will be 6 years. It is expected that 1800 to 2400 patients will be
      enrolled in order to obtain 785 analysable stage II samples from eligible patients.
      Approximately 25-35 clinical sites will be involved worldwide.

      The statistical analysis will be performed by Agendia and an independent research institute
      or hospital.

      Study Design Extension Study:

      This will be a prospective study to measure the impact of ColoPrint on adjuvant treatment in
      stage 2 colorectal cancer patients. After surgery the tumor sample will be shipped in RNA
      Retain to Agendia. The online Clinical Report Form (CRF) 0 will be completed to document if
      the patient fulfils the inclusion criteria. Baseline clinical data and the patient and
      physician chemotherapy intention, patient's perceived recurrence risk and decisional conflict
      without knowing the ColoPrint result will be entered in CRF 1. After completion of CRF1 the
      ColoPrint result is released. CRF2 will be completed after the final treatment decision has
      been made.

      This CRF will capture the patient and physician chemotherapy intention, patient's perceived
      recurrence risk and decisional conflict, impact of ColoPrint and the actual treatment the
      patient will receive. CRF3 will be completed 12 months after enrolment and will capture the
      patient status, patient's perceived recurrence risk and decisional conflict. CRF4 and 5 will
      be completed 3 and 5 years after surgery and will capture the patient status. A sample size
      of 210 stage 2 colon cancer patients is required to detect a 10% overall treatment change (5%
      significance and 90% power).

      Reporting of the Results:

      Blinded Study; The ColoPrint results will not be reported to the physician and/or patient at
      the time of enrolment. All samples will be stored in a freezer until 550-575 eligible stage
      II patients have been enrolled. Samples will then be analyzed in one batch in a blinded
      fashion from the clinical results.

      Extension Study; The ColoPrint results will be reported to the physician and patient after
      CRF1 has been completed.

      Primary Objective • To validate the performance of ColoPrint in estimating the 3-year relapse
      rate in patients with stage II colorectal cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

      • To assess the feasibility of using the ColoPrint test in the clinical setting.

        -  To compare the risk assessment in stage II patients using the ColoPrint profile vs a
           clinical risk assessment based on 1) Investigator's assessment of risk and 2) ASCO
           high-risk recommendations (T4 lesions, perforation / obstruction, inadequate node
           sampling (less than 12 nodes) or poorly differentiated histology).

        -  To establish the proportion of low-risk and high-risk ColoPrint profiles in stage II
           colorectal cancer patients in various countries.

        -  To investigate therapy as a potential confounding factor for ColoPrint results.

        -  To assess the performance of ColoPrint in estimating the 3-year relapse rate in patients
           with stage III colorectal cancer.

        -  To compare the performance of ColoPrint vs the clinical risk assessment in estimating
           the 5-year relapse rate.

        -  Assess the impact of ColoPrint on adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions in stage 2
           colorectal cancer patients

        -  Compare the ColoPrint results from fresh RNARetain colorectal tumor specimens to the
           matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) colon tumor specimens for
           concordance.
