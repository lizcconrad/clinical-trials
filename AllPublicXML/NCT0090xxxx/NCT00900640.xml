      The aim of this study is to prospectively document the incidence of CM adverse reactions at
      the time of ERCP and to determine whether various perceived risk factors are predictive of
      adverse reaction.

      Adverse reactions to iodine containing contrast media (CM) have been described after
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) but have been difficult to study due
      to their extremely low incidence. Adverse reactions can be classified by severity (mild,
      moderate or severe) or underlying mechanism (idiosyncratic versus nonidiosyncratic).
      Nonidiosyncratic reactions are related to the dose and osmolality of the CM; these are not
      observed during ERCP due to the relative small amount of systemic absorption of CM.
      Idiosyncratic reactions on the other hand are not dose-dependent and generally occur shortly
      after administration of CM.

      Premedication with corticosteroids, H1/H2 -blockers and the use of low osmolality CM is
      beneficial in preventing nonidiosyncratic reactions during intravascular administration.
      However their role in during ERCP is unclear as CM is not injected into the intravascular
      space. Currently there are no formal recommendations and clinical practice varies
      considerably. The general purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of CM reactions
      during ERCP and to determine whether various risk factors are predictive of idiosyncratic
      reactions. Based on these results, we hope to develop guidelines for the use of prophylaxis
      to prevent CM reactions in ERCP.
