    <textblock>
      Standardized acupuncture treatment for infant colic is a common treatment in general practice
      for doctors educated in medical acupuncture.

      The investigators plan to study whether the perceived opinion on positive results can be
      verified in a multi-center clinical trial. The investigators aim to measure the effect of
      standardized acupuncture treatment, three repeated sessions, on infant colic in a randomized
      singe blinded prospective multi-center study, starting September 2009. The study will be done
      in thirteen locations in Norway by specialists in General Practice trained in acupuncture.

      The investigators intend to include a total of 130 patients, 65 in the intervention group and
      65 in the control group.
