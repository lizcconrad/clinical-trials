  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in SCCHN and its
      overexpression is associated with poor patient outcome. EGFR is a promising target of
      anticancer therapy. We have developed EGFR antisense DNA as a safe and potentially
      efficacious treatment for SCCHN as shown in a previous phase I study conducted at the
      University of Pittsburgh. Cetuximab (Erbitux or C225) is a chimerized EGFR monoclonal
      antibody that has produced positive results in a phase III trial in SCCHN when added to
      radiation therapy and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally advanced SCCHN.
      Radiation plus cetuximab is considered a standard treatment, especially for patients who are
      not good candidates for chemotherapy. In the current study, we plan to evaluate the addition
      of intratumoral EGFR antisense DNA (EGFR AS) to standard radiation with concurrent cetuximab
      in patients.

      Subject population We will enroll patients with SCCHN who are suitable for intratumoral
      injections of EGFR antisense. Please see eligibility criteria.

      Treatment plan

      EGFR AS will be administered by direct intratumoral injection using direct visualization,
      endoscopy, or imaging-guidance (ultrasound) as clinically determined . Patients will receive
      a total of up to 7 weekly intratumoral injections of EGFR antisense (or less if there is no
      identifiable tumor) starting 2 weeks prior to radiation. Patients will receive standard
      radiation 70 Gy/200 cGy/daily, 5 days/week,excluding weekends and holidays, with concurrent
      cetuximab 250 mg/m2, after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 2 weeks prior to starting radiation.

      Statistical Design and Sample Size The study will be conducted in two-stages. In the first
      stage, 11 patients with stage IVA-C or recurrent disease will be evaluated for safety. If the
      regimen is deemed safe, a total of 31 patients with stage III or IVA-B, previously untreated
      SCCHN will be enrolled in the second stage of the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        3.1 Eligibility Criteria

          -  First stage Patients with current AJCC edition stage IVA-IVC or recurrent or
             metastatic head and neck cancer will be eligible. Patients with M1 disease must have
             asymptomatic or low volume distant metastasis and require palliation for local and
             regional disease

          -  Second stage (phase II part) Patients with current AJCC edition stage III-IVB (T1-T4,
             N1-3M0) head and neck cancer, except WHO type II and III nasopharyngeal cancer,
             including unknown primary tumors.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or
             variants or poorly differentiated carcinoma.

          -  Unidimensionally measurable disease (RECIST criteria).

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

          -  In the second stage of the study, therapy will be administered with a curative intent
             and patients should not have recurrent disease or distant metastasis.

          -  Primary tumor and/or lymphadenopathy should be technically suitable for intratumoral
             injections. The Otolaryngologist specialist on the head and neck team will determine
             this feasibility.

          -  Participating patients should agree to undergo a tumor biopsy at baseline as well as
             approximately 2 weeks later as specified in study schema.

          -  Prior treatment

               -  First stage: any prior treatment, except prior therapy which specifically and
                  directly targets the EGFR pathway, administered within the last 6 months. No
                  prior radiation therapy to the head and neck.

               -  Second stage: no prior chemotherapy, biologic/molecular targeted therapy
                  (including any prior therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR
                  pathway), or radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, including
             tonsillectomy, and organ sparing procedures, including neck dissection. Any non-biopsy
             surgical procedure for head and neck cancer must have taken place at least one month
             before initiating protocol treatment, at the treating physician's discretion.

          -  Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/=1,000/µL

        Platelets &gt;/=75,000/µL

        Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10 g/dL

        Total bilirubin &lt;2 x upper normal institutional limits

        Creatinine clearance &gt; 20 mL/min

          -  Age of &gt;/= 18 years

          -  Because radiation therapy is known to be teratogenic and EFGR inhibitors may have
             teratogenic potential, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completing
             study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy.
             Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        3.2 Exclusion Criteria

          -  Severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min)

          -  Treatment with anticoagulants, except when used to maintain the patency of a central
             venous line, or INR &gt;1.5, or PTT ratio &gt;1.5.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e.,
             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell
             or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, DCIS or LCIS of the breast,
             localized early stage prostate cancer, or malignancy that has been treated with a
             curative intent with a 3-year disease-free survival.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cetuximab, EGFR AS, and radiation
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with cetuximab and EGFR AS, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with cetuximab. The effects of cetuximab and
             EGFR AS on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown.
             For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible drug interactions with cetuximab. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when
             indicated. . HIV status of the patient will be obtained from the patient's history via
             discussion with the investigator. HIV testing is not required.

          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody.

          -  Patients who are not informed of and are not willing to comply with the
             investigational nature of the study and have not signed a written informed consent in
             accordance with institutional and good clinical practice guidelines.

          -  Phase 2 ONLY (second stage) - Subjects with M1 disease will be excluded.
