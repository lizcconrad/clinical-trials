      Participants in the cognitive training group train in a computer-based cognitive training
      program over a period of 12 weeks. An active control group train in a program involving tasks
      that do not engage high-level cognitive functioning over the same period.

    <description>CogniFit Personal Coach速 computer cognitive training program. The program provides individually tailored cognitive training based on the results of a baseline evaluation (the Neuropsychological Examination - CogniFit Personal Coach速). The program assigns scores to 17 cognitive abilities that are subsequently trained by means of 21 different tasks.</description>
