        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females were at least 18 years of age and not more than 70 years old

          -  A dental implant procedure was foreseen in the maxilla region corresponding to
             maxillary sinus

          -  Patients presented a bone defect in the sinus area, which needed a sinus floor
             elevation to place one or more dental implants

          -  The patients were unilaterally or bilaterally edentulous in the maxillary region
             corresponding to the sinuses

          -  Residual alveolar crest height of the lateral-posterior segments of the edentulous
             maxilla below the floor of the maxillary sinus was less than 8 mm and at least 3 mm,
             measured by CT scans. Furthermore, residual alveolar crest width should be at least in
             average 6 mm measured by the CT scans

          -  Patients were committed to the study

          -  Patients were healthy at time of surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical conditions requiring prolonged use of steroids

          -  Standard blood test performed by the medical practitioner of the patient showing:
             leukocyte dysfunction and deficiencies

          -  Haemophilia, bleeding disorders or cumarin therapy

          -  History of neoplastic disease requiring the use of chemotherapy

          -  Current pregnancy at the time of recruitment

          -  Physical handicaps that would interfere with the ability to perform adequate oral
             hygiene

          -  Use of any investigational drug or device within the 90 days period immediately prior
             to implant surgery on study day 0

          -  Immunocompromised patients including patients infected with HIV

          -  Patients who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day or cigar equivalents, or who chew
             tobacco

             a general contra-indication for surgical procedure or would prevent completion of
             study participation or interfere with analysis of study results, such as history of
             non-compliance, or unreliability

        Local exclusion criteria

          -  Local inflammation, including untreated periodontitis to residual dentition

          -  Mucosal diseases such as erosive lichen planus

          -  History of local radiation therapy

          -  Presence of oral lesions (such as ulceration, malignancy)

          -  Severe bruxing or clenching habits

          -  Persistent intraoral infection

          -  Patients with inadequate oral hygiene or unmotivated for adequate home care

          -  Unhealed extraction sites in the upper premolar or molar area

          -  Last tooth extraction performed less than 3 months before surgery 1

          -  Previous GBR (guided bone regeneration) or dental implant treatment in the
             lateral-posterior segments of the upper maxilla (foreseen implant site)

          -  Patients presenting clinical and radiological signs and symptoms of maxillary sinus
             disease

          -  Patients presenting with residual alveolar crest height of the lateral-posterior
             segments of the edentulous maxilla below the floor of the maxillary sinus less than 3
             mm and residual alveolar crest width less than 6 mm (measured by the CT scans)

          -  The reduction in residual bone height was determined by sinus pneumatization and not
             by vertical resorption of the residual alveolar crest with increased interarch
             distance. Patients with increased interarch distance were excluded from the study

          -  Existing teeth in the residual dentition with untreated endodontic or cariologic
             problems

          -  Horizontal or vertical augmentation to correct the vertical inter-arch distance or to
             correct horizontal defects
