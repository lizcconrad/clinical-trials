    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Had unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee diagnosed according to the American College
             of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria based on clinical and radiographic evidence of OA
             (presence of osteophytes on x-ray and written evaluation)

          2. Had functional capacity class rating of I, II, or III according to ACR classification

          3. Had a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without any clinically significant
             abnormalities in heart rate, rhythm, or conduction

          4. Had discontinued use of all analgesic medications (including over-the-counter [OTC]
             analgesics) prior to randomization (patients were allowed limited use of analgesic
             medications for non-study pain)

          5. At baseline visit, patients were randomized to active treatment if they had an average
             daily pain intensity score for the index joint of 5 or greater (on a 0 to 10 scale)
             for at least 3 days out of the 5 consecutive days immediately preceding the baseline
             visit; 0 is defined as &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is defined as &quot;pain as bad as ever imagined&quot;
             as measured by Question 5 of the BPI and recorded in a diary.

          6. At baseline visit, patients were randomized to active treatment if they had an OA
             severity score for the index joint of 7 or greater on a composite scale of 0 to 24 as
             measured by the Index of Severity for Osteoarthrosis of the Knee

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Had been diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis, gout, pseudo-gout or Paget's disease
             that in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the assessment of pain and
             other symptoms of OA

          2. Had elective surgery scheduled to occur during the 14-week study

          3. Had serious medical conditions requiring daily medications, such as anticonvulsants
             and tricyclic antidepressants, that may confound study results

          4. Had any other clinically significant joint disease or prior joint replacement surgery
             at the index joint

          5. Had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min)

          6. Had moderate or greater hepatic impairment

          7. Had experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or
             other NSAIDs

          8. Had a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding

          9. Were taking analgesic medications, glucosamine, or chondroitin that could not be
             discontinued during the study. Patients taking these medications prior to the study
             were required to discontinue use for the duration of the study. Patients using opioid
             analgesics at study entry were required to taper off these medications.

         10. Were taking long-acting opioids or opioids that could not be discontinued over the
             first 5 days of the washout period.

         11. Were receiving fluconazole or lithium (secondary to drug-drug-interaction risks)

         12. Were taking a lidocaine-containing products that could not be discontinued during the
             study

         13. Had previously failed treatment with Lidoderm analgesic patch for OA

         14. Had recently received either a corticosteroid injection (within 8 weeks) or hyaluronic
             acid (within 6 months) of study entry

         15. Were unable to discontinue use of topic drugs applied to the knee

         16. Had previously failed treatment with celecoxib or with two COX-2 specific inhibitors
             other than celecoxib

         17. Were taking class I anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g. mexiletine, tocainide)
