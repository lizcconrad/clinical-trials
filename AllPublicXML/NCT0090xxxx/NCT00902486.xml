    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose ranging, parallel group
      study. Subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had inadequate response to any
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including biologics will be enrolled.
      Screening evaluations will be performed within approximately 28 days of randomization. The
      duration of the study is 6 months with the primary endpoint assessed at 3 months. Eligible
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three doses (4, 7 or 10 mg QD) of INCB028050 or
      placebo.
