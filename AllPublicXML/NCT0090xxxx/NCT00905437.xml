  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the investigate if pregabalin started a day before surgery and
      continued for 14 days post-operatively can reduce post-operative pain, relieve pre- and
      post-operative anxiety and sleep disturbances.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Pain on Movement Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 5 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean pain on movement score was defined as the mean of the pain on movement score over Days 1 to 5 post-surgery. Pain experienced by participant during passive flexion through 90 degree and passive abduction through 30 degree at operated hip joint was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 10 where, 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Daily Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 7, Day 8 to Day 14 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily pain score was defined as the mean of daily pain score over Days 1 to 7 and Days 8 to 14 post-surgery. Daily Pain Rating Scale (DPRS): participant rated 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) during past 24-hour period. Higher score indicates greater level of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Daily Sleep Interference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 5 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily sleep interference score was defined as the mean of daily sleep interference numeric rating scale (NRS) score over Days 1 to 5 post-surgery. Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS): participant rated pain during past 24-hour period on NRS ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (pain completely interferes with sleep). Higher score indicates a greater level of sleep disturbance. Self-assessment performed daily on awakening prior to taking study medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Anxiety Visual Analogue Scale (A-VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 5 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean anxiety visual analogue scale (VAS) was defined as the mean of VAS score on the day of surgery and over Days 1 to 5 post-surgery. Participants measured their degree of anxiety over past 24 hours on a VAS of 0 to 100, where 0 = not at all anxious to 100 = extremely anxious.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Mobilization After Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 5 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Participant was encouraged each day (from Day 3) to attempt walking depending upon the degree of pain on standing. The first day on which the participant was able to walk for 5 steps was the day of mobilization. Median time to mobilization (in hours) was calculated till the day of mobilization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Rescue Medication Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 6 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medications were used for participants with moderate or severe resting pain. Fentanyl injection (25 microgram [mcg] intravenous bolus to a maximum dose of 3 milliliter/day), paracetamol tablet (15 milligram/kilogram orally to a maximum dose of 45 milligram/kilogram/day) were used as rescue medications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Neuropathic Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90, Day 180 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>ID Pain questionnaire was used to assess neuropathic pain. 6 items questionnaire, did pain feel like: (1)pins and needles (2)hot/burning (3)numb (4)electrical shocks (5)is pain made worse with touch of clothing or bed sheets (6)is pain limited to your joints. &quot;Yes&quot; response to questions 1-5 were scored as 1, while a &quot;yes&quot; response to question 6 was scored as -1. &quot;No&quot; response were scored as 0. Overall score range -1 to 5.Higher score more indicative of pain with a neuropathic component. Number of participants with score 2 or more (which indicated nerve pain) were reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is undergoing a routine (i.e., expected to be uncomplicated) total primary
             or secondary hip replacement surgery performed under a standardized regimen of spinal
             anesthesia, and is expected to experience moderate to severe post-surgical pain in the
             absence of post-operative analgesia

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is undergoing a revision to a previous hip replacement procedure, hip
             replacement procedure further to a road traffic accident with multiple injuries, or a
             procedure expected to last longer than 4 hours

          -  The patient has a history of uncontrolled chronic disease or a concurrent clinically
             significant illness or medical condition, which in the Investigator's opinion, would
             contraindicate study participation or confound interpretation of the results

        <title>Mean Pain on Movement Score</title>
        <description>Mean pain on movement score was defined as the mean of the pain on movement score over Days 1 to 5 post-surgery. Pain experienced by participant during passive flexion through 90 degree and passive abduction through 30 degree at operated hip joint was evaluated on a scale of 0 to 10 where, 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 5 post-surgery</time_frame>
