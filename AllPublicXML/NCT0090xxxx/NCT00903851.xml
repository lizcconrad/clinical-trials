      Patients with Type I or II diabetes and painful distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy
      with dynamic allodynia of the lower extremities, patients with Type I or II diabetes and pain
      distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy with no dynamic allodynia of the lower
      extremities, or patients with idiopathic distal predominantly sensory neuropathy participated
      in a Phase IV clinical trial to assess the efficacy of lidocaine patches in treating painful
      diabetic neuropathy or idiopathic distal sensory neuropathy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At Sites 1, 2, and 3 - Had painful diabetic polyneuropathy of 3 or more months
             duration

          -  At Site 1 only - Had clinical signs and symptoms of distal predominantly sensory
             polyneuropathy of 3 or more months duration. Diagnosis of predominantly sensory
             polyneuropathy were to be confirmed by either nerve conduction studies (large fiber
             sensory or sensorimotor axonal neuropathy) or by abnormal epidermal innervations on
             punch skin biopsy (distal leg/proximal thigh) (Herrmann et al., 1999; Holland et al.,
             1997)

          -  Had an average daily pain rating for the baseline week of pain ratings equal to 4 or
             greater on the 0 to 10 numerical pain rating scale

          -  Had at least 2 hours of moderate or severe pain intensity due to polyneuropathy daily
             in the immediately prior 3-month period

          -  Were using stable analgesic drug therapy for at least 1 week (regimen and dosages)
             prior to screening visit, with the exception of acetaminophen and lidocaine for
             patients undergoing a punch skin biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had prior treatment with topical lidocaine, except for use with the punch skin biopsy
             procedure

          -  Were currently under treatment with Class I antiarrhythmic agents (such as tocainide
             and mexiletine)

          -  Had any other pain more severe than the painful diabetic or idiopathic neuropathy

          -  Had open skin lesions in the area where the lidocaine patches were to be applied
