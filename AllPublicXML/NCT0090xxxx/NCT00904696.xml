  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder
      characterised by abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and alterations in bowel function. This
      condition significantly impairs quality of life and places a large burden on health care
      resources. Existing therapies for IBS are far from being satisfactory and new therapies are
      being constantly sought.

      The pathogenesis of IBS remains unclear. Imbalance in the intestinal microbiota is considered
      to be one important etiologic factor for IBS. That some probiotics are effective in the
      prevention and treatment of IBS supports this idea.

      Progut is a synbiotic: a combination of probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are viable
      beneficial bacteria that are normally present in a healthy digestive tract. Each capsule of
      Progut contains 9 billion viable bacteria from 8 different strains that are characteristics
      of a healthy normal gut microflora: Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. lactis, and
      L. bulgaricus); Bifidobacterium (B. longum, B. infantis and B. bifidum); and Streptococcus
      thermophilus at time of manufacturing. To ensure survival of these bacteria, Progut is
      encapsulated and enteric-coated.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the tolerability of Progut treatment 1-3 capsules/day in
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome under the same conditions as those likely to be
      encountered in a standard general clinical practice or outpatient clinic.

      The rationale for this study is to obtain tolerability data in patients with IBS in the
      Singapore. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the patients' satisfaction and symptom
      improvement with Progut treatment.

      This will be an open-label, single arm post marketing surveillance study involving an active
      treatment period of a minimum 3-week and a maximum 12-week duration. Treatment with Progut
      will be at the discretion of the attending doctor and decision is independent of this study.
      This study will only recruit patients following the prescription of Progut and follow them up
      for upto a maximum of 12 weeks.

      At Visit 1 (Day 1), the eligible patients will receive a prescription for Progut from their
      physician. Depending on the discretion of the attending physician, they will be prescribed
      Progut for treatment duration lasting 3 to 12 weeks. Safety of Progut under normal clinical
      use will be assessed at the end of this period. Perception of effectiveness, and tolerability
      of treatment will be assessed on Day 8-15 using a phone interview. On Visit 2 (any time
      between Day 22 to 85, depending on duration of treatment given and schedule of their
      follow-up visit arranged by the attending physician), the patient will be evaluated for
      symptomatic improvement, perception of effectiveness, tolerability and satisfaction with
      treatment, following which he/she will formally exit the study.

      This study design was chosen with the aim of recruiting rapidly a large cohort of patients
      representative of the population being prescribed Progut. A total of 50 patients will be
      included to allow for an assessment of patient's tolerability of Progut, as well as
      satisfaction and perception of effectiveness and symptom response in the Singapore
      population.

        The study subjects will be patients aged 18 years and older, diagnosed with IBS by their
        own physicians, and determined to be eligible to receive a prescription for Progut. In
        addition, they must satisfy the inclusion criteria stated below, be able to communicate
        well, provide written informed consent required by local regulations and willing to
        participate in the entire study.
