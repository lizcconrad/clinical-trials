      Subjects will be randomized to receive AR-12286 Ophthalmic Solution 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.25% or
      its vehicle (one eye), q.d. (AM) x 7 days, then q.d. (PM) x 7 days, then b.i.d. x 7 days. The
      first dose will be administered in the clinic. Ocular safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy
      will be evaluated in the clinic throughout this period.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or greater.

          2. Diagnosis of open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). Unmedicated
             (post-washout, if required) IOP &gt;= 24 mm Hg in one or both eyes at 08:00 hours, &gt;= 21
             mm Hg at 10:00, 12:00 and 16:00 hours on post-washout measurement (Visit 1).

          3. Corrected visual acuity in each eye +1.0 logMAR (logarithm mininum angle of
             resolution) or better by ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) in each
             eye (equivalent to 20/200).

          4. Able and willing to give signed informed consent and follow study instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Either eye

          1. Intraocular pressure &gt; 36 mm Hg

          2. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or to topical anesthetics,
             (benzalkonium chloride, etc.)

          3. Ocular trauma within the past six months, or ocular surgery or laser treatment within
             the past three months.

          4. History or evidence of ocular infection inflammation, or of herpes simplex keratitis,
             or clinically significant blepharitis or conjunctivitis at baseline (Visit 1)..

          5. Contact lens wear within 30 minutes of instillation of study medication.

          6. Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of Visit 2, with the exception of a)
             ocular hypotensive medications (which must be washed out according to the provided
             schedule), b) lid scrubs (which may be used prior to, but not after Visit 2) or c)
             lubricating drops for dry eye (which may be used throughout the study),

          7. Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. corneal edema, uveitis, severe
             keratoconjunctivitis sicca) which might interfere with the study, including
             glaucomatous damage so severe that washout of ocular hypotensive medications for one
             month is not judged safe (i.e., cup-disc ratio &gt; 0.8).

          8. Central corneal thickness greater than 600 microns.

          9. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

             Study eye:

         10. Glaucoma: pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component, history of angle closure.

             Note: Previous laser peripheral iridotomy is acceptable.

         11. Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or laser procedures in study eye(s).

         12. Refractive surgery in study eye(s) (e.g., radial keratotomy, PRK (photorefractive
             keratectomy), LASIK (Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis), etc.).

             General/Systemic:

         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests at screening (See Appendix
             1).

         14. Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, myasthenia
             gravis, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular or endocrine disorders) which might interfere
             with the study.

         15. Participation in any investigational study within the past 30 days.

         16. Changes of systemic medication during the study that could have a substantial effect
             on IOP within 30 days prior to screening, or anticipated during the study.

         17. Due to status of preclinical safety program, women of childbearing potential who are
             pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically acceptable form of
             birth control. An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she
             is one year post-menopausal or three months post-surgical sterilization. All females
             of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the
             screening examination and must not intend to become pregnant during the study.
