    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, non-randomized, non-controlled, phase II, clinical trial for
      treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients, younger than 66 years.

      Trial is based on:

        -  INDUCTION: FLAI + Gemtuzumab-Ozogamicin (FLAI-GO).

        -  CONSOLIDATION: Intermediate dose AraC + IDA (IDAC+IDA) +/- one course of high dose AraC
           (HDAC)

        -  INTENSIFICATION: Allo-BMT, ASCT

        -  MAINTENANCE: AraC

           a) Primary endpoints:

        -  Feasibility, Efficacy (CR+PR rate) and Toxicity of FLAI + Gemtuzumab-Ozogamicin.

        -  RFS, DFS and OS.

           b) Secondary endpoints:

        -  Evaluation of Minimal Residual Disease by WT1 (and other biologic markers) expression
           and monitoring.

        -  Evaluation of prognostic clinical relevance of biological features at onset.

        -  Feasibility and outcome of consolidation with BMT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-65 years.

          -  WHO PS grade 0-2 (Appendix B) or Karnofsky &gt; 70.

          -  AML according to the new WHO criteria, i.e., % of BM blasts ≥ 20%. NB. this % should
             be assessed on a BM aspiration or on a BM biopsy

          -  All FAB subtypes except M3.

          -  CD33 positivity (&gt; 20%). It is mandatory to perform an immunotyping of the BM blasts
             in particular the determination of CD33 positivity, which will be used as a inclusion
             factor.

          -  Previously untreated (except ≤ 14 days of Hydroxyurea) primary or secondary AML
             (including AML after MDS).

          -  Adequate renal and liver function, i.e., creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl and bilirubin, ALT/AST ≤
             3 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia.

          -  AML supervening after other myeloproliferative diseases.

          -  AML de novo or secondary previously pretreated.

          -  Concomitant malignant disease.

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

          -  Active uncontrolled infection [NB severe systemic infection should be excluded].

          -  Concomitant severe cardiovascular disease, i.e., arrhythmias requiring chronic
             treatment, congestive heart failure or symptomatic ischemic heart disease.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction of 50% or less.

          -  Severe pulmonary dysfunction (CTC grade 3-4).

          -  Severe concomitant neurological or psychiatric disease.

          -  History of alcohol abuse.

          -  HIV positivity.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Man and woman not agreeing to the adequate contraceptive precautions during study
             period and for at last 24 months after stop of therapy.

          -  Any psychological, familiar, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.
