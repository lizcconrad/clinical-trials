  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out what factors may be related to the risk of getting a
      second breast cancer among women who already have breast cancer in one breast. It will look
      at how genes, treatment for breast cancer; including radiation therapy, and the effects of
      different lifestyle activities, may affect the risk of breast cancer. It will use different
      processes to find genes that might increase the risk of breast cancer. The results of this
      study may help to develop better ways to detect, treat and prevent breast cancer. This study
      will compare women who have breast cancer in both breasts to women who have breast cancer in
      only one breast.

      This study expands upon an existing case-control study we call the Women's Environment Cancer
      and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. For simplicity, in this protocol, we will refer to
      that study as the &quot;parent&quot; study. The goal of both studies is to examine the interaction of
      radiation exposure and genetic susceptibility factors in the etiology of breast cancer. A
      subset of study participants who consented to 'future contact' in the GWA Study (and those in
      the 'parent' study from selected sites) will be included in an analysis of radiation-related
      heart disease and related conditions.

    <description>Take part in an approximately 45 minute telephone interview, with questions about detailed treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy (RT)) for all study participants. Their medical records will be reviewed to get further details about treatment of their breast cancer. They donate either a 35 ml blood sample (about 3 tablespoons) or a saliva sample. Blood Sample: if patient consents to give a blood sample, following the interview, they will be contacted by our staff phlebotomist (a person trained to draw blood). A scheduled appointment to draw a blood sample from you at your home. At the time of the blood draw, the phlebotomist will collect approximately 2 and 1/3 tablespoons of blood. Saliva Sample: if they choose not to give a blood sample, but consent to give a saliva sample instead, a saliva kit will be sent to there home. Once they provide the sample in the kit, they will be asked to mail back the sample in the pre-labeled kit that was sent to them.</description>
