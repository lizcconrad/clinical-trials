      The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of CDSS by knowing the prescribers
      actions to the CDSS, also the influence of prescribing error announced by pharmacists.

      1. To assess the sensitivity of the CDSS which could identify some specific prescribing
           errors (ex: duplication of drugs, dosage that exceed the maximum dose,prescribes drugs
           that have drug-drug interactions).

        2. To identify what kind of drugs are most likely to cause duplication use by the
           physicians, and what kind of drugs are most likely to exceed the maximum dosage, also to
           know what kind of drugs are most likely to cause drug-drug interaction that physicians
           encounter during prescribing.

        3. To evaluate the percentage of physician acceptance of the prescribing errors identify by
           the CDSS.

        4. What's the impact of CDSS on pharmacist announced prescribing error.
