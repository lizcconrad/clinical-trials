      Title of Study: Sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in biopsy proven node
      positive breast cancer.

      Objectives of the study:

      Primary objective

      1. Evaluate the accuracy of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients presenting with
      positive nodal disease, proven by ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration, following
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Secondary objectives

        1. Evaluate the technical success of sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy.

        2. Evaluate the accuracy of clinical examination and ultrasound examination of the axilla
           in identifying the presence of residual disease in the axilla following neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy in biopsy proven node positive breast cancer patients.

      Number of patients:

      N = 300

      Population:

      Patients with unresected breast cancer that are eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy that
      present with biopsy proven positive axillary nodes.

      Study duration:

      From February 2009 to February 2012 - 3 years

    <description>Sentinel node biopsy is a technique in which a radioactive isotope is injected in the breast, with or without blue dye. These substances will then migrate and concentrate in the first nodes in the axilla that drain the breast: The sentinel nodes. These nodes (usually one to four nodes) are then evaluated for the presence of cancer cells.</description>

        Conditions for patient eligibility

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients must be female.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients with stage IIA, IIB, IIIA (T1-3 and N1-2) breast cancer. Clinical N0 accepted
             if biopsy proven node disease.

          -  Patients that have biopsy proven positive axillary disease made by core needle biopsy
             or fine needle aspiration .

          -  Patients that accept to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy; patients are eligible until
             the day of surgery.

          -  Patients with bilateral breast cancer are eligible. Sentinel node biopsy is allowed on
             the contralateral breast if there is no disease in the axilla prior to chemotherapy.

          -  Patients that understand, accept and have signed the approved consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  Patient with stage IIIB, IIIC or IV breast cancer (T4 and N3) Patients with clinical
             N3 disease are excluded.

          -  Patients that have had previous axillary dissection or an axillary sentinel node
             biopsy; (patients that have had excisional biopsy or ipsilateral tumorectomy are
             eligible).

          -  Patients that have had previous radiotherapy to the axillary nodes

          -  Patients that have had mammary reduction

          -  Patients that are medically unfit to receive chemotherapy, as evaluated by the
             treating physician.

          -  If the injection of blue dye is planned, patients with hypersensitivity or allergy to
             isosulfan blue, Patent blue or methylene blue or radiocolloid dye are ineligible.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding .

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that preclude the patient from
             meeting the study requirements.
