  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the progression-free survival [PFS] at 36
      months for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who achieve a complete metabolic response as
      demonstrated by a negative fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scan after one cycle of ABVD
      (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) who undergo abbreviated ABVD chemotherapy
      (3 cycles).

      The proposed study is based on the repeated demonstration that patients with Hodgkin lymphoma
      who attain a negative PET scan early in therapy (after one or 2 cycles of chemotherapy) have
      a uniformly excellent outcome, with long term disease free survival of 90-95%. We propose to
      abbreviate chemotherapy in those patients showing a complete metabolic response as measured
      by FDG-PET after one cycle of ABVD. These patients will undergo two more cycles of ABVD
      chemotherapy, for a total of 3 cycles. Those patients failing to achieve a complete metabolic
      response as demonstrated by residual FDG avidity will go off study and be treated as per
      their primary treating physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented classical Hodgkin lymphoma according to the WHO
             Classification. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is excluded

          -  No prior treatment (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) for Hodgkin lymphoma

          -  Measurable disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies.
             Any tumor mass measurable in two dimensions and &gt; 2 cm is acceptable (or 1.5 cm if 0.5
             cm slices are used as in spiral CT scans)

          -  Age â‰¥ 18

          -  Patients must have at least one hypermetabolic lesion identifiable on initial PET scan

          -  LVEF by ECHO or MUGA within institutional normal limits

          -  Initial laboratory data should be compatible with the administration of standard doses
             of ABVD chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has no known HIV infection

          -  Patient is non-pregnant and non-lactating. Due to the teratogenic potential of the
             agents used in this study, pregnant or nursing women may not be enrolled. Women and
             men of reproductive potential should agree to use an effective means of birth control

          -  No other history of lymphoproliferative disorder or granulomatous disease
