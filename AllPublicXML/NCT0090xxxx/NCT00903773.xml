  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of severe renal impairment or failure
      on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of telaprevir (TVR). Pharmacokinetics means how the drug
      is absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body. In
      addition, the effect of severe renal impairment on the total and unbound plasma
      concentrations of the sum of TVR and its R-diastereomer VRT-127394 will be assessed.
      (Diastereomers are substances whose chemical structures are mirror images of each other).
      Finally, the short-term safety and tolerability of TVR in participants with severe kidney
      disease will be determined. The results of this study will guide dose recommendations for TVR
      in subjects with kidney disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label trial to investigate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of
      telaprevir (TVR) in 12 participants with severe renal impairment (defined as creatinine
      clearance (CrCl) &lt; 30 mL/min) as compared to 12 participants with normal renal function,
      matched for sex, race, age (± 10 years) and BMI (± 20%). Open-label means that the study
      doctor and the participants know what treatment will be assigned to them. All participants
      will receive a single 750-mg dose of TVR. Pharmacokinetic profiles of total TVR up to 24
      hours postdose will be determined. A 24 hour urine collection test will be performed to
      estimate the CrCl. In addition, the effect of severe renal impairment on the total and
      unbound plasma concentrations of the sum of TVR and VRT-127394 will be assessed. Tolerability
      and safety of TVR will be assessed throughout the trial period. Illnesses and side effects
      will be checked at every visit. Blood and urine samples will be taken at screening, on Day 1,
      2 and at the 2 follow-up visits. ECG and vital signs will be taken at screening, twice on day
      1, on day 2 and at the first follow-up visit. At the second follow-up visit vital signs alone
      will be determined. A physical examination will be done at screening, on the day before TVR
      intake, on day 2 and at both follow-up visits. All participants will receive a single 750-mg
      dose of telaprevir (TVR) given by mouth as 2 tablets of 375 mg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males are allowed and females of childbearing potential if adequate contraception is
             used. Females of non-childbearing potential should be amenorrheal for at least 2
             years, or have undergone tubal ligation (or other permanent birth control methods), or
             hysterectomy (total), or oophorectomy (bilateral)

          -  For participants with severe renal impairment: consistent with the disease process of
             chronic renal failure and associated symptoms, otherwise judged to be in good health
             in the opinion of the investigator on the basis of a medical evaluation (including a
             physical examination, medical history, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and
             screening laboratory tests), with any concomitant medical conditions under stable
             medical control
