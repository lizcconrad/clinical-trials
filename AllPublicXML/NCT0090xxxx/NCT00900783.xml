    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two doses of FV-100 to
      valacyclovir in patients with herpes zoster, or shingles. FV-100 has shown to be very potent
      in cells infected with varicella zoster virus, the virus that causes shingles. The study
      objectives include:

        -  Compare the safety of FV-100 to valacyclovir

        -  Compare the effect of FV-100, as compared to valacyclovir, on shingles pain

        -  Compare the effect of FV-100, as compared to valacyclovir, on shingles lesions

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women ≥ 50 years of age

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of HZ as evidenced by a unilateral dermatomal rash

          -  Patients with zoster-related pain (ZBPI worst pain score &gt; 0)

          -  Patients able to be enrolled into the study ≤ 72 hours from appearance of rash (i.e.,
             lesions or vesicles)

          -  Patients providing written informed consent

          -  Patients who are able to complete all study visits per protocol

          -  Men and premenopausal women must agree to practice a barrier method of birth control

          -  Patients with multidermatomal or disseminated HZ (i.e., &gt; 20 vesicles beyond the
             dermatomes adjacent to the primarily involved dermatome)

          -  Patients with HZ ophthalmicus, defined as cutaneous lesions in the dermatome
             associated with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve

          -  Patients with history of impaired renal function, (e.g., calculated creatinine
             clearance &lt;50 mL/min/1.73 m2)

          -  Patients taking narcotic analgesic routinely for a chronic pain condition

          -  Patients taking tricyclic antidepressants

          -  Patients who have received systemic antivirals with activity against VZV within the
             past 30 days, or a topical antiviral to treat their current HZ

          -  Patients who are immunosuppressed from:

               -  disease (e.g., malignancy [present or remission &lt; 5 years], HIV)

               -  corticosteroid use (except intermittent or topical/inhaled beclomethasone
                  dipropionate or equivalent &lt; 800 mcg/day), or

               -  other immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (cancer chemotherapy or organ
                  transplantation)

          -  Patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction that could interfere with drug absorption

          -  Patients with any other condition (e.g., extensive psoriasis, chronic pain syndrome,
             cognitive impairment) that, in the opinion of the site investigator, might interfere
             with the evaluations required by the study

          -  Patients who are not ambulatory (bed-ridden or homebound); hospitalized patients may
             be enrolled if they are ambulatory and able to complete the study requirements

          -  Patients with history of allergy to valacyclovir hydrochloride

          -  Patients unlikely to adhere to protocol follow-up

          -  14. Subjects taking strong CYP3A4-inhibiting protease inhibitors (specifically
             including atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir), strong CYP3A4
             inhibitors (specifically including clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole,
             nefazodone, telithromycin) and all strong CYP3A4 inducers (specifically including
             rifampin, efavirenz, etravirine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine)
