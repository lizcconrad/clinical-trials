  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of inhaled anesthetic drugs upon
      diastolic heart function (heart suction and filling performance) in patients who are
      undergoing coronary bypass surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic heart dysfunction is a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity and is the
      cause of symptomatic heart failure in approximately one half of patients who are admitted to
      hospitals with heart failure symptoms. However, diastolic heart function remains difficult to
      measure objectively without cardiac catheterization. Diastolic heart dysfunction is also
      common among patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Despite the
      ubiquitous use of inhaled volatile drugs to maintain anesthesia in these patients, their
      effects upon diastolic heart function remain unclear.
