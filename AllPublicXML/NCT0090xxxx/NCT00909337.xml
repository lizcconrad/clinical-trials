  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise-induced increase of the pulmonary arterial pressure may be an early sign of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension. It has been shown that patients with normal pulmonary
      arterial pressure at rest but elevated pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise have a
      decreased exercise-capacity and may have a worse prognosis compared to patients with normal
      pulmonary arterial pressure values at rest and during exercise. According to the currently
      used definition pulmonary hypertension can be diagnosed if the mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure is higher than 25mmHg at rest or 30mmHg during exercise. In this study patients with
      a risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (connective tissue disease) and increased
      pulmonary arterial pressure values during exercise are receiving a therapy with a dual
      endothelin receptor antagonist - bosentan, a therapy established for pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. The therapy effect is than compared to the recorded changes before the
      introduction of this therapy.

    <textblock>
      Bosentan is an established therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which may be diagnosed
      when the mean pulmonary arterial pressure is &gt;25mmHg at rest or &gt;30mmHg at exercise. Bosentan
      has shown efficacy, if mean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated at rest. However, there
      are no data available of the effects of such a therapy, if the mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure is normal at rest but elevated during exercise. The purpose of this study is to
      provide additional data on this group of patients. Our hypothesis is that patients with
      exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension may show a gradual worsening of pulmonary
      hemodynamics and potentially a development of manifest pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (elevated resting pulmonary arterial pressure values) without treatment, while the
      introduction of Bosentan may improve hemodynamics and exercise capacity in this patient
      group.

    <description>In this study, all participants have normal pulmonary arterial pressure at rest and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise. First, they were followed up for a year and were controlled after 1 year without specific therapy for pulmonary hypertension. Then Bosentan was introduced. A second control showing the effects of the therapy was done after 6 months. The changes in the &quot;therapy period&quot; can be compared with the changes in the &quot;follow up period&quot;.</description>
