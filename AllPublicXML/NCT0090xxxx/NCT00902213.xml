  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first multidisciplinary, randomized, longitudinal trial of a tailored,
      parent- and child-focused physical activity program for children (ages 4- &lt;19 years) with
      newly diagnosed ALL. It will test the ability of the intervention to prevent or diminish
      early physical function limitations and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL). The
      intervention will be tested for its effect on: 1) physical function outcomes (muscle
      strength, range of motion, endurance, gross motor skills), bone density and bone mineral
      content (end of therapy only); and 2) HRQL. This multi-site trial will test the intervention
      in 76 evaluable children with ALL (38 receiving the intervention and 38 receiving a placebo
      &quot;minimal movement&quot; standard care strategy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An advanced practice nurse (APN) will meet twice weekly with the patient and family for the
      first 4 weeks of the intervention to initiate the motivation-based dialogue and therapeutic
      interaction; this will be followed by once weekly visits during weeks 5-8 of the
      intervention; and monthly visits during weeks 9-through end of therapy. The physical
      therapist (PT) will meet at least once weekly with the patient and family during weeks 1-4 to
      initiate the prescriptive tailored exercise program; subsequent visits to reinforce and
      modify the program will occur at least once every other week during weeks 5-8, and at least
      once monthly during weeks 9-135 of the intervention. The PT will visit at least once weekly
      during weeks 1-4, at least once every other week during weeks 5-8, and at least once monthly
      during weeks 9-135. During weeks 9-135 of the intervention, the APN will call between the
      monthly in person-visits, if needed to those randomized to the MAP group to assure fidelity
      to the intervention and to provide booster support to the intervention where needed.
