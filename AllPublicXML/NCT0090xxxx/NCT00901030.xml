    <textblock>
      This study will examine the degree of blood thinning (platelet function) in patients coming
      for non-cardiac surgery on antiplatelet agents using platelet function tests called
      thromboelastography (TEG) and platelet mapping assay (PMA) and major cardiac complications
      that occur any time after surgery (perioperative).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have had stents in their coronary arteries (PCI) have to stay on antiplatelet
      agents to prevent clotting of their stents. These patients often require non-cardiac surgery
      (NCS) at some stage after their PCI. The rate of major cardiac complications (MACE)in this
      population is very high and it is unclear why they are at higher risk than the general
      population. It is possible their antiplatelet is not adequate, or that surgery causes them to
      be more clot prone. This is a prospective, multicentre observational study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients between ages 30-85 years old, receiving post-PCI aspirin and/or clopidogrel
             therapy

          -  patients undergoing non-ambulatory, NCS

          -  patients will have received a bare metal coronary stent within the last 12 months or a
             drug eluting stent at any time prior to their NCS

          -  the type of surgery has to be such that there are no contra-indictions to remain on an
             anti-platelet agent

          -  surgeon must agree to keep the patient on at least one anti-platelet agent during the
             perioperative period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  clotting abnormalities

          -  drugs affecting platelet function other than aspirin or clopidogrel

          -  moderate renal impairment

          -  liver dysfunction with co-existing thrombocytopenia
