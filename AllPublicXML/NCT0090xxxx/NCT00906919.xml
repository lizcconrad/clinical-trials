    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if greater effectiveness can be
      achieved by the addition of lay-led self-management patient education to regular
      professionally-led diabetes patient education in comparison to regular professionally-led
      diabetes patient education only.

    <textblock>
      In the current health care environment, it is unacceptable for patient education programs to
      merely provide information. Rather, educational programs must concentrate on behavior change
      and on supporting patients to become more confident and motivated in participating in
      managing their health. Persons with type 2 diabetes attending a Diabetes Education Centre
      will be assigned to either a group that receives regular professionally-led diabetes patient
      education (control group) or to to a group that receives regular professionally-led diabetes
      patient education augmented by lay-led self-management education i.e., the Stanford
      six-session Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (experimental group). Data will be
      collected at two points in time (0 and 6 months). Outcome measures will show if participants
      who receive self-management training in addition to regular patient education are able
      to:manage their diabetes more effectively; engage in the specific behaviors that keep the
      condition from worsening; achieve more control over their condition; and use the health care
      system more effectively.
