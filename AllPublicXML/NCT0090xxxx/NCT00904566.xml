  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using gene-expression profiling, Van't Veer and colleagues developed a 70-gene prognosis
      profile, MammaPrint, to identify breast cancer patients who are at low risk of developing
      distant metastases and therefore might safely be spared chemotherapy. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the prognostic value of the 70-gene Mammaprint profile in Japanese women with
      node-negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frozen tumor samples from 140 node-negative, breast cancer patients aged between 29 and 70
      years at diagnosis are hybridized on MammaPrint array. Patients were treated with breast
      conserving therapy or mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection between December 1998
      and August 2001 at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases. Samples are
      evaluated by gene expression profiling for the 70-gene MammaPrint profile and classified as
      genomic high risk or genomic low risk.
