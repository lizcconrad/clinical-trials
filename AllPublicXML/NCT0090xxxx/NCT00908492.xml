      The purpose of this study is to pilot the home Environmental Skill-Building Program (ESP) and
      an educational control intervention with persons with dementia and their caregivers (n=40) in
      preparation for a larger double-blind randomized controlled trial. Caregivers of persons with
      dementia often deal with difficult behaviors. The ESP is an occupational therapy intervention
      that helps caregivers adapt to their environment and build care-giving skills. The areas
      addressed include changes to the home set-up, adaptive equipment, instruction in strategies
      of problem-solving, energy conservation, safe task performance, and fall recovery techniques.
      A trial is needed with methodological rigor and to determine if the intervention is feasible
      in the Canadian health care system. Results will contribute to understanding how caregivers
      and people with dementia can be supported in their home environments.

    <description>The ESP intervention addresses home modifications and training in their use, instruction in strategies of problem-solving, energy conservation, safe task performance, fall recovery techniques, and balance and muscle strength training. Intervention is individualized for target areas identified in the initial client assessment and caregiver interview. The intervention involves using a problem solving approach and client-centred focus and the intervention assessment tools are individualized measures which determine the goals identified by the caregiver. It involves 5 visits over 6 months.</description>
