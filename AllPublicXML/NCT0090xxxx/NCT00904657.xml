      The study is conducted:

        -  to investigate the influence of sunitinib (study drug) on the plasma biomarkers VEGF-A,
           VEGF-C, soluble VEGFR-2, and soluble VEGFR-3 (vessel endothelial growth factors) and on
           the blood pressure;

        -  to generate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for sunitinib using biomarkers.
