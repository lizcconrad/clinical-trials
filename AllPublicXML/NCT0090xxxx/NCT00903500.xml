  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention consists of an individual counseling session, telephone counseling (7
      calls), given by a psychologist, and a pedometer. The intervention is based on cognitive
      behavioral therapy, the Diabetes Prevention Program, the first Step Program and Motivational
      Interviewing. The taxonomy of behavior change techniques is also taken into account. The
      duration of the intervention is six months. The individual session takes place one week after
      the baseline measurements, together with the participants' follow-up appointment with their
      endocrinologist. The individual session takes place at the endocrinology department and is
      expected to last approximately 30 minutes. In addition to the session, the participants of
      the intervention group receive a pedometer and a pedometer diary for six months. Participants
      of the intervention group also receive telephone counseling from the psychologist during 24
      weeks. They receive a call every two weeks for four weeks and then every four weeks for the
      next 20 weeks, good for a total of seven counseling calls. The calls are expected to last
      approximately 20 minutes. The Control Group has no intervention at all and receive their
      usual care.
