  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if BhCG testing to determine the completion of
      medical abortion simplifies the medical abortion protocol. Investigators hypothesize that
      women randomized to ultrasonographic determination of completion of medical abortion will
      have MORE follow-up visits/interventions beyond standard protocol than those randomized to
      medical abortion follow-up with serum BhCG.

      The investigators also hope to explore satisfaction with BhCG based follow-up among women
      seeking medical abortion. Investigators hypothesize that the majority of women who choose to
      follow-up with serum BhCG will be satisfied with this method of medical abortion follow-up.
