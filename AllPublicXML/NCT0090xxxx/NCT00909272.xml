      Can an ultrasound machine be used to perform a diagnostic lumbar medial branch block?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic lumbar medial branch block for low back and radiating to lower extremity due
      to lumbar facet joint pain has been traditionally done under fluoroscopic guidance. Some
      recent studies have shown that the diagnostic lumbar medial branch may alternatively be done
      under ultrasound guidance. This proposed technique has many advantages, avoid radiation
      exposure and decrease waiting period for patients to have a pain procedure for low back pain.
      The time taken, patients' satisfaction score, pain score, the distance the needle tip placed
      under ultrasound and the ideal position visualized under fluoroscopy will be measured. This
      study will be done in 2 parts. The first part will determine landmarks for ultrasound. It
      will involve using 5 cadavers. The second part of the study will involve 25 patients. The
      needles will be placed initially with ultrasound and then will be verified with C-arm
      fluoroscopy. Certain criteria will be used to determine its feasibility, for example, less
      than 20 minutes, less than 5 mm.

    <description>The ultrasound probe will be placed perpendicular to skin along the midline of lumbar spinous process on longitudinal view first to count the lumbar level. The midpoint of each lumbar level will be marked on the longitudinal view and then will be rotated ninety degrees counter clockwise to axial view to locate the facet joint and the transverse process of lumbar spine. A #22 gauge 10cm long Quincke spinal needle will be inserted to the target area using in plane approach on the axial view. Then the probe will be rotated ninety degrees clockwise to longitudinal view to ensure needle tip is placed on the cephalad aspect of the transverse process. It will then be immediately confirmed by C-arm fluoroscopy on oblique view.</description>

    <description>The target point is the superior medial aspect of transverse process of lumbar spine from L3 to S1. A #22 gauge 10cm long Quincke spinal needle will be use for needle placement. Needle placement will be visualized with ultrasound. Practice on cadavers with 3 different operators and see if results are reproducible. Verify with fluoroscopy.</description>
