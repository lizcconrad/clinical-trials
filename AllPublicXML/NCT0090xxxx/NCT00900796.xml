      The objective of this observational study is to determine the incidence of response in
      patients with predictive factors of major clinical response in active ankylosing spondylitis
      (AS) in patients who start anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy and correlate these
      findings in patients who switch from one to another anti-TNF due to inefficacy under usual
      clinical practice conditions in Spain.
