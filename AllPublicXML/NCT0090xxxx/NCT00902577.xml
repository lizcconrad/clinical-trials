  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well positron emission tomography (PET) scan using
      18F-fluoromisonidazole works when given together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ) in
      assessing tumor hypoxia in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
      Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI and PET scan using 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO), may
      help predict the response of the tumor to the treatment and allow doctors to plan better
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association of baseline FMISO PET uptake (hypoxic volume [HV]), highest
      tumor:blood ratio [T/Bmax]) and MRI parameters (Ktrans, CBV) with overall survival (OS) in
      participants with newly diagnosed GBM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association of baseline FMISO PET uptake (HV, T/Bmax) and MRI parameters
      (Ktrans, CBV) with time to progression (TTP) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6) in
      participants with newly diagnosed GBM.

      II. To assess the reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET uptake parameters by implementing
      baseline &quot;test&quot; and &quot;retest&quot; PET scans (performed within 1 to 7 days of each other).

      III. To assess the correlation between highest tissue:cerebellum ratio [T/Cmax] and T/Bmax at
      baseline.

      IV. To assess the correlation between other MRI parameters (T1Gd, VCI, CBV-S, ADC, NAA-Cho,
      BOLD, T2) and OS, TTP, and PFS-6.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Two weeks before initiation of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide, patients undergo MRI and
      PET scan using FMISO. A subset of 15 patients undergo FMISO PET scans approximately 1 week
      before chemoradiotherapy. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during
      study to compare image measures of tissue uptake of FMISO to blood concentrations. Tumor
      samples are collected from diagnostic biopsy or surgery for analysis of tumor hypoxic markers
      and methylguanine methyl transferase by immunohistochemical and PCR assays.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years.

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years after completion of study</time_frame>
    <description>The number of pixels in the tumor volume with a T/B ratio &gt; 1.2, indicating hypoxia, is multiplied by the known volume/voxel for the scanner to yield milliliter units to measure the HV. T/Bmax is the pixel in the tumor region with the maximum T/B (tumor:blood) ratio. HV depicts the volume of tumor that has crossed the threshold for hypoxia and T/Bmax depicts the magnitude of the hypoxia. Uni-variate analysis will be carried out for each parameter individually. Any parameter that has achieved statistical significance (P =&lt; 0.05) will be included in the multi-variate Cox model.</description>

    <description>Cox-regression model will be used to study the relationship between TTP and baseline FMISO PET uptake and MRI parameters. Logistic regression model will be used to study the relationship between PFS-6 and baseline FMISO PET uptake and MRI parameters. Uni-variate analysis will be carried out for each parameter individually. Any parameter that has achieved statistical significance (P=&lt; 0.05) will be included.

    <description>Other MRI parameters include: initial size of the lesion measured on T1 post Gd images [T1Gd], vessel caliber index [VCI], small vessel CBV, apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], values measured from MR spectroscopy such as NAA-Cho ratio, changes in BOLD signal with transient exposure to hyperoxia, and T2 lesion volume.

    <description>The reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET will be quantified through intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) which is defined as the ratio of σb^2 and (σb^2+ σc^2) where σb^2 is the variance of measurements between participants and σc^2 is the variance of measurements within participants.
For a subset of 15 participants who enroll in the test-retest substudy only. Patients must be scanned using the same ACRIN-approved PET scanner used for trial qualification, using the same protocol-specific parameters consistently at each time point.</description>
