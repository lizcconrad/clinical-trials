  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a double-blind, placebo controlled pilot study of HD, PD, and DLB
      subjects with sleep disturbances. This study is designed to determine the effects of 4 weeks
      Ramelteon treatment on the sleep patterns of people with basal ganglia disorders such as HD,
      PD and DLB. The study also aims to look at the sleep patterns of caregivers of people with
      HD, PD and DLB.

    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressively degenerative brain disorder, which results in a
      loss of mental and physical abilities. It is genetically determined and people carrying the
      HD gene invariably develop the clinical disorder at some point in their lives. HD symptoms
      consist of neuropsychiatric changes and motor movements. Once present, the symptoms are
      progressive in nature and eventually fatal. Currently there is no cure for HD.

      Like HD, Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) are also
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting the basal ganglia. PD and DLB are synucleinopathies -
      i.e., they are associated with dysfunction of the protein alpha-synuclein. Unlike HD, PD and
      DLB are not inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

      Sleep/wake cycles in HD, PD and DLB. HD patients, especially those in moderate to severe
      stages of the disease, frequently complain of difficulty falling and staying asleep. Little
      is known about the phenomenology and pathophysiology of sleep disturbances in HD. The few
      studies that have addressed this issue of sleep in HD have found disturbances in sleep
      architecture and sleep/wake cycles. Overall, the literature on sleep and other circadian
      disturbances in HD is very limited. If sleep/wake cycle disturbances in HD have
      pathophysiological mechanisms similar to other neurodegenerative disorders, then Ramelteon, a
      hypnotic agent and melatonin receptor agonist, may be beneficial in sleep/wake cycle
      disturbances in HD.

      Sleep disruptions and circadian sleep disruptions are integral to the clinical presentation
      of both PD and DLB. As is true in HD, sleep disturbances in PD and DLB cause severe
      disruption to the patients and their caregivers' lives. In PD, sleep dysfunction occurs in
      approximately two thirds of patients. Sleep problems range from difficulty with sleep
      initiation, sleep fragmentation, disturbance of circadian rhythm, REM sleep behavior disorder
      (RBD), to excessive daytime sleepiness. Frequent nighttime awakening and sleep disruption are
      the most common sleep problems in PD. In DLB, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) occurs years
      to decades before the onset of dementia. Importantly, melatonin is one of the main treatments
      used for RBD. Therefore, a melatonin agonist such as Ramelteon is a natural choice for the
      treatment of circadian sleep disturbances in PD and DLB.

      Activity monitors (actigraphs) have been used as an alternative to polysomnography (PSG).
      Actigraphs are small electronic motion sensors that detect movements in three axes and
      provide information about the subjects' activity levels over periods of days to weeks. Using
      validated algorithms to infer wakefulness and sleep, investigators can draw conclusions about
      the individuals' sleep/wake cycle patterns from their activity patterns.

        We will recruit 24 Huntington's disease, Parkinson's Disease, or Dementia with Lewy Bodies
        subjects. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, we expect that 20 of the 24 subjects who
        initially enroll will complete the study.

        Inclusion criteria will be the following:

          -  Subjects with HD will be between the ages of 20 and 65 years old;

          -  Subjects with PD or DLB will be between the ages of 40 and 90;

          -  Subjects will have subjective complaints of sleeping problems or their caregivers will
             complain of the subjects not sleeping well

          -  Subjects with all severity of HD, PD, and DLB symptoms will be accepted as long as
             they complain of sleep problems

          -  A diagnosis of HD, PD, or DLB. For HD patients, a positive HD gene status for everyone
             except the caregivers will have been obtained for clinical reasons and will be known
             at the time of enrollment into the study. PD patients will have a clinical diagnosis
             of PD. DLB patients will have a diagnosis of possible or probably DLB based on
             consensus criteria (outlined in McKeith et al., 2005).

          -  Subjects will be willing and able to participate in the informed consent process.

        Exclusion criteria will be the following:

          -  Subjects who are unable to participate in the informed consent process

          -  Subjects with previously documented primary sleep disorders (unrelated to HD, PD, or
             DLB), including Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome, Periodic Limb Movement Disorder of
             Sleep, or Narcolepsy.

          -  Subjects taking fluvoxamine, rifampin, ketoconazole , and fluconazole within 30 days
             of baseline

          -  Subjects with hepatic impairment

          -  Subjects who perform shift work or have any other circadian rhythm abnormality or
             disruption

          -  Subjects who are diagnosed with a Major Depressive Episode, current at the time of
             enrollment (subject may have a history of a Major Depressive Episode as long as it is
             in partial or full remission at the time of enrollment)

          -  Subjects who are diagnosed with a manic or hypomanic episode, current at the time of
             enrollment (subject may have a history of a manic or hypomanic episode as long as it
             is in full remission at the time of enrollment)

          -  Subjects who at the time of enrollment receive hypnotic agents or have been on
             hypnotic agents during the two weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Subjects who are pregnant at the time of enrollment or intend to become pregnant
             during the period of study participation

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the research personnel would not be able to participate
             in the research protocol because of agitation, lack of transportation, or other
             reasons.
