  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LBH589 is a drug that may slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by
      blocking certain enzymes. LBH589 has shown effects against cancer in laboratory studies and
      in studies using animals; however, it is not known if this medicine will show the same
      activity in humans. As of May 2006, approximately 100 patients have received treatment with
      either an intravenous or capsule form of LBH589. Only the capsule form of LBH589 will be used
      in this study. In addition, information from other research studies and laboratory studies
      suggests that this study drug may help to treat lung cancer.

      The main goal during the Phase I portion of this research study is to find out the highest
      and safest dose of LBH589 that can be given in combination with pemetrexed in subjects with
      lung cancer without causing severe side effects. The main goal of the Phase II portion of
      this study is to find how the patient's lung cancer responds to the LBH589 in combination
      with pemetrexed.

      This study will also investigate how the patient's body processes the combination of LBH589
      and pemetrexed. To determine this, the investigators will measure the amount of study drug in
      the patient's blood. This will be done with a series of blood tests, called pharmacokinetic
      (PK) tests. Other purposes of this study will be to determine the side effects of LBH589 in
      combination with pemetrexed and whether or not this combination is effective in treating your
      type of cancer.

      Objectives

        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LBH589 given on a three times weekly schedule
           when combined with pemetrexed for the treatment of patients with advanced thoracic
           malignancies, except squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (phase I part).

        2. To determine the overall response rate and non-progression rate (clinical benefit rate)
           and progression-free survival of the combination of LBH589 and pemetrexed in patients
           with previously-treated advanced NSCLC (phase II part).

        3. To determine the pharmacodynamic effects of LBH589 and pemetrexed on levels of histone
           deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as on levels
           of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the blood.

        4. To identify biomarkers in baseline, archival tumor tissue that may correlate with
           antitumor efficacy.

      Subject population Phase I: We will enroll patients treated with any number of prior regimen
      and all thoracic malignancies, except squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

      Phase II: We will enroll patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC who have received 1
      prior chemotherapy regimen (1 additional regimen in the setting of initial curative treatment
      is allowed if completed &gt;1 year earlier).

      Treatment plan

        -  Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV, day 1, every 21 days, on the first day of the week LBH589 is
           given.

        -  LBH589 three-times-a-week (doses will be at least 2 days apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday,
           Friday), until disease progression or intolerable toxicities LBH589 will start the week
           prior to the first pemetrexed cycle and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies will be performed
           (week -1)

      Study design and sample size:

      This is a phase I/II study. Phase I: 9-18 patients (estimated); Phase II: 17-41 patients
      (estimated).
