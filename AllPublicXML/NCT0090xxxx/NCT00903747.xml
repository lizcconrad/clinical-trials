  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, parallel-group active- and placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised
      study, stratified by gender and with a hybrid crossover group design, to compare treatment
      with prucalopride 2 mg/day (intended therapeutic dose) and prucalopride 10 mg/day
      (supratherapeutic dose) with placebo. A single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin is included
      as a positive control in terms of the effect on cardiac repolarisation.

      Study hypothesis:

      Treatment with therapeutic (2 mg) or supratherapeutic (10 mg) doses of prucalopride in
      healthy male and female volunteers will not increase QTc interval compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total number of 120 healthy subjects (with an approximate 1:1 female:male ratio) are
      planned to be randomised.

      Day 1: a baseline ECG profile. Day 1: Group 1 will receive prucalopride, Group 2a will
      receive moxifloxacin, and Group 2b will receive placebo.

      On Day 5 (steady-state level is reached), a full ECG assessment day will be performed,
      enabling the comparison of prucalopride 2 mg with placebo.

      Subsequently, the number of tablets will be escalated in all groups (blinded) with 1 tablet a
      day up to 5 tablets.

      On Day 13 (steady state for the supratherapeutic dose level of 10 mg of prucalopride) another
      ECG assessment day will be performed, enabling a comparison of prucalopride 10 mg with
      placebo.

      Group 2b will receive a single dose of moxifloxacin on Day 15. All subjects will be
      discharged on Day 16. Subjects will remain in the CRU throughout the treatment period.

      All subjects will return for a follow-up visit on Day 30 (± 1 week) (approximately 14 days
      after the last dose).
