    <textblock>
      Multi-center, open-label, non-randomized trial to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of
      nilotinib. Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled in this trial at 3 centers in Mexico,
      which means all ongoing patients participating on [CAMN107A2109] excluding discontinued
      patients. During this study, patients will receive nilotinib orally, at a dose of 400 mg
      b.i.d. Patients will normally receive nilotinib on an outpatient basis. This trial will have
      a maximum of 24 months of follow-up time.
