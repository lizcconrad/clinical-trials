    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether more than one subpopulation exists of
      patients with the diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis (IC) based on sensory testing and to
      determine if subjects with IC have normal counterirritation-related modulatory systems.

    <textblock>
      To determine whether more than one subpopulation exists of patients with the diagnosis of
      Interstitial Cystitis (IC) based on sensory testing and to determine if subjects with IC have
      normal counterirritation-related modulatory systems. Previous studies by the PI suggest that
      two populations of subjects are present in the IC population but a larger number of subjects
      with IC would need to be tested in order to determine if this were indeed true. Other studies
      have demonstrated that counterirritation-related effects are absent in several chronic pain
      populations including fibromyalgia and chronic headaches. Identification of a subset of IC
      patients or the identification of a failure of counterirritation-related effects may predict
      responses to therapeutic interventions.
