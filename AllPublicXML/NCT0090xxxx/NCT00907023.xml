  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the influences of discharge teaching and care
      coordination on how ready a parent is to take their child home from the hospital after a
      solid organ (kidney, heart and liver) transplant. This study will also look into how the
      parent handles coping, utilization of healthcare resources, and parent adjustment 3 weeks
      after discharge from the hospital.

      Parents of children that have received a heart, kidney or liver transplant will be asked to
      participate in this protocol. Involvement in this study involves completion of questionnaires
      prior to the child being discharged from the hospital. Three weeks after discharge, there
      will also be a follow-up phone call to complete more questionnaires.

      Readiness for hospital discharge is a under-investigated topic in pediatric solid organ
      transplant patients, despite the increasing number of pediatric patients undergoing
      transplant surgery. Results from this study will be used to develop an intervention program
      to promote readiness for hospital discharge in parents of children who receive a solid organ
      transplant.
