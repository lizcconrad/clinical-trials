    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study that determines a tolerable combination of sorafenib, when given
      sequentially with cytarabine and clofarabine and determines the feasibility of administering
      this drug combination in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies
      including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), infantile leukemia (both either AML and/or ALL). AML with prior
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, and
      biphenotypic leukemia.

      Research is performed in patients with age of ≥ 0 months old and &lt; 31 years old. In course 1,
      sorafenib will be given orally (PO) on days 1 to 7. Pharmacokinetic studies on days 1 and 7
      and pharmacodynamic assessment on day 8 will be performed. Inter-patient dose escalation or
      de-escalation of clofarabine and sorafenib will be performed based on tolerability and
      toxicity. On days 8 to 12, clofarabine and cytarabine will be administered intravenously (IV)
      without concurrent twice daily sorafenib. Sorafenib will then be given on days 15 to 28 (14
      days). Cytarabine and clofarabine may be given before day 8 when the treating physician feels
      it is necessary after consulting with the primary investigator based on the participant's
      clinical condition (e.g. disease progression). Intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (age-adjusted
      doses) with leucovorin rescue (24 and 30 hours after IT therapy) can be given on day 8.
      Participants with central nervous system (CNS) disease can receive IT therapy weekly until
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses). Triple
      intrathecal therapy with methotrexate, hydrocortisone and cytarabine is allowed other than
      day 8 therapy.

      Response evaluation will be performed on day 22 (or 15 days after initiation of cytarabine
      and clofarabine) in the first course. One course of therapy will be for 28 days unless
      disease progression is seen. Participants may receive subsequent courses (up to 5 courses) if
      there is no disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sorafenib is given on days 1 to 7
      and 15 to 28 in subsequent courses, and cytarabine with or without clofarabine will be
      administered starting on days 8 to 12 (clofarabine can be removed after course 2).
