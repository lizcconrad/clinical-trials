      The goal of the study is to investigate the efficacy of an evidence-based weight loss
      intervention, on a background of quality health care, on asthma control among obese adults.
      The intervention will employ a combination of recommended dietary and physical activity
      changes, and behavioral modification techniques.

    <description>Participants will attend a 15 weekly class sessions during the first 4 months. Classes will be co-lead by a dietician and exercise specialist and will involve a private weigh-in, a group discussion, a presentation of a lifestyle topic, 30 minutes of supervised moderate physical activity, followed by action-planning and goal-setting. During the next 2 months, participants will meet with a dietician on an individual basis for a private weigh-in, personal discussion and problem solving, review of self-monitoring records, and action-planning. The last 6 months will consist of applying and maintaining what has been learned in previous class sessions. Self-monitoring records, questions and problems will be discussed with interventions at least once every 2 months or more frequently if needed.</description>
