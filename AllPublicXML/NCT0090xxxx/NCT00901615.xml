      The purpose of the study is to determine the recommended dose (RD) of lenalidomide (Revlimid)
      when administered in association with R-CHOP (rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine and prednisone).

      The study is a dose escalation study of lenalidomide (Revlimid) administered orally during 14
      days in combination with fixed doses of rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) administered every 3 weeks (R-CHOP 21) in patients with
      B-cell lymphoma.

               -  Diffuse large B cell

          -  Aged from 18 to 70 years

          -  WHO performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Signed inform consent

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL not more than 3 days from the
             start of study drug and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse or begin one acceptable method of birth control, at least 4 weeks before
             she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to monthly pregnancy testing and

             about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.

               -  † A female patient is considered to have childbearing potential unless she meets

               -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L).

               -  Serum SGOT/AST or SGPT/ALT 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (34 µmol/L), except in case of hemolytic
                  anemia.

          -  Prior history of malignancies other than lymphoma (except for basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast) unless the
