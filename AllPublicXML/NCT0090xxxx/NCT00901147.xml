    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intravenous Bortezomib combined with oral
      Panobinostat (LBH589) are effective in treating adult patients with relapsed/refractory
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma or NK/T-cell lymphoma after the failure of conventional
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and NK/T-cell lymphoma are uncommon diseases that are
      prevalent in Asia. They are associated with poor prognosis when treated with conventional
      chemotherapeutic regimes. Their long term disease-free survivals are dismal with only 10-30%
      of patients surviving long term. More intensive regimens including high dose chemotherapy
      with autologous stem cell transplant have been tried as primary induction treatment, but have
      not been shown to be beneficial. Given the rarity of PTCL and NK/T-cell lymphoma, much of the
      literature consists of studies with small sample size and anecdotal case reports. Therefore,
      no consensus exists on the best therapeutic strategy for either newly diagnosed or relapsed
      disease. The failure of conventional chemotherapy in this regard suggests that novel
      therapies including epigenetic approaches and proteasome inhibition should be explored.

      Preclinical data of bortezomib and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) in T-cell and
      NK/T-cell lymphoma cell lines are encouraging. Bortezomib and HDIs have also separately
      demonstrated activity in T and NK/T-cell lymphomas in phase II studies, leading to their
      separate developments in phase III studies. Demonstration of synergism in these 2 agents, in
      part due to their dependence on overlapping pathways, suggests that they should be explored
      as a combination, especially when treating a disease with a very unfavourable outcome. The
      purpose of this phase II study is to assess the efficacy of orally-administered panobinostat,
      a potent class I/II pan-deacetylase inhibitor with intravenous bortezomib in this patient
      population.
