  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this clinical trial with BI 207127 is to see the effect of 4 week
      combination of BI 207127 with Peginterferon alfa (Peg-IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) on hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) virus load and how safe BI 207127 is in this combination in HCV infected
      patients.

        <description>Reductions of viral load (Log10) at each visit up to day 28, change from baseline. Change from baseline was calculated as the value at baseline minus the value at each later visit.
A negative value represents an increase in viral load, a positive value represents a decrease in viral load.</description>
