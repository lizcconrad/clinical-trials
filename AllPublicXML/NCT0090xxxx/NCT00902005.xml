      The aim of this study is to examine the associations between inflammatory disease activity
      and endothelial function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis patients treated
      with methotrexate and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha)inhibitor in combination or
      methotrexate or TNFalpha-inhibitor alone. Further, to look for improvement in endothelial
      function, and decrease in bone and cartilage destruction during treatment with the
      combination therapy of TNFalpha-inhibitor and methotrexate in RA and Psoriatic Arthritis
      (PSA) patients. Last, examine the TNFalpha inhibitors influence on endothelial function and
      levels of bone and cartilage markers in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS).
