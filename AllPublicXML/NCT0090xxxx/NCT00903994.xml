        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are males or females 18 years of age or older (If female, must be practicing
             abstinence or using a medically acceptable form of contraception (e.g., intrauterine
             device, hormonal birth control, or double barrier method). For the purpose of this
             study, all females are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             post-menopausal, biologically sterile, or surgically sterile (i.e., hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy), or have undergone tubal ligation for greater than or equal to
             one year.)

          -  Have a diagnosis of acute tendonitis or bursitis of the shoulder, elbow or knee with
             acute onset of the current episode in the 15 days preceding the screening visit

          -  Have average pain intensity during daily activities over the past 24 hours rated 5 or
             greater on an 11-point scale (range 0 to 10). (If the onset of acute tendonitis or
             bursitis is less than 24 hours before the screening visit, the patient will rate the
             average pain intensity during daily activity since the time of onset.) Site personnel
             must not reveal this eligibility criterion to prospective patients.

          -  Are willing to discontinue use of all analgesic medications (including
             over-the-counter [OTC] analgesics) except the study patch. Note: Aspirin at a daily
             dose of 81 mg per day for cardiovascular prophylaxis will be allowed.

          -  Have been informed of the nature of the study and have provided written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a positive urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only) or are
             pregnant or lactating

          -  Have tendonitis or bursitis secondary to a systemic inflammatory disease (e.g.,
             rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies), or resulting from calcification or
             requiring surgery

          -  Have had pharmacologic treatment (e.g., analgesic medications except 81mg prophylactic
             aspirin) less than 12 hours before the baseline assessments

          -  Have received systemic corticosteroids in the 30 days preceding the screening visit
             (e.g., intra-articular, peritendinous, oral, or parenteral administration). Nasal
             inhalation steroids are permitted.

          -  Have received any pharmacologic treatment or physical therapy in the past 6 months for
             the joint targeted for this study. Pharmacologic treatment or physical therapy for
             current tendonitis or bursitis is allowed unless the medication or therapy is
             prohibited by the protocol.

          -  Require continued use of an immobilization device for treatment of the current episode
             of tendonitis or bursitis

          -  Have a history or physical examination finding that is incompatible with safe
             participation in the study, including GI ulcer or bleeding, anemia or prolonged
             bleeding time

          -  Have a history, or physical examination finding, that is incompatible with study
             product use or with obtaining robustly interpretable data, chronic skin conditions
             such as psoriasis, clinically significant osteoarthritis, or skin lesions or wounds at
             the affected site

          -  Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Are taking medications or other substances contraindicated due to the nature of the
             study medication or the potential for drug interactions. This includes:

               -  patients with allergies to prescription or OTC products containing NSAIDs

               -  patients in whom aspirin or other NSAIDs or analgesic drugs induce the syndrome
                  of asthma, rhinitis and nasal polyps

               -  patients taking medications that may affect clotting, for example warfarin,
                  parenteral heparin, ticlopidine (Ticlid®) or clopidogrel (Plavix®)

               -  patients taking lithium

               -  patients taking methotrexate

          -  Are renally or hepatically impaired in the judgment of the investigator based on the
             patient's medical history or other available clinical laboratory information

          -  Are taking sleep medications, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants or antidepressants at
             a dose that has not been stable for at least 3 months

          -  Receiving physical therapy for the tendonitis/bursitis. Ongoing, stable physical
             therapy for conditions not related to tendonitis/bursitis is allowed.

          -  Have scheduled elective surgery or other invasive procedures during the period of
             study participation

          -  Have any illness or concurrent condition that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator or medical monitor, make study participation unsafe or would confound
             study results (e.g.,inflammatory arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, fibromyalgia, or
             are currently undergoing treatment for chronic pain)

          -  Have received an investigational drug or product or participated in an investigational
             drug study within a period of 30 days prior to receiving study medication
