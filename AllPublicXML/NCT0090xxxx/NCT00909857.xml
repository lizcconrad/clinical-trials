    <description>Dysmenorrheic pain was defined as pelvic pain during the menstrual/withdrawal bleeding episode and the 2 days before this episode. Baseline period: 2 days before the first menstrual bleeding until 3rd day before the 3rd menstrual bleeding (normalized to a standard 56-day period). Treatment period: 2 days before the withdrawal bleeding (WB) of the 1st evaluable treatment cycle until 3rd day before the WB of the cycle after the 2nd evaluable treatment cycle (normalized to a standard 56-day period).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants aged 14 to 50 years with a need for oral contraception suffering from primary dysmenorrhea were recruited at specialized study sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of 771 participants screened, 264 failed screening, mostly due to not meeting in-/exclusion criteria (155), withdrawal of consent (49), loss to follow-up (36) or pregnancy (10). Thus, 507 participants were randomized (253 to Estradiol valerate/Dienogest and 254 to Ethinyl estradiol/Levonorgestrel).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Bleeding/spotting episodes (day[s] with bleeding/spotting preceded and followed by at least 2 bleeding/spotting-free days) were described using the reference period (RP) method (length of RP: 90 days) recommended by the World Health Organization. 1st RP started on the 1st day of study medication. The total number of days during bleeding or spotting episodes was counted. Spotting = less than associated with normal menstruation relative to the subject’s experience with no need for sanitary protection (except for panty liners). Bleeding = any bleeding of greater intensity than spotting.</description>
