  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the efficacy and safety of a regimen of ON 01910.Na as a 48-hour
      continuous intravenous infusion once a week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle in MDS patients
      with Trisomy 8 or classified as Intermediate-1, -2 or High Risk who are not responding to
      current therapeutic options. The rationale for this trial is based upon data from laboratory
      studies with ON 01910.Na and upon activity that has been observed in other clinical trials
      with ON 01910.Na in patients with MDS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, study in which 14 MDS patients with Trisomy 8 or classified as
      Intermediate-1, -2 and High risk who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive
      ON 01910.Na 800 mg/m^2/24h as an continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) over 48 hours once a
      week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. As of Amendment 3 to the Protocol, the regimen is changed
      to 1800 mg/24h for 72 hours every other week for the first four 2-week cycles and every 4
      weeks afterwards. The total study duration is 31 weeks, which includes a 2-week screening
      phase, a 27-week dosing phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase that begins after the last dose
      of ON 01910.Na. Beginning at week 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter, patients will be assessed
      for response. Patients who drop out for any reason will not be replaced. Patients who achieve
      by week 29 a complete or partial response or stabilization of their disease are eligible to
      receive an additional 24 weeks of ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/24 h over 72 hours per week of a 4-week
      cycle.
