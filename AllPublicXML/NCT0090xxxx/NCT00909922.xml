      The aim of this study was to identify posture asymmetries in transfemoral amputees utilizing
      clinical evaluation measures. The purposes of this investigation were: 1) to measure the limb
      length indirectly to determine the proportion of participants with LLD and to quantify the
      mean amount of discrepancy. The investigators hypothesized that a majority of transfemoral
      amputees would present with a short prosthetic limb. 2) To measure pelvic tilt to determine
      if transfemoral amputees undergo musculoskeletal adaptations similar to those reported in the
      literature. The investigators hypothesized that transfemoral amputees would present with a
      greater degree of anterior pelvic tilt and pelvic innominate asymmetry than what has been
      previously reported. 3) To assess restriction in lateral trunk flexion and hip extension to
      determine if asymmetry was present and if it was related to the increase in anterior pelvic
      tilt. The investigators hypothesized that restrictions would be found in the lateral trunk
      flexors and hip flexors on the amputated side contributing to posture asymmetry at the
      pelvis. 4) To determine if musculoskeletal adaptations at the pelvis were affected by
      prosthetic limb length, lateral trunk flexion and hip extension restrictions, and residual
      limb length. The investigators hypothesized that the previously reported posture asymmetries
      would contribute to musculoskeletal adaptations at the pelvis and trunk. Results of the
      present study will provide a reference for clinicians when using clinical evaluation measures
      to determine the presence of posture asymmetries in transfemoral amputees. If posture
      asymmetries are detected, clinicians need to determine musculoskeletal structures at fault
      and offer treatment solutions to prevent secondary impairments.
