  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three year fMRI study conducted at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital and
      the William. S. Middleton VA Hospital. This study is guided by the hypothesis that reduced
      fMRI activity and connectivity cortical midline structures (i.e., medial frontal and ventral
      posterior cingulate cortex) are physiologic abnormalities that relate strongly to the
      compromised insight into cognitive deficits, or anosognosia, shown by a subset of individuals
      with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and AD. Further, the investigators hypothesize that these regional
      changes in fMRI activity are predictive of faster progression from aMCI to AD.

    <description>The control group have to be medically and cognitively healthy(MMSE â‰¥ 28; Hopkins Verbal Memory Test-Revised raw score within 1.5 SD of normative values for age and gender). These individuals are recruited from the community and all attempts will be made to match them on age and education to individuals recruited for groups of AD and aMCI.</description>

    <description>Participants who have expressed interest to take part in the study. A consensus from the study clinicians regarding the diagnosis will be required before a subject is enrolled. The criteria for MCI include 1) observation of memory decline by informant, 2) Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score between 24 and 30, 3) objective memory impairment on neuropsychological tests, 3) intact functional abilities, and 4) no diagnosis of dementia.</description>

    <description>Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according with the NINDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. An additional criterion is a MMSE score between 16 and 27. All AD patients must have capacity to provide informed consent as judged by the referring physician.</description>

        MCI and AD patients are referred from memory clinics at the UW hospital, William S.
        Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital (Madison, WI) and the statewide clinics offered
        through the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute (WAI).
