    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present research study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics, as well as
      safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of different ascending dosing regimens of AP214 in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. AP214, the investigational drug, is being developed to
      potentially prevent post-surgical kidney injury after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair.
