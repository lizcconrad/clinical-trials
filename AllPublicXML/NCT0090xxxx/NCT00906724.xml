      Hypothesis: Insulin-resistant African-American and Hispanic adolescents will show significant
      improvement of insulin sensitivity (SI) and positive changes associated with fibrinolytic
      markers and lipid profile after a two month supervised aerobic training.

      The specific aims of the study are 1) To determine the effects of exercise on insulin
      sensitivity in insulin-resistant African-American and Hispanic adolescents; 2) To determine
      the effects of exercise on fibrinolytic markers in insulin-resistant African-American and
      Hispanic adolescents.

      The hypothesis is that insulin-resistant African-American and Hispanic adolescents will show
      significant improvement of insulin sensitivity (SI) and positive changes associated with
      fibrinolytic markers and lipid profile after a 1 month pre-training period and two-months of
      supervised, moderate intensity aerobic exercise.

      Part I. Insulin-resistant African American and Hispanic adolescents from the DC metro area
      will be recruited through various recruitment efforts. Potential participants will have 2
      screening visits in which their medical history, physical activity level, body mass index,
      and fasting plasma glucose and insulin or OGTT results will determine eligibility.

      Part 2. If inclusion criteria is met, the subjects will undergo a 2 week dietary
      stabilization period, treadmill exercise testing, IVGTT, blood draws for fibrinolytic and
      lipid markers, DEXA scan, and anthropometric measurements. Subjects will have a 1 month
      pre-training period and 2 months of supervised, moderate intensity aerobic exercise. All
      baseline testing will be repeated after the exercise period to see any significant
      differences.
