    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients were at least 18 years old, with unilateral or bilateral open-angle glaucoma
        (defined as IOP &gt; 21 mmHg, mean of three consecutive measurements, at any time during the
        day, at the moment of glaucoma diagnosis) or ocular hypertension (IOP&gt; 25 mmHg, mean of
        three consecutive measurements, at anytime during the day, at the moment of diagnosis).
        Glaucoma was defined as a reproducible glaucomatous visual field defect based on GHT
        outside normal limits and/or PSD lower than 0,5% or glaucomatous changes of the optic disc
        associated to elevated IOP. A visual acuity (ETDRS) of 20/80 or better was required for
        randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Included woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy, systemic contra-indication to
        beta-blocker therapy, argon laser trabeculoplasty three months before screening visit, any
        history of filtering surgery, ocular surgery or uveitis three months before screening
        visit, hypersensitivity to any compound of the study drugs, concomitant use of any
        experimental drug, any condition in which treatment with beta-blocker is contraindicated or
        any other abnormal and/or ocular condition or symptom that would prevent study
        participation, according to the judgment of the investigator. The use of systemic
        beta-blocker, if needed, was allowed and not considered an exclusion criterion. Latanoprost
        non-responders defined as lower than 15% IOP reduction after run-in period with latanoprost
        monotherapy were excluded from the study.
