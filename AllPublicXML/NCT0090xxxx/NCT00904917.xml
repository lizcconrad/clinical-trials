      Abstract

      Background: There is limited representation of ethnic minorities in preventive interventions
      for the generational impact of maternal depression.

      Methods: The Preventive Intervention Project (PIP) was adapted to be culturally and
      contextually relevant for urban African American mothers with depression and their children.
      A pilot clinical trial (PIP vs. lecture) was conducted.

    <measure>Children Depression Inventory (CDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and at post-treatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Children Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1992) is a widely-used self-report scale of depressive symptoms suitable for use by youth ranging from 7 to 17 years. The CDI is a 27-item scale that is self-rated and symptom-oriented. The 27 items on the assessment are grouped into five major factor areas. The item score are rated 0-2 with a total scores summed and converted to T scores. The total T score ranges from 33 to 100 with high scores indicating higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-treatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC; March et al., 1997) is a self-report instrument that measures a broad range of anxiety symptoms in youth. The MASC consists of 39 items using a 4-point Likert scale that are distributed across four major factors, three of which can be parsed into two subfactors each. Main and subfactors include (1) physical symptoms (tense/restless and somatic/autonomic), (2) social anxiety (humiliation/rejection and public performance fears), (3) harm avoidance (perfectionism and anxious coping), and (4) separation anxiety. Scores are summed and converted to T-scores. The total T score ranges from 25 to 90 with higher scores representing greater levels of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Understanding Mood Disorders Questionnaire (UMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-treatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Understanding Mood Disorders Questionnaire (UMDQ; Gavazzi, Fristad, &amp; Law, 1997) measures attributions and knowledge of symptoms, course, and treatment of mood disorders and a symptom checklist. It has 39 items and two subscales. A range of total score is 0 to 59. The first 20 questions are true/false questions and correct responses are scored 2 points each. Nineteen questions are a checklist of symptoms and correct identification of those depression and manic symptoms are scored 1 point each. All items are summed for a total score. Higher scores indicate greater knowledge of mood disorders. Both maternal and child reporters completed this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child's Report on Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-treatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Child's Report on Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI; Schludermann &amp; Schludermann, 1970) assesses children's and parents' perceptions of parental acceptance, permitting psychological autonomy, and level of parental control. The 10-item acceptance scale which assesses parental warmth was administered. The acceptable scale has items scored from 1 to 3 (not like me, somewhat like me, a lot like me). Items are summed with a total range is 10 to 30. Higher scores represents greater warmth exhibited by mother to child. Separate forms are available for both child and parent report.</description>

        <title>Children Depression Inventory (CDI)</title>
        <description>Children Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1992) is a widely-used self-report scale of depressive symptoms suitable for use by youth ranging from 7 to 17 years. The CDI is a 27-item scale that is self-rated and symptom-oriented. The 27 items on the assessment are grouped into five major factor areas. The item score are rated 0-2 with a total scores summed and converted to T scores. The total T score ranges from 33 to 100 with high scores indicating higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured at baseline and at post-treatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
        <population>These scores are based on the CDI which was administered solely to the children of the dyadic mother-child intervention and control groups. Post-intervention scores based on 9 children in Adapted PIP (2 lost to follow-up) and 6 children in Lecture group (2 lost to follow-up).</population>

        <title>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC)</title>
        <description>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC; March et al., 1997) is a self-report instrument that measures a broad range of anxiety symptoms in youth. The MASC consists of 39 items using a 4-point Likert scale that are distributed across four major factors, three of which can be parsed into two subfactors each. Main and subfactors include (1) physical symptoms (tense/restless and somatic/autonomic), (2) social anxiety (humiliation/rejection and public performance fears), (3) harm avoidance (perfectionism and anxious coping), and (4) separation anxiety. Scores are summed and converted to T-scores. The total T score ranges from 25 to 90 with higher scores representing greater levels of anxiety.</description>

It has 39 items and two subscales. A range of total score is 0 to 59. The first 20 questions are true/false questions and correct responses are scored 2 points each. Nineteen questions are a checklist of symptoms and correct identification of those depression and manic symptoms are scored 1 point each. All items are summed for a total score. Higher scores indicate greater knowledge of mood disorders. Both maternal and child reporters completed this measure.</description>

        <description>Child's Report on Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI; Schludermann &amp; Schludermann, 1970) assesses children's and parents’ perceptions of parental acceptance, permitting psychological autonomy, and level of parental control. The 10-item acceptance scale which assesses parental warmth was administered. The acceptable scale has items scored from 1 to 3 (not like me, somewhat like me, a lot like me). Items are summed with a total range is 10 to 30. Higher scores represents greater warmth exhibited by mother to child. Separate forms are available for both child and parent report.</description>
