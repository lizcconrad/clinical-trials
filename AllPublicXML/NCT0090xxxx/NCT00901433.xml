  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NAEPP (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program) guidelines recommend that
      spirometry be performed on patients with asthma because they serve as an objective measure of
      airway obstruction. Unfortunately, most children under 5 years of age are unable to perform a
      forced expiratory maneuver making conventional spirometry unavailable in this age group in
      most venues. Furthermore, other population groups such as retarded people, elderly or
      physically handicapped share the same difficulty.

      Karmel Sonix Ltd has developed the Personal WheezoMeter a hand-held pulmonary sounds analyzer
      that utilizes contact sensors to acquire, amplify, filter, record and quantify the presence
      of wheezing. This usability study was designed to test independent home use and device
      interface effectiveness of the Personal WheezoMeter in order to validate its safe and
      effective use by intended users.
