    <measure>Recovery Time (Rt[65] From Insulin-induced Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of hypoglycemic clamp (t=0 minutes) through 270 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Rt(65) defined as the time to recover from hypoglycemia (blood glucose level of 50 mg/dL) to an arterialized venous blood glucose of 65 mg/dL. At t= -60 minutes on the morning of Day 1 (Visit 6) or Day 22 (Visit 8), a hypoglycemic clamp was used via an increased insulin infusion rate to achieve blood glucose concentrations of 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) within ~30-90 minutes. At the end of the 30-minute hypoglycemic clamp interval, insulin and glucose infusions were terminated, and the time to recover from hypoglycemia to 65 mg/dL Rt(65) was determined. Rt(65) was followed up to 270 minutes</description>

    <measure>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Concentration Average Over 8-12 Hours (C[Ave] 8-12 hr) Post Single Dose MK0893</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of MK0893 administration through 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax was the maximum or &quot;peak&quot; concentration of MK0893 observed after its administration.
Approximate C(ave 8-12) was the MK0893 concentration average over 8-12 hours post-dose and was computed as the Area Under the Curve over 8-12 hours post-dose (AUC [8-12]) ÷ 4</description>

    <time_frame>From time of MK0893 administration through estimated 32 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentration of single dose MK0893 was measured from time of administration to 24 hours post-dose and extrapolated out to 32 hours post-dose using the plasma concentration vs. time curve</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With An Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of administration of study treatment through end of Post-Study (up to 21 days after administration of last dose of study treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the
structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. This also included any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product.</description>

        <description>Rt(65) defined as the time to recover from hypoglycemia (blood glucose level of 50 mg/dL) to an arterialized venous blood glucose of 65 mg/dL. At t= -60 minutes on the morning of Day 1 (Visit 6) or Day 22 (Visit 8), a hypoglycemic clamp was used via an increased insulin infusion rate to achieve blood glucose concentrations of 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) within ~30-90 minutes.
