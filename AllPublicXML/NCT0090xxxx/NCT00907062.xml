  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a common hypopigmentation disorder with significant psychological impact if
      occurring before adulthood. One study investigating the use of Ginkgo biloba for the
      treatment of vitiligo in adults reports effectiveness, but has significant flaws. We endeavor
      to conduct an open label pilot clinical trial replicating the previous trial on 12
      adolescents 12 to 18 years old. The purpose of the pilot is to test the feasibility of
      recruitment and patient retention, variability of outcome measures, and identify major safety
      concerns. The pilot will use 60 mg of standardized G. biloba two times per day (BID) for 12
      weeks. The primary outcome will be the validated Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF)
      evaluation form, secondary outcomes will include the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI),
      assess repigmentation via photographs, and will monitor and report adverse reactions.
