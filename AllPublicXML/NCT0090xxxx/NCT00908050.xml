      The purpose of this study is to determine whether botulinum toxin helps patients with
      bruxism.

      Bruxism represents involuntary movements of the jaw muscles, resulting in tooth grinding and
      clenching. Generally it occurs during sleep, but occasionally can be present during the day,
      so called awake bruxism. Bruxism is a common condition, affecting approximately 8% of all
      people. It is not known what causes bruxism but it may result in tooth damage, jaw pain,
      headaches, poor quality sleep and may bother your partner's sleep at night due to the tooth
      grinding noise. There is no generally accepted treatment for bruxism. Mouth guards and
      several medications have been tried, but they generally did not work or caused side effects.

      Botulinum toxin &quot;Botox&quot; is a natural toxin, which weakens the muscles when injected in very
      small amounts. It is currently approved and used for the treatment of various conditions
      involving abnormal muscle spasms, such as neck twisting (torticollis), twitching of the face
      (hemifacial spasm) or eyes (blepharospasm), headaches, muscles stiffness following strokes,
      and it has also been used cosmetically for wrinkle removal.

      Since bruxism is caused by involuntary spasms of the jaw muscles, botulinum toxin has been
      tried, initial results showing that it is safe and effective. The injections generally take
      one week to start working and 2 weeks for a full effect, which lasts on average 12-16 weeks,
      and slowly wear off. The injections are generally repeated every 3-4 months.

    <description>week 1: the patient will undergo the following: a. physical examination; b. sleep questionnaire c. bruxism questionnaire to establish a clinical diagnosis of bruxism; d. headache questionnaire; e. Clinical Global Improvement scale; f. masseter muscle measurement; g. anxiety questionnaire; h. demographic questionnaire;
week 2: The patient undergoes a polysomnogram (sleep study). The patient will spend one night (10:30pm-8:00am or until spontaneous awakening) in a sleep lab. During the sleep study, the following parameters will be recorded: electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, upper airway resistance, heart rate, muscle activity; upper airway resistance,masseter muscles bilaterally. All recordings are performed using surface electrodes (self-adhesive to the skin), none of them invasive.
Study visit 3 (week 3): Patients are injected with botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX) 60 units in each masseter muscle and 35 in each temporalis muscle, bilaterally.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years old with a diagnosis of bruxism, based
             on the standard criteria.

          -  2. If the subject is a female of childbearing age, she must have had a hysterectomy,
             tubal ligation, or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy, or have practiced a method of
             contraception (hormonal contraceptives, spermicidal barrier, intrauterine device,
             partner sterility) at least one month prior to study entry. Any female of childbearing
             age will have a urine pregnancy test one week prior to the treatment (visit 2).

          -  3. Ability of the patient or guardian to sign and understand informed consent.

          -  4. Ability to follow and comply with study directions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Coexistence of active psychosis, other active psychiatric disease or cognitive
             impairment.

          -  2. Coexistence of serious co-morbid conditions.

          -  3. Exposure to any botulinum toxin preparation within the past 6 months.

          -  4. Participation in another experimental therapeutic protocol within 30 days.

          -  5. Any medical condition in which the administration of botulinum toxin is
             contraindicated, including myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other
             neuromuscular diseases.

          -  6. History of dysphagia.

          -  7. History of botulism.

          -  8. A condition or situation in which the investigators view will confound the ability
             of the subject to participate in the study.

          -  9. Patients or guardian who are unable to understand and sign informed consent.

          -  10. Pregnancy

          -  11. Patients who do not meet inclusion criteria.

          -  12. Patients in whom it is felt that a major portion of overall sleep morbidity is not
             related to bruxism.
