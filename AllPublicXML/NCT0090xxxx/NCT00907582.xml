  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic
      treatment, remission can be achieved by chemotherapy with ATRA and/or arsenic and addition of
      mylotarg. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation using a polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) negative graft is important treatment option to obtain sustainable remission. This
      study is to test the efficacy and the safety of conditioning regimen with idarubicin and
      busulfan for relapsed Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL).

      Once relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia achieved molecular remission after all-trans
      retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic treatment, PBSC was mobilized and collected with further
      confirmation of molecular remission via RT-PCR.

      Patients received autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.
