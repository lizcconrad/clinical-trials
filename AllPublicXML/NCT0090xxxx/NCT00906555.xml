  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequacy of solute clearance makes a profound impact on clinical outcome in maintenance
      hemodialysis patients. Thus far, guidelines on the target of solute clearance (Kt/V or URR)
      are based on patients with three dialysis sessions per week. However, quite a few patients
      have their dialysis sessions twice per week in China. The dialysis target of solute clearance
      in this population remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the optimum
      target solute clearance (Kt/V or URR) in maintenance hemodialysis patients with two dialysis
      sessions per week. Two groups of hemodialysis patients with different Kt/V (1.2 ≤ Kt/V ＜ 1.7
      versus Kt/V ≥ 1.7) will be followed until 96 weeks in this prospective, randomized,
      multi-center, interventional study.

      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center intervention study. 400 maintenance
      hemodialysis patients with twice dialysis sessions per week will be enrolled into the study.
      All the patients have their baseline Kt/V between 1.2 and 1.7 (1.2 ≤ Kt/V ＜ 1.7). After
      treatment intervention, the patients will be randomized to two groups according to their
      different Kt/V (1.2 ≤ Kt/V ＜ 1.7 vs. Kt/V ≥ 1.7), then the patients will be regularly
      followed up at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks, 72 weeks and 96 weeks. Clinical
      outcomes such as mortality, complications and life quality between the two groups will be
      investigated.
