  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical patients are usually starved for 8 to 12 hours before operation in order to reduce
      the chances of vomiting and other complications during the anaesthetic. Recent studies have
      suggested that this period of starvation might be harmful as it 'weakens' or 'stresses' the
      body before the operation. To avoid these harmful effects of starvation, patients are now
      given carbohydrate drinks (sugar-containing drinks that provide energy for the body) up to 2
      hours before the operation. These drinks have been shown to make patients feel better, reduce
      sickness after the anesthetic/surgery and result in quicker recovery from operation. But the
      ways in which the sugar drinks have these beneficial effects on the body are unknown. The
      optimum time of giving these drinks to patients before operation is also unknown. This study
      will investigate the hormone responses of the body, following intake of 2 different
      carbohydrate drinks, in order to determine the optimum time of intake of these drinks in
      order to obtain the maximum benefits for the body.
