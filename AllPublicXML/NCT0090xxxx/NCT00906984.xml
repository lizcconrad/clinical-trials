  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide TheraSphere treatment for patients with liver
      cancer who cannot be treated by surgery. The effect on the tumor and any side effects of
      TheraSphere treatment will be examined. This study will provide supervised and limited access
      to TheraSphere treatment at University California Irvine Medical Center.

      TheraSphere is a medical device containing yttrium-90 (Y-90), a radioactive material that has
      been used previously in the treatment of liver tumors. When Y-90 is incorporated into very
      tiny glass beads (TheraSphere), it can be injected to the liver through blood vessels
      supplying the liver. This allows a large dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor with
      less risk of toxic effects from radiation to other parts of the body or to healthy liver
      tissue. The radiation from TheraSphere is contained within the body and becomes minimally
      active within 7 days after treatment due to physical decay. The glass beads remain in the
      body, but do not cause any health problems. TheraSphere has been approved for use in the
      treatment of liver cancer in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration on a
      limited basis.

      This protocol provides TheraSphere treatment for patients with liver cancer who cannot be
      treated by surgery. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be evaluated for eligibility
      for this treatment with the following: physical examination, medical history, blood tests
      requiring approximately 2 tablespoons of blood, EKG, CT or MR of chest to examine lungs, CT
      or magnetic resonance (MR) of abdomen to evaluate liver, stomach and intestines, and bone
      scan to rule out spread of disease to bones. If eligible on initial screening, patients will
      proceed to a second stage of screening, including an hepatic angiogram to confirm treatment
      can be provided safely and to highlight the blood vessels supplying the liver, and a nuclear
      medicine study (Tc-99m MAA scan) to display the blood flow to the lungs, stomach and
      intestines.

      When it is determined treatment can be delivered safely, patients will receive TheraSphere
      via the hepatic artery through blood vessels supplying the liver on an outpatient basis.

    <description>TheraSphere® treatment will be performed in the outpatient setting. The effect on the tumor and any side effects of TheraSphere® HUD treatment will be examined. This is not a research study and there are no comparison or experimental treatments being used. Within 14 days of initial treatment, reverification of eligibility will be confirmed. If review of eligibility indicates an uncorrectable risk of flow to the gastrointestinal organs or risk of shunting to the lungs, treatment will not be administered. In this event, the patient will receive alternative treatment (chemoembolization) or no treatment. If the patient remains eligible, TheraSphere® will be administered within 14 days. All patients will be evaluated at 30 days post-treatment to assess clinical experience and adverse effects. Subsequently, patient status will be followed via communication with the referring oncologist to determine disease status and survival. Survival surveillance will continue up to 24 months.</description>
