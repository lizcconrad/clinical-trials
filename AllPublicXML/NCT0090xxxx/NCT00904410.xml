  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FDG PET, a whole-body imaging technology based on glucose metabolism, can effectively
      detect subclinical and clinical therapeutic responses at stages that are earlier than those
      detected by conventional approaches.

      We propose to conduct a prospective study to evaluate early therapeutic response using
      18F-FDG PET before and after the 1st cycle of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer
      patients.

      Variation of 18F-FDG PET uptake is compared to clinical and echographical tumor response
      evaluated after 3 cycles of chemotherapy.

      The purpose is to estimate the capacity of 18F-FDG PET to differentiate responder and
      non-responder patients.
