      To evaluate whether Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) might be an effective alternative
      treatment option for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), in comparison to current gold
      standard surgical treatment- Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (i.e. International prostate symptom
             score IPSS&gt;8) who are bothered by their symptoms (i.e., interfere with the daily
             activities of living)

          2. Urinary retention (related to BPH) leading to catheterization.

          3. Refractory to medical treatment or patient is not willing to consider medical
             treatment

          4. Pre trans-urethral resection of prostate (TURP) to reduce the size of prostate gland
             if prostate is too big for TURP surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mild symptoms (IPSS &lt;8)

          2. Moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (i.e. IPSS&gt;8) who are not bothered by
             their symptoms (i.e., symptoms do not interfere with the daily activities of living).

          3. Suspected malignancy.

          4. Any of the following clearly related to BPH- bladder stones, recurrent UTIs, and renal
             insufficiency.

          5. Advanced atherosclerosis and unsuitable vascular access.
