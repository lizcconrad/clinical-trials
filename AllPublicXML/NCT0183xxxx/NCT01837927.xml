    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          -  Men and women aged 40 years or over.

          -  History of current or former smoking of at least 10 pack-years

          -  Cooperative outpatients, with a COPD diagnosis established by the measurement of
             FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 post-bronchodilation in basal spirometry (without use of medication or
             post-washout). Moderate to severe stage patients will be included, with
             post-bronchodilator FEV1 between 30 and 80% of the normal value according to GOLD 2011
             since the inclusion criteria in this trial will be based on spirometry results.

        Exclusion:

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers

          -  History of asthma at visit 1 indicated by, but not limited to:

               -  Onset of respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma (such as coughing, wheezing,

             urinary retention, any other condition that might compromise patient safety or
             compliance, interfere with the evaluations, or prevent the termination of their
             participation in the study.

          -  Patients with contraindications to tiotropium or ipratropium treatment or who have
             experienced undesirable reactions with inhaled anticholinergic agents or patients with

             with any of those components, or a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study
             medications, including rescue medication, or similar classes of medication.

          -  Patients using tiotropium, long-acting anticholinergics, short-acting
             anticholinergics, fixed combinations of inhaled beta agonists and inhaled
             corticosteroids, theophylline. In these cases, the patient is allowed, after agreeing
             to participate in the study, to enter a washout period from Visit

          -  Patients using inhaled steroids, alone or as an exchange in a fixed combination at
             equivalent doses, unless on a stable treatment for at least 1 month prior to
             randomization

          -  Patients using nonselective beta-blockers.

          -  Patients using cromoglycate, nedocromil, ketotifen and leukotriene antagonists unless
             on stable treatment for at least 1 month prior to randomization .

          -  Patients who used oral prednisone (or equivalent) over a long period, defined as ≥ 10
             mg/day for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1

          -  Patients who used intramuscular depot corticosteroids within 30 days from Visit 1.

          -  Patients with a history of long QT Syndrome or with prolonged QTc (&gt; 450 ms) measured
             at Visit 1 (Fridericia Method).

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, have clinically significant
             abnormalities on ECG. These patients should not be re-screened.
