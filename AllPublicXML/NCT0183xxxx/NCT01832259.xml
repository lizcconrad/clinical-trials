  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The area around a tumor (&quot;pre-metastatic niche&quot;) may be an area to which cancer cells are
      attracted. The study doctor will take blood and tumor samples to look for certain features
      linked with response to treatment so that they can predict which future patients may benefit
      from this therapy. The purpose of this study is to see if the drug pazopanib can be used to
      reduce the amount of pre-metastatic niche in the patient's lymph nodes (a common site for
      prostate cancer to spread). Down the line, this may help to prevent prostate cancer from
      coming back after surgery.

          -  Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications listed in the
             protocol for at least 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior

          -  Treatment with any of the following anti-cancer therapies:

               -  radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational

               -  surgery or tumor embolization within 14 days prior to the first dose of pazopanib
                  OR hormonal therapy within 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is
                  longer) prior to the first dose of Pazopanib

          -  Administration of any non-oncologic investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half
