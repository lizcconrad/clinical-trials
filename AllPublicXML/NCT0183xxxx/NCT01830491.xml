    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the combination therapy of aspirin and
      clopidogrel napadisilate is not inferior to that of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate with
      respect to its effectiveness in inhibiting platelet aggregation, if it is given for four
      weeks to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients who had been treated with a drug-eluting
      stent before &gt; 12 months and had remained in a stable condition with a single antiplatelet
      agent, aspirin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  aged 20 to 80 years

          -  men and women with coronary artery disease who had been treated with drug-eluting
             stent placement before &gt; 12 months

          -  patients who had remained in a stable condition with a single antiplatelet agent,
             aspirin

          -  patients who did not show any sign or symptom of the worsening of their angina within
             the last six months that required a coronary artery intervention, a coronary artery
             bypass, or coronary angiography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were taking another antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug such as
             clopidogrel, warfarin, or cilostazol in addition to aspirin, unless they could
             withdraw from such other drug/s, in which case they could be enrolled in the study

          -  severe liver disease (ALT or AST ≥ 10 times the upper normal limit)

          -  active hemorrhage such as gastro-intestinal ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage

          -  a high risk of bleeding (blood coagulation disorder, uncontrolled severe hypertension,
             active bleeding, or history of severe bleeding)

          -  pregnant or lactating women
