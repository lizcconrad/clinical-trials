  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical symptoms appear, there is a long period when changes
      in the brain occur. In this long asymptomatic period or preclinical phase, studies with
      populations at risk of developing AD have shown cognitive differences compared to control
      groups without such risk. There is a need for short, sensitive, easily administered,
      reproducible, non-expensive and independent of socio-demographic influences tests enabling
      the detection of pre-symptomatic variations in memory, when the memory decline is still
      within a normal range.

      Study main hypothesis: When evaluated with high-demanding tests of memory and executive
      function, the cognitive performance of cognitive healthy people aged between 45 and 65 and,
      extensively, to a group of up to 75 years, will vary significantly depending on clinical,
      socio-demographic and genetic features

      The purpose of Study 45-65 is to assess if:

        -  Endogenous factors (clinical history, risk factors, genetic factors APOE4, etc…),
           exogenous (socio-demographic, ambient and lifestyle variables) and cognitive reserve
           (including bilingualism) influence cognitive performance.

        -  New and/or updated tests translated and validated in Spanish and Catalan when needed,
           will provide accurate and sensitive measurements of the variability of cognitive
           performance in this target population, representative of the preclinical phase of
           Alzheimer's disease.

      An optional visit is offered to study participants that includes: cerebral magnetic
      resonance, vascular ultrasound and olfactory testing.
