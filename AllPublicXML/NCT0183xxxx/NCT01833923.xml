    <textblock>
      Anlotibib (ALTN) is a kind of innovative medicines approved by State Food and Drug
      Administration（SFDA） which was researched by Jiangsu Chia-tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Co.,
      Ltd.

      ALTN is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2 and
      VEGFR3. It has the obvious resistance to new angiogenesis.

      The primary objective of this trial is to explore the maximum tolerated dose(MTD),
      dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) of ALTN and rational dosage regimen for phase II study, to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics with single and multiple doses of ALTN from
      5mg/d,10mg/d,16mg/d,12mg.
