  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is to investigate to what extent a gentle tissue extraction of CIN lesions of the cervix
      will bring the same conclusion than the conventional cervix biopsy, but with less pain and
      morbidity, after patients were undergoing a conisation in order to treat CIN.

    <description>Object of this study is the evaluation of two different methods of gaining cervical tissue in order to determine whether, and if so in what extent, a CIN is existent. The first method is a cervical biopsy, the second method is a gentle tissue saving curettage of the cervix uteri. Also is to be investigated that the latter method shows a reduction of pain and morbidity after the procedure.
For this reason the pathological outcome of the two methods will be compared to the result of a conisation, which will be received by the patient to cure their cervical lesions.</description>
