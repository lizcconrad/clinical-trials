  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women. Currently, breast conservation
      surgery (BCS) is the treatment most often prescribed. BCS involves removing the tumor while
      conserving the greatest amount of healthy breast tissue. Under standard white light, tumor
      borders are difficult for the surgeons to visualize. Therefore, between 30-70% of patients
      require a second operation to remove remaining cancerous tissue that wasn't detected during
      the initial surgery. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need for a new imaging tool that
      improves tumor visualization during the first surgery.

      PRODIGI, a new hand-held optical imaging device, uses a safe violet-blue light to detect
      fluorescence signals in the tissue. Different tissues are associated with specific
      fluorescent colors and therefore the device can be used to differentiate between tumor and
      healthy breast tissue. Based on previous clinical data, PRODIGI can distinguish some tumors
      from normal tissues, but is not specific enough to detect a difference across all breast
      tumor types.

      The fluorescent contrast drug 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) accumulates in tumors naturally
      and previous research has shown that 5-ALA increases tumor-normal tissue fluorescence
      contrast. In this observational clinical study, PRODIGI and 5-ALA will be used to visualize
      tumor borders during BCS. 5-ALA induced fluorescent images from the surgical sample and the
      surgical bed obtained by PRODIGI will be compared retrospectively with the images taken under
      standard white light and/or autofluorescence. The technology's ability to accurately identify
      tumor borders better than conventional practice will be confirmed by tissue pathology.

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that 5-ALA will selectively increase breast tumor-to-normal
      fluorescent contrast and therefore increase tumor margin delineation using the PRODIGI device
      compared to standard white light or autofluorescence visualization. The goal of this
      observational study is to use intraoperative fluorescence imaging across all three patient
      cohorts (control, 15mg/kg 5-ALA, 30mg/kg 5-ALA) to determine if there is an increase in
      tumor-specific fluorescence contrast, and to select the optimum 5-ALA contrast agent dose.
      All patients across each cohort will receive conventional BCS and care independent of
      contrast agent dose. Data from this preliminary study will be used to guide the design of
      future statistically powered randomized controlled trials involving PRODIGI and 5-ALA.
      However, at this early stage our initial aim is to develop a baseline understanding of the
      5-ALA fluorescent signatures in normal and tumor breast tissues in the surgical setting.

      This technology has the potential to guide surgeons during BCS and reduce the re-incision
      rates by ensuring that the surgeons can properly identify tumor from normal tissue during
      surgery. If successful, this new fluorescence imaging technology may improve patient outcomes
      by reducing the likelihood of cancer recurrence, accelerating the recovery process and
      decreasing healthcare costs by eliminating the need for a second surgery.

    <description>The sensitivity and specificity of fluorescence imaging for differentiating cancer from normal tissue in the breast will be evaluated by tissue histopathology and compared to standard white-light imaging. The sensitivities and specificities for auto-fluorescence (Cohort 1: 0 mg/kg 5-ALA) will be compared to the sensitivities and specificities of the two doses of 5-ALA (Cohort 2: 15mg/kg and Cohort 3: 30mg/kg). In addition, the sensitivities and specificities between the two 5-ALA dosing cohorts will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>The fluorescent signatures will be compared to biological components within an average of 2 months after each surgery. The fluorescence catalogue will be created within approximately 4 months of achieving a full dataset (45 patients).</time_frame>
    <description>The fluorescent signatures from punch biopsies taken from the tumour and in normal tissue will be determined using fluorescence point spectroscopy. The biological components of the corresponding punch biopsies will be determined by tissue histopathology. The fluorescence signatures of the different types of tissue (adipose, connective, etc.) will be correlated for all punch biopsies taken as part of the study.</description>
