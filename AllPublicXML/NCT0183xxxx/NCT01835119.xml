  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus can cause the accumulation of secretions and gas, resulting in nausea,
      vomiting and abdominal distension and pain. Prolonged paralytic ileus is one of the commonest
      reasons for delayed recovery and discharge from hospital following abdominal surgery.
      Advances in surgical techniques and peri-operative management such as the use of laparoscopic
      surgery, thoracic epidural analgesia, early postoperative feeding and mobilization, amongst
      others, have been shown to help in the resolution of postoperative ileus.

      Chewing gum, as a proxy for sham feeding, may accelerate the motility of the GI tract by
      stimulating the cephalic phase of digestion and eliciting the release of multiple promotility
      GI hormones. A number of small controlled studies evaluating the effect of chewing gum on
      postoperative intestinal recovery in patients undergoing colorectal surgery have been
      conducted. Decreased time for bowel function recovery and decreased hospital length of stay
      have not been consistently documented, possibly owing to the insufficient power of existing
      studies and study design issues. In addition, all previous studies have been limited by their
      use of sugarfree gum, containing known motility agents (eg, sorbitol).

      In this study, gum chewing was studied for its effect on women with surgical staging for
      malignant gynecologic disease such as endometrial cancer, cervix cancer and ovarian cancer.

    <description>Gum type was standardized with all subjects receiving sugar-free peppermint-flavored gum.
The patients in the chewing gum group, gum chewing began the morning of postoperative day 1. Patients chewed gum (one stick) 3 times daily in the morning, afternoon, and evening at least 5 min. The administration of the therapy was implemented by ward nursing staff and recorded in the patients file. All gum-chewing patients completed their course of gum chewing until bowel function.</description>
