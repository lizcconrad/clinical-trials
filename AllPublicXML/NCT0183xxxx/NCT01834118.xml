    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of repeated renal denervation in
      non-responding patients with severe hypertension. Therefore ultrasound technique will be
      used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal Denervation is a CE-certified opportunity for treating patients with therapy-refractory
      hypertension. In some patients it doesn't show a significant lowering of the blood pressure,
      so a repeated renal denervation is an option.

      In this study repeated renal denervation will be performed with the Recor Paradise Ultrasound
      Catheter.

      For the study no specific procedures are required which would exceed the standard renal
      denervation procedure with the CE-certified Recor Paradise Ultrasound Catheter System.

      There are no additional risks for the patient in consequence of participating in the study or
      the follow up procedures.
