    <textblock>
      The Patient evaluated in Emergency room since admission and detailed history and clinical
      examination done .The in hospital cases where sepsis is the culprit and shifted to Intensive
      Care Unit (ICU) in view of septic shock were included since onset of shock.

      Initial fluid resuscitation done and if the patient were no fluid responsive they were
      randomized into arms noradrenaline or terlipressin and the dose escalated to achieve the
      primary objectives. At the same time the strict vitals monitoring and standard medical
      therapy for sepsis including antibiotics and other supportive therapy continued. The patients
      were followed up till discharge, death or up to 28days after enrollment into the protocol
      (whichever the longest). The detail methodology has been explained in column 14 later.
