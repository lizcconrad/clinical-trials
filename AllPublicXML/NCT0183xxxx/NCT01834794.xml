  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and test an intervention for the simultaneous treatment of
      cannabis use disorders and tobacco smoking. This is important because over 50% of adults
      seeking treatment to help stop cannabis use also smoke tobacco regularly, which decreases
      their chance for a successful treatment outcome and increases adverse acute and long-term
      psychosocial and health consequences. The proposed treatment will integrate existing
      computer-based behavioral interventions for cannabis and tobacco and use nicotine replacement
      medications to improve outcomes in this difficult to treat clinical population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of persons seeking treatment for cannabis-use disorders (CUDs) regularly
      smoke tobacco. Combining tobacco with cannabis has become a common method of smoking
      cannabis. Similarities of use, and using together, can make quitting difficult. Stopping
      tobacco simultaneously with cannabis may be beneficial. Little scientific information
      currently addresses how to best target tobacco smoking during treatment for CUDs. Our
      long-term goal is to develop an effective protocol for intervening in tobacco smoking without
      changing cannabis outcomes. A two-phase, Stage 1 therapy development project will accomplish
      the following: First, a treatment protocol and manual will be developed that integrates a
      tailored intervention for tobacco smoking with an intervention for CUD (Aim 1). Utilization
      of web-based counseling programs will standardize delivery of the intervention and foster
      eventual dissemination. A pilot study will provide an initial test of acceptability and
      feasibility. Second, a Stage 1, proof-of-concept study will compare this intervention to one
      that targets CUD only (Aim 2). The hypotheses assert that the intervention (1) will be
      accepted by the majority of eligible participants (2) will result in more tobacco quit
      attempts and rates than the CUD-only treatment; and (3) will not adversely affect cannabis
      outcomes. Last, the project will evaluate the potential of specific moderators of outcomes to
      predict outcomes and inform subsequent treatment development efforts (Aim 3). If the
      hypotheses were confirmed, dissemination of this protocol would reduce adverse psychosocial
      and health consequences of tobacco or cannabis dependence. Findings will inform future
      development of prevention and intervention strategies.
