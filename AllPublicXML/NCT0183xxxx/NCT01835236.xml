  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab based treatment is the standard of
      care as long as there are no contraindications to trastuzumab. Frequently, trastuzumab is
      being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However, since therapy with
      trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC, the optimal
      treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under
      debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab, a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression, chemotherapy
      with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further line therapies
      are performed according to the physician's discretion. If this new therapeutic strategy is as
      effective and better tolerated than the conventional strategy, this would mean a serious
      breakthrough in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      -To evaluate the efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) at 24 months of a
      chemotherapy-free dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (first-line) followed
      by T-DM1 (second-line) and of a chemotherapy-containing dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab (first-line) followed by T-DM1 (second-line) in patients with HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate other efficacy parameter

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the two treatment strategies

        -  To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL)

        -  To learn how patients are treated after trial treatment

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor
      status (positive vs negative), prior trastuzumab (never or &gt;12 months vs ≤12 months after
      last infusion), visceral metastases (present vs absent) and site. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        SELECTION OF PATIENTS (MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA)

        Inclusion criteria for first-line therapy

        • Histologically confirmed breast cancer with distant metastases

        Note:

          1. A biopsy from the primary tumor or a metastasis can be used for diagnosis.

          2. Patients with non-measurable lesions are eligible.

          3. Patients with inoperable, locally advanced breast cancer with lymph node metastases
             other than ipsilateral locoregional (axillary, infraclavicular, parasternal) or other
             distant metastases are eligible.

          4. Patients with bone metastases with or without bone targeted therapy (bisphosphonates,

          1. A formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy from the primary tumor or a
             metastasis has to be used for HER2 status determination. If a biopsy is available from
             a metastasis, the HER2 testing should be performed using the metastasis.

          2. Fine needle aspiration is not acceptable for HER 2 testing. • Women aged ≥18 years

             • WHO performance status 0 to 2

             Note:

             Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed if doses for anthracyclines have
             not exceeded 720mg/m2 and 240mg/m2 for epirubicin and doxorubicin, respectively.

             - Re-exposure to paclitaxel is permitted, if the last dose of taxane was given at
             least 1 year before randomization.

             - Re-exposure to vinorelbine is permitted, if the last dose of vinorelbine was given
             at least 1 year before randomization.

             have been stopped at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.

             • Prior treatment with pertuzumab and/or T-DM1

             • Known leptomeningeal or CNS metastases
