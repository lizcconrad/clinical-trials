  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland. Few people who develop
      this disease live more than 5 years after being diagnosed. Those whose tumors have spread
      inside their abdomen may have an especially poor outcome. In these cases, traditional
      chemotherapy is not very effective. One possible new treatment is aggressive surgery with
      heated chemotherapy. This type of treatment has been more effective for other types of cancer
      in the abdomen. Researchers want to see this if approach can improve the outcomes of people
      with ACC.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of surgery and heated chemotherapy for ACC.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced ACC.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected. Heart function tests will be given. Imaging studies will be used to
           locate the surgical sites before the operation.

        -  Participants will have surgery to remove ACC tumor tissue. After the tumors have been
           removed, they will have heated chemotherapy with cisplatin. The heat may help weaken any
           remaining cancer cells and make them easier to destroy. It will also focus the treatment
           on the tumor sites, rather than the whole body.

        -  Participants will recover in the hospital for several days after surgery. They will have
           regular follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the surgery.

      Background:

      - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor with an incidence of 1.5 to 2 per

      million people per year and has a very poor prognosis with an overall 5-year mortality

      rate of 75 - 90% and an average survival from the time of diagnosis of 14.5 months.

      - The treatment of choice for a localized primary or recurrent tumor is surgical

      resection. For unresectable metastatic or recurrent disease, mitotane,

      aminoglutethimide, metapyrone, and ketoconazole are used.

      - Cisplatin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents for ACC. In the

      Surgery Branch we have conducted Phase I and II trials using heated intraperitoneal

      (IP) chemotherapy with cisplatin for primary peritoneal mesothelioma, low grade

      appendiceal adenocarcinoma, ovarian malignancies, and high grade adenocarcinoma

      of the gastrointestinal tract. Synergy has been demonstrated for cisplatin and

      hyperthermia

      - The purpose of this trial is to determine if an aggressive surgical approach with

      intraperitoneal administration of heated cisplatin when tumor volume is minimal, can

      impact and improve on progression free survival.

      Objectives:

      - To determine IP progression free survival after optimal debulking and heated IP

      chemotherapy with cisplatin in patients with IP spread of adrenocortical cancer

      Eligibility:

      - Histologically proven ACC evalauable by CT imaging with the majority of disease

      confined to the peritoneal cavity and surgically resectable to a residual size of less

      than 1 cm or amenable to radiofrequency ablation in patients who are &gt; 18 years of

      age.

      Design:

      - This is a classic phase 2 trial to determine efficacy of this therapeutic strategy in

      ACC. Patients will undergo cytoreductive surgery to achieve a CCR of 0 or 1.

      Patients who are successfully debulked will then undergo HIPEC with cisplatin.

      Patients will be evaluated by associate investigators in coordination with the Principal

      Investigator for eligibility. Due to its exploratory nature, up to 30 patients may be

      enrolled to obtain 24 evaluable patients. (Patients must undergo successful debulking

      and HIPEC to be considered evaluable.)
