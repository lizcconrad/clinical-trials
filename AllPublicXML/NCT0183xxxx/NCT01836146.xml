        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age at time of consent

          -  Subject must be able and willing to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject must be able and willing to comply with the required follow-up schedule

          -  Subject has office Systolic Blood Pressure ≥ 160 mmHg at confirmatory visit

          -  Subject has a daytime mean Systolic Ambulatory Blood Pressure &gt; 135 mmHg during the
             two week screening period

          -  Subject has an office Systolic Blood Pressure that remains ≥160 mmHg despite the
             stable use of ≥3 antihypertensive medications concurrently at maximally tolerated
             doses, of which one is a diuretic or subject was previously on diuretic but documented
             to be diuretic intolerant, for a minimum of 14 days prior to the procedure and with an
             expectation to maintain for a minimum of 180 days post procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has significant renovascular abnormalities such as renal artery stenosis &gt; 30%
             in either renal artery

          -  Subject has undergone prior renal angioplasty, renal denervation, indwelling renal
             stents, and/or abdominal aortic stent grafts

          -  Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease as determined by the
             Study Investigator

          -  Subject has a life expectancy less than 12 months, as determined by a Study
             Investigator

          -  Subject is participating in another clinical study which has the potential to impact
             their hypertension management (pharmaceutical/device/homeopathic)

          -  Subject is pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential and is not using adequate
             contraceptive methods

          -  Subject has active systemic infection

          -  Subject has renal arteries with diameter(s) &lt; 4 mm in diameter or &lt;20 mm in length

          -  Subject has an estimated Glomerular Filtrate Rate (eGFR) &lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 using
             the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula

          -  Subject has Diabetes Mellitus Type I

          -  Subject has multiple main renal arteries in either kidney

          -  Subject has an identified secondary cause of hypertension (for example, including, but
             not limited to, Polycystic kidney disease, Cushing's syndrome, Aldosteronism)

          -  Subject has evidence of significant abdominal aortic aneurysm (defined as maximum
             diameter of &gt;4 cm)

          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris or cerebrovascular
             accident less than 180 days prior to enrollment

          -  Subject is expected to have cardiovascular intervention within the next 180 days

          -  Subject has a condition which would interfere with the accurate interpretation of the
             study objectives including but not limited to a large arm diameter that is unable to
             accommodate the blood pressure cuff or arrhythmia that interferes with automatic pulse
             sensing.
