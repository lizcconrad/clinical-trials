    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at the long term effects of a complex socio-affective
      mental training program on a neuroscientific-, hormonal-, behavioral-, biological, and
      subjective measures-level. The training protocol consists of a variety of meditation and
      other mental health techniques, which are trained over the period of 3-9 months (13 weeks per
      Module; 1-3 Modules)

      The ReSource Project is a unique, large-scale study on the effects of mental training
      techniques. Over a period of three to nine months, participants practice a wide range of
      mental exercises that are designed to enhance attentional control, body- and self-awareness,
      emotion regulation, self-care, compassion, empathy, and perspective taking. Overall, the aim
      of the training is to improve mental health and social skills. It may reduce stress, improve
      mental clarity, increase life satisfaction, and lead to a better understanding of others'
      views, values, and actions.

      The ReSource Project is a secular program developed by a team of experienced meditation
      teachers, scientists, and psychotherapists.

      Over the last decades, isolation, stress, and psychological tensions have been steadily
      increasing in our society. Mental training can alter stress responses, physical health,
      resilience, attention, perception, emotional experience, and social behavior. Evidence for
      these results is based on previous studies showing behavioral changes, as well as observed
      changes in brain function and structure. Moreover, health factors, such as peripheral
      autonomic responses, stress hormones, and immune parameters were significantly changed after
      training.

      The ReSource Project consists of three consecutive modules: called &quot;Presence&quot;, &quot;Perspective&quot;,
      and &quot;Affect&quot;. The Presence Module trains mindful attention to internal mental and physical
      processes. The Perspective Module focuses on socio-cognitive abilities, such as insight into
      the nature of the mind and self, and also the ability to assume the perspective of others.
      The Affect Module focuses on constructive ways of dealing with difficult emotions, and works
      to cultivate prosocial motivations and positive emotions such as compassion.

      In contrast to most previous studies of just a few months, the ReSource Project will be
      conducted over a period of 3-9 months for three experimental cohorts (cohorts start in a
      shifted design; 2 cohorts train over a period of 9 months (all 3 Modules in different orders,
      13 weeks per Module), 1 cohort trains over 3 months (only the Affect Module)), and will cover
      a wide range of practices intended to enhance cognitive and socio-affective skills. 2 retest
      control cohorts account for the effects of repeated testing.

    <description>There are two parts to this game: 2nd person punishing and 3rd person punishing. In the 2nd person punishing game, there are two players. One Player (player A) has a larger amount of money at her disposal, than the other player (player B). The player with the larger amount of money can decide how she wants to split the money between herself and the other player. Then player B can decide whether he wants to punish player A by taking money from player A while using his own money (for each unit of money she spends three three units are taken from the other player). After two rounds, the tasks of the players are reversed. In the 3rd person punishing game, the participants watch the interaction of anonymous players A and B. After each round, the participant can decide whether or not to punish the player, who split the money. All computer tasks are divided into 6 blocks and participants completed one block per week (1 hour each).</description>

    <description>Aim of this measure is to access the amount and content of spontaneously generated cognition. Main focus is &quot;day dreaming&quot; or &quot;mind wandering&quot; that occurs, when our minds drift off, while working on a task.
In this measure, subjects are asked to work on two little, rather boring PC-based exercises (1. choice reaction time task (CRT); 2. working memory (WM) task). During selective queries, they are then asked for the content and valence of their thoughts (&quot;thought probe&quot;). All computer tasks are divided into 6 blocks and participants completed one block per week (1 hour each).</description>

    <description>During each measurement time point, blood samples will be collected from each subject and stored at -80 degrees Celsius. The aim is to test if the training leads to reduced shortening of the telomeres, the probes are sent to the Blackburn lab of UCLA in San Francisco, USA.
Additionally, a complete blood count is drawn. Not aiming in diagnostic directions, the goal is to assess the status of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes in the probes. These are thought to be general markers of immune activity and are inspected in relation to telomere length. Blood counts will be assessed by a lab in Leipzig, Germany.</description>

Interviews will be done by a interview specialist with a degree in Psychology and Philosophy.
The data will be treated in accordance with data protection laws. In further publications, all statements of the subjects will be anonymized, the tapes will be erased after transcription. In case they agreed to be video-taped, the material will potentially be used for a video documentation of the whole ReSource Project.</description>
