  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of the NuNec速
      Cervical Arthroplasty System in a small patient population. The NuNec device is currently CE
      marked and commercially available in Europe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NuNec速 feasibility study is a prospective, multi-centered, non-randomized clinical trial.
      Only patients who have been diagnosed with single level, C3 to C7, symptomatic cervical
      degenerative disc disease and have failed at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment or
      present signs of progression of spinal cord/nerve root compression with continued
      non-operative care will be enrolled.

      Patients will be evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at discharge, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12
      and 24 months.
