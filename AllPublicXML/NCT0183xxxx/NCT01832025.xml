  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sinus augmentation, also referred to as a sinus lift or a sinus graft, is an oral surgery
      procedure where bone is added to the upper jaw near the molars. The goal of the surgery is to
      add enough bone material onto the upper jaw to support the placement of a dental implant. The
      augmentation and the dental implant placement will be done at the same time to avoid the need
      for two surgeries. This is standard of care.

      The purpose of this study is to compare any problems and patient comfort levels following
      surgery. Subjects will be randomly placed into one of two groups: the internal lift group or
      the external lift group. Both types of surgery are routinely done at our clinic. Usually the
      type of procedure (internal or external) is based on the dentist's preference. Investigators
      are doing this study to compare them to each other to see if one is more comfortable for the
      subject than the other or if they are equal. It is predicted that the two techniques may
      differ when it comes to complications during the procedure, patient discomfort following the
      procedure and patient complications in the weeks and months after the procedure. This last
      comparison has not yet been studied, and surgeons often choose the technique that they prefer
      from their own experiences. With this research study researchers hope to gain valuable
      information that will help surgeons' decisions in the future.

        -  Investigators hypothesize that external sinus augmentation with simultaneous implant
           placement (external technique) will have a higher rate of Schneiderian membrane
           perforation than the internal sinus augmentation with simultaneous implant placement
           (internal technique).

        -  Investigators hypothesize that the internal technique is associated with more discomfort
           for the subject compared with the external technique.

        -  Investigators hypothesize that the external technique will result in more severe
           pain/bleeding/swelling than the internal technique.

        -  Investigators hypothesize that the internal technique has a higher incidence of
           complications that occur between three weeks and three months postoperatively compared
           with the external technique.

        -  Investigators hypothesize that the external technique has a higher amount of analgesics
           taken postoperatively compared with the internal technique

      Experimental Design

      The proposed study design is a single site, double armed, randomized clinical trial. Subjects
      will be those whose diagnosis requires restoring the lateral maxillary edentulous area by
      performing sinus augmentation together with implant placement.

      Sample Size and Statistical Analysis Sample size A number of 46 subjects, 23 per each group,
      who meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be treated for this study to allow for
      a dropout rate of up to 15%. Up to 60 subjects will be consented to reach the research goal
      of 46.

      The sample size was determined using nQuery program (version 7.0) - for a power of 80% with
      20 subjects/group, assuming the anticipated values for the Schneiderian membrane rate
      perforation as 55% (8) for the external procedure and 10% for the internal procedure (9),
      based on previously reported studies for each procedure.

      Randomization Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio using a balanced design based on
      a computer-generated randomization scheme. A printout of this scheme will be used by the
      co-investigator which will have the randomization for each subject that qualifies in the
      order of qualification. Randomization will occur the day of surgery.

      Blinding Due to the nature of the procedures, this study will not be blinded.

      Subject Characteristics Subjects will include patients whose diagnosis requires restoring the
      lateral maxillary edentulous area by performing sinus augmentation together with implant
      placement.

    <description>The internal lift procedure uses a drilling instrument (a drill that cuts through bone) to break through the bone for where the implant will later go. This creates an opening in the necessary area to allow more bone material to be added, which will move the sinus up and allow for the implant to be securely placed.</description>

    <description>The external lift procedure involves cutting through the upper-most part of the gums to then cut through the bone to create an opening in the necessary area. The sinus will be manually lifted and the bone material will be added, which will allow for the implant to be securely placed.</description>
