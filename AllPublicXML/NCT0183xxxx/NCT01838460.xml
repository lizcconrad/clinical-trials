      To compare each subject's AUCinf, after administration of one single dose of 6 mg of
      Nicorette sublingual nicotine tablets ( three 2mg tablets) to that of one single 1 g dose of
      SS containing 16 mg nicotine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open, randomized, five-way cross-over. Single dose administration. The Nicorette 6 mg
      sublingual tablets and three strengths of SS are tested. Subjects are 18-50 years old,
      male/female (non-pregnant), healthy volunteer, using minimum 12 pouches of 1 g portion snus
      or half a can of loose snus per day. The treatments are given as single doses in randomized
      order. The subject keeps the sublingual tablets still under the tongue for 30 minutes.

      The subject keeps the pouch(es) of snus still between the upper lip and the gum for 30
      minutes. Serial blood samples are drawn before, and at regular time intervals up to 6 hours
      after administration.

      Amount of nicotine extracted, plasma nicotine concentration at 30 minutes (C30), Tmax, Cmax,
      AUCinf and heart rate for each treatment. The AUCinf area is based on plasma data corrected
      for background nicotine (time zero sample).

      Each subject's rating of subjective effects using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on a palm top
      computer, anchored with &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;.

      VAS scores will be obtained at the plasma concentrations sampling time points up to 30
      minutes for:

        -  craving intensity

        -  overall &quot;product strength&quot; (head rush, &quot;buzz&quot;, &quot;hit&quot;, feeling alert)

        -  increased salivation

        -  burning sensation in the mouth and/or throat
