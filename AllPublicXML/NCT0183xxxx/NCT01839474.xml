    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) machine (a device that blows air into the lungs) decreases the chance of a child dying
      from difficulty breathing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infections, malaria, and sepsis remain leading causes of death in children
      throughout the world.These conditions may lead to respiratory distress and eventually failure
      if not adequately managed. In developing countries with limited resources, advanced airway
      management and support can be challenging and needs to be approached in a different manner
      than is done in developed nations. For example, the use of invasive mechanical ventilation
      for respiratory distress is not an option in many resource-limited countries due to the lack
      of available technology, infrastructure, and trained personnel. Other alternatives should be
      utilized in order to support children with reversible conditions during their acute
      respiratory distress stage. One such alternative is non-invasive positive pressure.

      Prior research demonstrated that nasal bubble CPAP can be successfully introduced and
      utilized in a developing country's emergency ward. Nurses in four Ghanaian district hospital
      emergency wards (Kintampo, Mampong,Nkoranza, and Wenchi) were able to safely apply CPAP and
      monitor the patient's response. The investigators demonstrated that patients receiving CPAP
      had a significant decrease in respiratory rate compared with those that did not with a mean
      difference of 14 breaths per minute. There were no major side effects associated with the use
      of CPAP. Now that CPAP has demonstrated to decrease respiratory rate in a non-specific
      disease population presenting with respiratory distress it is important to determine if it
      also improves survival. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to determine if the use of
      CPAP in children 1 month to 5 years of age with respiratory distress decreases mortality.

    <description>Appropriately sized nasal prongs will be selected for the patient, gently applied ensuring a tight seal, and securely fastened. The CPAP machine will be turned on to deliver a pressure of 5 cm H2O in the inspiratory limb of the system. Patients will be allowed to be in the position of most comfort, preferably with mouth closed to maintain pressure in the circuit.</description>
