  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three major subtypes of breast cancer:

        1. Hormone receptor positive (contain cells that express the estrogen receptor or
           progesterone receptor).

        2. Tumors that express the epidermal growth factor receptor gene ( HER-2)

        3. Triple negative (cancer cells that lack the hormone receptors and the epidermal growth
           factor receptor gene HER-2.

      While effective therapies exist for most cases of breast cancer at first occurrence, many
      patients eventually exhibit disease that does not respond to all standard breast therapies,
      particularly in the metastatic setting.

      There are therapies that are used to treat other types of cancers with genetic mutations that
      are in the process of being evaluated for use in breast cancer. The current techniques used
      for detecting mutations in the genes of breast cancer patients, which can be treated with
      drugs specific for the genetic mutations, are invasive and identifying effective diagnostic
      non-invasive procedures are the next challenge for physicians. This study will compare the
      ability to detect genetic mutations samples from non-invasive procedures such as a blood
      draw, to more invasive procedures such as tissue taken from a biopsy sample.

      There is also a concern with current techniques used to detect genetic mutations that cells
      from a single tissue sample may not be representative of the types of cells present in all
      the tumors in the body and therapies selected using a single tissue sample may not be
      effective for all of the cancer in the body. This study will use blood drawn from
      participants prior to any drug therapy and compare the genes from this blood to tissue
      samples from multiple sites of disease.

      The study will also compare the genetic profile of the metastatic tumors to the genetic
      profile of the original breast cancer to determine if there are any changes in the genetics
      of the tumor cells.

      The participants that have newly diagnosed metastatic disease will provide tissue from their
      primary site of disease via an image guided biopsy. These participants will also provide
      tissue from at least 2 other distant metastatic sites (lung, pleural/peritoneal, liver,
      brain, or skin). Each biopsy procedure will attempt to obtain 2-3 samples for research
      purposes.

      Participants that have locally recurrent disease in the breast will have the tissue from the
      site of re-occurrence biopsied as well as two distant metastatic sites (lung,
      pleural/peritoneal, liver, brain, or skin). Participants that have either multi-centric
      disease or bilateral disease will have all tumors sampled with the intention of providing 2-3
      samples/tumor for research purposes. Participants with multi-centric and bilateral disease
      will also have 2 distant sites of distant disease sampled (lung, pleural/peritoneal, liver,
      brain, or skin).

      Prior to any scheduled biopsy procedures all participants will have a blood draw used to
      examine the genetics of the tumor cells in the blood. The participants will have 8 tubes of
      blood drawn for the test and then they will proceed onto the tissue sampling portion of the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  3.1 Radiographic evidence of new or progressive metastatic breast cancer by CT
             chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan, or by PET scan.

          -  3.2 Patient must have ≥3 sites of disease involving ≥2 organ sites appropriate for
             biopsy. Treating physician, in consultation with interventional radiologist as needed,
             will select sites for potential biopsy (see section 5.2.2 for guidance on evaluable
             sites.)Histologic documentation of metastatic invasive breast cancer with metastasis
             to a distant organ site (lung, liver, pleural/peritoneal, skin [if skin, must be
             determined by treating physician that it is not skin involvement from breast primary
             or local regional recurrence], and/or bone) by core needle or excisional biopsy.

          -  3.3 The subject must agree to undergo and be able to tolerate the research biopsy(ies)
             and blood draw.

          -  3.4 Prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy with therapeutic intent is
             allowed in the metastatic setting. However, for patients currently receiving such
             treatment(s), archived tumor specimens will not count towards the required biopsy of 3
             tumors

          -  3.5 Women or men &gt; age 18.

          -  3.6 Ability to give informed consent.

          -  3.7 Normal Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio within 30 days of any
             diagnostic biopsies, or if patient is on anticoagulation therapy, approval is required
             by provider doing the biopsy.

          -  3.8 Negative pregnancy test or beyond reproductive potential.

          -  3.9 Medical evaluation by medical oncology within 4 weeks.

          -  3.10 Previous but not current smokers are eligible if they have not smoked for more
             than 10 years and have less than 25 pk yr smoking history, see exclusion criterion
             3.14.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        3.12 Poor venous access (unable to tolerate large-gauge needle).

        3.13 Unable to tolerate blood draw or research biopsy procedures.

        3.14 Current smokers or smoked at all within the last 10 years, or have a lifetime smoking
        history greater than 25 pack-years. (One pack year is equal to smoking 1 pack per day for 1
        year; 5 pack years = one pack/day for 5 yrs, or ½ pack/day for 10 yrs, etc.). There is
        evidence that smoking increases the likelihood of detecting mutations in cancer-related
        genes in plasma DNA in healthy individuals (i.e., who do not have detectable cancer) (15,
        16). We wish to avoid detecting such genetic lesions in this pilot study by excluding
        current, recent and heavy smokers
