  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of this study is the unedited evaluation of the circadian autonomic profiles
      of resistant hypertension with and without white-coat response.

      All patients were submitted to office blood pressure measurement, Ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring and 24-hour Holter monitoring.

      Baseline blood samples for the measurement of glycemia (mg/dL), total cholesterol (mg/dL),
      LDL cholesterol (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), creatinine (mg/dL), serum uric acid, serum
      sodium, serum potassium, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity
      (PRA) were collected at 08:00 after overnight fasting.

    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The autonomic nervous system can be assessed by the heart rate variability. Variations in heart rate variability are normally observed in association with diurnal rhythms and blood pressure changes. The heart rate variability parameters are different in many studies, although the consensus is that lower values of the indices of vagal as well as high indices of sympathetic functions are associated prospectively with death and disability.
In humans, the disturbances of the circadian rhythms of heart rate variability and blood pressure have been intensively studied, mainly due to the increased cardiovascular death reported during the morning hours</description>

        Forty-four resistant hypertension subjects, regularly followed up at the cardiovascular
        clinical pharmacology out-patients' clinic, and who complied with pharmacological
        prescription for hypertension, were recruited to participate in this transversal and
        observational study.
