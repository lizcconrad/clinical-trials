    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the relationship between the coronary artery
      calcification assessed by MDCT with the plaque characteristics and necrotic lipid core
      content of non-intervened coronary segments assessed with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).

      A total of 60 patients, from a single center, who meet all of the study inclusion criteria
      and none of the study exclusion criteria will be prospectively enrolled in this study.
      Qualifying patients will be referred to the study site for clinically indicated, non-emergent
      cardiac catheterization with NIRS evaluation, either proceeded or followed by coronary artery
      calcium score (CACS) evaluation.

      Qualifying patients that are referred directly to cardiac catheterization with NIRS
      assessment secondary to symptoms or abnormal functional test will be sent for cardiac CACS
      assessment following the catheterization before discharge from the hospital. In this group,
      patients who require ad hoc PCI upon initial angiography will be excluded to avoid artifacts
      on CACS. In patients who are referred for a clinically indicated cardiac catheterization with
      IVUS evaluation within 3 months after MDCT with CACS, NIRS of at least two (2) major
      epicardial vessels will be completed prior to any (if necessary) coronary revascularization.

    <description>All patients will undergo NIRS to at least 2 major epicardial vessels as a research related intervention. Patients will be considered to be enrolled in the trial upon completion NIRS evaluation. Patients who had a clinically indicated CT with CACS evaluation within 3 months prior to the cardiac catheterization with NIRS evaluation will not have any other research related interventions. Patients who have not had a clinically indicated CT with CACS within 3 months prior to the cardiac catheterization with NIRS evaluation will have the CACS after NIRS imaging prior to discharge from the hospital.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is â‰¥18 years of age

          -  Patient is clinically indicated due to angina, abnormal functional test or other
             ischemic symptoms to undergo non-emergent cardiac catheterization with IVUS evaluation
             i.If the patient has not had a cardiac MDCT with CACS meeting the protocol
             requirements within 3 months prior to the cardiac catheterization, the patient is able
             to undergo CACS following LipiScan IVUS and NIRS evaluation, prior to any coronary
             revascularization ii. If the patient has had a cardiac MDCT evaluation with CACS
             meeting the protocol requirements within 3 months prior to the cardiac
             catheterization, LipiScan IVUS and NIRS imaging will be completed in at least two (2)
             major epicardial vessels prior to any coronary revascularization
