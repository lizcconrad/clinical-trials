  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking to see if giving ranolazine to subjects on stable pulmonary
      hypertension specific therapies but with right ventricular dysfunction (RVEF &lt;45%) would
      improve their outcome. This study is accompanied by a baseline comparison of the metabolic
      profiling/microRNA/iPS cells of subjects with and without right ventricular dysfunction.
