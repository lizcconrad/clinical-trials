  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether four new alternative imaging methods can be
      used to follow the response of breast cancer to the treatment patients are being given. These
      methods produce an image of the inside of the breast so that doctors can better decide
      whether breast cancer is responding to therapy. An important part of the study is to examine
      the same person with all methods in order to directly compare results. The four methods are:
      MRI Elasticity Imaging (abbreviated MRE), Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (abbreviated
      EIS), Microwave Imaging and Spectroscopy (abbreviated MIS), Near Infrared Spectroscopy
      (abbreviated NIR). In addition to the experimental imaging methods, patients may also undergo
      a contrast-enhanced MRI, and/or additional mammography, which will help researchers compare
      the experimental methods. These additional examinations are accepted diagnostic procedures;
      they are not experimental. Some participants will have one or both of these additional
      examinations if clinically indicated.

        Women with locally-advanced breast cancer, with or without metastatic disease, meeting
        inclusion criteria (and giving informed consent for participation) receiving systemic
        therapy at DHMC will be enrolled. Breast size and epithelial integrity of the skin surface
        can limit the ability to deliver effective imaging exams, adn these individual
        characteristics need be determined in each individual patient. Women with pacemakers or
        other implanted electronic devices will not be allowed into the study because of potential
        for electrical interference with proper operation during an imaging session.
