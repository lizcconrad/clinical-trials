      The objective of this study are to determine the relapse-free survival of resected pancreatic
      cancer patients following two novel regimens. The secondary objectives are 1) to assess the
      toxicity of each of these regimens in this setting. 2) To perform exploratory genomic
      analyses as a means of assessing molecular characteristics potentially associated with risk
      of relapse with one or both of the regimens. 3) To determine the relationship between known
      mutations and metabolic activity as measured by FDG-PET and risk of relapse.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed evidence of pancreatic
             carcinoma.

          -  Patients must have had all gross disease resected (R0 or R1 resection).

          -  Patients who underwent an R2 resection are not eligible.

          -  Patients must have had no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for pancreatic
             cancer.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Patient must have ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function measured within 2 weeks. prior to
             registration as follows:

        ANC &gt; 1,500/µL Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL Total bilirubim less than 2-fold ULN
        AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)&lt;2.5X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance &gt;
        60mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 4 weeks and &lt; 12 weeks post-surgery at time of study registration.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are stronglt advised to use
             appropriate contraceptive measures.

        Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. All agents used in this study as well as
        radiation therapy to the abdomen have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
        effects. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within
        2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy.

          -  Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known metastases are not eligible.

          -  Patients with wounds that have not fully healed are not eligible.
