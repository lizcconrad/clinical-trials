      Conventionally, the outcome of liver transplantation is usually reported in terms of graft
      and patient survival, medical and surgical complications, but lack of health-related quality
      of life (HRQOL) that might be associated with immunosuppression complications (e.g.,
      diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease,
      renal dysfunction, osteoporosis, and de novo malignancy), disease recurrence, and rejections
      after transplantation.

      Specific aims are proposed to achieve in this study:

        1. To compare graft and patient survival rate, incidence of treatment-related adverse
           effects between different patterns of immunosuppression combination among patients
           received post-liver transplant care in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH),
           Taiwan.

        2. To quantify the long-term health impacts of immunosuppressive regimens on
           quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), the loss-of-QALE relating to immunosuppression
           therapy, and types of transplantation.
