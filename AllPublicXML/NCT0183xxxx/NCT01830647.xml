      This prospective observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of first-line
      Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with standard chemotherapy in routine clinical practice
      in patients with metastatic cancer of the colon and/or rectum. Patients will be followed for
      the duration of their treatment and a 30-day follow-up after the last dose of study drug.
