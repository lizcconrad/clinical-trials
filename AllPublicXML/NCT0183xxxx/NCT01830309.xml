      -  Primary: To evaluate food effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of
           CJ-12420 in healthy male subjects.

        -  Secondary

             -  To explore food effect on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of single oral dose of CJ-12420
                in healthy male subjects(PD/PK group)

             -  To evaluate the safety of single oral dose of CJ-12420 in healthy male subjects
                under fed or fasting condition.
