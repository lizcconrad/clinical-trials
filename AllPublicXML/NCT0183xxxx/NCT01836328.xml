  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of current studies regarding the use of methadone (MTD) in the treatment of
      cancer pain are focused in its administration via the oral route (PO). The ratio considered
      from VO to parenteral route (BP) is 2:1. Academic literature assumes the ratio from BP to VO
      to be 1:2. In our unit, we use MTD in the context of ROP and not as the last opioid. If face
      with a situation where there is a good control of pain with MTD BP, usually we move to VO. We
      have observed that the traditional ratio tend to produce certain toxicity problems. Because
      of this, we have proposed a new ratio of conversion from PAR MTD to oral MTD, i.e. 1:1.2

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the different ratios of conversion from MTD VP to MTD PO. To verify the
      presence of lower toxicity in the ratio 1:1.2 against 1:2 while still maintaining a good
      control of pain in patients with advanced cancer that are hospitalized in different
      palliative care units.

      METHODOLOGY: Prospective randomized single blind study in patients with cancer pain treated
      with parenteral MTD and that would move into MTD oral provided there is good control of pain.
      The patients will be randomly split into two groups: (Group A = ratio 1:1.2 and Group B=ratio
      1:2). Patients will be evaluated during the two days before the switch is applied, the day of
      the change and during the 3 days post-ROP. The patients who display significant toxicity
      and/or bad analgesic control within the first 72 hours post-ROP will be considered negative
      cases. The size of the sample required will include 44 patients distributed in balanced
      groups in order to obtain a size effect of 45% and a statistical power of 80%. The
      significance level will be 0.05 for two tails.

      STATISTIC ANALYSIS: By means of Chi-squared to compare the proportion of Opioid Rotation (OR)
      failure in both groups of study.

    <description>Far advanced cancer patients with cancer pain hospitalized, and treated with PMTD undergo a preliminary 48 hours observation phase.
Blinded evaluators assess pain management and treatment toxicity and determine an OPTIMISED DOSE of parenteral METHADONE (pain control without toxicity) for each patient.
Only patients with a correct control of pain and without significant toxicity throughout this period are eligible for randomization.
INTERVENTION: Patients randomized to this arm will receive the double of OPTIMISED DOSE of parenteral METHADONE, orally every 24h in 3 administrations during the following 3 days.</description>

          -  for inclusion in the screening phase, the patient is a candidate to pass parenteral
             methadone to oral methadone (MTD) following to the physician criteria.

          -  for inclusion in the assessment phase should follow: presence of cancer pain
             controlled with no significant toxicity with MTD VP for 48h. Be considered controlled
             pain and absence of significant toxicity due to MTD, as the definitions given in the
