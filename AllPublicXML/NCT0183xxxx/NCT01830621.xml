    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive a new drug, BBI608,
      or better to receive no further treatment for colon or rectal cancer. To do this, half of the
      patients in this study will get BBI608 and the other half will receive a placebo (a substance
      that is designed not to do anything).

    <textblock>
      This research is being done because currently there are no approved remaining effective
      treatments for colon or rectal cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on colon cancer of a new drug, BBI608,
      and best supportive care (BSC) compared to BSC alone.

      BBI608 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and
      seems promising, but it is not clear if it can offer better results than the usual care which
      is best supportive care alone.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is treatment with drugs and other treatments
      that may help to make a patient feel better or may improve their quality of life. This
      treatment is known as &quot;best supportive care&quot; (BSC). Although patients with best supportive
      care can feel better for some months, the cancer usually continues to grow.

             arrhythmia, significant pulmonary disease (shortness of breath at rest or mild
             exertion), uncontrolled infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies except: adequately treated non-melanoma
             skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours

          -  Prior treatment with BBI608.
