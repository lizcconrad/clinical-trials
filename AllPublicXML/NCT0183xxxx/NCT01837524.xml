    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of grocery-store based nutrition counseling visits for weight management vs.
      in-office visits. The investigators will test pre- and post-intervention individual-level
      dietary quality, knowledge, self-efficacy around dietary choice, and cost of shopping,
      measuring difference between intervention and control arms. At the study's end, the
      investigators will also conduct focus groups with a subset of 20 patients (10 from each arm)
      and do a structured interview with the dietitian to better understand the feasibility,
      strengths and shortcomings of this approach. Patients who complete the main portion of the
      trial will be randomly selected for recruitment into a focus group and consented separately
      for that focus group at the end of the study.

      The investigators hypothesize that, compared to office-based visits, the KP Personal Shopper
      visits will result in higher member diet quality scores, better nutritional knowledge scores,
      higher self-efficacy and confidence around food purchasing decisions, and more favorable
      perception of the visit by both dietician and member. The KP Personal Shopper approach may
      also result in increased grocery store costs for some members. Long-term, the investigators
      hypothesize that improvements in member perception, knowledge and dietary quality will lead
      to improved health outcomes.

    <measure>Change in Dietary Quality Scores of Members as Measured Using the 2005 Healthy Eating Index (HEI).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Block FFQ will be administered at baseline in order to calculate a participant's baseline HEI score, and will be re-administered after the 3 month intervention to re-calculate the post-intervention HEI score.
The numbers reported here represent the change from pre to post intervention, in the HEI scores for participants in each group
HEI scores can range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the least overall healthy diet, and 100 representing the most overall healthy diet. There are no units associated with the HEI score. The measure was developed by the US Dept of Agriculture and complete details regarding its development can be found on their website.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional Knowledge of Members</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of the Parmenter-Wardle Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (1999, UK) has been created based on present-day guidelines and eating patterns in the Southeast U.S., and will be administered at baseline and scored, then re-administered after the intervention and re-scored to determine whether or how the score improved after the intervention with the dietitian.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cost of Grocery Shopping for Members</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Receipts from a typical week's worth of grocery shopping will be collected from all participants at baseline. Then, the same process will be repeated each month during the intervention phase to see what effect participation has on costs of grocery shopping for participants (e.g. if buying more produce because shopping with dietitian - will shopping be more expensive?)</description>

    <measure>Member Self-efficacy and Confidence in Food Purchasing Decisions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using a brief survey at baseline (scored) and re-surveyed after the intervention. Survey questions are based on similar items from other studies of health behavior interventions.</description>

    <description>25 participants will be randomized to this arm. They will receive a baseline 30-minute phone call with the study dietitian to determine their current health problems, dietary patterns, shopping and cooking habits and health goals. They will then have 3 in-person visits with the dietitian conducted during grocery shopping trips at a local supermarket. These in-person visits will be conducted monthly over a 3 month period. The information delivered in the visits will be similar in content to that delivered in an in-office visit, including how to pick the best types of foods or ingredients for a given health condition, how to read and understand food labels, healthy recipes, how to track food and drink intake, and basic nutritional knowledge.</description>

        <title>Change in Dietary Quality Scores of Members as Measured Using the 2005 Healthy Eating Index (HEI).</title>
        <description>The Block FFQ will be administered at baseline in order to calculate a participant's baseline HEI score, and will be re-administered after the 3 month intervention to re-calculate the post-intervention HEI score.
The numbers reported here represent the change from pre to post intervention, in the HEI scores for participants in each group
HEI scores can range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the least overall healthy diet, and 100 representing the most overall healthy diet. There are no units associated with the HEI score. The measure was developed by the US Dept of Agriculture and complete details regarding its development can be found on their website.</description>

            <title>Grocery-Store-Based Visit Arm</title>
            <description>28 participants were randomized to this arm. They were assigned to receive a baseline 30-minute phone call with the study dietitian to determine their current health problems, dietary patterns, shopping and cooking habits and health goals. They were then scheduled for 3 in-person visits with the dietitian conducted during grocery shopping trips at a local supermarket. These in-person visits were to be conducted monthly over a 3 month period. The information delivered in the visits was similar in content to that delivered in an in-office visit, including how to pick the best types of foods or ingredients for a given health condition, how to read and understand food labels, healthy recipes, how to track food and drink intake, and basic nutritional knowledge.

They were assigned to receive a baseline 30-minute phone call with the study dietitian to determine their current health problems, dietary patterns, shopping and cooking habits and health goals. They were then scheduled for 3 in-person visits with the dietitian conducted at one of our medical office buildings. These in-person visits were conducted monthly over a 3 month period. The information delivered in the visits will included how to pick the best types of foods or ingredients for a given health condition, how to read and understand food labels, healthy recipes, how to track food and drink intake, and basic nutritional knowledge.
In-Office Dietitian Visits: Participants will have 3, 1 hour in-office sessions with the dietitian during which targeted curriculum on nutritional knowledge, weight management, healthier eating, menu and label reading, will be delivered. These visits will take place monthly over a three month period.</description>

        <description>A modified version of the Parmenter-Wardle Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (1999, UK) has been created based on present-day guidelines and eating patterns in the Southeast U.S., and will be administered at baseline and scored, then re-administered after the intervention and re-scored to determine whether or how the score improved after the intervention with the dietitian.</description>

        <description>Receipts from a typical week's worth of grocery shopping will be collected from all participants at baseline. Then, the same process will be repeated each month during the intervention phase to see what effect participation has on costs of grocery shopping for participants (e.g. if buying more produce because shopping with dietitian - will shopping be more expensive?)</description>
