    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the novel melanocortin-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of
      Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) will reduce axonal loss following ON by limiting
      inflammatory optic nerve injury. We will compare the effect of ACTH and intravenous
      methylprednisolone therapy on axonal injury following ON using ocular coherence tomography
      (OCT), a sensitive, reproducible and noninvasive tool to measure retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) thickness.

      The primary outcome will be the average RNFL thickness at 6 months. Additional pre-specified
      statistical analyses will compare the difference in the mean RNFL thickness at 6 months in
      the affected eye between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups, and the mean
      6-month affected eye RNFL thicknesses adjusted for the baseline unaffected eye RNFL. The
      secondary outcome measure will examine the frequency of optic nerves with RNFL swelling
      between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups at 1 and 3 months. The tertiary
      outcome will be changes in mfVEP amplitude and latency, ONHP detection, and pupillary
      diameter (UTSW only). A predefined exploratory outcome will compare the ganglion cell plus
      inner plexiform layer (GC+IPL) thickness at 6 months between treatment groups

      Patients with their first episode of unilateral acute optic neuritis (ON) will be treated
      with either 3 days of IV methylprednisolone followed by 11 days of oral prednisone or 15 days
      of intramuscular (IM) or sub-cutaneous corticotropin (SQ) Acthar, adrenocorticotropic hormone
      (ACTH).

      This is a single blind, parallel active group, randomized controlled trial in which 60 people
      with clinically unilateral acute optic neuritis (≤ 2 weeks of vision loss; with or without a
      previous diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) will be treated with either
      ACTH or IV methylprednisolone/prednisone (IVMP) for 2 weeks. The primary, secondary, and
      tertiary outcomes will be as noted above. The assessing physicians will be blinded to
      treatment to minimize bias. We intend to recruit a target number of 3 participants per month
      and to complete recruitment within 10 months. This rate of recruitment is estimated on the
      incidence of optic neuritis among the visits to the Rocky Mountain MS Center and the
      University of Texas Southwestern (tertiary care MS centers with &gt; 6,000 patient visits/year).
      Participants will be assessed for inclusion/exclusion criteria by their treating neurologist
      at the Rocky Mountain MS Center (PI- Dr. Jeffrey Bennett) or University of Texas Southwestern
      (PI - Dr. Elliot Frohman), and following informed consent, will be randomized with gender,
      prior diagnosis of MS, disease modifying treatment (DMT) usage (interferons vs. Glatiramer
      Acetate vs. Tysabri/Gilenya/Aubagio/Tecfidera vs. no treatment), and time to randomization as
      binary minimization data. We expect to enroll 30 subjects per institution.

      Following informed consent and randomization, participants will receive treatment either high
      dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg IV daily for 3 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisone daily
      for 11 days) or Acthar (80 U IM or SQ daily for 5 days followed by 40 U IM or SQ daily for 10
      days). Clinical follow-up by the treating physician is planned at months 0, 1, 3, and 6.
      During each visit, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, low contrast
      acuity (2.5%), and color vision (Farnsworth D-15) will be assessed. OCT evaluations (ONH and
      macular cube) will be performed at months 0, 1, 3 and 6 months using spectral domain OCT
      (Cirrus OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA). Automated visual fields (Humphrey
      30-2 SITA) will be performed at baseline and month 6. MfVEP, multifocal electroretinography
      (mfERG), fundus photography (to assess for pallor) and pupillometry will be performed at
      baseline, month 3 and month 6 in the cohort of patients recruited at the University of Texas
      Southwestern. The patient's treating neurologist will perform blood tests and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations to exclude other causes of optic neuropathy at the
      initial study visit as part of their routine care.

      RNFL edema will be defined as either average RNFL thickness greater than the 95th percentile
      of the age matched normal database or a ratio of RNFL thickness (affected/fellow eye) greater
      than 1.1 in any quadrant.11 The study sites will collect and report data on adverse events
      (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) per standard practice.

      A representative at UTSW will determine patient randomization accounting for the variables
      noted above.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          2. Male and female patients aged between 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          3. Diagnosis of clinically unilateral acute demyelinating optic neuritis (ADON)

          4. Clinical signs and symptoms of ADON starting within the 14 day prior to intended
             randomization (loss of vision, pain on movement, impairment of color vision).

          5. The qualifying episode of optic neuritis must be the first clinical episode of optic
             neuritis in the affected eye.

          6. Able to undergo treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone or Acthar gel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Functionally or clinically relevant comorbidity of the affected eye (e.g., glaucoma,
             amblyopia, optic nerve hypoplasia, macular hole, macular edema, vitreomacular
             traction, uveitis, diabetes, optic neuritis, or other diseases of the optic nerve or a
             history thereof).

          2. Bilateral optic neuritis.

          3. Concurrent functionally or clinically relevant disturbances of the eye not affected by
             ADON.

          4. High clinical likelihood of a form of optic neuritis other than ADON (e.g., no pain on
             movement, no light perception, severe optic disk edema, atrophic optic disk, retinal
             exudates, or hemorrhages).
