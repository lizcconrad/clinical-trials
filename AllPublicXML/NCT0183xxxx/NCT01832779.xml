  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a chronic disease of altered esophageal motility with resulting functional
      obstruction to the passage of food leading to poor quality of life and significant morbidity.
      The two main treatments available in the US are endoscopic balloon dilation and surgical
      myotomy. Each therapy has advantages and drawbacks and at present both are considered a first
      choice approach depending on patient preferences and local expertise. Surgical myotomy
      provides long lasting improvement in dysphagia but even when done laparoscopically is
      invasive and complex. Extensive acid reflux resulting in significant morbidity is routinely
      seen after surgical myotomy and additional anti-reflux operation is typically done at the
      time of the myotomy. Endoscopic balloon dilation is a simple minimally invasive outpatient
      procedure but improvement of symptoms tends to be shorter in duration and repeat dilations
      are commonly needed. Both therapies improve on dysphagia but tend to provide suboptimal
      control of chest pain which is one of the cardinal symptoms of achalasia.

      The peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was first introduced in Japan to address the suboptimal
      results with endoscopic balloon dilation and surgical myotomy. POEM is incisionless minimally
      invasive but in addition may have some further advantages over surgical myotomy including
      unlimited length of the myotomy with expected better control of chest pain and preservation
      of the anatomical anti-reflux barrier (angle of His and the cruse of the diaphragm) with
      expected lower incidence of acid reflux.

      In Japan POEM has become the preferred modality for therapy of achalasia due to the excellent
      results and exceptional safety record. In the US, dedicated POEM devices were approved by the
      FDA just recently. As a result the bulk of the published data comes from Japan and very
      little is known regarding outcomes in US population. Therefore the investigators want to
      prospectively record our experience with POEM as done as part of routine medical care in US
      population. This will be a data recording study. All patients will receive standard medical
      care and no experimental interventions will be performed.

      Information about the subject's medical history, leading up to the need for an Achalasia
      treatment, the procedure itself and how the subject does after the procedure, including after
      the subject gets home, will be collected. This will be done by gathering relevant information
      from the subject's medical chart and/or by talking with the subject prior to and after the
      subject's medical procedures. There are no specific study procedures or tests. All
      information collected is part of the subject's medical care and will be collected even if the
      subject is not in the study.
