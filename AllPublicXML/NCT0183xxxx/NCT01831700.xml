      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets (20+25) mg of M/s Ipca Laboratories Ltd., India
      and the corresponding Reference Product: Zestoretic® 20/25 lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide
      Tablets of M/s AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, USA under fasting condition in normal,
      healthy, adult, human subjects in a randomized crossover study.

      The study was conducted with 48 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single
      Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets (20+25) mg of either test or reference was
      administered to the subjects as per the randomization schedule in each study period with
      about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting position.

      The duration of clinical phase was 12 days, including the washout period of 7 days between
      each study period.
