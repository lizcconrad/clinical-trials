  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help understand the benefits of eating food supplemented with
      fiber in the form of sugarcane bagasse (the leftover fiber after cane juice is extracted) on
      glucose metabolism and body weight.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will employ a double-blind randomized controlled study design with 3 arms
      such that obese, insulin resistant adults will be randomly selected to receive food made with
      1) sugarcane bagasse, 2) non-caloric, non-fermentable fiber, or 3) a similar product with
      minimal fiber for 4 weeks. The intervention will be in the form of brownies and cookies and
      will look and taste nearly identical to each other. Caloric value will be constant with all
      three delivery systems. Subjects will have blood testing and body composition analysis before
      and after the intervention.

    <measure>The benefit of sugarcane bagasse on glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in adults with established insulin resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be randomly selected to eat food supplemented with either 1) sugarcane bagasse, 2) another type of fiber of equal weight, or 3) minimal fiber. At baseline each eligible subject will have a 3 hour oral glucose tolerance test. Subjects will consume one brownie and two cookies a day for four weeks. At the end of four weeks, the blood tests conducted at baseline will be repeated.</description>

    <description>At baseline and weekly till the end of the study, weight will be measured. In addition body composition via DXA will be measured at baseline and at the end of the study.</description>
