      Determine whether a relationship exists between polymorphisms of the genes XDH, HPRT1, and
      PRPS1 and gout, hyperuricemia, or the dose of xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors to reach a
      goal serum uric acid of less than 6 mg/dL. This study is observational in nature as no dose
      adjustment of XO inhibitors will be made by study investigators.

      Background: Our recent gout study demonstrated a relationship between the xanthine oxidase
      (XO) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 2107A&gt;G to the dose of allopurinol needed to reach
      a goal serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less. This study had some limitations but suggests
      that specific SNPs could be related to dose of allopurinol needed to treat.

      Objective: To determine the relationship of multiple purine enzyme SNPs of genes encoding
      PRPS1, HPRT1, and XO to the dose of xanthine oxidase inhibitor needed to achieve a goal
      treatment uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL. Another primary outcome will be to determine
      relationship of two XO SNPs to hyperuricemia/gout. A secondary outcome will be to determine
      the frequency of these SNPs tested.

      Design: Patients will be consented for enrollment in either the gout/hyperuricemia group or a
      control group. Control group patients will have neither gout nor hyperuricemia. No patients
      will be enrolled if they are overproducers of uric acid. It is anticipated that 200 patients
      will be enrolled in each group for a total of 400 patients over the next 2 years.

    <description>This study will test the relationship of 2107A&gt;G XO to the dose of allopurinol needed to achieve a treatment goal of less than 6 mg/dL. It will also test whether or not SNPs affecting the gene for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) are related to gout, hyperuricemia, or the dose of XO inhibitor needed to reach a goal of 6 mg/dL. Relationships will be determined using typical non-parametric or parametric tests depending on the skew and skedasticity.

        Patients for either the gout/hyperuricemia group or the control group will be recruited at

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study will be open to all adults over age 18 years of age who satisfy at least one
             of the conditions below:

          -  Have asymptomatic hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level &gt; 7.0 mg/dL) on at least 2
             separate occasions,

          -  Clinical diagnosis of gout,

          -  Have neither asymptomatic hyperuricemia or gout but will serve as part of the control
             group (approximate age/gender matched control)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  To best isolate the relationship between purine enzyme SNPs to hyperuricemia or gout
             and its treatment, factors which could elevate the serum uric acid level independent
             of protein function need to be excluded. Specifically, patients who are
             &quot;overproducers&quot; of serum uric acid will be excluded:

          -  Have a myeloproliferative disorder (hematologic malignancy such as leukemia or
             lymphoma)

          -  Are actively receiving therapy for any neoplasia (aside from non-melanoma skin cacner)

          -  Have greater than 5% of skin involvement from psoriasis

          -  Have a known history of xanthinuria

          -  Consume more than 14 drinks per week of alcoholic beverages

        Patients that are pregnant or nursing will not be enrolled. Patients to be enrolled in the
        control group will also be excluded from enrollment if they have any of the conditions
        above.
