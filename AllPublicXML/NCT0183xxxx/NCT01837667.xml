    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational drug called LB-100 for
      Injection for treatment of solid tumors, when given with or without docetaxel. LB-100 is a
      small molecule that in laboratory and animal studies has shown activity when used by itself
      or together with drugs approved to treat some types of cancer (chemotherapeutic agents).
      Docetaxel is a drug that has been approved for the treatment of some types of cancer; one of
      the trade names for docetaxel is TaxotereÂ®. The study is in 2 parts. Part 1: Patients will
      receive injections of LB-100. Part 2: Patients will receive injections of LB-100 and
      docetaxel. This is the first study where LB-100 for Injection will be used in humans.

             metastatic solid tumors who have failed standard treatment and have no other effective
             treatment available, or docetaxel-naive patients who have failed standard treatment
             and have tumors for which a docetaxel-based regimen would be appropriate.
