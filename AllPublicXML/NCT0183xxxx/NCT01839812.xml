  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective was to determine whether a standard 1mg/kg intraoperative dose of dexamethasone
      results in similar drug levels for all patients and to characterize the relationship between
      these drug levels and the innate stress response following infant Cardiopulmonary Bypass
      (CPB). The investigators hypothesized that postoperative dexamethasone levels are highly
      variable, and that the infant stress response is inversely related to the amount of
      dexamethasone measured in the blood. To test this theory the investigators simultaneously
      measured blood levels of dexamethasone and cortisol at critical time points during the
      perioperative period for infants undergoing CPB for CHD surgery.

      We conducted a single center prospective trial of infants (â‰¤ 365 days of age) who presented
      to a single institution for congenital cardiac surgery.

      Blood was collected from study participants at 7 time points; 1) post-anesthesia induction,
      2) post-CPB/pre-MUF, 3) Intensive care unit (ICU) arrival, 4) post-op hour 4, 5) post-op hour
      8, 6) post-op hour 12, and 7) post-op hour 24. At each of the 7 time points blood was
      analyzed for levels of the following; dexamethasone, cortisol, ACTH, Interleukin (IL) 10, IL
      8, and IL 6. In addition, the innate stress response was evaluated with a cosyntropin
      stimulation test. Each patient received a 1 mcg/1.73 m2 intravenous dose of cosyntropin at;
      anesthesia induction, prior to dexamethasone (time 1), ICU arrival (time 3), and 24 hours
      after ICU arrival (time 7). Cortisol levels were measured before (time 1, 3, and 7) and 30
      minutes after cosyntropin administration (time 1a, 3a, and 7a).
