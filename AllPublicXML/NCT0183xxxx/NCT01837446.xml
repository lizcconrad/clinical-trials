    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is a debilitating side effects of cancer treatment for which there is not much
      successful treatments at yet. The investigators are going to evaluate the effectiveness of
      topical morphine compared with a routine mouthwash in managing cancer treatment-induced
      mucositis. The investigators hypothesize that topical morphine is more effective and more
      satisfied by patients than the magic mouthwash in reducing severity of cancer
      treatment-induced oral mucositis.

    <time_frame>Up to six days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are visited by a radiation oncologist at baseline, 3rd day, and 6th day of the intervention. The WHO grading system of mucositis is administered for each patient in which, 0 indicates a healed mucositis and no signs or symptoms, 1 indicates mild soreness but not problem in eating, 2 indicates painful erythema, edema, or ulcers but able to eat, 3 indicates severe painful erythema, edema, or ulcers and having problem in eating, and 4 indicates if there is a requirement for parenteral or enteral support.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>After six days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients also are asked about if pain/discomfort relived by mouthwash and if so for how long (&lt; 1 h, 1 to 2 h, &gt; 2 h). Their satisfaction with treatment is graded as satisfied, tolerable, and intolerable.</description>

    <description>The morphine group uses the mouthwash of 2% morphine solution (20 mg morphine sulfate diluted in 100 mL of water), 10 mL every three hours; six times a day. The morphine solution is prepared by the faculty of pharmacy under supervision of the Food and Drug Organization of the local Medical University.</description>
