    <textblock>
      Lid retraction is a difficult problem encountered in oculofacial plastic surgery. It can
      result from previous surgery, radiotherapy or cicatrizing disease or it may be idiopathic.
      Whatever the aetiology, the cosmetic appearance is troublesome to patients and, can be
      damaging to the cornea. The definitive therapy for lid retraction is surgical, and often
      involves complicated procedures including tissue grafting.

      Hyaluronic acid gels (HAG) have been FDA approved for the treatment of facial rhytids by
      subcutaneous injection and volume addition. These gels have gained wide popularity in for
      cosmetic applications in filling volume deficit areas. Functional applications in the
      periorbital area have also been described including the filling of volume deficit
      anophthalmic orbits, ectropion and loagophthalmos. Additionally, pilot studies have found HAG
      to be useful in correcting both upper and lower eyelid retraction, with good effect.

      The purpose of this investigation is to define the clinical utility of HAG correction of
      lower eyelid retraction in terms of anatomic (lid position), quantitative (dry eye signs on
      cornea) and qualitative effects (symptom severity).

      Our hypothesis is that HAG correction of lower eyelid retraction will improve patient
      comfort, clinical signs of dry eye and aesthetic self image.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Lower eyelid retraction of &gt;1mm in one or both eyes.

          2. Complaints of either significant ocular symptoms (OSDI&gt;13) or cosmetic deformity
             associated with the eyelid retraction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 21 years: due to lack of data on safety for HAG fillers in pediatric
             population

          2. Age over 65 years of age: as HAG filler effect may be different in this population

          3. Are pregnant or nursing: as there is little safety data on potential teratogenicity of
             HAG fillers

          4. Have a demonstrated allergy to HAG fillers or lidocaine

          5. Have a current infection, skin sore, pimple, rash, hive or cyst over the injection
             site: to avoid worsening the infection or transmitting it

          6. Have a bleeding disorder or currently taking blood-thinning medications such as
             Coumadin or heparin on a daily basis.

          7. Currently active stage Thyroid Eye Disease
