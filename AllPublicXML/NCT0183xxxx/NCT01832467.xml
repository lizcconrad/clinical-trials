      To determine the objective overall response of re-treatment with cetuximab-based chemotherapy
      in patients upon disease progression while under observation, who had previously responded to
      first-line or second-line treatment with cetuximab-based chemotherapy for metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC), but had stopped treatment for reasons other than disease
      progression.

    <description>Cetuximab may be given at either one of the following schedules at the investigator's discretion:
2-weekly: Cetuximab is started on day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy, at 500mg/m2 every 2 weeks over 120/90/60minutes.
Weekly: Cetuximab may be given at a loading dose of 400mg/m2 on day 1over 120 minutes, followed by weekly dosing at 250mg/m2 on day 1, over 60 minutes of each cycle of chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy: Only one of the following regimens may be combined with cetuximab at the investigator's discretion according to institutional standard. Some recommended regimens used in Hong Kong.
Regimens to be combined with biweekly cetuximab:
Irinotecan at 2-weekly schedule.
FOLFIRI (as inpatient or via ambulatory pump).
FOLFOX (as inpatient or via ambulatory pump).</description>

          -  Have progressive disease based on all of the following criteria (from a-d):

             (a) Previously received cetuximab-based chemotherapy as first- or second-line
             treatment for metastatic or recurrent disease with, any one of the following drug
             combinations: (i) Cetuximab, fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin; or, (ii) Cetuximab,
             fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan; or (iii) Cetuximab and irinotecan. (b) Must have
             achieved at least stable disease, partial or complete response to treatment stated in
             '(a)' above.

             (c) Experienced disease progression after more than 60 days from the last date of
             administration of the treatment stated in '(a)' above.

             (d) 'Disease progression' can be defined as radiological or clinical progression.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Radiotherapy, surgery (excluding prior diagnostic biopsy) or any investigational drug
             in the 30 days before enrollment. Radiotherapy for pain relief is allowed as long as
