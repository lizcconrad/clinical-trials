  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to constant strain the joints of the hands are frequently affected by osteoarthritis
      (OA).

      Short-wave diathermy (SWD) is a form of electromagnetic therapy, which causes movement of
      ions, distortion of molecules, and creation of eddy currents and as a result heat is produced
      in deep tissue. Its claimed mechanism of action includes inducing an anti-inflammatory
      response, reducing joint stiffness, stimulating connective tissue repair, and reducing muscle
      spasm and pain.

      Since the available studies were performed to study the large weight-bearing joints only,
      there is a lack in scientific evidence for the efficacy of SWD in hand OA.

      The aim of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect
      of SWD on:

      joint function in patients with hand OA. joint pain in patients with hand OA. grip strength
      in patients with hand OA. quality of live in patients with hand OA.
