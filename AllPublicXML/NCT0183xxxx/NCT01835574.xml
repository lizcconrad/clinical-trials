    <textblock>
      HIV risk among female entertainment and sex workers (FESW) remains high and use of
      amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) significantly increases this risk. We designed a cluster
      randomized stepped wedge trial: The Cambodia Integrated HIV and Drug Prevention
      Implementation [CIPI) study. The CIPI study is embedded within the SMARTgirl HIV prevention
      program. The CIPI study aimed to recruit FESW from 10 provinces, assessing HIV risk exposures
      including ATS use. The CIPI study then tested sequentially delivered, behavioral
      interventions targeting ATS use. The trial combines a 12-week Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT)
      intervention with four-weeks of cognitive-behavioral group aftercare (AC) among FESW who use
      ATS. The primary goal of the CIPI study is to reduce ATS use and unprotected sex among FESW.
      The CCT+AC intervention is being implemented in ten provinces where order of delivery was
      randomized. Outcome assessments (OEs) including biomarkers and self-reported measures of
      recent sexual and ATS use behaviors are conducted prior to implementation, and at three
      6-month intervals after completion. All women who are ATS negative at 6-months, including
      those who have completed the CCT+AC intervention are eligible to participate in a
      micro-enterprise (ME) opportunity. Consultation with multiple groups and stakeholders on
      implementation factors facilitated acceptance and operationalization of the trial.
      Statistical power and sample size calculations were based on expected changes in ATS use and
      unprotected sex at the population level as well as within-subjects. Dissemination of process
      indicators during the multi-year trial is carried out through annual in-country Stakeholder
      Meetings. Provincial 'Close-Out' forums are held at the conclusion of data collection in each
      province. When analysis is completed, dissemination meetings will be held in Cambodia with
      stakeholders, including community-based discussions sessions, policy briefs, and results
      published and presented in the HIV prevention scientific journals and conferences. CIPI is
      the first trial of an intervention to reduce ATS use and HIV risk among FESW in Cambodia.
      Results will inform both CCT+AC implementation in low and middle-income countries and
      programs designed to reach FESW.

      The CIPI Study is 16-week program that combines Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) and
      group-based supportive After Care (AC) for moderate and high risk FESW ATS users using a
      stepped wedge randomized cluster design. The trial tests the CCT+AC intervention in 10
      Cambodian provinces (clusters). Outcome Evaluation (OE) data is collected at 1 time-point
      prior to implementation of the CCT+AC program (Baseline), and 3 time-points after the
      intervention (OE-1, OE-2, and Post-OE) at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline in each
      province. CCT+AC is followed by a linked economic capacity building opportunity. Women who
      are ATS-free, including those negative at baseline and those who successfully complete the
      CCT+AC intervention are eligible for referral to a MicroEnterprise (ME) program. The ME
      program combines financial literacy education and referral to a Cambodian registered
      microfinance organization (Chamroeun) for loan applications that may support alternate
      economic options for participating eligible women.

    <description>The intervention combines a 12-week conditional cash transfer (CCT) intervention with 4-weeks of cognitive-behavioral group aftercare (AC) among women who use ATS. CCT includes thrice weekly urine screening for 12 weeks; participants receive $ for ATS-negative screens. Those with 3 negative screens in a week participants receive a cash bonus, which increase per month to mitigate habituation to the CCT reward schedule. Women who complete &gt;=50% of ATS negative screening visits may participate in a 4-week, cognitive-behavioral AC group delivered immediately after CCT, which includes: 1) experiential group exercises; 2) didactic recovery skills training; 3) meditation and relaxation training; and 4) a ''lucky draw'' which is a form of CCT that provides positive reinforcement for group attendance.</description>
