    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted at multiple sites) study. In this study approximately 209 participants will be
      observed. Participants receiving topiramate will be observed monthly for 3 months. Safety
      assessments will include evaluation of adverse events and body weight of the participants
      which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of this study will be
      approximately 3 months.
