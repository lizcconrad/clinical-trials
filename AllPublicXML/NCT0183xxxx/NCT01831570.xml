      Introduction Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive degradation
      of articular cartilage. Hand OA involves symptomatically more than 1 million of subjects in
      France (i.e., painful or with functional impairment). To date, the treatment of OA is only
      symptomatic and no drugs are able to stop the degradative process of cartilage.

      50% of patients with hand OA exhibit a functional impairment responsible for a severe
      handicap, which is almost similar to rheumatoid arthritis. While the risk factors of hand OA
      are well identified (i.e., familial history, female sex, menopause, obesity), clinical
      outcome in large cohort is poorly known. In addition, the investigators miss predictive
      clinical, biological or imaging factors of severe clinical (i.e. pain, functional impairment
      or aesthetic damage) or structural evolution (i.e., aggravation of radiographic scores).

      Primary objective To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological, genetic
      and imaging factors of clinical aggravation after 6 years of follow-up.

      Secondary objectives To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological,
      genetic and imaging factors of clinical aggravation after 3 years of follow-up.

      To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological, genetic and imaging
      factors of clinical aggravation after 3 years of follow-up.

      To investigate whether variations of clinical evaluation of hand hand OA and radiographic
      structural changes are associated or correlated between inclusion and 3 years of follow-up or
      between inclusion and 6 years follow-up To investigate whether clinical status and
      radiographic alterations are correlated at inclusion To determine whether hand OA is
      associated with OA at other sites or with other hand diseases (carpal tunnel syndrome,
      tendinitis) To evaluate frequency of erosive hand OA among the whole hand OA cohort at
      inclusion, at 3 and 6 years of follow-up To identify clinical, biological, genetic and
      imaging factors associated with erosive hand OA (versus non erosive hand OA) at inclusion or
      during the follow up (3 and 6 years) To investigate predictive clinical, biological, genetic
      and imaging factors of clinical or radiographic aggravation after 3 or 6 years of follow-up
      in the erosive hand OA subgroup

      Methods :

      the investigators plan to include 500 patients in the cohort (5/week) 7 visits (one per year)
      are planned: M0, M12, M24, M36, M48, M60 and M72. A clinical evaluation of hand OA will be
      performed at each visit. At visit M0, M36 and M72, hand radiographs and radiographs of other
      OA localisation (if symptomatic) will be performed.

      A blood sample will be taken at inclusion for biomarker studies and genetic investigations.

      A blood sample will be taken at M36 and M72 to build a prospective serum collection.

      Duration of the study: 8.5 years with 2.5 years of inclusion period Duration of the study for
      one patient: 6 years Recruitment at the Rheumatology Department of Saint-Antoine Hospital
      with a multicentric international steering committee

      Potential outcomes :

        -  Identification of clinical, radiological and biological tools useful to predict clinical
           and structural outcomes

        -  Description of the history course of hand OA and predictive factors of severe evolution
           (i.e. erosive form of hand OA) To integrate in daily practice, clinical and radiological
           tools allowing a standardized follow up of hand OA patients.

      Methods : Prospective observational study The study will be proposed to all patients viewed
      at the out-patient clinic for hand OA which took place in Saint-Antoine Hospital in
      Rheumatology Department since 2004 (usually 12/week). The investigators plan to include 500
      patients in the cohort (5/week).

      7 visits (one per year) are planned: M0, M12, M24, M36, M48, M60 and M72. A clinical
