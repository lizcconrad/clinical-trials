  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle changes often fail due to loss of motivation. Telemedicine and personal coaching
      have the potential to support lifestyle change and weight loss. Therefore, the aim of our
      randomized controlled trial is to examine the effect of telemedicine with and without
      coaching in comparison to a control group on weight loss in overweight participants.

      In an occupational health care setting employees with overweight and/or metabolic syndrome
      will be randomized into a three arm 12-week trial. Participants in the telemedical (TM) and
      telemedical coaching (TMC) group got a weighing machine and a step counter, with automatic
      transfer into a personalized online portal, which could be monitored from both, the
      participant and the study centre. The TMC group weekly will get care calls from the study
      centre aiming to discuss measured data and to fix target agreements. The control group will
      remain in routine care.
