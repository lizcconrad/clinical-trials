      The purpose of the study is to determine if DSC127 is effective in increasing incidence of
      complete wound closure at 10 weeks confirmed at a visit 2 weeks later when compared to the
      vehicle (gel without active ingredient) in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM) who have
      chronic Wagner Grade 1 or 2 plantar neuropathic foot ulcers, 0.75 - 6 cm2 in size.

      Subjects will undergo a two week screening period to assess plantar ulcer healing, and those
      healing less than 30% will be eligible for randomization, providing they meet all other
      inclusion criteria. Four weeks of blinded &quot;treatment&quot; follows the screening period, and an
      observation period of six weeks (to 10 weeks post first treatment) follows the 4-week
      treatment period. If the ulcer closes during the treatment or observation period, the closure
      will be confirmed two weeks later, and at this time the subject enters a durability
      assessment period of up to 12 weeks.

      All aspects of Standard of Care are followed throughout the study period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ambulatory subject age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent

          2. Has type 1 or type 2 DM under metabolic control as confirmed by a glycosylated
             hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≤12% and a serum creatinine level of ≤3mg/dL

          3. At Screening and at Baseline (prior to randomization), subject has at least one ulcer
             that fulfills all of the following criteria:

               -  Present for ≥1 month and ≤1 year

               -  Partial- or full- thickness and not involving bone, tendon, or capsule (probing
                  to tendon or capsule), i.e. Wagner Grade 1 or 2

               -  Has no sign of infection or osteomyelitis

               -  Plantar neuropathic ulcer; ulcer must be predominantly on the plantar surface of
                  the foot to ensure adequate off-loading and may include the toes

               -  Size of the target ulcer must be 0.75 - 6 cm2

               -  Target ulcer must be non-healing as defined as &lt;30% reduction in size in response
                  to standard of care during the two week Screening Period

                    -  If more than one ulcer is present that meets the inclusion criteria, the
                       largest one will be considered the Target ulcer.

                    -  If there are two ulcers of the same size that meet all criteria, the one
                       with the higher Wagner Grade will be considered the Target ulcer.

                    -  If there are two ulcers of the same size and the same Wagner Grade, the one
                       present for the longest qualifying time will be the Target ulcer.

          4. Has an ankle brachial index (ABI) ≥ 0.7 on the foot with the target ulcer

          5. Has an assessment of the baseline level of neuropathy of the foot using
             Semmes-Weinstein filaments.

          6. A female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             at the time of Screening, and must be willing to use a medically acceptable method of
             birth control, such as Essure®, hormonal contraception (oral pills, implantable
             device, or skin patch), intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or double barrier
             throughout the study. A female subject of childbearing potential who practices
             abstinence is not required to employ birth control.

          7. Has the ability and willingness to understand and comply with study procedures and to
             give written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study or initiation of study
             procedures

          1. Has a known hypersensitivity to any of the investigational drug or vehicle components

          2. Has been exposed to any investigational agent within 30 days of entry into the study

          3. A female who is pregnant or nursing

          4. Has active malignant disease of any kind except for basal cell carcinoma (of the
             skin). A subject, who has had a malignant disease in the past, was treated and is
             currently disease-free, may be considered for study entry.

          5. Has a hemoglobin of less than 8.5 gm/dL.

             screening)

         10. Has an ulcer primarily ischemic in etiology

         11. Has sickle-cell anemia, Reynaud's, or other peripheral vascular disease

         12. Has received a biologic agent, growth factors or skin equivalents (Regranex®,
