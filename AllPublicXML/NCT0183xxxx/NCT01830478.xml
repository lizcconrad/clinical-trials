      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lenalidomide in association with rituximab
      is effective in the treatment of patients with indolent non follicular NHL relapsed after
      &gt;=2, but less than 4 prior lines of (immuno)chemotherapy.

      Single arm, multicenter, open-label study divided in two phases: 1. Induction phase; 2.
      Follow-up phase. Enrolled patients will start the induction phase and receive the courses of
      R-Lenalidomide. At the end of the third cycle of R-Lenalidomide (week 12 of the study), the
      patients will be evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment); the patients with
      Progressive Disease (PD) will be withdrawn of the study. Two weeks after the end last courses
      of R-Lenalidomide (week 26 of the study) patients will be evaluated for tumor response
      (complete assessment). Patients with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), and
      with a stable disease will undergo the follow up phase, while patients with PD will be
      withdrawn of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological confirmed diagnosis of B-Cell non follicular NHL according to REAL/WHO
             Classification: small lymphocytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom
             macroglobulinemia, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma,
             extranodal non-gastric marginal zone lymphoma

          -  Availability of tissue biopsy mandatory when suspected pathological sites (nodal or
             extranodal) are easily accessible and in presence of extranodal non-gastric marginal
             or nodal marginal zone lymphoma diagnosis. In the other cases bone marrow biopsy, when
             representative, may be considered sufficient for defining lymphoma histotype

          -  Disease relapsing after &gt;=2, but less than 4 prior lines of (immuno)chemotherapy. At
             least one of previous treatment had to include rituximab

          -  Presence of at least one of the following criteria for the definition of active
             disease: systemic symptoms, bulky disease, progressive marrow failure and/or
             splenomegaly and/or lymph adenopathy
