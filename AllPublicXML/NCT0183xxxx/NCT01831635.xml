  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of data on the aetiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The
      investigators conducted a systematic review of the literature which identified several cohort
      and case-control studies that have investigated a wide range of potential medical,
      environmental and occupational risk factors. However, these studies have been limited by a
      wide variation in case definition and small sample sizes limiting the potential to detect
      modest risk differences between cases and controls. The research group propose an exploratory
      case-control study of 100 patients with classic MPNs and 200 controls to determine the
      optimal methods for roll out of this study to a multi-centred UK-based case-control study
      that will investigate the aetiology of MPN subtypes. The objectives of the study are to
      evaluate recruitment procedures, response rates, the development of a telephone administered
      questionnaire, compare occupational exposure assessment using OccIDEAS, a novel web based
      program, with a job-exposure matrix (FINJEM), evaluate the feasibility of collection of DNA
      from saliva compared to blood samples, identify potential aetiologic factors associated with
      MPNs and explore assessment of quality of life. The findings of this exploratory study will
      form the basis of a protocol for a large United Kingdom (UK)-wide case-control study of MPNs.
