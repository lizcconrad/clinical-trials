    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the expression of Melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3),
      Melanoma-associated antigen C2 (MAGE-C2), New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1
      (NY-ESO-1), L antigen family member 1 (LAGE-1), Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) and PRAME
      (PReferentially expressed Antigen of MElanoma) tumor antigens in a large number of
      pathologically proven stage I, II and III NSCLC samples of Asiatic patients.

      This study will be based upon the analysis of samples and patient-related data already
      available at the various investigation sites. There will be no study treatment and no
      study-specific procedure carried out on the patients.

      Clinical data collected will include patient demographics (age, gender), Tumor, Node,
      Metastasis (staging system) [TNM stage], histopathologic description and the patient smoker
      status. Strict anonymity of patient data will be maintained.

      This retrospective study is based upon the analysis of archived formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tissue samples and patient-related data already available at the
      investigational site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion of a tissue sample, all of the following criteria must be met:

          -  The patient had pathologically proven stage I, II or III NSCLC.

          -  All the data required are available from patient's records.

          -  Many patients may no longer be alive, or no longer be in contact with the
             investigation sites. Thus, patients will not be required to give their informed
             consent before inclusion in the study.
