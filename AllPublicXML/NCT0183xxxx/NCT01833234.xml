  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a questionnaire that can quickly measure the impact that
      epilepsy has on a person's life. This questionnaire will be useful in following whether the
      impact of epilepsy increases, decreases or stays the same over time. The results also may
      point out areas that would benefit from discussion or attention in visits with your doctor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have used a set of broad open-ended questions about the impact of epilepsy
      on a person's life to formulate a long list of questions to characterize the impact the
      seizures, medications, and comorbidities that you are having. In the future, this will be
      boiled down to a short list of questions.
