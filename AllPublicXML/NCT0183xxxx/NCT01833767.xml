    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine response rates by administering low dose
      cyclophosphamide on day 1, followed by 5 days of outpatient IL2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Patients may have
             received prior systemic therapy or may be previously untreated.

          2. Patients must have measurable disease on physical exam or radiologic studies.

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and estimated survival of at least 3 months.

          4. White blood count of &gt; 3500/mm3, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 gm/dl;
             bilirubin, ALT, AST &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal; serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl.

          5. Patients must undergo a low-level cardiac stress test as a screen for possible
             atherosclerotic heart disease. Patients with a positive stress test would be excluded
             from this trial.

          6. Patients with elevated temperatures &gt; 100.5 F must have sources of occult infection
             excluded.

          7. Patients must be felt to have recovered from effects of prior therapy, such as &gt; 2
             weeks after prior chemotherapy.

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and adequate
             precautions to prevent pregnancy during treatment must be taken.

          9. Patient consent must be obtained prior to entrance onto study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Medical illness requiring corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents (such
             as cyclosporin or methotrexate.

             2. Autoimmune disease such as inflammatory arthritis which could be exacerbated by
             immune-based therapy.

             3. Prior history of psychiatric disorder which could be exacerbated by interleukin-2.

             4. Lactation or pregnancy.

             5. Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease including history of recent (&lt; 6
             months prior) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, primary cardiac
             arrhythmias (not due to electrolyte disorder or drug toxicity, for example) beyond
             occasional PVC's, angina, positive low-level stress test, or cerebrovascular accident.

             6. Current untreated brain metastasis.
