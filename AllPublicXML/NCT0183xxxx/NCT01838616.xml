  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a clinical effectiveness trial designed to compare the effectiveness, safety, and
      tolerability of treatment with tapentadol prolonged release with that of oxycodone/naloxone
      prolonged release in non-opioid pre-treated subjects with severe chronic low back pain with a
      neuropathic pain component.

      Both tapentadol and the opioid oxycodone are effective in chronic severe pain and tapentadol
      and oxycodone/naloxone have shown advantages in gastrointestinal tolerability versus
      oxycodone. Therefore, it was of high scientific interest to compare the latter 2 analgesics
      with respect to gastrointestinal tolerability. Tapentadol may have advantages regarding the
      neuropathic pain-related symptoms of low back pain due to its 2 mechanisms of action.

    <measure>Change in the Average Pain Intensity Score on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization Visit); End of Continuation Period (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>For this pain assessment, the participant indicated the level of average pain experienced over the previous 3 days on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-3) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The value reported represents the change from the randomization visit (i.e., the last 3 days in the washout period prior to Investigational Medicinal Product initiation and titration) to the end of the continuation period (i.e., up to 9 weeks on the stable dose). The theoretical values range from -10 to 10. A negative sign indicates a decrease in pain from the start of treatment. The higher the absolute values, the greater the change since the start of treatment (Baseline Visit).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Randomization Visit); End of Continuation Period (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assessed the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants were asked &quot;How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?&quot; e.g. &quot;Pain in your stomach&quot;. There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on abdominal symptoms, 3 on rectal symptoms and 5 on stool symptoms. Responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). If the changes in the overall or subscale scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation. The change in the assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) total score from the Randomization Visit to the Final Evaluation Visit. The PAC-SYM overall score is the sum of scores of all non-missing items divided by the number of non-missing items (if at least 6 items were non-missing).</description>

          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of chronic low back pain; chronic pain defined as
             pain lasting for at least 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Participant's pain must require a strong analgesic (defined as World Health
             Organization Step III) as judged by the investigator.

          -  Participants who require a washout of co-analgesics at enrolment must have an average
             pain score (NRS-3) of 5 points or higher. Participants who do not require a washout of
             co-analgesics at enrollment must have an average pain intensity score (NRS-3) during
             the last 3 days of 6 points or higher.

          -  The painDETECT diagnostic screening questionnaire must be either &quot;positive&quot; (score of
             19 to 38 inclusive) or &quot;unclear&quot; (score of 13 to 18 inclusive). If the participant is
             being treated with a stable regimen of centrally acting co-analgesics, a &quot;negative&quot;
             painDETECT score (score 9 points or higher).

        Inclusion criteria prior to allocation to treatment:

          -  Participants must have an average pain intensity score (NRS-3) during the last 3 days
             of 6 points or higher.

          -  Participants must score either &quot;positive&quot; (score of 19 to 38 inclusive) or &quot;unclear&quot;
             (score of 13 to 18 inclusive) on the painDETECT diagnostic screening questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a clinically significant disease or clinical laboratory values that in the

          <description>The painDETECT questionnaire was used to determine the possibility of the presence of a neuropathic pain component. It is a participant completed questionnaire. A total score is calculated. Participants with a score between 0 and 12 are scored as being &quot;negative&quot; (no neuropathic pain component). Value between 19 and 38 as being &quot;positive&quot; (presence of neuropathic component)&quot;. Values from 13 to 18 are scored as being &quot;unclear&quot;. Participants being treated with a stable regimen of centrally acting co-analgesics at baseline were permitted if the score was at least 9.</description>

        <title>Change in the Average Pain Intensity Score on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-3)</title>
        <description>For this pain assessment, the participant indicated the level of average pain experienced over the previous 3 days on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-3) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The value reported represents the change from the randomization visit (i.e., the last 3 days in the washout period prior to Investigational Medicinal Product initiation and titration) to the end of the continuation period (i.e., up to 9 weeks on the stable dose). The theoretical values range from -10 to 10. A negative sign indicates a decrease in pain from the start of treatment. The higher the absolute values, the greater the change since the start of treatment (Baseline Visit).</description>

The value reported represents the change from the randomization visit (i.e., the last 3 days in the washout period prior to Investigational Medicinal Product initiation and titration) to the end of the continuation period (i.e., up to 9 weeks on the stable dose). The theoretical values range from -10 to 10. A negative sign indicates a decrease in pain from the start of treatment. The higher the absolute values, the greater the change since the start of treatment (Baseline Visit).</description>

        <title>Change in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assessed the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants were asked &quot;How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?&quot; e.g. &quot;Pain in your stomach&quot;. There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on abdominal symptoms, 3 on rectal symptoms and 5 on stool symptoms. Responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). If the changes in the overall or subscale scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation. The change in the assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) total score from the Randomization Visit to the Final Evaluation Visit. The PAC-SYM overall score is the sum of scores of all non-missing items divided by the number of non-missing items (if at least 6 items were non-missing).</description>

          <title>Change of Average Pain Intensity Over Three Days for Pain Radiating Towards or Into the Leg at the End of Treatment</title>
          <description>Typical dermatomal pain was defined as being pain that radiates beyond the knee towards the foot (sciatica) or pain evoked by stretching of the sciatic nerve.
Therefore, the participant was asked to rate their pain intensity over the past 3 days with regards to this particular pain characteristic.
The recalled average pain intensity during the last 24 hours was assessed using an 11-point Numeric rating scale, where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine.
A negative sign indicates that there was a decrease in the average pain radiating towards or into the leg.</description>

Based on these questions a final assessment score was calculated. The minimum score ranged from zero to a maximum of 38. Participants with a score between 0 and 12 were scored as being “negative” (had no neuropathic pain component). A value between 19 and 38 was rated as being “positive” (neuropathic component present). Values from 13 to 18 were scored as being “unclear”. The theoretical range of change in this trial ranged from -38 to 15. A negative change indicated a decrease in their neuropathic component of pain.</description>

        <title>Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) Sub-scores and Overall Score Assessment</title>
        <description>In the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) the participant rated their symptoms of neuropathic pain. Ten pain questions were answered on an 11-point scale; from 0 (symptom not present) to 10 (symptom at its worst imaginable intensity, e.g. worst burning imaginable). The overall NPSI score was calculated by the summation of all ten responses and ranges between 0 and 1. For pain descriptions burning, pressing, paroxysmal (pain like electric shocks or stabbing), evoked (due to touch) and paresthesia (sensation that is not unpleasant) or dysesthesia (unpleasant) sub-scores are reported. The overall values reported for all participants that completed the questionnaire are shown. A symptom was absent if the value is 0, the symptom was present in all participants and all participants rated it at its worst possible intensity if a value is 1.</description>

The overall NPSI score was calculated by the summation of all ten responses and ranges between 0 and 1. For pain descriptions burning, pressing, paroxysmal (pain like electric shocks or stabbing), evoked (due to touch) and paresthesia (sensation that is not unpleasant) or dysesthesia (unpleasant) sub-scores are reported. The overall values reported for all participants that completed the questionnaire are shown. A symptom was absent if the value is 0, the symptom was present in all participants and all participants rated it at its worst possible intensity if a value is 1.</description>

Ten pain questions were answered on an 11-point scale, from 0 (symptom not present) to 10 (symptom at its worst imaginable intensity, e.g. worst burning imaginable). The overall NPSI score was calculated by the summation of all ten responses and ranges between 0 and 1. For pain descriptions burning, pressing, paroxysmal (pain like electric shocks or stabbing), evoked (due to touch) and paresthesia (sensation that is not unpleasant) or dysesthesia (unpleasant) sub-scores are reported. The overall values reported for all participants that completed the questionnaire are shown. A symptom was absent if the value is 0, the symptom was present in all participants and all participants rated it at its worst possible intensity if a value is 1. A negative change indicates that the intensity of the symptom has decreased since the start of treatment.</description>

        <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) has several brief broad questions on 8 aspects of health (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) that a participant was asked to score over the last week. The physical and mental summary scores were calculated from the individual responses. A higher score indicates a better participant perceived state of health. All domains were scored on a scale from 0 (lowest level of health) to 100 (highest level of health), with 100 representing the best possible health state.</description>

        <title>Changes in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) has several brief broad questions on 8 aspects of health (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health) that a participant was asked to score over the last week. The physical and mental summary scores were calculated from the individual responses. A higher score indicates a better participant perceived state of health. All domains were scored on a scale from 0 (lowest level of health) to 100 (highest level of health), with 100 representing the best possible health state.
The change in the SF-12 score shows an improvement in health from baseline if the values are positive. The higher the value the greater the improvement since starting the trial.</description>

        <title>EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D) Health Status Index Outcome</title>
        <description>The participant scored the EuroQol-5 questionnaire. The EuroQol-5 questionnaire uses a health state classification with 5 dimensions. Each dimension was assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1 (with 1 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing &quot;dead&quot;). The higher the values (the closer the value is to 1) the better the health status in a treatment group.</description>

        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessment scale for the symptom severity of anxiety disorders and depression. It comprises 14 items. Seven statements describe anxiety. Each answer is scored on a four-point scale (0-3). All seven answers are summed to a total score with a maximum score of 21 points. A score below 7 is not considered to indicate anxiety. A score of 11 or above is considered to be a case of anxiety.
A decrease in values over the trial period indicate that there has been an improvement.</description>

        <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: Depression</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessment scale for the symptom severity of anxiety disorders and depression. It comprises 14 items. Seven statements describe depression. Each answer is scored on a four-point scale (0-3). All seven answers are summed to a total score with a maximum score of 21 points. A score below 7 is not considered to indicate depression. A score of 11 or above is considered to be a case of depression. A decrease in values over time indicates that there has been an improvement.</description>
