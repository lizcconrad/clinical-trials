  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of PICO study is to design an aquatic exercise program specific for obese individuals
      with knee osteoarthritis which the main goals are OA symptoms management and the improvement
      of physical fitness. The author's opinion is that the musculoskeletal pain is the main
      constraint for any kind of mobility and its control should be considered as an important goal
      in the weight management's programs. Therefore the PICO project proposes an aquatic exercise
      program to controlling pain and other symptoms management, showing that it is possible to
      live with the disease, and motivating the change in lifestyle, thus preventing the
      installation or worsening of KOA. In this way, five hypotheses were formulated: H1. 3 months
      of aquatic exercise is enough to improve KOA symptoms and functionality in obese individuals;
      H2. The gait parameters of obese individuals with KOA can be improved by aquatic exercise;
      H3. Beyond the exercises skills, aquatic exercise group classes can work with an educational
      component, promoting lifestyles changes. H4: Pain reduction and a better psychological status
      can lead an increase of functionally, increasing amount of physical activity. H5: Even if the
      main goal is not weight management, the aquatic exercise program can lead a weight reduction
      or body composition change.

      The PICO program is an overall body fitness and mind intervention through aquatic exercise
      involving as well an education component, created specifically for individuals with KOA. Its
      a single-blinded, one center, and randomized controlled trial with 3 months duration.
      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: aquatic exercise (AE) and control
      group (CG) which will participate in an educational program with the same hourly load.

    <description>The communitarian PESO program is based on appropriate clinical guidelines and on validated behavior change principles. Implemented by an intervention team with expertise gained from current scientific research in weight control determinants, this program as well PICO, is free of charge for all interested adults who wish to manage their weight and health. It operates since 2005 with the aims to prevent obesity or reduce excess weight, as well as, some of the risks associated with obesity in adults through a change to steady healthy habits, attitudes and behaviors. PESO has 3 months duration and it is structured in 12 sessions of one and a half hour, once a week.</description>

    <description>Aquatic Exercise program is organized in 24 sessions distributed over 12 consecutive weeks, with a frequency of twice a week. The duration of each session will be 60 minutes, being that 10 minutes are for patient reception, blood pressure control, pain register or others and the effective time inside the water is 45 minutes. The indoor pool works with an air temperature around 27±1ºC and water temperature is controlled for 30.5±5ºC. Workout is organized in order to have a progressive overload every week or every two sessions, when occurs an introduction of a new stimulus. Water is the main instrument to create resistance and only in the last weeks, according with participants progression and if the self-reported pain controlled, drag equipment will be added.</description>
