    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate usefulness of the respirophasic variation in carotid
      artery peak flow velocity measured by Doppler ultrasound, which is noninvasive and easily
      accessible, as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with coronary artery disease.

    <description>After induction of anesthesia, peak velocity of carotid artery blood flow is measured by the pulsed wave Doppler signal obtained from the left common carotid artery. Respirophasic variation of the peak velocity is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of peak velocity divided by the mean of the two values during one respiratory cycle. Fluid responder is defined as a patient whose stroke volume index is increased â‰¥15% after volume expansion. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to descriminiate fluid responder is performed.</description>
