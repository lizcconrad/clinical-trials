    <textblock>
      Open-label randomized phase III trial, using a non-inferiority comparison design. After
      randomization,patients will receive either post-operative radioiodine ablation with an
      activity of 1.1 GBq (30 mCi) after stimulation by rhTSH, and then be followed-up (ablation
      group) or be followed-up (without postoperative radioiodine ablation) (follow-up group).

      The objective is to assess the non-inferiority of the proportion of patients without
      tumor-related event evaluated at three years after randomisation in the absence of
      radioiodine ablation (follow-up group) compared to the ablation group, in patients with
      low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy with or without lymph
      node dissection (pT1am N0 or Nx, pT1b N0 or Nx)

    <description>Administration of 1.1 GBq of I131 is given after the second intramuscular injections of rhTSH (0.9 mg). A whole body scan (WBS) is performed 2 to 5 days after the administration or I131 with determination of the neck uptake.
Follow-up consists in:
10 (+/- 2 months) after randomization: neck ultrasound + a serum Tg measurement after rhTSH stimulation
2 years (+/- 2 months) after randomization: serum Tg measurement under LT4 treatment (Tg/LT4)
3 years (+/- 2 months) after randomization: neck ultrasound and a serum Tg/LT4
