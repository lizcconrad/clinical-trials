    <textblock>
      There are quite a few qualitative studies done to find out patients experience of chronic
      pain. There are no studies on what the patients feel and what thoughts and feelings arise in
      the patients that are exposed to interventional pain management. This study aims to
      illuminate how it is to live through an interventional pain management program.
