      Background: Accidental falls result in major physical and psychological morbidity in the
      elderly.

      Aim: To evaluate effects of lower-limb strength and flexibility program, which is analyzed
      under the control of other risk factors, on preventing recurrent falls and fall- related
      injuries in the community-dwelling elderly faller.

      Methods: The randomized double blind, longitudinal study will enroll about 780 elderly
      fallers, who are aged more than 70 years old. They are retrieved from the &quot;Adult Health
      Examination&quot; and allocated into intervention group and control group. All the fallers have at
      least one risk factor of accidental falls and no indication for exclusion criteria. Health
      professionals assess the risk factors of falls and provide medical educations and suggestions
      to all subjects concerning modification of environmental hazards, dizziness, multiple drugs
      use, and general transfer skill, etc. Physical therapists instruct the elderly of
      intervention group to do lower-limb strength and flexibility program by the aid of Theraband.
      There are three times of variables measurement at baseline, 6 months and 12 months after
      examination. Differences in baseline characteristics between groups are tested by independent
      samples t test, Mann Whitney U test, or Chi-square test. To compare the outcomes in different
      groups, the investigators evaluate balance and mobility with multiple linear regression,
      accidental falls or not with logistic regression, and all-related injuries with Cox's
      proportional hazard model.
