  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating two ways of treating pain after hip surgery. One way is
      though a thin tube (called a catheter), and it is placed into the back so that pain-numbing
      drugs can reach the nerves near the backbone. This is called an &quot;epidural&quot; catheter. Another
      way is to place the catheter close to the hip, where the surgery is done, so that the
      pain-numbing drugs can reach some of the nerves more locally. This is called a &quot;fascia iliaca
      compartment&quot; catheter.

      The investigators do not know which way is best to treat pain, or has fewer side effects, or
      allows a patient to leave hospital faster. Usually, patients would receive only one type of
      catheter for pain relief. To do this comparison, the investigators would place both catheter
      types, so that patients help us tell which one works better.
