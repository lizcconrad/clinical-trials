    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important cause of in-hospital mortality and may be
      rapidly fatal if not diagnosed and treated. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and
      therapeutic modalities, it is still one of the important causes of hospital mortality.
      Previous several reports have described the variable outcome of patients with PE with
      reported mortality rate ranging from 8.1% (stable patients) to 25% (with cardiogenic shock)
      and 65% (post cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Nevertheless, there are no published studies
      from Korean hospitals that assessed the outcome of acute PE treated in the hospital with IV
      unfractionated heparin. We conducted this study to determine the outcome, risk factors,
      clinical characteristics and demographics of patients with acute PE and to identify possible
      demographic and clinical factors associated with prognosis.
