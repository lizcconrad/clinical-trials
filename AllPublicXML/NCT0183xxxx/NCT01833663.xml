      This study is a multi-site, randomized, opened and parallel-controlled clinical study.

      The patients up to the inclusion criteria are randomly treated with Solifenacin Succinate
      Tablets (5mg/d) or Solifenacin Succinate Tablets (5mg/d) + local estrogen for 12 weeks.
      Before the dosing and at Week 4, 8 and 12 of the dosing, various examinations are made, and
      various indices are evaluated.
