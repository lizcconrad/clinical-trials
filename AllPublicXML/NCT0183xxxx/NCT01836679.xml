  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide combined with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate efficacy which includes the progression free survival (PFS), PFS at
      6 months, objective response rate, duration of response rate, overall survival and time to
      progression, and safety which include adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests, of the
      treatment of chidamide plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non small
      cell lung cancer.
