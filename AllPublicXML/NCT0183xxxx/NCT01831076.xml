  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well exemestane before surgery works in treating
      postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive stage II-III breast
      cancer. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      exemestane may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop preliminary data regarding the efficacy and safety of exemestane in
      the preoperative treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+ or PR+ tumors. This trial is also
      designed to develop a predictive model to correlate expression of the known isoforms of ER
      and progesterone receptor (PR) and the aromatase enzyme with response to estrogenic
      deprivation using exemestane.

          -  Newly diagnosed

          -  Patients with prior non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease
             free for &gt;= 5 years before study entry; patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin that has been effectively treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that
             has been treated by surgery only, or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the
             ipsilateral or contralateral breast that has been treated by surgery only are
             eligible, even if the cancer was diagnosed within 5 years before randomization

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Hemoglobin within normal limits for institution

             serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x
             ULN

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN for institution
