    <textblock>
      The investigators enrolled 90 patients on maintenance hemodialysis with dialytic vintage ≥12
      months, iPTH 150-300pg/ml and serum calcium&lt;2.5mmol/L. Patients were randomized to three
      groups with different dialysate calcium concentration , 1.25 mmol/L(DCa1.25),
      1.5mmol/L(DCa1.5) and 1.75 mmol/L(DCa1.75) for 24 months respectively. Hemodialysis was
      performed for 4 hours three times weekly. Serum total calcium(tCa), ionized
      calcium(iCa),intact parathyroid hormone(iPTH)and phosphorus (P) levels were recorded before
      and after the study and single dialysis session in every patient. iCa and P levels were
      measured in spent dialysate.Bone density, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase(BAP),
      osteoprotegerin(OPG)、β-crosslaps、total Procollagen Type I Intact Propeptide (P1NP）and
      vascular calcification were measured in every patient periodically. vascular calcification
      including aortic arch calcification, abdominal aorta calcification and coronary artery
      calcification were measured by chest radiography, lateral lumbar radiographs and coronary
      artery computer tomography (CT) respectively. The primary endpoints included death,
      cardio-cerebral vascular disease(defined as heart failure, myocardial infarction and stroke),
      newly nontraumatic bone fracture, secondary parathyroidism uncontrolled by medicine and
      valvular or vascular calcification. The secondary endpoint were admission or emergency
      observation.
