  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. Partial
      hepatectomy is still considered as the conventional therapy for HCC. Intrahepatic recurrence
      of HCC after partial hepatectomy is common and was reported to be more than 77% within 5
      years after surgery. Repeat hepatectomy is an effective treatment for intrahepatic HCC
      recurrence, with a 5-year survival rate of 19.4-56%. This is comparable to the survival after
      initial hepatectomy for HCC. Unfortunately, repeat hepatectomy could be carried out only in a
      small proportion of patients with HCC recurrence (10.4-31%), either because of the poor
      functional liver reserve or because of widespread intrahepatic recurrence. In the past two
      decades, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) has emerged as a new treatment modality
      and has attracted great interest because of its effectiveness and safety for small HCC (≤ 5.0
      cm). Studies using PRFA to treat recurrent HCC after partial hepatectomy reported a 3-year
      survival rate of 62-68%, which is comparable to those achieved by surgery. PRFA is
      particularly suitable to treat recurrent HCC after partial hepatectomy because these tumors
      are usually detected when they are small and PRFA causes the least deterioration of liver
      function in the patients. Our previous retrospective study demonstrated that RFA was
      comparable to re-resection for recurrent HCC, and our recent RCT showed that RFA combined
      with TACE is superior to RFA for HCC ≤7.0cm. So our hypothesis is that RFA combined with TACE
      is superior to re-resection for recurrent small HCC. The aim of this retrospective study is
      to compare the outcome of reresection with TACE+RFA for small recurrent HCC after partial
      hepatectomy.

    <description>TACE was performed according to the following protocol: All patients underwent a distal super-selective catheterization of the hepatic arteries using a coaxial technique and micro-catheters (2.9 Fr, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Then, the same three chemotherapeutic agents at the same dosages were used throughout this study, regardless of tumor number and size. Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy was performed using carboplatin 300 mg. After that, chemolipiodolization was performed using epirubicin 50 mg, and mitomycin C 8 mg mixed with 5 mL of lipiodol. If the territory of the chemolipiodolized artery did not show stagnant flow, pure lipiodol was then injected. RFA was performed after TACE in 2 months by using a commercially available system (RF 2000; Radio-Therapeutics Mountain View, CA), and a needle electrode with a 15 Ga insulated cannula with 10 hook-shaped expandable electrode tines with a diameter of 3.5 cm at expansion (LeVeen; RadioTherapeutics).</description>

    <description>Re-resection was carried out under general anesthesia using a right subcostal incision with a midline extension. Intra-operative ultrasonography was performed routinely to evaluate the tumor burden, liver remnant and the possibility of a negative resection margin. We performed anatomical resection aiming at a resection margin of at least 1 cm. Pringle's maneuver was routinely used with a clamp and unclamp time of 10 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. Hemostasis of the raw liver surface was done with suturing and application of fibrin glue.</description>
