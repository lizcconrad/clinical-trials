  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant recipients usually lose their graft by rejection or by immunosuppressive
      drugs toxicity. In kidney transplantation, calcineurin-inhibitors (including cyclosporine A)
      are widely used. Their renal toxicity could be divided between an acute toxicity (toxic
      arteriolopathy and toxic tubulopathy) and a chronic toxicity (hyaline arteriolopathy,
      interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis). Several animal models have
      shown the implication of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation in those toxic
      phenomenons. The use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is useful regarding to the
      renal function and kidney histological damages.

      Several antagonists are available in France but none is indicated in kidney transplantation.
      Eplerenone appears to be the most selective molecule of the mineralocorticoid receptor and to
      have less adverse anti-androgenic effects than others molecules. Its principal adverse events
      are hyperkalemia and orthostatic hypotension. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,
      especially eplerenone, could be very useful in the prevention of the nephrotoxicity induced
      by calcineurin-inhibitors.

      Classically, eplerenone is contra-indicated in patients presenting with an impaired renal
      function, determined by a creatinine clearance under 50mL/min. Moreover, in France, a warning
      is especially notified for the association with cyclosporine A due to the fact that no study
      have been done in this context.

      The investigators study first the safety of the use of eplerenone in association with
      cyclosporine A in kidney transplant recipients. Then, if it is safe, the investigators will
      study its efficiency in a large randomized controlled trial.
