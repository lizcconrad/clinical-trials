      A spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to any injury to the spinal cord that is caused by trauma
      instead of disease.[1] Depending on where the spinal cord and nerve roots are damaged, the
      symptoms can vary widely, from pain to paralysis to incontinence.[2][3] Spinal cord injuries
      are described at various levels of &quot;incomplete&quot;, which can vary from having no effect on the
      patient to a &quot;complete&quot; injury which means a total loss of function.Injuries at any level can
      cause:Increased muscle tone (spasticity),Loss of normal bowel and bladder control (may
      include constipation, incontinence, bladder spasms),Numbness,Sensory changes Pain,Weakness,
      paralysis. This Study is a single arm,Phase I/II , single centre trial to check active
      comparing the safety and efficacy of Bone marrow derived autologous cell(100 million per
      dose) trial to be conducted for 36 months.
