  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no previous reports on the use of Onabotulinum Toxin A to treat men with scrotal
      pain that we found published. We propose a pilot study to use Botox to block the testicular
      nerves on a group of 15 men with chronic scrotal pain who have failed the standard medical
      therapy. The men must have had temporary relief from a testicular cord block using marcaine.
      Before and 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the Onabotulinum Toxin A injection, the men
      would be asked to fill in visual analog scales for pain, a quality of life assessment, a
      depression index (MDI) and Chronic Epididymitis Symptom Index (CESI). They will also be
      subject to sensory testing of the scrotum before, after 1 month, 3 moths and 6 months.

    <description>Change in pain is measured by visual analog scales for pain, a quality of life assessment, a depression index (MDI) and Chronic Epididymitis Symptom Index (CESI) before therapy and 1, 3 and 6 months post therapy. In addition, physical examination of the testis and epididymis and sensory testing of the skin of the scrotum and anterior thigh before the therapy and 1, 3 and 6 months post therapy. The sensory testing will be the patients' subjective reporting of the sensation felt with light touch (normal, decreased, increased or painful) and pin prick (decreased, normal or increased) in the skin of the scrotum and anterior thigh of the treated side (the side where the therapy was used) compared to the untreated side (where no therapy was used).</description>
