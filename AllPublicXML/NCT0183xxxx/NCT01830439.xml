  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, balanced, single-dose, two-period,
      two-sequence, crossover, open-label study to evaluate the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics of PA-824. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that the rate and
      extent of absorption of two doses of PA-824 (50mg or 400 mg and 200mg) are the same after a
      high-calorie, high-fat meal as compared with after a minimum 10-hour fast.

      For each of the two dose levels 16 subjects with approximately 8 men and 8 women, will be
      enrolled for a total of 32 subjects.
