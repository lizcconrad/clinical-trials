    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II trial studies the safety and effectiveness of lenalidomide with or without
      idelalisib. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Idelalisib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether
      lenalidomide is more effective with or without idelalisib in treating mantle cell lymphoma.

      A notice of temporary accrual suspension for Alliance A051201 was issued on 1/28/14. The
      study was suspended to new patient accrual until a protocol amendment was finalized, which
      provided revised treatment instructions. The study was reactivated on 4/22/14 including the
      removal of the rituximab treatment arm.

      Outline: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      The phase I treatment plan includes the following:

        1. Lenalidomide will be tested at sequential dose levels in a standard 3+3 design.

             1. Dose Level 0 = 15mg/day for days 1-21 every 28 days

             2. Dose Level 1 = 20mg/day for days 1-21 every 28 days and

             3. Dose Level 2 = 25mg/day for days 1-21 every 28 days.

           Patients can continue lenalidomide for up to 48 weeks (12 cycles) of treatment.

        2. Idelalisib will be orally administered starting at 150 mg twice daily for continuous
           28-day cycles until progression, intolerance, or patient/physician discretion. The dose
           is the same in dose levels 0, 1, and 2.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in the Phase II treatment plan. The primary
      and secondary objectives for this study are:

        1. Phase I Primary Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination
           of lenalidomide with idelalisib in sequential dose cohorts.

        2. Phase II Primary Objective: To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of the
           combination of lenalidomide with or without idelalisib in a randomized phase II design.

        3. Phase II Secondary Objectives:

             1. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), and
                overall survival (OS) of the combination of lenalidomide with or without idelalisib
                in a randomized phase II design.

             2. To determine the prognostic and/or predictive significance of proliferation markers
                and cell cycle components in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma
                (MCL) treated with idelalisib and lenalidomide.

             3. To determine whether phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) expression levels are
                correlated with response to idelalisib plus lenalidomide.

             4. To determine whether Notch activation as assessed by notch homolog 1,
                translocation- association (NOTCH1) intracellular domain (ICD) immunohistochemistry
                (IHC) correlates with NOTCH1 mutational status and outcome in MCL patients treated
                with idelalisib and lenalidomide.

             5. To determine whether sex determining region Y-box 11 (SOX11) expression correlates
                with response in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL treated with idelalisib and
                lenalidomide.

             6. To correlate cereblon (CRBN) expression with response in patients with
                relapsed/refractory MCL treated with idelalisib and lenalidomide.

             7. To evaluate several plasma cytokines and correlate observed changes to objective
                response rates.

               1. Histologically documented mantle cell lymphoma, with the following
                  immunophenotypic characteristics: cluster of differentiation (CD)5+, (CD)23-,
                  cyclin D1+; this may be from an initial diagnostic biopsy, or one obtained at
                  time of relapse

               2. Institutional flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry must confirm CD5 antigen
                  expression, lack of CD23 antigen expression, and expression of cyclin D1.

               3. Variant cases of mantle cell lymphoma will be eligible to participate after
                  discussion and joint agreement between the PI, the Pathology Committee Chair, and
                  the Lymphoma Committee Chair. Variant cases may include (but are not limited to)
                  lack of Cyclin D1 expression (ie cases with Cyclin D2 or Cyclin D3 expression),
                  CD23 negativity (if all other criteria are met), or alternative translocations
                  leading to Cyclin D1 expression.

          2. Prior Treatment - Patients must have prior treatment with at least one regimen, which
             may have been single agent or multi-agent, and consisted of traditional cytotoxic
             agents and/or biologic agents. Patient must not have received prior idelalisib or
             lenalidomide therapy. Patient must have progressive disease or refractory disease.
             Refractory disease will be defined as stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD)
             as best response to prior therapy.

             Progressive disease will be defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)
             as initial response to prior therapy followed by disease progression within 6 months.

             Prior autologous, but not allogeneic, stem cell transplant is allowed. No
             corticosteroids within two weeks prior to study, except for maintenance therapy for a
             non-malignant disease. Maintenance therapy dose may not exceed 20 mg/day prednisone or
             equivalent.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status - Patients must have ECOG
             performance status of 0-2.

          4. Measurable Disease must be present either on imaging studies. Non-measurable disease

             considered non-measurable include the following:

               1. Bone lesions (lesions, if present, should be noted)

               2. Ascites

               3. Pleural/pericardial effusion

               4. Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis

               1. CD4+ cell count &gt; 350/mm3

               2. Treatment sensitive HIV and, if on anti-HIV therapy, HIV viral load &lt; 50
                  copies/mm3

               3. No history of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining conditions or
                  other HIV related illness

               4. No concurrent zidovudine or stavudine because of overlapping toxicities with
                  protocol therapy

               5. Patients with known HIV positivity must have CD4 assessment and viral load at
                  baseline and every 6 months while on study.

          7. Pregnancy and Nursing Status - Patients must be non-pregnant and non-nursing. Females
             of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10-14 days prior to registration.
             Further, they must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse

             additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before starting
             lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use
             a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP, even if they have had a successful
             vasectomy. A FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy
             or bilateral oophorectomy, or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24
             consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time preceding 24 consecutive months).
