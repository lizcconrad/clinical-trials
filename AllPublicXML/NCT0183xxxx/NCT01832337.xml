  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischaemic preconditioning may confer the cytoprotection in critical organs. The
      investigators hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce
      heart and gastrointestinal function injury in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing
      elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

    <description>We hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would reduce heart and intestinal injury in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery.The primary outcomes included the biomarkers reflecting intestinal injury (serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein, endotoxin levels and),time (hours) from end of operation to first passage of stool or flatus,the biomarker reflecting heart injury (CTnI,serum heart fatty acid binding protein ).Perioperative electrocardiographic was also recorded. In addition, the severity of intestinal injury was assessed with pathological scoring methods. Markers of systemic inflammation (CRP) were measured as well.</description>

    <description>Limb remote ischemic preconditioning (LRIP) consisted of three cycles of left upper limb ischemia induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the left upper arm to 200mmHg, with an intervening 5 minutes of reperfusion, during which time the cuff was deflated.</description>
