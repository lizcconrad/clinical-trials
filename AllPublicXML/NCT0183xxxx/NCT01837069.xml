      OPTIMIZE - OS (Optimization of Pre-surgical Testing with an Intensive Multifactorial
      Intervention to MinimiZe Cardiovascular Events - Orthopedic Surgery) trial is to determine
      the best management strategy for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. OPTIMIZE will be a
      prospective randomized trial that will enroll patients during pre-surgical testing before
      orthopedic surgery. This trial will investigate different strategies aimed at lowering
      cardiovascular events following orthopedic surgery. The study will compare an intensive
      multifactorial intervention comprising behavioral modification and polypharmacologic therapy
      aimed at several modifiable risk factors versus usual care. The trial hypothesis is that a
      personalized optimization approach is superior to usual care in reducing a composite of
      death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial necrosis, venous
      thromboembolism or thrombosis requiring reoperation at 30-days. Secondary endpoints include
      length of stay, major bleeding, each individual endpoint from the primary endpoint, and
      quality of life.
