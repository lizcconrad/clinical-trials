  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether three new types of MRI techniques used during
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis to look at rectal cancer can help doctors to
      tell if the tumor is getting better in response to the radiation and/or chemotherapy
      treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI, aka
      perfusion MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI), herein referred to in combination as
      advanced MRI (aMRI) in the investigation of early tumor response to standard multi-dose,
      fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) of the pelvis given in the neoadjuvant setting
      concurrent with chemotherapy as well as induction chemotherapy prior to chemoradiotherapy or
      consolidation chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy for primary rectal adenocarcinoma. This
      protocol aims to expand upon the growing body of knowledge concerning early changes in tumor
      neovascularity and cellular density as a potential biomarker of therapy efficacy. It further
      aims to address the trend towards more refined treatment stratification for lower risk tumors
      to avoid morbidity from potentially unnecessary radiation, chemotherapy or even radical
      surgery, by assessing the earliest changes that occur in microvasculature and perfusion and
      diffusion of water during this treatment to see if these can be predictive of long-term
      efficacy of therapy.

    <description>The analysis plan will be identical to the one for the primary endpoint: six change measures will be computed for each DCE-MRI parameter (parameters Ktrans, Ve, kep, AUC 90, AUC 180) and each of these change measures will be evaluated as a predictor using the reference standard nCR/CR. ROC curves and the area under them will be estimated and used to rank the predictors.</description>
