    <textblock>
      Patients (pts) with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC received NVBiv 25 mg/m² + CDDP 80 mg/m² on D1 and
      NVBo 60 mg/m² on D8 every 3 weeks (q3w) for 2 cycles as induction. Pts with response or non
      change received NVBo 20 mg fixed dose on D1 D3 D5 + CDDP 80 mg/m² on D1 q3w for 2 more cycles
      during RT(66 Gy/6.5 w).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vinorelbine (NVB) + CDDP is considered a standard trt in induction or concomitantly with RT
      (Vokes, Fournel, Krzakowski). NVBo simplifies the administration of trt and provides the same
      efficacy as intravenous NVB (NVBiv). In order to assess this and to improve the tolerance, a
      trial was started with NVBiv and NVBo + CDDP as induction followed by a fractionated
      administration of NVBo + CDDP during RT.

    <description>During the induction period, patients received chemotherapy for two 3-week cycles. Bolus intravenous vinorelbine 25 mg/m², was administered on day 1, then cisplatin 80 mg/m² was administered over 1-hour infusion. Vinorelbine 60 mg/m² was also administered on day 8.
Patients with objective response (OR) or no change (NC) continued the concomitant period (CP) including two additional 3-week cycles of radio chemotherapy (vinorelvine 20 mg D1 D3 D5 Cisplatin 80 mg/m² 66 Gy).</description>
