      The objective of this cluster randomized trial is to test whether a comprehensive
      intervention program within a national public primary care system will improve hypertension
      control among uninsured hypertensive patients and their families in Argentina.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and
      antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and
      concomitant cardiovascular disease and premature death have been demonstrated in randomized
      controlled trials, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied in the general
      population, especially in low and middle income countries.

      Objectives: To test whether a comprehensive intervention program within a national public
      primary care system will improve hypertension control among uninsured hypertensive patients
      and their families in Argentina

      Design: Cluster randomized trial

      Study Participants: 1,890 study participants from 18 primary care clinics within a public
      primary care network in Argentina will be recruited. Patients with hypertension from the
      participating clinics, their spouses, and their adult hypertensive family members will be
      enrolled.

      Intervention: Nine clinics with approximately 945 participants will be randomly assigned to
      the comprehensive intervention group and 9 clinics with similar participants to the usual
      care group. The comprehensive intervention, including health care provider education, a
      home-based intervention among patients and their families (lifestyle modification and home
      blood pressure [BP] monitoring) delivered by community health workers, and a mobile health
      intervention, will last for 18 months.

      Outcomes: BP and other indicators will be measured at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18
      during follow-up using standard methods. The primary outcome is a net change in systolic
      (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to month 18 between the intervention and control
      groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of
      hypertensive patients with adequate BP control (BP&lt;140/90 mmHg), cost-effectiveness of
      hypertension control, and net BP changes in normotensive participants.

    <description>Physicians will receive training in the use of treatment algorithms based on hypertension guidelines.
Community health workers (CHW) will be trained in facilitating behavioral change through BP monitoring, medication management, and lifestyle modifications. CHW will serve as a source of education, motivation, and social support, and as facilitators of healthcare utilization for participants. CHW will conduct home visits, schedule appointments with primary care physicians, deliver antihypertensive medications to patients' homes, and provide tailored counseling to address barriers to behavior change.
Individualized text messages to promote lifestyle changes and reminders to reinforce medication adherence will be sent to participants weekly.</description>

    <ipd_description>Our study data sharing plan will comply with all NIH policies for data sharing. Sharing of data and scientific findings with the research and clinical communities will be executed through the centralized NIH data repository, publications in peer reviewed journals, and presentations at scientific meetings. Data sharing will be implemented in a timely manner. The study data, including data from baseline and follow-up visits, will be prepared for transmission to the NHLBI data repository beginning two years after the last subject completes the study visit. These data will be free of identifiers that allow identification of individual research participants either directly or through &quot;deductive disclosure.&quot; In addition, we will offer through our public access website opportunities for outside investigators to collaborate with us using the complete study data and samples.</ipd_description>
