    <textblock>
      RATIONAL: Simmitecan is an anticancer ester prodrug, which involves activation to
      chimmitecan. Chimmitecan，a novel CPT derivative, exhibited potent antitumor activities both
      in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting topoisomerase I. Also exerted comparable effects on
      topoisomerase I compared with topotecan and SN38 and possessed improved anticancer potency
      and pharmacologic profiles, compared with the clinically available CPT analogues.

      PURPOSE: to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of
      Simmitecan.
