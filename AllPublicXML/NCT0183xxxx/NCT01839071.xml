    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if patients with coronary heart disease have
      higher risk to develop diabetes mellitus among the following two years.

      The examination of biomarkers taken from blood and fat issue shall provide which factors
      could be responsible for development of diabetes mellitus.

    <measure>Fat tissue biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with Coronary artery disease(CAD) undergo a subcutane fat tissue biopsy to identify inflammation and diabetes biomarker, such as TNF, Adiponectin and Clock-Gene. This is done baseline, after 1 year and after 2 years. Comparison of the current measurements among the measurements of the following 2 years shall give evidence about the reasons and conditions of diabetes development.</description>

    <measure>Blood collection</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Blood of patients with Coronary artery disease(CAD)is taken to identify biomarkers of inflammation and diabetes, such as CRP, HbA1c, Adiponectin, Plasma MMp-9, s-ICAM-1, s-VCAM-1, P-selectin and Clock-Gene, CD11b/CD18, CD14, L-selectin, CD-64 and TNF. This is done baseline, after 1 year and after 2 years. Comparison of the current measurements among the measurements of the following 2 years shall give an evidence about the reasons and conditions of diabetes development.</description>
