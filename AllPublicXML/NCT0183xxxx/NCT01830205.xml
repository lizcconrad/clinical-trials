Mild participants were counted as per their original allocation.</description>

            <description>Participants with normal renal function and had creatinine clearance by the Cockcroft-Gault method &gt;=90 milliliter per minute were administered with single oral dose of daclatasvir 60 mg tablet after 10 hours of overnight fasting on Day 1. One participant from this group, who had eGFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m^2, was reallocated into mild renal impairment reporting arm and was administered with a single oral dose of daclatasvir 60 mg tablet after 10 hours of overnight fasting on Day 1. Original allocation was based on an estimated eGFR, while the reallocation was based on the eGFR measurement at baseline.</description>
