      Background The purpose of the present controlled clinical trial was to assess the effect of a
      single 60 min application of transcutaneous electrical nervous stimulation (TENS) at sensory
      stimulation threshold (STS), compared to the application of motor stimulation threshold (MTS)
      as well as to untreatment, on the surface electromyographic (sEMG) and kinesiographic
      activity of patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Methods Sixty female subjects,
      selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, suffering from unilateral TMD in
      remission were assigned to MTS, STS or untreatment. Pre- and post-treatment differences in
      the sEMG activity of temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MM), digastric (DA) and
      sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM), as well in the interocclusal distance (ID), within group
      were tested using the Wilcoxon test, while differences among groups were assessed by
      Kruskal-Wallis test; the level of significance was set at p â‰¤ 0.01.
