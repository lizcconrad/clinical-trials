    <textblock>
      This study is to obtain the characteristics and treatment pattern of the unresectable HCC
      patients who are candidates for systemic therapy and in whom a decision to treat with
      sorafenib from early stage of TACE treatment course (concomitantly use no later than the 3rd
      TACE procedure) has been made under real-life practice conditions.this study will also
      conclude the safety and effectiveness of combination in uHCC patients.

        Unresectable HCC patients and be candidates for concomitantly systemic therapy with
        sorafenib + TACE. Considering the local practice and possible clinical benefits, sorafenib
        should not be initiated later than 7 days after the 3rd TACE course. No prior tartgeted
        therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically/ cytologically documented or radiographically diagnosed
             unresectable HCC who are candidates for systemic therapy and for whom a decision to
             treat with sorafenib has been made. Radiographic diagnosis needs typical findings of
             HCC by radiographic method i.e. on multi-dimensional dynamic CT, CT hepatic
             arteriography (CTHA)/CT arterial portography (CTAP) or MRI;

          -  Patients receive the first dose of sorafenib no later than 1 week (&lt;=7days) after the
             3rd TACE procedure

          -  Patients did not receive other prior systemic treatment by using target therapy

          -  Patients must sign the informed consent form;

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months;

          -  The physician must be willing to complete and submit all CRFs;

          -  The physician must be willing to submit to a site audit with verification of source
             documents and validation of data reported;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The first dose of sorafenib 7 days after the 3nd TACE procedure

          -  Exclusion criteria must follow the approved local product information
