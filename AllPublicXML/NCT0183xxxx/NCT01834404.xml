  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to determine the effect of Phentermine and Topiramate ER on gastric
      emptying, gastric accommodation, satiety, and satiation in obese participants.

      Investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of combination phentermine topiramate ER
      versus placebo given orally for 10-15 days.

      At visit 1 subjects had a brief interview, body measurements, and completed 4 questionnaires
      to rule out any gastrointestinal or significant psychological distress.

      At visit 2 subjects did a satiation/nutrient drink test. They drank a nutrient drink until
      they reached the maximum volume that could be tolerated, symptoms were recorded and blood
      samples taken at 4 times. They were randomized to one of the arms, and received a 5 day
      supply of study medication or placebo. The dosing of the study drug was phentermine 3.75 mg /
      topiramate 23 mg days 1-5.

      At visit 3 subjects returned to pick up a nine day supply of study medication or placebo. The
      dosing of the study drug was increased to phentermine 7.5 mg / topiramate 46 mg days 6-14.

      At visit 4 subjects underwent imaging to measure the volume of their stomach with an external
      camera that revolved around abdomen while they were lying on a table. Stomach volume was
      checked during fasting, starting 10 min after an intravenous injection of a radioactive
      material. The subjects ingested more of the liquid nutrient drink and 2 more images were
      obtained over 30 minutes. On the same day, subjects participated in an all you can eat meal,
      starting 4 hours after the ingestion of the liquid nutrient drink.

      At visit 5 subjects repeated the satiation/nutrient drink test. They drank a nutrient drink
      until they reached the maximum volume that could be tolerated, symptoms were recorded and
      blood samples taken at 4 times.

      At visit 6 subjects took part in a gastric emptying by scintigraphy test. Subjects were given
      a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs and milk contained a small
      amount of radioactive substance. At the completion of the meal, subjects stood in front of a
      special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals.

    <measure>Gastric Emptying of Solids Half-Time (T 1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, approximately 2 hours after radiolabeled meal was ingested</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric emptying of solids half-time is defined as the time for half of the ingested solids to leave the stomach. At visit 6 subjects took part in a gastric emptying by scintigraphy test. Subjects were given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs and milk contained a small amount of radioactive substance. At the completion of the meal, subjects stood in front of a special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting Gastric Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 13, approximately 10 minutes after Technetium (99mTC) injection</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting whole gastric volume was measured by Technetium (99mTc)-SPECT Imaging. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial Gastric Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 13, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>Postprandial gastric volume was measured by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. After the liquid meal tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume to Fullness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>At visit 5, subjects did a satiation/nutrient drink test. Participants recorded their sensations every 5 minutes using a numerical scale from 0-5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal, and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation). This measure was the volume consumed when the fullness sensation reached level 3.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14, approximately 30 minutes after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>At visit 5, subjects did a satiation/nutrient drink test. Participants recorded their sensations every 5 minutes using a numerical scale from 0-5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal, and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation). This measure is the volume consumed when the fullness sensation reached level 5.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Buffet Meal Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 13, approximately 4.5 hours after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>At visit 4 subjects underwent imaging to measure the volume of their stomach, fasting and after ingesting a liquid nutrient drink. Four hours after the liquid meal, subjects were invited to eat, over a 30-minute period, a standard &quot;all you can eat&quot; meal vegetable lasagna, vanilla pudding, and skim milk. The total Kcal of the food consumed was analyzed by using validated software.</description>

    <measure>Solid Gastric Emptying: Proportion of Meal Emptied at 2 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, approximately 2 hours after radiolabeled meal was ingested</time_frame>
    <description>At visit 6 subjects took part in a gastric emptying by scintigraphy test. Subjects were given a scrambled egg breakfast with toast and a glass of milk. The eggs and milk contained a small amount of radioactive substance. At the completion of the meal, subjects stood in front of a special camera and pictures were taken at specific intervals. This outcome measure is the proportion of the radiolabeled meal emptied at 2 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Postprandial Gastric Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 13, approximately approximately 30 min after liquid meal</time_frame>
    <description>Change between postprandial and fasting whole gastric volume by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

          <title>Body Mass Index (BMI)</title>
          <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a health index for comparing weight to height. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. The body mass index is an indication if a person is at a suitable weight for his height on an approximation of body fat. A body mass index of under 20 is considered to be underweight, while a body mass index between 20 to 25 is considered healthy. A body mass index in the range of 25 to 30 is regarded as overweight. A body mass index over 30 is regarded as obese.</description>

        <description>Fasting whole gastric volume was measured by Technetium (99mTc)-SPECT Imaging. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

        <title>Postprandial Gastric Volume</title>
        <description>Postprandial gastric volume was measured by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. After the liquid meal tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

        <description>Change between postprandial and fasting whole gastric volume by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>
