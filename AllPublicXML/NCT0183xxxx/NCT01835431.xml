    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and North and South America. The aim of the trial is
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart once daily plus
      insulin aspart for the remaining meals in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus.

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 16 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as an event with onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day on randomised treatment.</description>

    <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes (PG &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or severe hypoglycaemia).
Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were either:
Severe (i.e. the child is having altered mental status and cannot assist in their care, is semiconscious or unconscious or in coma with or without convulsions and may require parenteral therapy (glucagon or i.v. glucose), or
An episode biochemically confirmed by PG value of &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <measure>Number of Hyperglycaemic Episodes (PG Above 14.0 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) Where Subject Looks/Feels Ill</measure>
    <time_frame>After 16 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The episode of hyperglycaemia was noted when the glucose measurement was 14.0mmol/L or above and the subject looked /felt ill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hyperglycaemic Episodes (PG Above 14.0 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) Where Subject Looks/Feels Ill With Ketosis (Blood Ketones Above 1.5 mmol/L)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 16 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The episode of hyperglycaemia was noted when the glucose measurement was 14.0mmol/L or above and the subject looked /felt ill. The ketone meaurement involved an additional finger prick and ketosis was considered present if blood ketones were higher than 1.5mmol/L</description>

Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were either:
