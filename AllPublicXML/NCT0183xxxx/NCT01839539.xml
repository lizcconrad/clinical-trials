  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dendritic and cytokine-induced
      killer cells (DC-CIK) for colorectal cancer (CRC).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients with stage Ⅲ CRC, who had received neoadjuvant and (or) adjuvant chemotherapy or
      (and) radiotherapy according to NCCN guidelines, and got complete response (CR), will be
      randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment) or group B (just regularly follow
      up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 2-3 cycles of
      DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks). Patients in group B will have no anti-tumor therapy.
