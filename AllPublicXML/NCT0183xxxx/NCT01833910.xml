    <textblock>
      Prompt delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can double a victims chance of
      survival from cardiac arrest (CA), yet it is provided in less than 1/3 of witnessed events.
      Studies indicate that video-based education methods can effectively train bystanders in CPR.
      Using the education and evaluation methods of an existing in-hospital training program, the
      investigators will assess the CPR skills of students taught with video-only methods, with and
      without psychomotor skills practice, and compare them to those using a video self-instruction
      (VSI) kit.

      The long term goal of our work is to implement real world CPR training strategies that
      maximize resuscitation skill retention, and promote willingness to act while addressing major
      barriers to training including time and cost. To accomplish this, the study team will train
      student volunteers from the University of Pennsylvania using one of three methods: 1) a
      video-only method with no psychomotor skill practice, 2) a video-only method with psychomotor
      skill practice on a household object or 3) a video self-instruction (VSI) kit. Volunteers
      will be young, healthy students from the University of Pennsylvania with no CPR Training
      within the last 24 months. The investigators will use the American Heart Association's CPR
      Anytime Video Self-Instruction Kit which comes equipped with a DVD and inflatable manikin.

      For the groups receiving the Video-Only methods, the investigators will remove the inflatable
      manikin and train the subjects with the DVD. The investigators will randomize the
      participants to one of the video-only methods or to the VSI kit method of training when they
      are scheduled for training. Immediately following the training, the investigators will
      conduct a CPR skills test to measure the effectiveness of the training method. Three (3) to
      twelve (12) months post-training the investigators will schedule and conduct an in-person
      interview with subjects. As part of the interview, subjects will be asked to complete a
      survey measuring their comfort level and willingness to use their CPR skills. Subjects will
      also be asked to complete another CPR Skills test.
