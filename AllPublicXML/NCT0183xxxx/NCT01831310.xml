  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypercatabolism and immune suppression are frequently seen in patients with malignancy.
      Preoperative nutritional state is an important factor in determining surgical and
      postoperative complications because the preoperative nutritional status affects the
      postoperative nutritional state, immunity and inflammatory response. In these patients,
      standard parenteral nutrition may not be sufficient to maintain the immunity and provide
      positive or stabilized nitrogen balance. Preoperative and perioperative supplementation with
      immune-enhancing enteral nutrition has been reported to increase total lymphocytes and T
      lymphocytes and decrease circulating levels of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor- alfa.
      There is a report which showed that glutamine dipeptide supplemented parenteral nutrition
      improved the cellular and humoral immune functions. The investigators aimed to evaluate the
      effect of postoperative glutamine-dipeptide and/or omega 3 fatty acid supplemented parenteral
      nutrition on the neutrophil functions and postoperative course of patients with colorectal
      cancer.
