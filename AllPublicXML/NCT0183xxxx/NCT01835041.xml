      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, CPI-613, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic
      acid), when used in combination with modified leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, irinotecan
      hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX), in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      II. To collect tissue for future genomic analyses. III. To obtain preliminary data on
      efficacy of treatment with CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid.

      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1
      and 3. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours,
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.
