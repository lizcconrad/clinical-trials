    <textblock>
      This project examines the effects of a 4 month structured exercise intervention program in
      patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We will examine changes in total and
      depot-specific (i.e.in different tissues, liver, muscle and pancreas)fat. We will correlate
      these with measurements of the insulin from the liver. The hypothesis is that by reducing fat
      in these specific depots we can reduce insulin resistance and prevent progression to
      diabetes.

      1. Exercise program: We are asking people to take part in a supervised exercise program for
           4 months. This involves on average a weekly supervised exercise bout plus other
           unsupervised exercise bouts at home. We will ensure participants are physically able to
           embark on this by taking their medical history, physical examination and validated
           questionnaire (PARQ). This program is for the benefit on the patients' long term health.

        2. MR imaging to assess fat: occassionally these may pick up anomalies which require
           further investigation. A radiologist will screen the abdominal images and GP will be
           informed on anything requiring further investigation.

           No radiation is received during MR imaging.

        3. Physiological studies: Patients will be asked to attend for 2 non-consecutive days
           before and after the exercise intervention. Regular blood samples will be required as
           apart of these investigations.

    <description>Supervised exercise training Four months exercise training intervention will be either gym-based or patients will choose the mode of exercise that suits their lifestyle. Patients will be encouraged to exercise four times per week for 30-45 min at 60-80 % of maximal heart rate, with a 5 min warm-up and warm-down. Participants will be given free access to a variety of affiliated sports centres and will use the Wellness Key system, a software program that enables researchers to remotely track the exercise activity of participants very accurately. To ensure compliance with rest or exercise, all participants of both groups will have their mean physical activity level in 2 non-consecutive weeks evaluated with an ambulatory accelerometer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sedentary, non smoking, male subjects,

          -  Alcohol consumption men &lt;21 units/week,

          -  BMI 27-35. (Lean individuals do not suffer from NAFLD, so are not suitable for this
             study. Conversely, we are restricted to a maximum BMI of 35 due to the size
             limitations of the MR scanner.)

          -  A clinical diagnosis of NAFLD based upon the following criteria: i) exclusion of other
             causes of liver disease i.e. negative Hepatitis B and C serology, a negative
             auto-immune profile and normal caeruloplasmin concentrations, ii) Ultrasound
             appearances suggestive of a fatty, echo-bright liver with no evidence of cirrhosis (in
             some cases, the diagnosis will have been confirmed histologically after liver biopsy.

          -  Being willing to engage and motivated to follow an exercise program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prescription of corticosteroids, amiodarone, tamoxifen, methotrexate (drugs known to
             cause secondary steatohepatitis) or fibrates. Statin is Ok as long as the patients are
             on stable therapy for a while, if changed then the patient will be excluded.

          -  Alcohol consumption for men 21 units/week.

          -  A contraindication to exercise (such as unstable ischaemic heart disease),

          -  Type 2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes patients are excluded so that we are examining the
             involvement of insulin resistance at a reversible stage before β-cell failure has
             occurred).

          -  Patients who are on medications that will interact with GTN (glyceryl trinitrate) will
             be excluded from the GTN dilatation (endothelial independent NO mediated function)
             aspect of the study.

          -  Individuals who suffer from claustrophobia and have metal implants will be excluded
             from the MRI aspect of the study.

          -  Patients who smoke will also be excluded from the study.

          -  Total cholesterol &gt;7
