  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and adverse effects of Uterine Artery
      Embolization (UAE), High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) in treating patients with
      uterine fibroid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usual management for symptomatic uterine fibroid is surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy),
      in the current study, uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a form of non-surgical and
      minimally invasive treatment, High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) is a form of
      non-invasive treatment that can be completed as an out-patient within hours. Embolization
      causes ischaemia and shrinkage of the fibroid and therefore symptomatic relieve. HIFU is a
      medical technology that has been used for cancer treatment. Energy is delivered from outside
      the body in a non-invasive manner to produce heat energy that causes necrosis and shrinkage
      of the uterine fibroid thereby relieves the symptoms due to the fibroid. It does not involve
      radiation. The clinical effectiveness of HIFU for uterine fibroid is unknown, however, based
      on the knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of HIFU on liver cancer and pancreatic cancer,
      there is reasonable ground to believe that HIFU is effective for uterine fibroid.

    <description>The patient will be admitted into hospital for UAE. UAE was performed with patients under local anesthesia. Embosphere particles (BioSphere Medical) with a size of 500 - 700µm were used in all procedures. Embospheres were mixed with contrast material and saline and injected into each uterine artery until either parenchyma filling of the fibroids had stopped (target embolization) or the main uterine artery was blocked with stasis of contrast material (selective embolization). After the procedure, women were admitted to the gynecology ward for postprocedural care. All patients were advised to stay in the hospital for at least 1 night.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be given to the patient in one or more sessions on an outpatient basis. The uterine fibroid will be identified and located with ultrasonography and ablated with HIFU. For lesion beyond 6 cm distance from skin, HIFU is given at a power of 1200-1500 watt for 1500 - 2000 times at each spot, for 50 milli-second each time, at an interval of 100 milli-second, at a spot distance of 1.5cm, a line distance of 1.5cm, and a plane distance of 1.0 -1.5cm; for lesion within 6 cm distance from skin, HIFU is given at a power of 1300±15% Watt for 40 times at each spot, for120 milli-second each time, at an interval of 100 milli-second, at a spot distance of 0.3cm, a line distance of 0.3cm, and a plane distance of 0.8cm.</description>
