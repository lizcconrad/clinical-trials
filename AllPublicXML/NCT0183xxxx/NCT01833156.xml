  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In lymphedema there is increase in water content of the tissue. We studied a device
      (MoistureMeterD) which is suitable to detect water contact in the tissue. Although the
      apparatus is commercially available, no validation study had been performed in vivo with
      local edema.

      We designed a validation study for inter- and intra observer variability and the
      reproducibility in vivo by histamin induced local edema

      The multiprobe Delfin MoistureMeterD is a unique and compact water-specific instrument for
      the measurement of water content of biological tissues. It measures the dielectric constant
      values of the skin and subcutaneous tissues non-invasively and locally in a few seconds. The
      dielectric constant value is directly proportional to the amount of water in the tissue.

      As lymphedema produces local water content increase, we are interested if the device is
      suitable for daily use in lymphedema patients. Therefore we designed a protocol to measure
      the results with a moisturemeter in a standardized edema formation by histamin induced
      scratch test edema. This method is well known in type I allergy testing.

      The aim of the study is:

        1. research the inter- and intra observer variability

        2. measure the reproducibility of edema formation in a standardized edema formation

    <description>The researchers are randomized in investigator A and B. In several patients at one time three measures are made: A1 and A2 and B. By collecting these data we can calculate the intra-observer variability (A1 versus A2) and the inter observer variability (A1/2 versus B)</description>
