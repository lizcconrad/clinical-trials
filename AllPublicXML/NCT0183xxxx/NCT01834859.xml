  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very-low calorie diets are relatively safe and effective in inducing significant weight loss,
      when used in selective individuals and under clinical supervision. However, weight loss
      maintenance in the long-term remains the main challenge, with many experiencing a significant
      weight regain. Several compensatory mechanisms are activated under weight reduction, both at
      the level of energy intake (such as increased appetite) and energy expenditure (such as
      reduced energy expenditure), and increase the risk of relapse.

      The main aim of this study is to compare the effect of two multidisciplinary lifestyle
      interventions on weight loss maintenance at one year, after initial weight loss during 8
      weeks very-low calorie diet. Participants will be allocated (non-randomly) to either an
      outpatient program in the obesity unit of the local hospital, or to an inpatient program
      consisting of a &quot;continuous care&quot; intervention, with three intermittent stays (each with
      three-week duration) in a rehabilitation center over a one year period. Moreover, the
      investigators aim to assess the impact of weight loss (achieved with a very low calorie diet)
      and weight loss maintenance on compensatory mechanisms activated during weight reduction.

      This study included a sub-study (n=30) to determine the timeline over which compensatory
      mechanisms (at both the level of energy expenditure and appetite control system) are
      activated with progressive weight loss. Additional measurements were taken at day-3, 5 and 10
      % weight loss, and after 4 weeks weight stabilization (after gradually reintroduction of
      food).

    <description>Multidisciplinary outpatient program including both individual and group-based therapy. During the first visit, there will be offered an individual consultation with the dietician, physiotherapist and psychiatric nurse. Follow-up will be in groups meeting every month for the first four months and every two months afterwards up to one year. The intervention will focus on nutritional education, healthy eating, increased physical activity levels (aiming initially at 10 minutes/day, then increasing to 30 minutes/day) and cognitive therapy.</description>
