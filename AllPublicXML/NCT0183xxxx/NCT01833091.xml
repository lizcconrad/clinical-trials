      Effects of creating an artificial night on physiological changes, weight and feeding
      tolerance in preterm infants.

      Introduction:Nowdays,with medical advances in intensive care increased chance of survival in
      premature infants.One of the major concerns exposure to high light levels in neonate &amp;
      subsequent it is increase in metabolism rate.So,this study was conducted to determine the
      effect of creating an artificial night on physiological changes, weight and feeding tolerance
      in preterm infants.

      Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial dual group study, 38 preterm infants
      (gestational age of 30-34weeks)due to prematurity hospitalized at Ghaem NICU,were evaluated
      within 10 days. Infants were divided into two groups of 1200-1700 and 1701-2200g based on the
      weight and the weight of each group were randomized into artificial night(dark period was
      from 19 to 7 during incubator was covered with linen cloth &amp; light period was from 7 to 19
      removed the cover) and control groups(continuous lighting). Mothers &amp; infants through
      questionnaires,interviews,observation &amp; document completion, changes in physiologic &amp; weight
      befor entering the study &amp; then physiologic changes twice a day,weight &amp; feeding tolerance
      were collected daily.Data were analyzed using spss v.16 software.

    <description>Infants in the intervention group received light cyclic with pattern 12 hours. Light period was from 7 to 19 during which the infants were put in the normal environmental light and dark period was from 19 to 7 during which was the infants' incubator was covered with linen cloth. The vital signsand &amp; arterial oxygen saturation of the infants in the intervention group were controlled before covering the incubator i.e. at 19. Also, the infant's vital signs were again monitored at 7 am.The infant weighed in every day at 7 am during the 10 days of study. Feeding tolerance was daily determined at 8 am, using nasogastric tube or orogastric tube to control residue as well as to review the presence or absence of abdominal distention, vomiting.</description>
