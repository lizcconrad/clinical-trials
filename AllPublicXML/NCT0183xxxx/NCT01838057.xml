  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the impact of painPRIMER in a prospective six-month clinical investigation
      looking at clinical outcomes, health care professional and patient satisfaction, healthcare
      resource use, productivity and direct and indirect costs. The hypothesis is that early
      identification of the presence of neuropathic pain and back pain related comorbidities, to
      direct appropriate pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment, painPRIMER would improve
      patient outcomes and reduce patient cycling, inappropriate use of imaging and surgery,
      thereby reducing costs and productivity loss associated with these inefficiencies.
