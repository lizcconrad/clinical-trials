  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a relational touch / relational
      intervention on persistent pain in a long term geriatric hospital care ward population. The
      main issue is the pain reduction. The hypothesis is that this type of intervention is very
      useful on pain reduction in old people even with physical or mental disability.

    <textblock>
      The first 74 patients wanting to participate are randomly assigned to 2 groups: relational-
      touch or relational. Inclusion criteria are : patients with chronic pain; age &gt;65y and
      informed consent. Where patients had mental impairment the family's agreement is solicited.
      The regional Ethics Committee agreement was granted. The intervention consists of 6
      Relational versus Relational- Touch sessions (twice a week) .Evaluation takes place after the
      second, 4th and 6th sessions and in the 4th week following the intervention. The main outcome
      is the pain reduction.

      The primary outcome measure is the pain reduction according to the DOLOPLUS scale and the
      VRS; the secondary outcomes measures are : patient's participation rate; pain related
      symptoms variation; overall benefit.
