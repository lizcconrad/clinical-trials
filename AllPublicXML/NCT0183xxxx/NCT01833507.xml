  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is common in adults with complex medical problems with ensuing complications
      afterwards. Obese patients suffer higher mortality and impaired functional status often as a
      result of their obesity. One primary goal to reduce both obesity and improve functional
      status is exercise. The investigators hypothesize that a simple exercise intervention with
      limited behavioral goal-setting will reduce weight and increase functional status compared to
      usual care. As a secondary measure, the investigators hypothesize that using this
      intervention will reduce hospital admissions and ER visits.

      We are enrolling up to 150 subjects where half will receive a pedometer and behavioral
      goal-setting at enrollment and half will receive a pedometer and goal-setting 2 months later.
      It is a 4 month study. Our aims are as follows:

      Primary Aim: Determine the relationship between gait speed, grip strength and walking steps
      in patients randomized to a self-exercise program compared to usual care in complex medical
      patients.

      Second Primary aim: To determine the effect of a self-exercise program compared to usual care
      on weight loss in complex medical patients.

      Secondary Aim: Determine the relationship between the number of hospitalizations in patients
      randomized to a self-exercise program compared to usual care in complex medical patients.
