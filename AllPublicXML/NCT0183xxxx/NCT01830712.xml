    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this study is to
      assess the long-term (5+ years) postoperative functional outcomes of elective orthopaedic
      surgery (EOS) patients from previously reported studies F7HAEM/USA/3/USA and F7HAEM/USA/4/USA
      (NCT01561391) and furthermore to assess the impact of EOS on psychosocial outcomes, frequency
      of bleeding episodes and durability of joint surgery.
