  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that
      automatically delivers both insulin and glucagon can improved glycemic control vs. usual care
      for young people with type 1 diabetes 12-20 in a diabetes camp environment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bionic pancreas will be compared to usual care in a crossover design in which each
      volunteer will serve as his or her own control. Each volunteer will be under closed-loop
      glucose control for five days and usual camp level of diabetes care for five days in random
      order with a one day washout period in between.

             inhibitors, acarbose)anti-diabetic medications.

             vomiting.

          -  Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the usual care and
             closed-loop BG control portions of the study.

          -  History of eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia, &quot;diabulemia&quot; or omission of
             insulin to manipulate weight

          -  History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
             hypoglycemia requiring treatment
