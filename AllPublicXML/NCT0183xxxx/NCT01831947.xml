      This clinical trial investigates the impact of intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab antibody
      on the acuteness of vision. Patients included are suffering from choroidal
      neo-vascularization (CNV) as a consequence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

      Initially, all patients get injections of 0.5 mg Ranibizumab in monthly intervals for 3
      months. Subsequently, one group gets Ranibizumab in intervals of 2 months, whereas a second
      group is treated on demand.

      The primary end point of the study is the change of best-corrected visual acuity after 12
      month.

      Secondary end points include the impact of Ranibizumab on morphological changes of the
      retina, the number of patients with gain or loss of 15 or more letters visual acuity after 12
      months, changes in quality of life and the number of injections required during the first 12
      months of treatment.
