  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 90% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) can recover thanks to conventional
      polychemotherapy regimens - ABVD or BEACOPP - with or without radiotherapy. Nevertheless,
      some patients relapse and others are resistant to any treatment. These patients represent
      2-5% of stage I / II and 5-10% of disseminated stages. The usual prognostic index based on
      clinical and biological data (supradiaphragmatic HL: EORTC and advanced HL International
      Prognostic Score) cannot always detect patients at risk.

      New prognostic factors are required to screen out these high risk patients. Among available
      biological factors, we will retain the cytokines secreted by tumor cells and cells from the
      environment.

      Indeed, the prognostic value of plasma cytokines levels and their soluble receptors has
      recently been described by at least two teams. Olivier CASASNOVAS set up a prognostic index
      based on quantities of IL-1 RA, IL-6, sCD30 and TNFR1 at diagnosis,and the V. Diehl team
      published the prognostic value of the decrease of TARC (CC Thymus and Activation-related
      chemokine).

      In daily practice, the early assessment of response by PET CT-scan is now an undeniable
      prognostic factor. Early identification of no-response or relapse is, in fact, based on
      clinical and imaging (PET-CT scan).

      We propose to evaluate the decrease of cytokines concentration with a prognostic value (TARC,
      IL-6, IL1-RA, sCD30, TNFR1) as markers of response during treatment and during early
      follow-up. The dosage of these cytokines will be paired with radiological assessments.

      A correlation between the decrease of cytokines plasma levels overtime and event-free
      survival will be searched afterwards.

      To evaluate the decrease of cytokines concentration with a prognostic value as markers of
      response, the dosage of TARC, IL-6, IL1-RA, sCD30 and TNFR1 will be performed during
      treatment at :diagnosis, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 2 Day 1, cycle 3 Day 1, Day 1 of consolidation
      (Cycle 5 day 1 or before radiotherapy) and evaluation of end of treatment.

      an early follow-up with a dosage of cytokines will be performed 3 months after the end of
      treatment.

      An evaluation for Event Free Survival will be done at 3 years from diagnosis.
