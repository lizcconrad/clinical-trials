  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Non-interventional Prospective Study. Centres will enroll adult patients with
      partial onset seizures for whom the clinician has decided to initiate ZNS as an adjunctive
      therapy prior to the decision to take part in this study. Patients to be enrolled into the
      study are not sufficiently controlled with one dug licensed for the use of monotherapy in
      partial onset seizures. Patients will be seen at baseline and then during normal clinical
      visits at intervals which are appropriate to the typical practice of the treating clinician.
      Patients will be assessed at baseline and then at least 3 and 6 months after the baseline.

    <measure>Retention Rate of Zonisamide (ZNS) after 6 months from Baseline</measure>

    <description>The retention rate or the proportion of patients still receiving ZNS after 6 months will be assessed. At each of the two visits after 3 months and 6 months (final assessment or early discontinuation), the clinician will record whether the patient is still on ZNS treatment, or whether treatment has been discontinued.</description>

    <description>The recommended initial daily dose is 50 mg in two divided doses. After one week the dose may be increased to 100 mg daily and thereafter the dose may be increased at weekly intervals, in increments of up to 100 mg. Doses of 300 mg to 500 mg per day have been shown to be effective, though some patients, especially those not taking CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450)-inducing agents, may respond to lower doses.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The decision to prescribe ZNS was made by the physician before and independently of
             his/her decision to include the patient in the study

          -  Patients treated with one drug licensed for the use as monotherapy in partial onset
             seizures

          -  Based on the physician's clinical judgment, the patient seizure activity is not
             controlled sufficiently with the current monotherapy and it is in the patient's best
             interest to be prescribed adjunctive ZNS

          -  Patient was prescribed ZNS no longer than 2 weeks before baseline

          -  Treatment with ZNS has to be commenced in line with the drug's license and ZNS SmPC
             (Summary of Product Characteristics)

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  Capable of understanding the purpose of the study, fully informed and having given
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have started ZNS outside the approved SmPC at enrolment

          -  Simultaneous participation in an interventional clinical trial and/or taking an
             investigational drug

          -  Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or condition which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may complicate communication with the patient.
