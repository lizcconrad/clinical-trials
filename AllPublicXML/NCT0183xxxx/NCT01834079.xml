      Optic Nerve Diseases: Conditions which produce injury or dysfunction of the second cranial or
      optic nerve, which is generally considered a component of the central nervous system. Damage
      to optic nerve fibres may occur at or near their origin in the retina, at the optic disk, or
      in the nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, or lateral geniculate nuclei. Clinical
      manifestations may include decreased visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, impaired color
      vision, and an afferent papillary defect. primary out put of clinical study is to measures
      Improvement in visual loss and improvement in idiopathic intra cranial.This is a Single arm,
      Single centre trial to check the safety and efficacy of bone marrow derived autologous mono
      nuclear cell(100 millions per dose )clinical trial to be conducted for 36 months .
