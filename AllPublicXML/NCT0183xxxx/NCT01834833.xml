      hospitalisation for acute heart failure. Randomised, endpoint: number of day alive out of
      hospital during 6 months

      Background: the risk for rehospitalisation is very high after hospitalisation for acute heart
      failure. Aim: evaluate the benefit of a consultation with a cardiologist, including
      echocardiography and education of the patient, between 7 and 15 days after discharge, in high
      risk patients, identified with BNP or incomplete therapy. Parallel randomised study. The main
      endpoint is the number of day alive out of hospital during the 6 months post discharge;
      statistics intention to treat comparison of the number of days alive out of hospital in the
      group with consultation compared with the group without consultation. Recruitment 3 years and
      4 months, follow-up 6 months. Patients included have been hospitalised in hospital BICHAT
      75018 Paris, France. Financing is by the ministry of health (PHRQHOS)
