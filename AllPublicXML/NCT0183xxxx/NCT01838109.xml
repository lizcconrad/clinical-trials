  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent major gastrointestinal surgery is potentially at risk of malnutrition
      due to reduced oral intake, increased nutritional need, reduced gastrointestinal absorption
      function, and/or metabolic changes after surgery. The postoperative malnutrition is
      associated with low quality of life and seems to be related long-term nutritional status.
      This study is a multicenter, open-labeled prospective randomized clinical trial to examine
      the effect of postoperative oral nutritional supplements (ONS) after major gastrointestinal
      surgery by comparing the change of body weight and other nutritional parameters between the
      experiment group that is supplied with ONS and the control group without ONS.
