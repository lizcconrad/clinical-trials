  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the impact and
      feasibility of a prolonged physical activity intervention in school-aged childhood cancer
      survivors who self-report sedentary lifestyles. The study will test the hypothesis that
      childhood cancer survivors participating in a physical activity intervention guided by Social
      Cognitive Theory will increase the amount of time spent daily in moderate to vigorous
      physical activity, and improve exercise self-efficacy compared to children randomized to
      usual care. A secondary aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on cardiovascular
      risk factors including fitness and body composition.
