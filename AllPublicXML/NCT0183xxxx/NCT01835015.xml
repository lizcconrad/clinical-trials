  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and serum pharmacokinetics
      of CLG561 in subjects with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were divided into 5 cohorts, with the subjects in each cohort being administered a
      single IVT dose of CLG561 in 1 of 5 concentration levels A-E, where A=lowest and E=highest.
      All subjects received active CLG561. Progress from one cohort to the next was time-lagged to
      allow for safety review. Dosing was also time-lagged within each cohort. Only one eye
      (designated as the study eye) was dosed per subject. Post-dose safety assessments and ocular
      examination occurred immediately after the IVT injection and continued throughout the
      outpatient visits at pre-determined timepoints. Collection of post-injection blood samples
      began after the IVT injection at pre-determined timepoints. Subjects were followed for up to
      84 days.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) by Visit - Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2, Day 4, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA (with spectacles or other visual corrective devices) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) testing was reported in letters read correctly. Improvement of BCVA was defined as an increase (gain) in letters read from the baseline assessment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, Day 2, Day 4, Day 15, Day 29, Day 57, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>IOP was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry or tonopen, at the discretion of the Investigator, and reported in mmHg (millimeters of mercury). A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <description>A dilated fundus examination was performed to evaluate the health of the retina, macula, choroid, and optic nerve. Subjects having a normal baseline evaluation were examined at subsequent visits, and any change from normal to abnormal was recorded. Criteria for reclassifying from normal to abnormal were left to the opinion of the investigators. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. None of the abnormalities were deemed related to the study medication.</description>

    <description>A slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination was performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye. Subjects having a normal baseline evaluation were examined at subsequent visits, and any change from normal to abnormal was recorded. Criteria for reclassifying from normal to abnormal were left to the opinion of the investigators. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.

          <title>Number of Subjects With a Change From Normal to Abnormal in Ocular Signs at Any Post-Therapy Visit as Compared to Baseline Assessment</title>
          <description>A slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination was performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye. Subjects having a normal baseline evaluation were examined at subsequent visits, and any change from normal to abnormal was recorded. Criteria for reclassifying from normal to abnormal were left to the opinion of the investigators. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. None of the abnormalities were deemed related to the study medication.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected for the duration of a subject’s participation in the study (up to 84 days). Ocular AEs are presented for both study eye and non-study eye. AEs were obtained as solicited comments and observations by the Investigator.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject exposed to study drug or any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of study drug, or untoward medical occurrence at any time prior to administration of first dose of study drug. AEs were reported as pre-treatment and treatment-emergent.</desc>
