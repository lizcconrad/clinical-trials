    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm double blind placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of Red Grape
      Cell (RGC) powder containing all the matrix of polyphenols that can be found in red grapes.
      polyphenols have several beneficial effects on various body systems, are present in many
      edible foods, and are considered safe for human consumption by regulatory authorities. Animal
      and human studies suggest a potential for polyphenol-rich compounds in enhancing
      mitochondrial activity and exercise capacity. However, the effect of RGC on exercise
      performance in humans had not yet been tested. A special population where increasing
      performance is highly sought are competitive athletes. The aim of the current study is to
      investigate the effect of RGC on measures of aerobic fitness, body composition and mood in
      trained male cyclists
