  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no known effective treatment for patients with advanced stage
      neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma who have relapsed or not responded to
      standard therapy. In previous studies that used 131I-MIBG as a potential anti-cancer therapy,
      a decrease in the size of tumors was seen in some of the children and adults. This research
      study will continue to evaluate the side effects of 131I-MIBG when treating children and
      adults with neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma. The 131I-MIBG compound is
      intended to work by selectively delivering the radioactive iodine to the tumor cells, which
      is then intended to result in their destruction.

      The purpose of this research study is to:

        -  Make 131I-MIBG therapy available to patients with advanced neuroblastoma,
           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma

        -  Further assess the side effects of 131I-MIBG therapy

    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma remain fatal diseases for a large
      percentage of patients, especially those with high-risk disease features who become resistant
      to conventional therapy. 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog
      that concentrates in adrenergic tissue and has been shown to be sensitive and specific for
      detecting localized and metastatic neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma. More
      importantly, experience of many institutions has proven that this agent used as a targeted
      radiotherapeutic has significant anti-tumor activity against refractory neuroblastoma 1-7 as
      well as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, UCSF, and
      the University of Michigan have just completed a large Phase 2 study of 131I-MIBG given in
      doses of 10-18 mCi/kg with stem cell rescue, if necessary, and have shown that this agent is
      safe and effective palliative therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients. In
      addition, there is growing evidence that low-dose (5-10 mCi/kg) submyeloablative MIBG therapy
      is both safe and effective for disease palliation. This protocol therefore provides a
      mechanism to deliver this therapy when clinically indicated.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Provide palliative therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with advanced neuroblastoma,
           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma.

        -  Gain more information about acute and late toxicity of 131I-MIBG therapy for patients
           with refractory neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis: Refractory/Relapsed neuroblastoma with original diagnosis based on tumor
             histopathology or elevated urine catecholamines with typical tumor cells in the bone
             marrow, OR pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma not amenable to curative surgery

          -  Age ≥ 12 months and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions during
             therapy period with/without pharmacologic anxiolysis.

          -  Disease status: Failure to respond to standard therapy (usually combination
             chemotherapy with/without radiation and surgery) or development of progressive disease
             at any time (any new lesion or an increase in size of &gt; 25% of a pre-existing lesion).
             Disease evaluation must be completed within 8 weeks of study entry. If possible, the
             disease evaluation should take place subsequent to intervening therapy; if intervening
             therapy does occur, evaluations should be done as clinically indicated. If patient has
             received prior treatment with MIBG, they must have a response or stable disease after
             the most recent MIBG infusion. Patient may have PD after showing initial response to
             MIBG therapy (at [or around] the day 35-63 post-MIBG therapy evaluation).

          -  Patients must have a hematopoietic stem cell product available for re-infusion after
             131I-MIBG treatment at doses of ≥ 12 mCi/kg. If no stem cells are available, then the
             dose of 131I-MIBG should be &lt; 12 mCi/kg.

               -  The minimum quantity for purged or unpurged peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is
                  1.5 x 10e6 viable CD34+ cells/kg (recommended 2 x 10e6 viable CD34+ cells/kg).

               -  The minimum dose for bone marrow is 1.0 x 10e8 mononuclear cells/kg (optimum &gt;
                  2.0 x 10e8 mononuclear cells/kg).

          -  Prior Therapy: Patients may enter this study with/without re-induction therapy for
             recurrent tumor. Patients must have fully recovered from the toxic effects of any
             prior therapy, meeting the following criteria: At least 2 weeks should have elapsed
             since any anti-tumor therapy and the patient must meet hematologic criteria below.
             Three-months should have elapsed in the case of completing radiation to any of the
             following fields: craniospinal, total abdominal, whole lung, total body irradiation
             (spot irradiation to skull-based metastases is NOT considered craniospinal radiation
             for the purposes of this study. Cytokine therapy must be discontinued a minimum of 24
             hours prior to 131I-MIBG therapy.

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2x upper limit of normal; AST/ALT ≤ 10x upper limit of normal

          -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 2x upper limit of normal OR 24-hr creatinine clearance OR GFR ≥ 60
             ml/min/1.73m2(For example, a patient would meet this criteria if GFR &lt; 60
             ml/min/1.73m2 but serum creatinine ≤ 2x upper limit of normal.)

          -  ANC ≥ 750/µL; Platelets ≥ 50,000/µL without transfusion if stem cells are not
             available (ANC ≥ 500 and any platelet count allowed if stem cells available). Patient
             must be off myeloid growth factors for at least 24 hours. If the patient has received
             prior treatment with MIBG, they may be thrombocytopenic, but requiring no more than 2
             platelet transfusions per week to maintain counts above 20,000. Hemoglobin must be ≥
             10 gm/dL (transfusion allowed) regardless of stored stem cell availability.

          -  Normal lung function as manifested by no dyspnea at rest or exercise intolerance, no
             oxygen requirement

          -  No clinically significant cardiac dysfunction

          -  Signed informed consent/assent: The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized
             guardian must acknowledge in writing that consent/assent to become a study subject has
             been obtained, in accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S.
             Department of Health and Human Services.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to
             withstand therapy. Significant organ impairment should be discussed with the Principal
             Investigator prior to patient entry.

          -  No patients who are pregnant or lactating will be allowed. Patients of childbearing
             potential must practice an effective method of birth control while participating on
             this study, to avoid possible damage to the fetus. Abstinence is an effective method
             of birth control.

          -  Patients who are on hemodialysis

          -  Proteinuria, in the absence of urinary infection, within 4 weeks prior to the planned
             treatment date is a relative contraindication to receiving therapy for patients with
             pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma with any
             proteinuria must have a 24-hr urine protein determination. If proteinuria is confirmed
             as being above the institutional upper limit of normal, the patient is ineligible for
             MIBG therapy.
