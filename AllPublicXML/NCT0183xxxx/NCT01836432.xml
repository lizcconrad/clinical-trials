  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most
      patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to die from the rapid progression of their
      disease. One primary reason for this is that the disease is typically without symptoms until
      significant local and/or distant spread has occurred and is often beyond the chance for cure
      at the time of the diagnosis. The lack of any treatment to substantially increase long term
      survival rates is reflected by the poor outcomes associated with this disease, specifically
      time to disease progression and overall survival.

      However, another important part of the body is now being looked at as a target for therapy
      against this disease - the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that pancreatic tumor
      cells produce a number of defective proteins, or express normal proteins in highly
      uncharacteristic ways, as part of this cancer. In some cancers, these abnormalities can cause
      an immune response to the cancer cells much in the way one responds to infected tissue. In
      progressive cancers however, the immune system fails to effectively identify or respond to
      these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or destroyed for reasons not yet
      fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a new way to stimulate the immune system to
      recognize pancreatic cancer cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks
      the growth of the cancer.

      This new method of treatment helps the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients to
      &quot;identify&quot; the cancerous tissue so that it can be eliminated from the body. As an example,
      most people are aware that patients with certain diseases may require an organ transplant to
      replace a damaged kidney or heart. After receiving their transplant, these patients receive
      special drugs because they are at great danger of having an immune response that destroys or
      &quot;rejects&quot; the transplanted organ. This &quot;rejection&quot; occurs when their immune system responds
      to differences between the cells of the transplanted organ and their own immune system by
      attacking the foreign tissue in the same way as it would attack infected tissue. When the
      differences between foreign tissues and the patient's body are even larger, as with the
      differences between organs from different species, the rejection is very rapid, highly
      destructive, and the immunity it generates is longlasting. This is called hyperacute
      rejection and the medicine used to immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this
      response to teach a patient's immune system to fight their pancreatic cancer just as the body
      would learn to reject a transplanted organ from an animal.

      To do this, Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contains human pancreatic cancer cells that contain
      a mouse gene that marks the cancer cells as foreign to patient's immune systems. The immune
      system therefore attacks these cancer cells just as they would attack any truly foreign
      tissue, destroying as much as it can. Additionally, the immune system is stimulated to
      identify differences (aside from the mouse gene) between these cancer cells and normal human
      tissue as foreign. This &quot;education&quot; of the immune system helps treat the patient because
      pancreatic cancer cells already present in a treated patient are believed to show some of the
      same differences from normal tissue as the modified pancreatic cancer cells in the product.
      Due to these similarities, the immune system, once &quot;educated&quot; by the Algenpantucel-L
      immunotherapy, identifies the patient's cancer as foreign and attacks.

      The chemotherapy combination to be used in this study has been shown to improve survival in
      advanced pancreatic cancer and is being combined with an experimental pancreatic cancer
      immunotherapy that stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. One goal
      of this study is to determine whether chemotherapy and immunotherapies can work cooperatively
      to increase anti-tumor effects to levels beyond what would be seen with either treatment
      alone.

      In this experimental study, all patients are given a strong combination of anti-tumor
      chemotherapies while some patients are also given injections of an immunotherapy drug
      consisting of two types of pancreatic cancer cells that we have modified to make them more
      easily recognized and attacked by the immune system. We propose to test this new treatment
      protocol in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer to demonstrate that treatment
      with the immunotherapy increases the time until the tumor progresses or increases overall
      survival when given in combination with the current standard of care therapy for this
      disease.

      This protocol attempts to treat pancreatic cancer therapy using a naturally occurring barrier
      to xenotransplantation in humans to increase the efficacy of immunizing patients against
      their pancreatic cancer. In this protocol, the transfer of the murine α(1,3)
      galactosyltransferase [α(1,3)GT] gene to immunotherapy component cells results in the cell
      surface expression of α(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (αgal) epitopes on membrane glycoproteins and
      glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response. This
      response occurs when organs are transplanted from lower animal donor species into primates
      and results in rapid destruction of transplanted tissue and an augmented response against
      transplant antigens, including antigens not related to the αgal epitopes. Human hosts have
      pre-existing anti-α-gal antibodies that are thought to result from chronic immunological
      stimulation due to exposure to α-gal epitopes that are naturally expressed on normal gut
      flora and these antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG).
      Opsonization and lysis of the immunotherapy component cells mediated by this antibody is
      believed to increase the efficiency of antigen processing by targeting vaccine components to
      antigen presenting cells via the Fcγ receptor.

               2. Venous involvement of the SMV/portal vein demonstrating tumor abutment with
                  impingement and narrowing of the lumen, encasement of the SMV/portal vein but
                  without encasement of the nearby arteries, or short-segment venous occlusion
                  resulting from either tumor thrombus or encasement but with suitable vessel
                  proximal and distal to the area of vessel involvement, allowing for safe
                  resection and reconstruction

                  segment encasement or direct abutment of the hepatic artery without extension to
                  the celiac axis.

               4. Tumor abutment of the SMA not to exceed greater than 180 degrees of the
                  circumference of the vessel wall.

          -  Tumors considered to be unresectable due to local advancement include an absence of
             distant metastases as well as:

               1. Head: Greater than 180 degrees SMA encasement or any celiac abutment or
                  unreconstructible SMV/portal occlusion or aortic invasion or encasement.

               2. Body: Greater than 180 degrees SMA or celiac encasement or unreconstructible
                  SMV/portal occlusion or aortic invasion.

               3. Tail: SMA or celiac encasement greater than 180 degrees.

               4. Nodal status: Involvement of lymph nodes beyond the field of resection should be
                  considered unresectable due to distant spread and therefore not eligible for this
                  protocol.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 1.

          -  Serum albumin ≥ 2.0 gm/dL.

          -  Expected survival ≥ 6 months.

          -  Adequate organ function including:

               1. Marrow: WBC ≥3000/mm^3 and platelets ≥100,000/mm^3.

               2. Hepatic: serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, ALT (SGPT) and AST (SGOT) ≤3 x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) at time of enrollment. If a patient has elevated liver
                  function tests at the time of initial presentation or develops them during
                  work-up and they are the result of a mechanical obstruction of biliary drainage
                  by tumor compression or invasion, a biliary drain may be placed as described in
                  NCCN Practice Guidelines in Oncology V2.2012. If drainage allows for the liver
                  function tests to come within inclusion criteria, the patient may be enrolled.

               3. Renal: serum creatinine (sCr) ≤2.0 x ULN, or creatinine clearance (Ccr) ≥30
                  mL/min.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand the study, its inherent risks, side
             effects and potential benefits and be able to give written informed consent to
             participate. Patients may not be consented by a durable power of attorney (DPA).

          -  All subjects of child producing potential must agree to use contraception or avoidance
             of pregnancy measures while enrolled on study and receiving the experimental product,
             and for one month after the last immunization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt;18-years-old.

          -  Active metastases.

          -  Other malignancy within five years, unless the probability of recurrence of the prior
             malignancy is &lt;5% as determined by the Principal Investigator based on available
             information. Patient's curatively treated for squamous and basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin or patients with a history of malignant tumor in the past that have been disease
             free for at least five years are also eligible for this study.

          -  History of organ transplant.

          -  Current, active immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, etc.

          -  Subjects taking chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy for any reason are not
             eligible. Subjects may receive steroids as prophylactic anti-emetics per the
             FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel regimen. Subjects receiving inhaled or
             topical corticosteroids are eligible. Subjects who require chronic systemic
             corticosteroids after beginning treatment, will be removed from study.

          -  Significant or uncontrolled congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction or
             significant ventricular arrhythmias within the last six months.

          -  Patient has active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring
             systemic therapy.

          -  Autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis
             (RA), etc.). Patients with a remote history of asthma or mild active asthma are
             eligible.

          -  Other serious medical conditions that may be expected to limit life expectancy to less
             than 2 years (e.g., active liver cirrhosis) or a serious illness in medical opinion of
             the clinical investigator.

          -  Any condition, psychiatric or otherwise, that would preclude informed consent,
             consistent follow-up or compliance with any aspect of the study (e.g., untreated
             schizophrenia or other significant cognitive impairment, etc.).

          -  A known history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of
             their excipients.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women due to the unknown effects of immunization on the developing
             fetus or newborn infant. (For patients with child bearing potential, a βHCG must be
             completed within 14 days of first treatment).

          -  Known HIV positive.

          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy or radiation for pancreatic cancer or prior
             treatment with radiation for other diagnoses to expected pancreatic cancer treatment
