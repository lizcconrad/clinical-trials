    <textblock>
      To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole as an adjunctive treatment to
      an antidepressant treatment (ADT) for adult patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration of the study was 32 weeks and the study consisted of Periods A, B, and A+.
      Patients entered the study in Period A and were treated open-label with one of six
      commercially available antidepressant treatments (ADTs) for 8 weeks. Patients who met the
      blinded response criteria at the Week 6 Visit, were deemed early responders and were
      withdrawn from the study. At Week 8, patients with inadequate response to placebo + ADT, as
      per the randomisation criteria, entered Period B and were randomised to received double-blind
      brexpiprazole + ADT or placebo + ADT for 24 weeks. Non-randomised patients continued in
      Period A+ and received placebo + ADT until the end of the study. The primary objective was to
      compare the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole with placebo. This comparison occurred
      Period B; therefore, the focus is Period B.

    <measure>Full Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomisation to end of Period B (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Full remission is defined as a Montomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score ≤10 and a ≥50% decrease from randomisation in MADRS total score for at least 8 consecutive weeks during randomized treatment. The MADRS is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 to 6. The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The overall score ranges from 0 (symptoms absent) to 60 (severe depression). The MADRS total score is the sum of the 10 items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Full Functional Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomisation to end of Period B (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Full functional remission is defined as a Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score &lt;=6 and all SDS domain scores &lt;=2 observed for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the randomised treatment period. The SDS assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>

    <measure>Full Global Score Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomisation to end of Period B (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Full global score remission is defined as a Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score &lt;=2 observed for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the randomised treatment period. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale where the clinician rates the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis, on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Time in Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomisation to end of Period B (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The total time the patient spends in remission during randomised treatment. Remission is defined as a MADRS total score &lt;=10 and a &gt;=50% decrease from randomisation in MADRS total score. Time in remission is defined as the sum of days over all periods between Period B visits where remission was obtained. The period between two visits is counted as in remission if the patient was in remission when the period started.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Full Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomisation to end of Period B (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The time from randomisation until full remission has been obtained. Full remission is defined as a MADRS total score ≤10 and a ≥50% decrease from randomisation in MADRS total score for at least 8 consecutive weeks during randomised treatment. The time to full remission was calculated using Kaplan-Meier Methods.</description>

    <measure>Full Remission Sustained During the Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomisation to end of Period B (24 weeks)</time_frame>

Full remission is defined as a MADRS total score ≤10 and a ≥50% decrease from randomisation in MADRS total score for at least 8 consecutive weeks during randomised treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomisation to week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The original Q-LES-Q is a patient self-rated scale designed to measure the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by patients in various areas of daily life. It consists of 93 items to measure: physical health, feelings, work, household duties, school, leisure time activities, social relations, and general activities. The Q-LES-Q short form (SF) contains 16 items from the general activities section. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The total score is the sum of the first 14 items. The last two scores are stand-alone items. The total score ranges from 14 to 70.</description>

        <title>Full Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Full remission is defined as a Montomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score ≤10 and a ≥50% decrease from randomisation in MADRS total score for at least 8 consecutive weeks during randomized treatment. The MADRS is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 to 6. The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The overall score ranges from 0 (symptoms absent) to 60 (severe depression). The MADRS total score is the sum of the 10 items.</description>

        <title>Full Functional Remission During the Randomised Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Full functional remission is defined as a Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score &lt;=6 and all SDS domain scores &lt;=2 observed for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the randomised treatment period. The SDS assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>

        <description>Full global score remission is defined as a Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score &lt;=2 observed for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the randomised treatment period. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale where the clinician rates the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis, on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>

The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.</description>

        <description>The original Q-LES-Q is a patient self-rated scale designed to measure the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by patients in various areas of daily life. It consists of 93 items to measure: physical health, feelings, work, household duties, school, leisure time activities, social relations, and general activities. The Q-LES-Q short form (SF) contains 16 items from the general activities section. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The total score is the sum of the first 14 items. The last two scores are stand-alone items. The total score ranges from 14 to 70.</description>
