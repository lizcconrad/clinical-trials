  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency Departments (EDs) are a critical component of the U.S. healthcare system, treating
      over 119 million patients each year. While EDs have historically neglected tobacco control
      efforts, several recent studies have examined the feasibility and efficacy of implementing
      tobacco cessation in the ED. Work by our research team and others, has shown that tobacco
      treatment is both feasible and effective in the ED setting.

      Effective, evidence-based interventions for treating tobacco dependence have also been
      codified in the United States Public Health Service guidelines. Even brief interventions
      delivered by physicians and other healthcare providers can produce significant increases in
      cessation across diverse clinical settings (e.g., outpatient clinics, surgery units, EDs),
      and patient groups (cardiac, respiratory, general admissions). However, in clinical practice,
      delivery of tobacco interventions is inconsistent at best, particularly in non-primary care
      settings.

      This translational study uses an existing Emergency Department Information System (EDIS), to
      facilitate the identification of smokers and to enhance the provision of smoking cessation
      intervention materials and pharmacological adjuncts for patients receiving treatment in the
      ED. The EDIS tracks the geographic and chronologic progression of patients through the ED and
      contains triage and nursing notes, lab values, radiology reports and links to images, vital
      signs, embedded printable discharge instructions, and fax links to primary care provider
      (PCP) offices.

      Following recruitment of a baseline (care-as-usual) cohort (Step 1), the investigators will
      provide training to ED physicians and staff to improve the identification and treatment of
      smokers. Following Step 1, the investigators will make adaptations to the EDIS system that
      include smoking status tracking, tobacco treatment prompts and medication information panels
      for the emergency treating physician, and links to printable discharge instructions,
      quit-smoking medication information and referral to a pro-active phone follow-up counseling
      for enrolled smokers. A second cohort of participants (Step 2) will be enrolled after
      implementation is complete. Contemporaneous with Steps 1 and 2, participant cohorts will be
      recruited at a control site (UMass Medical) to control for potential effects of historical
      trends. This study represents a comprehensive systems-based translation of empirically
      supported tobacco treatment built into a widely used patient tracking platform (MedHost)
      maximizing the probability of developing a sustainable tobacco intervention that can be
      readily disseminated.

      Specific Aims A.1. To test the incremental efficacy of a modified Emergency Department
      Information System (EDIS) &quot;MedHost&quot;, using a multiple-cohort design implemented in 2 steps.
      Two recruitment phases (baseline/care as usual and full implementation) will be used to
      assess the impact of EDIS enhancements on rates of identification and treatment of ED
      patients who smoke. The primary outcome is the difference in six-month abstinence between
      those recruited prior to program implementation (Baseline) versus those recruited when the
      program is fully implemented (Step 2). H1) Smokers enrolled during Step 2 at RIH will show
      significantly greater cessation at month 6 compared Step 1 and control site participants.

      A.2. To compare rates of smoker identification, physician intervention and follow up care for
      smoking cessation and use of quit-smoking medications among ED patients recruited before and
      after EDIS modification. H2) Compared to Step 1 and the control site, Step 2 will show
      significantly higher rates of smoker identification, physician intervention and follow-up for
      smoking, and use of quit-smoking medications.

      A.3. To investigate the effects of the EDIS enhancement on relevant behavioral and
      psychological constructs that may act as mediators of smoking behavior change (&quot;Mechanisms of
      Action&quot;), and the relationships of these potential mediators to smoking cessation (e.g.,
      perceived risk, nicotine dependence; in Measures section). H3) Participants enrolled during
      Step 2 at RIH will show greater changes in posited mediational constructs than those enrolled
      in Step 1 and at the control site.

      A.4. To examine the incremental costs of implementation of the intervention and to conduct
      analyses of marginal cost effectiveness using cost-per-smoker-quit. (This aim is not
      hypothesis driven) Exploratory Aim: A.5. To examine ED physician and other health care
      providers (HCP) attitudes regarding the utility of the EDIS system for tobacco intervention.
      The investigators will conduct interviews with ED physicians and nurses to elicit their
      perceptions of the usefulness and helpfulness of the modified EDIS, and its effects on their
      perceived self-efficacy and motivation to provide tobacco intervention. The investigators
      will also solicit direct feedback on the modified platform and user interface.
