    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and immune response to DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion
      protein CDX-1401 and decitabine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid
      leukemia. DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein, called CDX-1401, is a full length NY-ESO-1 protein
      sequence fused to a monoclonal antibody against DEC-205, a surface marker present on many
      immune stimulatory cells. This drug is given with another substance called PolyICLC, which
      acts to provoke any immune stimulatory cells which encounter the NY-ESO-1-DEC-205 fusion
      protein to produce an immune response signal against NY-ESO-1. Immune cells which have thus
      been primed to react against NY-ESO-1 may then attack myelodysplastic or leukemic cells which
      express NY-ESO-1 after exposure to the drug decitabine. The chemotherapy drug decitabine is
      thought to act in several different ways, first, it may directly kill cancer cells, and
      secondly, the drug can cause cancer cells to re-express genes that are turned off by the
      cancer, including the gene for NY-ESO-1. Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein (CDX-1401)
      and polyICLC together with decitabine may allow the immune system to more effectively
      recognize cancer cells and kill them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of Anti-DEC-205-NY-ESOI (CDX-1401) fusion protein (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1
      fusion protein CDX-1401) given in combination with decitabine 20 mg/m^2 intravenously.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity by determination of NY-ESO-1
      specific antibody, and T-cell clones following standard treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
      (decitabine) in conjunction with immune sensitization with Anti-DEC 205-NY-ESO-I fusion
      protein (CDX-1401).

      II. To determine the impact of decitabine treatment on peripheral blood cells from patients
      treated in this manner on NY-ESO-1 target gene expression, NY-ESO protein expression,
      NY-ESO-1 promoter methylation, and global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the response rate (complete response, partial response and hematological
      improvement) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients treated with the combination in order to provide descriptive characteristics.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 subcutaneously (SC) and
      intradermally (ID) and poly-ICLC subcutaneously (SC) on days -14 and 15 of course 1 and on
      day 15 for courses 2-4. Patients also receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days.
