      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when given together
      with cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with high-risk acute
      myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, cytarabine, and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Azacitidine may also help cytarabine
      and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work better by making the cancer cells more sensitive to the
      drugs

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the recommended phase II dose of 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) when combined
      with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) chemotherapy
      in high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete remission (CR) rate following the use of induction chemotherapy
      regimen of 5-azacytidine followed by high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and mitoxantrone
      chemotherapy in high-risk AML patients.

      II. To determine the toxicity of the combination regimen. III. To determine the disease-free
      survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patient population.

      IV. To determine the gene expression levels of topoisomerase II and deoxycytidine kinase in
      leukemia blasts pre-treatment and following therapy with 5-azacytidine.

      V. To collect specimens for banking for use in future research studies with a view to
      elucidating the predictors of response to epigenetic therapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azacitidine.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes or
      subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 4 hours on days 6 and 10,
      and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on days 6 and 10.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive azacitidine IV over 10-40 minutes or SC QD on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation continue
      on to maintenance.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive azacitidine IV over 10-40 minutes or SC QD on days 1-5. Courses
      repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended phase II dose of azacitidine when combined with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, based on incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4</measure>
    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>DLT defined as any grade 4 or greater non-hematologic toxicity (except transient [less than 48 hours] nausea/vomiting, transient [less than 48 hours] liver function test derangements) or a grade 3 non-hematological toxicity lasting more than 7 days. Persistent bone marrow aplasia (in the absence of bone marrow involvement with disease) lasting more than 56 days would also be regarded as a DLT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gene expression levels of topoisomerase II and deoxycytidine kinase in leukemic blasts pre-treatment and following therapy with azacitidine will be measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Will be compared using a two-sample t test. If the data do not appear to be normally distributed, a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used in place of the t-test. Normality will be assessed using graphical techniques, such as normality probability plots.</description>

                       (t-MN); this broad definition is meant to include any prior therapy with
                       chemicals that affect DNA replication, DNA integrity, or DNA structure, or
                       chemicals that alter cell growth; this includes traditional cytotoxic
                       chemotherapy, newer immunologic agents that have been shown to have
                       cytotoxic activities in addition to immunosuppressive functions, and other
                       chemicals; note that patients with primary AML could be diagnosed with a t-
                       MN if morphology/cytogenetic analysis clearly indicated that the second
                       process is not a relapse of the original disease

               -  AML arising from an antecedent hematological disorder age &gt;= 18 years

               -  De novo AML in patients age &gt;= 60 years

             and for at least 6 months after study treatment

          -  Patients must be at least 2 weeks from major surgery, radiation therapy, participation
             in other investigational trials and must have recovered from clinically significant
             toxicities of these prior treatments

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

             in this protocol

          -  Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

          -  Use of investigational agents/any anticancer therapy within 2 weeks before study entry
             with the exception of hydroxyurea (note: for patients with hyperleukocytosis [white
             blood cell (WBC) &gt; 20,000/uL], hydroxyurea [and leukapheresis, if clinically
             indicated] will be initiated and these patients will receive 5-azacytidine when the
             WBC count has decreased to =&lt; 20,000/uL; hydroxyurea can be overlapped with

             the prior therapy was identical to the schema/schedule proposed in this study)

          -  Active second cancer other than specified; active cancer refers to cancer that
             requires systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy within 6 months of the study

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ
             dysfunction (e.g. uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary
             disease, infection, psychiatric illness) that may in the judgment of the treating
             physician/ principal investigator place the patient at undue risk to undergo treatment

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients

          -  Any significant concurrent illness that would, in the judgment of the treating
             physician/principal investigator, compromise patient safety or compliance, or study
