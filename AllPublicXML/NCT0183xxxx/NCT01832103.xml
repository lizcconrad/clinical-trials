      The primary purpose of this study is to obtain a preliminary pharmacokinetic profile of
      MK-7145 2 mg immediate release (IR) following single-dose administration in male participants
      with moderate renal insufficiency. In addition, the study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      effect of a single dose of MK-7145 2 mg IR on 24-hour net natriuresis in male participants
      with moderate renal insufficiency.
