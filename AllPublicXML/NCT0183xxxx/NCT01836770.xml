  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the contrast flow patterns in the epidural space
      using the inferior-anterior approach with continuous fluoroscopic guidance, and determine how
      well this approach correlates with appropriate contrast flow patterns and with analgesia at
      follow up. This knowledge may prove useful in guiding physician practice patterns in the
      non-surgical management of low back pain.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be suitable (ventral/anterior)
      epidural contrast spread based on inferior-anterior needle-tip position, particularly with
      appropriate needle tip position.

    <description>Contrast flow patterns will be used as the primary outcome measure. The statistical test to be employed is to compare the proportions of patients in the study who experienced posterior flow, anterior flow and if that anterior flow had spread to more than 1 vertebral level in either direction, what that direction was, and the presence or absence of vascular flow.</description>

    <description>VAS Pain Score - The statistical test to be employed is Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare if there is a difference in pain score at appointments 1 months and 3 months post-injection relative to pre-injection.</description>
