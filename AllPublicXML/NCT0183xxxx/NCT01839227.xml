  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a well-recognized complication of patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery. Previous studies reported near-infrared spectroscopy provides
      information on the occurrence of cerebral desaturation resulted in POCD. But evidence of POCD
      after general surgery has been lacking. Especially, the prone position is used primarily for
      surgical access to the posterior spine, if there is any significant lowering of the legs or
      tilt of the entire table, venous returns may be decrease or augmented accordingly. The
      purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between POCD and intra-operative
      cerebral oxygen saturation after spine surgery in elderly patients.

    <description>Correlation between rSO2 and POCD
The average, left and right absolute rSO2 values were collected every 30 seconds. rSO2 value was recorded as excel data.
Absolute rSO2 value and AUT(area under the threshold) send beneath the absolute threshold limits of 40%, 50%, 60% and 20% under the baseline. AUT was calculated based on this formula: AUT (present)=AUT (past)+(rSO2 threshold-rSO2 value)Ã—sample rate

    <description>Cognitive functioning was assessed with the following test: Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and visuomotor test of D-LOTCA battery.
Regional cerebral oxygen saturation was continuously monitored using the INVOS 5100 (somatics,Troy, MI) with bifrontal placement of two sensors before the induction of the anesthesia until the end of operation.
Baseline rSO2 was defined as the average saturation value over a 1 min period before induction of general anesthesia, beginning approximately 3 min after the sensors were applied in supine position. After the induction, baseline prone rSO2 was defined over a 5min period after the change of position.
There is no intervention were made according to rSO2 values. Physiologic variables including BIS, PaCO2,PaO2, glucose, electrolyte, hematocrit, HR, MAP, and nasopharyngeal temperature were measured every 1 hours during the surgery.</description>
