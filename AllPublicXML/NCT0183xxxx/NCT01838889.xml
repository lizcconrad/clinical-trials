  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a group psychological
      intervention for postnatal depression in British mother's of south Asian origin. The aim is
      to evaluate the efficacy of a group psychological intervention (PHP) based on the principles
      of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in treating depression in postpartum women. The hypothesis is
      that depressed British women of South Asian origin receiving the group intervention will show
      significant improvements in terms of severity of depression as compared to the treatment as
      usual (TAU) control group.
