      Background/Justification: Regular physical activity (PA) has substantial health benefits in
      persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D), including reduced risk of complications and
      cardiovascular mortality. Despite these benefits, individuals with T1D remain significantly
      less active than their peers without diabetes. Two major factors likely explain the low rates
      of PA in young people with T1D: (1) fear of post-exercise hypoglycaemia, particularly
      nocturnal hypoglycaemia, and (2) a lack of empirical evidence for the efficacy of PA for
      achieving optimal glycaemic control. A number of acute exercise trials recently demonstrated
      that the inclusion of vigorous intensity PA in conventional moderate intensity (i.e. walking)
      PA sessions may overcome these limitations. No studies have tested the efficacy of high
      intensity PA for reducing the risk of exercise-related hypoglycaemia or glycaemic variability
      in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Study Hypotheses: In persons 15-35 years of age living with T1D, this study will test the
      hypotheses that (1) the addition of intermittent vigorous intensity PA to a moderate
      intensity intervention will reduce the time spent in hypoglycaemia in the 12 hour period
      following exercise and (2) the addition of intermittent vigorous intensity PA to a moderate
      intensity PA intervention will elicit significant improvements in glycemic excursions, as
      measured by the Mean Amplitude of Glycaemic Excursions (MAGE), in the 12-hour period
      following exercise.We are also exploring the hypothesis that reducing the risk of
      hypoglycemia will lead to a sustained increase in physical activity one year after
      randomization.
