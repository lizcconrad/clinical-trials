  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the effect that dietary carbohydrates have on blood
      sugar by measuring the glycaemic index. The glycaemic index is a comparison between the
      effect of equal amounts of carbohydrate from a test food compared to a standard (in this case
      glucose) on blood sugar.

      Different foods that contain different carbohydrates have different effects on blood sugars.
      This is of interest as a number of studies have shown that the level of sugar in the blood
      after a meal relates directly to the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. The aim
      of collecting this data is to be able to give advice to people about the carbohydrates they
      eat to reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease.

      The study is a randomized cross-over controlled trial: the order of the test foods will be
      randomized by an independent internet-based program; each participant will be asked to
      consume all the products; the test food will be compared with a control (in this case 50g
      glucose).

      Suitable subjects will be invited for a screening visit to check for eligibility criteria.
      Body weight and height measurements will be taken as well as a standard biochemical and
      haematological screen. If they are eligible and willing to take part, volunteers will be
      entered into a database and contacted when a GI test becomes available. Volunteers may take
      part in more than one GI testing up to a maximum of 40 visits per year. Volunteers may
      withdraw from the database or the study at any time without giving any reason.

      Subjects will be asked to come for a set amount of visits for each GI test depending on the
      number of product that need to be tested (minimum 3 maximum 12 visits for each testing). The
      volunteers will be informed of the number of visits before they enter the GI testing. For
      each visit, subjects are tested in the morning after a 10-12h overnight fast.

      Three fasting blood samples are taken (-5, -3, -1) 2 minutes apart after which subjects
      consume the test meal or reference food at an even rate over 15 min. All subjects are asked
      to record the time it takes in minutes to consume the test food/reference. Further blood
      samples are taken at 15, 30, 31, 32, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the beginning of the meal.
      The test meal and reference food should be consumed with a 250ml drink of water. This remains
      constant for each of the tests in the series.

      Blood is obtained by finger-pricking using disposable Unistix needles. In previous studies,
      capillary blood has yielded less between-subject variation in GI. Instant glucose analysers
      will be used.

    <description>Reference food The reference food is 50 g glucose powder dissolved in 250ml water
Test foods The test foods are prepared according to manufacturer's instructions, representing the food as normally consumed. The test foods are consumed once only on separate occasions as a portion providing 50g of available carbohydrate.
Breakfast cereals should be consumed with 150 ml milk which is additional to the 50 g available carbohydrate in the cereal. In testing breakfast cereals, the reference food must also be consumed with an additional 150 ml milk.</description>
