      Loss of kidney function results in accumulation in the blood of molecules that are either
      excreted or metabolized by the kidney. Collectively, these molecules are termed Uremic
      Retention Molecules (URMs) or toxins. It is increasingly recognized that colonic bacterial
      metabolites like p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate that are absorbed from the colon and
      excreted by the kidney may contribute to the pool of compounds implied in uremic toxicity.
      Indeed, these URMs have been linked to increased levels of inflammation markers, chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) progression, cardiovascular disease and overall mortality in CKD and/ or
      hemodialysis patients. Therefore, interventions that target the production or absorption of
      URMs from the gut might decrease inflammation and oxidative stress that are commonly seen in
      the uremic milieu. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) data
      show that high dietary fiber intake is associated with decreased serum levels of C-reactive
      protein (CRP) in those with and without CKD and these associations are much stronger in the
      CKD population. A possible explanation of this effect is that a high fiber diet in CKD
      patients modulates the bacterial production, intestinal absorption and finally the serum
      levels of URMs like p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, which in turn results in decrease
      in inflammation.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Hypothesis:

        1. Higher serum levels of markers of inflammation such as high sensitivity C-reactive
           protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α seen in stage 4
           CKD (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) compared to stage 2 CKD
           (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2) is partly explained by the
           higher circulating levels of URMs (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate) in stage 4 CKD,
           and

        2. Dietary supplementation in stage 4 CKD with 30g/d of a soluble fiber Psyllium (brand
           name-Metamucil TM) will decrease circulating URMs levels and thereby, decrease serum
           levels of inflammation markers and urinary levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β,
           a marker of kidney fibrosis.
