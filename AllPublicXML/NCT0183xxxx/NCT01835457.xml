  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auto-immune diseases are characterized by an inappropriate inflammatory response against
      tissues in the body and represent a major health care burden. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such
      as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β play a central role in the pathophysiology of many auto-immune
      diseases. Innovative therapies aimed at limiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a
      more physiological manner are warranted. In previous research conducted in an individual
      known as &quot;the iceman&quot;, the investigators found that, through a autodidact
      concentration/meditation technique, he appears to mount a controlled stress response,
      characterized by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and enhanced production of
      cortisol, both of which are known to result in immunosuppression. In accordance, while
      practicing this concentration/meditation technique, the inflammatory response during human
      endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] administration) was remarkably low in this individual.
      Therefore, this technique could provide a novel means of controlling the inflammatory
      response. However, the aforementioned results were obtained in just one subject, and hence
      can not serve as scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the concentration/meditation
      technique. The iceman claims that he can teach this technique to other subjects within a
      relatively short time frame. Therefore, in the present study the investigators wish to
      investigate the effect of concentration/meditation on autonomic nervous system activity and
      the inflammatory response during experimental human endotoxemia in a controlled manner, by
      comparing a group of subjects that are trained by &quot;the iceman&quot; and practice the
      concentration/meditation technique with a group of subjects which do not.
