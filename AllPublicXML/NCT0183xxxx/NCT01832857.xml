  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients
      with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors for whom there there is no available therapy to
      provide clinical benefit or for those who have refused further standard therapy. The primary
      outcome measure is Overall Survival (OS). The secondary outcome measures are: Response Rate
      (RR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and safety.

      Open-Label Single-Arm Design: This is an open-label study, and investigators and subjects are
      not blinded to the treatment. Also, the assignment of patients will not be randomized, since
      this is a single-arm study.

      Treatment with CPI-613: A treatment cycle is 4 weeks, with CPI-613 given on Days 1 and 4 of
      the first 3 weeks.

      Dose and Sample Size: The dose of CPI-613 is 3,000 mg/m2. This is Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) determined from the Phase I dose-escalated trial, Study# CL-CPI-613-009 (conducted in
      patients with hematologic malignancies under IND 107,800). This dose has also been found to
      be well tolerated in another Phase I dose-escalated trial, Study# CL-CPI-613-002 (conducted
      in patients with solid tumor under IND 74,530). There will be 20 evaluable patients with each
      tumor type. Once there are 20 evaluable patients with a particular tumor type has been
      treated with at least 1 cycle, no patients of the same tumor type will be accrued. Dosing
      Delay and Dose Modification of CPI-613 in the Event of Adverse Events: For adverse events
      unrelated to serum creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function but are possibly
      related to CPI-613, the occurrence of Grade 1 toxicity does not generally require dose
      modification for subsequent doses for that patient. However, if Grade 2 toxicity (other than
      alopecia and nausea) probably related to CPI-613 develops, treatment is to be withheld and
      can resume only after the Grade 2 toxicity has been reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose
      level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 25% of the dose at which such
      Grade 2 toxicity occurs. Grade 2 alopecia and nausea do not require withholding treatment or
      dose reduction. If Grade 3 or 4 toxicity probably related to CPI-613 develops, dosing of
      CPI-613 of that patient will be withheld and the patient shall be monitored for recovery
      from, and reversibility of, such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity. To resume treatment with CPI-613 for
      a patient who has had CPI-613-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, the Grade 3 or 4 toxicity must
      be reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will
      be reduced to 50% of the dose at which such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs.

      For adverse events related to creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function that are
      possibly related to CPI-613, dosing of the patient will be withheld even if the severity
      level is Grade 1 or above. Treatment can resume only after the toxicity has been reduced to
      Grade 0. The dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 15% if the
      severity level is of Grade 1, by 25% for Grade 2 toxicity, and by 50% for Grade 3 or 4
      toxicity.

      Furthermore, if the toxicity possibly related to CPI-613 is acute renal failure and the
      severity level is Grade 3 or 4, further patient enrollment will be temporarily suspended in
      order to enable assessment of the following aspects of the trial and implementation of
      corrective measures or protocol amendment, and if necessary:

        -  compliance of the study sites and investigators to the study protocol

        -  evaluation of the appropriateness of the procedures for monitoring renal function

    <description>This arm is for patients that have failed, or are not eligible for, all available therapies. CPI-613 drug product, provided in concentrated form at 50 mg/mL, must be diluted with D5W prior to administration. CPI-613 is to be infused intravenously (IV) via a central venous catheter. CPI-613 will be given 2x weekly, administered on Days 1 and 4 of each of the 3 treatment weeks, followed by a week of rest. The dose of CPI-613 will be 3,000 mg/m2 infused IV over 2 hours (this is the maximum tolerated dosing [MTD]), via a central venous catheter with D5W running at a rate of about 125-150 mL/hr.</description>
