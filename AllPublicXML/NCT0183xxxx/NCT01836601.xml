  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether a family-centered nighttime communication intervention
      improves: 1) shared understanding by parents, residents, and nurses of hospitalized pediatric
      patient's medical plans, 2) parent-reported errors, 3) parent and provider experience of
      nighttime medical care.
