  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to enhance the Principal Investigator's research ability
      to conduct behavioral interventions for people with lupus. This includes intervention design,
      implementation, data collection and data analysis. The Intervention to Improve Quality of
      life for African-AmericaN lupus patients (IQAN) Project is designed to examine whether a
      uniquely tailored intervention program can improve quality of life, decrease indicators of
      depression, and reduce perceived and biological indicators of stress in African American
      lupus patients. This study builds on three decades of work conducted in the field of
      arthritis self-management but differs in that the intervention mode, the disease (lupus), and
      the study population (African-Americans) are unstudied or understudied. The IQAN Project will
      use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model as its
      theoretical framework. This program has three specific aims. The first aim seeks to design a
      three armed randomized, wait list controlled trial that employs a patient-centered
      'a-la-carte' approach that offers subjects a variety of modes of interaction, allowing them
      to choose as many or few as they wish. The second aim is to assess the intervention, using
      the RE-AIM model framework. The third aim, to be achieved before the first aim, is to use
      previously collected data to characterize patient-centric barriers to care in
      African-American lupus patients, in order to identify trends in patient needs and desires, as
      well as correlates of non-response and non-compliance that can be used in the development and
      refinement of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be coordinated by an Intervention Coordinator, with assistance from
      local/MUSC Study Coordinators. A unique 'a-la-carte' self-management program will be offered
      to 50 African-American lupus patients participating in an ongoing SLE Clinic Database Project
      at MUSC. The Intervention Coordinator will work with each participant in the intervention arm
      to create an individualized intervention plan (IIP). Each IIP will include 1-4 options,
      including a mail-delivered arthritis kit, addition and access to a listserv, participation in
      a support group, and enrollment in local self-management program(s). Due to the nature of the
      IIP, the proposed intervention will inherently vary by participant. A 'set menu' control
      group of 50 lupus patients will be offered a standardized chronic disease self-management
      program only, and a control group of 50 lupus patients will receive usual care (UC), void of
      intervention components. Validated measures of stress, depression, and quality of life will
      be collected in all patients in each condition before and after intervention activities. To
      ensure intervention integrity, discrete components will follow written protocols and peer
      leaders will complete a standardized checklist for each session/encounter.

    <intervention_name>Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is a 2.5 hour workshop given weekly for six weeks. People with different chronic health problems attend together and support one another in making positive changes in their health. Workshops are facilitated by two trained leaders, one or both of whom are non-health professionals with a chronic disease themselves. It is the process in which the program is taught that makes it effective. Classes are highly participative, and mutual support builds the participants' confidence in their ability to manage their health and maintain active and fulfilling lives.</description>

    <description>Interested participants will be referred to the &quot;Lupus: Listening and Learning Group&quot;, a Charleston-based support group affiliated with the Lupus Foundation of America (LFA). One to two LFA-trained facilitators implement the group. The meeting format generally includes a specific discussion topic or an informative presentation such as by a medical or counseling professional, pharmacist, or lupus researcher. This program is followed by time within the group for further interaction and support among the attendees who wish to participate. The Lupus: Listening and Learning Group is open to all lupus patients, family members, friends and supporters, and there is no pre-registration or fee involved.</description>

    <description>A project listserv will be established to link all intervention participants to facilitate exchange of coping strategies, pose questions, and share preferred educational resources or any other information relative to their everyday and disease-specific experiences and/or participation in the project. Participants will be provided with a URL, from which they will be able to subscribe to the listserv. Once subscribed, they will be able to post and receive messages, managed by a listserv moderator, who will be responsible for distribution to listserv members as appropriate. Participants will have the option to unsubscribe at any time.</description>
