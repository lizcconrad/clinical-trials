  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study proposes to address the question of whether patients' cerebral oxygen
      saturation levels are predictive of their recovery from thoracic surgery. Further, the study
      poses the hypothesis that a patient's poor recovery status goes on to increase a patient's
      risk of developing post-operative morbidities such as pneumonia, arrhythmias and delirium.
      The aim of this study is to address the observation that some patients struggle more than
      others in their recovery and that 1) this may be a result of intraoperative cerebral oxygen
      desaturations and 2) that this may affect their post-operative morbidity. If a potential
      means of predicting poor outcomes is identified this will lead to further research into how
      to adjust the associated variables, such as cerebral oxygenation, to improve patient
      post-operative outcome.

      Despite advances in the field of thoracic surgery, post-operative morbidity continues to be a
      significant problem with limited understanding of the connection between the insult of
      surgery and anesthesia and the pathophysiology of the development of these morbidities.
      Surgeons in the thoracic department have noted that some patients seem to recover less
      vigorously than other patients. What accounts for these different recovery trajectories is
      unclear. Researchers have developed a Post-Operative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS) which
      assesses six domains (physiologic, nociceptive, emotive, activities of daily living,
      cognitive, and overall patient experience) and has been suggested to serve as a means of
      tracking patients' recovery from surgery.

        Anticipated inclusion is all patients scheduled for thoracic surgery at Mount Sinai
        Hospital by the aforementioned surgeons Dr. Flores and Dr. Kaufman. Exclusion criteria will
        be those patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are less that the age of 18 years old,
        (3) are currently prisoners, (4) do not display the capacity to consent to the trial and
        (5) who are unwilling to complete the study. Screening for exclusion criteria will occur
        primarily in the pre-operative setting under the guidance of Drs. Flores and Kaufman and
        will be reviewed by the Research Coordinator and acting anesthesiologist on the day of
        surgery.
