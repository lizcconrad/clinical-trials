  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Velcade
      and Rituximab in patients with relapsed Non Hodgkin's Follicular Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive the combination Velcade-rituximab for up to a total of 6
      cycles of Velcade and 6 infusion of rituximab.

      Patients will be evaluated for clinical, laboratory, imaging parameters at baseline, during
      study treatment, at the end of the treatment and during follow up (every 6 months for 3
      years). In the first stage, 17 patients will be treated. An interim analysis will be
      performed after recruitment of the first 17 evaluable patients. Aim of this analysis is to
      determine preliminary the activity of the treatment.If &gt; 7 responses are observed, the
      accrual is continued and 24 additional patients are treated up to a total of 41. If ≤ 21
      respond, the treatment is rejected as ineffective. If 22 or more respond, the treatment is
      judged promising for further development.

             chemotherapy regimen and/or immunochemotherapy;

          -  age &gt; 18 years;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2;

          -  no evidence of transformation to a high grade lymphoma;

          -  evidence of ≥ grade 2 neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment;

          -  known hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol;

          -  known hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions to murine antibodies or proteins;
