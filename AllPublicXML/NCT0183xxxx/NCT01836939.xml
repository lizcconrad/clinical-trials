      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CNDO 201Trichuris
      suis ova (TSO) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      Psoriasis is driven by T-cell infiltration in the epidermis. The T-cells involved in
      psoriasis exhibit a Th17-like and a Th1-like cytokine secretion profile. This excess Th17/Th1
      response is thought to play a critical role in the development of psoriasis, and reducing
      Th17/Th1 activity would be a potential way of halting the inflammatory process leading to
      psoriasis.
