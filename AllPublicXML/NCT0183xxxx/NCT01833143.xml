  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the drug Bortezomib to see how well it works. The
      investigators want to find out what effects, good or bad, it has on patients with a limited
      smoking history or who have a specific mutation associated with their lung cancer.

    <measure>Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Before each drug dose, the patient will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may have occurred after the previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0,).</description>

    <description>Bortezomib will be administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) at 1.3 mg/m2/dose followed by a 10-day rest period for a 21 day cycle. Dose modifications are permitted as per a prescribed algorithm. Acyclovir at 400mg daily is recommended as prophylaxis for herpes zoster. Restaging scans, with evaluation of response, will be done every 2 cycles (6 weeks of treatment ± 7 days). Treatment will continue until clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, treatment delay &gt; 2 weeks, or at the discretion of the treating physician or patient.</description>
