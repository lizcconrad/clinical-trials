      Objective: It is often difficult to distinguish a benign endometrial disease from a
      malignancy and tools to help physician are needed, in order to triage patients into high and
      low risk of endometrial cancer (EC). The purpose of this study was to obtain a predictive
      model to asses the Risk of Endometrial Malignancy (REM) in women with ultrasound endometrial
      abnormalities.Women, between 45 and 80 years, diagnosed with ultrasound endometrial
      abnormalities and scheduled to have surgery were enrolled on a prospective study at
      Department of Gynaecologic Oncology of Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. Preoperative clinical,
      ultrasound and laboratory features were taken into account. Logistic regression algorithm was
      utilized to categorize patients into low and high risk groups for EC.

    <measure>REM (RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL MALIGNANCY): a proposal for a new scoring system to evaluate risk of endometrial malignancy.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>We select patients affected by endometrial cancer and benign endometrial disease. Preoperative they underwent to pelvic ultrasound, CA125 and HE4 dosage and anamnesis. They will be considered as training group to obtaine the probability of endometrial malignancy based on HE4, ultrasound features and symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>We select a verification set, composed by endometrial cancer disease and benign endometrial pathologies patients. In this set we apply the risk of endometrial cancer tool, obtained in the training set, in order to verify the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.</description>
