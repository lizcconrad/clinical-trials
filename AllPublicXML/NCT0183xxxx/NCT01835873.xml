  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural) is considered the method of choice for anesthesia
      obstetric deliveries because of the ability to use fewer drugs, a more direct experience of
      childbirth and the capability to provide excellent postoperative analgesia. However, the
      incidence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery is high and can lead
      to maternal and fetal morbidities. Certain interventions may reduce the incidence and
      severity of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension, including the use of vasopressors and
      intravenous pre- or co-hydration using different types of volume expanders; crystalloid or
      colloid solutions. Such interventions aim to increase maternal cardiac output, which is the
      key in attenuating the hypotensive response to spinal anesthesia.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of intravenous prehydration
      (preloading) of healthy parturients scheduled for caesarean section with either a crystalloid
      (Ringer's lactated) or colloid solution (HES 130/0.42) in the prevention of hypotension after
      spinal anesthesia.

      The FloTrac/VigileoTM device provides continuous monitoring of maternal cardiac output by
      employment of a minimally invasive technique based on arterial pulse contour analysis.
      Assessment of maternal hemodynamic status using the FloTrac/VigileoTM constitutes a secondary
      outcome. Other secondary outcomes are total amount of vasopressors used, neonatal outcome,
      intraoperative side effects and maternal satisfaction scores.
