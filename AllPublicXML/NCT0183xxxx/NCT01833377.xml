  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the applicability of caraway (black cumin) intake on the
      treatment of obesity. So, a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted to
      examine the applicability of caraway product in terms of safety and efficacy.

    <textblock>
      A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, was done on 120 healthy overweight and obese
      women aged 20-55 in Iran. data were collected trough questionaires, interview and physical
      examination. the required parameters including anthropometric indices, body composition vital
      parameters (heart rate and blood pressure)and full blood parameters, were measured before and
      after intervention. volunteers were randomized into test and control group and were asked to
      consume either caraway samples or placebo during 12 intervention weeks.

      the outcome measure will be assessed for both primary and secondary data from baseline
      through week 12 (3 months).
