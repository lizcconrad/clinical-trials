  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of atazanavir
      in a fixed-dose combination with cobicistat with that of atazanavir coadministered with
      cobicistat as single agents.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Died and With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>

    <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant who receives an investigational product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; is life-threatening; or requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant who receives an investigational product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; is life-threatening; or requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.</description>
