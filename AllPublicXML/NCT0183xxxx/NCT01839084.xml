  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to determine whether Xenon - as compared to Isoflurane - shows a
      nephroprotection after partial nephrectomy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A partial nephrectomy is accompanied by ischemia time, followed by reperfusion. This
      frequently leads to a kidney injury of the remained tissue and decrease of the renal function
      after surgery. As it was shown that Xenon has protective properties against
      ischemia/reperfusion injury, the investigators hypothesize that Xenon application during
      partial nephrectomy leads to a stronger nephroprotection than an anesthesia with Isoflurane.

      The study will be conducted by two investigator types: The study enrollment and the
      post-anesthesia follow-up will be performed by Investigator I who is blinded to the study
      treatment. Investigator II will only perform general anesthesia for partial nephrectomy and
      will therefore necessarily be unblinded to the treatment conditions.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following study groups. Group 1 (Xenon) will
      receive Xenon for maintenance of balanced anesthesia for partial nephrectomy. Group 2
      (Isoflurane) will receive Isoflurane for the same surgery.
