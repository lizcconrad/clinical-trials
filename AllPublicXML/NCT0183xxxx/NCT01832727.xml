      The primary objectives are as follows:

      Phase 1b:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oprozomib given orally, once daily, on
           2 different schedules.

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability

      Phase 2:

        -  To estimate the overall response rate (ORR).

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability

          -  Patients requiring therapy who have relapsed and/or are refractory to their last
             therapy and have been treated with at least 1, but not more than 5 lines of multiple
             myeloma therapy.

          -  Prior carfizolmib is not required but is allowed if a patient had at least 2 cycles of
             carfilzomib alone or in combination with a dose of at least 20/27 mg/m2, as long as

               2. Was not removed from carfilzomib therapy due to toxicity, unless approved by the
                  medical monitor

               3. Was not removed from carfilzomib therapy for progressive disease nor experienced
