  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) report falling over a 6-month period and a
      majority of those who fall require medical attention for injuries. Importantly, balance
      dysfunction, muscle weakness, and spasticity are modifiable risk factors for falls among
      community-dwelling older adults and likely persons with MS. Indeed, there is evidence that
      these physiological risk factors can be minimized with exercise training in persons with MS
      and this might translate into a decrease in fall risk as documented in community-dwelling
      older adults.

      The investigation will examine the effectiveness of a home-based exercise program that is
      designed to reduce fall risk by targeting specific fall risk factors including balance
      dysfunction and two of its latent causes, muscle weakness and spasticity in persons with
      multiple sclerosis. It is predicted that persons who receive home-based exercise program will
      have a reduction in fall risk.

      Over half of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) report falling over a 6-month period and
      half of those who fall require medical attention for injuries. To make matters worse, a fall
      can result in activity curtailment, physiological deconditioning, and institutionalization.
      Importantly, balance dysfunction, muscle weakness, and spasticity are modifiable risk factors
      for falls among community-dwelling older adults and likely persons with MS. Indeed, there is
      evidence that these physiological risk factors can be minimized with exercise training in
      persons with MS and this might translate into a decrease in fall risk as documented in
      community-dwelling older adults. To that end, an appropriately designed exercise training
      program that targets specific, modifiable risk factors might be effective for decreasing the
      fall risk in persons with MS.

      The investigation will examine the effectiveness of a home-based exercise program that is
      designed to reduce fall risk by targeting specific fall risk factors including balance
      dysfunction and two of its latent causes, muscle weakness and spasticity in persons with
      multiple sclerosis. It is predicted that persons who receive home-based exercise program will
      have a reduction in fall risk.

      Participants will undergo multidimensional assessment of walking, balance, muscle strength,
      spasticity and fall risk prior to and immediately following the 12 week intervention.
      Following baseline assessment participants will be randomized into intervention or control
      groups. The intervention group will receive exercise instruction 4 times over 2 months. The
      home-based exercise protocol will focus on improving balance, walking, lower limb and core
      muscle strength, and spasticity, all potential determinants of falling.

    <description>The home-based exercise group attends 4 exercise instructional sessions lead by a train exercise specialist. The exercise protocol focuses on improving balance, walking, lower limb and core muscle strength, and spasticity. The instructional session teaches participants a standardized series of exercises that focus on balance, muscle strength, and stretching. The exercises target lower limb &amp; core muscle function. Once taught, participants will perform the exercises 3 times a week in their home as outlined in a manual. Subjects return in the first month and second month to ensure that exercises are being executed with correct form and appropriate intensity level. Compliance of at-home exercise will be assessed with diaries that participants complete every other week.</description>
