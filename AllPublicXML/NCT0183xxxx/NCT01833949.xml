  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our study was to compare the efficiency of the right ULOD using thermal
      doses adjusted to ovarian volume (60 J/cm3) with the BLOD method at constant dose and to
      assess treatment efficiency.

      The study included 96 infertile, clomiphene citrate-resistant women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS), who underwent either unilateral or bilateral laparoscopic diathermy at the
      Clinical Hospital Split, Croatia. PCOS was diagnosed following the Rotterdam consensus
      criteria. In the ULOD group, we treated the right ovary with thermal dose of 60 J applied per
      one cubic centimeter of ovarian. In the comparator, BLOD group, all patients received 600 J
      per ovary. The follow-up period encompassed six menstrual cycles for all subjects.Sample size
      was based on the test of the primary hypothesis that ULOD treatment would result in a higher
      ovulation rate than BLOD. In our pilot study in 61 patients, ovulation rates were estimated
      to 44% in the BLOD arm and 69% in the ULOD arm. Assuming 5% significance and 80% power, we
      calculated that the minimal sample size for a one-sided test had to be 96 patients.

      The aims of our prospective study:

        1. Compare the efficiency of the right ULOD using thermal doses adjusted to ovarian volume
           (60 J/cm3) with the BLOD method at constant dose and to assess treatment efficiency and
           predict ovulatory response based on clinical parameters (right or left ovary and its
           volume) and received thermal doses.

        2. Evidence the effects of ULOD using thermal doses adjusted to ovarian volume on endocrine
           (changes in androgen and AMH) and reproductive outcomes (ovulation rate) in
           clomiphene-resistant women with PCOS.

        3. To determine whether unilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling (ULOD) using thermal doses
           adjusted to ovarian volume diminishes ovarian reserve less than bilateral LOD (BLOD)
           using a fixed thermal dose

    <description>The secondary outcome measures were: correlations and differences in values (and changes) measured markers (unilateral / bilateral or ovulation / anovulation). Markers that are considered: AMH [ng / ml], follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) [IU / L], the number of follicles in both ovaries, total ovarian volume [cm3], the volume of the right ovary [cm3], the volume of the left ovary [cm3], FAI, T [nmol / L], LH [IU / L], A [nmol / L], sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) [nmol / L], dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DEHASO4), [mmol / L],prolactin (PRL), BMI [kg/m2] and years.</description>

    <description>Unilateral laparoscopic drilling
In the ULOD group, we treated the right ovary.The thermal dose of 60 J applied per one cubic centimeter of ovarian volume was calculated from the mean total energy applied on a 10 cm3 ovary (627 J) from three earlier ULOD reports. Ovarian volume had been measured by ultrasound at baseline to determine the total thermal dose to apply on the right ovary. The number of punctures (Np) was also calculated for each patient according to the following formula:
Np = 627 J / 30 W / 4 s Therefore, patients in the ULOD group differed in the number of punctures and energy received by the right ovary, depending on its volume.</description>

    <description>Bilateral laparoscopic drilling
In the comparator, BLOD group, all patients received 600 J per ovary (totaling 1200 J) through five punctures at 30 W for 4 s each (5 punctures x 4 s x 30 W = 600 J).
The ovaries in both groups were cooled after the drilling by irrigating the abdominal cavity with 200-300 mL of physiological saline.</description>
