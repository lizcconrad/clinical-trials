    <textblock>
      The absence of methodologically, prospectively and retrospectively collected information on
      the use of the Quadrilateral Surface Plate (QSP) in the given indication requires a
      multicenter approach. Using a registry to get more information about the effectiveness and
      possible benefits or complications during the surgery and during the post-operative treatment
      is adequate and necessary to get new insights to the use of the Quadrilateral Surface Plate.

      This registry includes six visits at which data is collected form the patinet (pre-op,
      post-op, 6 weeks FU, 3 months FU, 6 months FU and 12 months FU). Patients can be inlucded
      prospectively or retrospectively. If properatively recruited patients complete two
      questionnaires (EQ5D and Merle d'Aubigné) at their preoperative visits. These questionnaires
      are repeated after 6 and 12 months. Surgeons report about the success of the surgical
      procedure in a specifically designed questionnaire.

      During the whole study period, adverse events related to the implant or surgery are collected
      as well as x-rays and CT (as per standard of care).

        The increasing number of acetabular fractures in elderly individuals with osteoporosis has
        added new technical challenges to surgical management. A common group of fracture patterns
        in this population is the anterior wall or column often with an associated posterior
        hemitransverse.

        These injuries frequently also include quadrilateral surface comminution which can make
        both reduction and stabilization more difficult. The 3.5 mm quadrilateral surface plate was
        developed to provide a more effective way to deal with these issues, for example, a way to
        deal with the quadrilateral surface enbloc for reduction, allowing buttress stabilization,
        which is independent of bone density.
