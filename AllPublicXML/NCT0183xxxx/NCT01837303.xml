      Purpose: To assess equivalence between low cost manual liquid based cytology (pap smear) and
      standard Thin prep cytology screening.

      Participants: 100-120 healthy women presenting for standard pap smear screening

      Procedures (methods): After routine care pap smear, another pap smear will be performed and
      placed in the study medium. Clinical care pap and study pap will be reviewed by a single
      pathologist to assess for equivalent findings.

      Hypothesis: Manual liquid based cytology is equivalent to conventional liquid based cytology.

      instructions and then clinical care pap and study pap will be reviewed by a single
      pathologist to assess for equivalent findings.

    <description>A pap smear/cervical cytology is performed using a spatula and brush to obtain cells from the ectocervical and endocervical region of the cervix. The specimen will be collected twice to put in the standard clinical pap medium and another to put in the study pap medium.
These slides will be processed so that they may be reviewed by a single board certified pathologist.
There are no other interventions or follow up. All participants will undergo the above described procedures. There is no placebo.</description>
