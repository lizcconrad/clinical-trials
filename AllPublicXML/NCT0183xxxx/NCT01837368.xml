      Validation of PRISM (Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure) as a assessment of
      quality of life and suffering in patients with tinnitus.

      Association between experiencing, verbalizing and regulating emotions and perceived tinnitus.

      Correlation analysis are used to search for connections between the subjective behavioral
      outcomes mentioned above and the objective EEG-patterns.

      Validation of PRISM (Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure). Assessment of
      quality of life and suffering in patients with tinnitus in an observational study using
      different questionnaires. (THI, TF, TBF-12, BDI, BAI, SF-36).

      THI - Tinnitus Handicap Inventory

      TF - Tinnitus Questionnaire after Goebel and Hiller

      TBF-12 - Tinnitus Impairment Questionnaire

      BDI - Beck Depression Inventory

      BAI - Beck Anxiety Inventory

      SF-36 - Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire

      Association between experiencing, verbalizing and regulating emotions and perceived tinnitus
      using the TAS-20 (20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and the above mentioned questionnaires.

      EEG-studies on the spontaneous brain activity of individuals affected by tinnitus
      consistently report differences in the composition of the EEG-frequency spectrum between
      individuals with tinnitus and healthy controls. Furthermore it has been shown that not only
      the auditory cortex but other regions of the brain are involved in the perception of the
      chronic ear noise as well. Among them is the limbic system which is associated with the
      emotional processing of the human brain.

      Correlation analysis are used to search for connections between the subjective behavioral
      outcomes mentioned above and the objective EEG-patterns. Aim of the current study is to
      provide conclusive models of associated assessments of the psychological strain end emotional
      stress of individuals suffering from tinnitus and objective EEG-analysis.
