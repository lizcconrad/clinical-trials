  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An early and efficient enteral nutritional support could improve the clinical outcomes of
      brain injured critically ill patients. Gastrointestinal feeding intolerance defined as an
      increased gastric residual volume frequently occurs in these patients.

      Previous experimental studies have suggested that a small-peptide enteral feeding formula
      could promote the gastric emptying compared to a whole-protein formula. An improved
      gastrointestinal tolerance of enteral nutrition should allow a rapid increase in the daily
      caloric intake and enhance nutritional support of brain injured critically ill patients.

      This open-labelled prospective randomized trial aims to compare 2 groups of patients: the
      Study Group and the Control Group. The randomization process will concern the allocation of
      the type of enteral feeding formula administered for nutritional support: Peptamen® AF in the
      Study Group, and Sondalis® HP in the Control Group. 2 centers are involved in this study.

      Each patient admitted in the critical care unit will be assessed for eligibility. After
      written informed consent is obtained from relatives, patient without any exclusion criteria
      will be included in the study.

      The allocation of the type of enteral nutritional feeding formula will be randomized after
      inclusion.

      Enteral nutrition according to the randomization group will start within the 48 hours of
      admission and up to 10 days, if requested. Beyond the 10th day, all patients will receive
      standard enteral nutrition formula.

      After inclusion, data regarding efficacy and tolerance will be assessed daily up to day 10.

      Mortality and outcome will be assessed at day 28 and at day 60.
