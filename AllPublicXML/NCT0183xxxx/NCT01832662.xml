  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages. It contains polyphenols (chlorogenic
      acids) and bioavailability of these bioactive compounds is now somewhat well understood. In
      addition, chlorogenic acids are known to be antioxidants in the cup, but reliable evidence
      remains to be observed in vivo. The objective of this trial is to understand if regular (10d)
      coffee intake may be beneficial on biomarkers of oxidative damage measured in urine and
      plasma. A secondary objective is to understand if polyphenols isolated from coffee may be as
      beneficial as the whole beverage in reducing oxidative stress compared to placebo

      This is an interventional study with a crossover randomized placebo-controlled double-blind
      design to assess the effect of regular consumption of coffee on oxidative stress compared to
      placebo.
