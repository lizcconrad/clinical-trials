      Background: Acute heart failure is a common disease associated with high morbidity and
      mortality. Unfortunately, pathophysiology and optimal initial treatment are both ill defined.

      Working Hypothesis:

        -  Improved understanding of the pathophysiology underlying heart failure might allow more
           cause-specific treatment to this syndrome.

        -  More rapid diagnosis of acute heart failure may allow to more rapidly initiate the
           appropriate treatment.

        -  Cardiac dysfunction especially in comorbid dyspneic patients is not adequately
           characterized and the spectrum of acute heart failure is more diverse than originally
           thought.

      Methods: This is a large multicenter center, observational study enrolling unselected,
      consecutive patients with acute dyspnea presenting to the Emergency Department. Patient
      history, physical examination and laboratory parameters will be systematically obtained.
      Echocardiographic examinations will be routinely performed. Follow-up will be done at
      specified intervals (3, 6 and 12 months) after the initial presentation and risk predictors
      will be analyzed in multivariable regression models.

      Expected Value of the Proposed Project: The data obtained during this project will help to
      further improve diagnostics and prognostics in patients with acute dyspnea and to better
      understand underlying pathology of cardiac dysfunction in this cohort.

      Significance: The study aims are up-to-date and deal with an important health care problem in
      society. Conclusions drawn will significantly change care of patients with acute heart
      failure probably leading to a significant reduction of rehospitalization, morbidity and
      mortality.
