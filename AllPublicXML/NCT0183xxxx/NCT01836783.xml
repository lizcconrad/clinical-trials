      The study will compare the density and strength of regenerated bone in extraction sockets
      after being grafted with two different materials: Bone Allograft and Bone Allograft with
      Amnion.

      The investigators hypothesize that sockets grafted with the Amnion graft will exhibit
      enhanced healing patterns and will accelerate the formation of regenerated bone in the
      grafted areas.

    <textblock>
      The amniotic allograft is a cryopreserved allograft tissue matrix derived from human
      placental tissues recovered from live healthy donors. Amniotic tissue is an abundant source
      of collagen which provides an extracellular matrix to act as a natural scaffold for cellular
      attachment in the body; collagen provides a structural tissue matrix that facilitates
      cellular migration and proliferation in-vivo. The product is developed using proprietory
      techniques by BioDlogics, LLC. The amniotic allograft growth factors are thought to enhance
      formation of a supportive scaffold for regeneration, to facilitate interactions between cell
      types, and to influence anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and immuno-privilege activities.

      Atraumatic extractions and socket grafts will be performed. Dental implants will be inserted
      into the grafted areas 8 weeks post-graft. The implants will be restored and followed for 24
      months post-insertion.
