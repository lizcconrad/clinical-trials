  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the differences in quitting smoking between African
      Americans (AA) and White smokers treated with varenicline.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While many studies have evaluated the use of drugs for quitting smoking among Whites, few
      have assessed efficacy with AAs. Racial/ethical differences in smoking are well documented.
      AAs smoke less than White smokers but experience disproportionately greater smoking disease
      and death.

      Past studies by the researchers in this study looked at how effective other smoking cessation
      methods are in AAs. These methods included nicotine gum, nicotine patch and buproprion SR.
      This study will be evaluating varenicline in both AA and White smokers. There has not been a
      study conducted yet to prospectively research AA-White differences in smoking cessation and
      also to examine potential causal pathways explaining AA-White differences in quitting.
