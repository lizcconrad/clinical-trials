    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if walnut oral immunotherapy can be used in
      subjects allergic to tree nuts to decrease their tree nut allergy and induce changes in their
      immune system.

    <description>The determination of the effectiveness of WOIT in inducing clinical desensitization to a second tree nut to which the subject is allergic when compared to placebo. This will be measured by the change in the amount of tree nut the subject can consume during their food challenge at 38 weeks compared to their consumption during the baseline challenge at study entry.</description>

    <time_frame>38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects who can consume all of the 5000mg of walnut protein without symptoms during the food challenge after the desensitization phase of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of subjects who are able to reach a cumulative protein dose of 2000mg at the desensitization oral food challenge to walnut and the test tree nut.</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 6 to 45 years, either sex, any race, any ethnicity with a convincing clinical
             history of walnut or another tree nut allergy and either a positive prick skin test (&gt;
             3mm) or serologic evidence of allergic sensitization (defined as specific IgE &gt; 0.35
             kU/L) to walnut and at least one other tree nut.

          -  A positive 2000 mg oral food challenge at enrollment to walnut and to one other tree
             nut.

          -  Written informed consent from participant and/or parent/guardian

          -  Written assent from all subjects as appropriate

          -  All females of child bearing age must be using appropriate birth control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe anaphylaxis to walnut or other tree nuts, defined as symptoms
             associated with hypoxia, hypotension or neurologic compromise (cyanosis or SpO2 &lt; 92%
             at any stage, hypotension, confusion, collapse, loss of consciousness; or
             incontinence).

          -  Known allergy to oat

          -  Chronic disease (other than asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis) requiring therapy or
             other respiratory or medical conditions deemed by the investigator to put the subject
             at increased risk of anaphylaxis or poor outcomes from receiving OIT or undergoing
             food challenge.

          -  Poor control or persistent activation of atopic dermatitis

          -  Active eosinophilic or other inflammatory (e.g., celiac) gastrointestinal disease in
             the past 2 years.

          -  Participation in any interventional study for food allergy in the past 6 months

          -  Participant is on &quot;build-up phase&quot; of immunotherapy (i.e., has not reached maintenance
             dosing).

          -  Severe asthma (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 5 or 6, see Appendix 2) or poorly controlled
             mild or moderate asthma

          -  Inability to discontinue antihistamines for initial day escalation, skin testing or
             OFC

          -  Use of omalizumab or other non-traditional forms of allergen immunotherapy (e.g., oral
             or sublingual) or immunomodulator therapy (not including corticosteroids) or biologic
             therapy within the past year

          -  Use of beta-blockers (oral), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
             angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) or calcium channel blockers

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
