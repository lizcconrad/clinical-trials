  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide safety and efficacy data comparable to available over-the-counter
      bowel preparations prior to colonoscopy. While there are many bowel preparations available,
      most of them remain expensive and require prescription from a health provider. The
      investigators believe EZ2go Complete will provide a non-inferior colon cleansing in a more
      accessible way (over-the-counter).

      To accomplish this goal, the investigators decided to evaluate the proposed EZ2go combination
      versus currently available over-the-counter bowel preparations. The investigators believe the
      EZ2go kit will not be inferior to current FDA approved over-the-counter bowel preparations.
