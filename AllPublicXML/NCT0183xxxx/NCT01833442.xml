      The trial objective is to compare two very different meditation protocols (Kundalini Yoga and
      Relaxation Response meditation techniques) to help the OCD treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial comparing the two different meditation protocols is expected to have two
      phases: 0-month to 4.5-month period where we compare the Kundalini Yoga protocol with
      Relaxation Response meditation technique, both on the primary efficacy variable using the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and some if not most of the secondary
      variables using The Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS), Clinical
      Global Impressions (CGI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck-A),
      Beck Depression Inventory (Beck-D), and SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF36).
      Participants will go to the hospital once a week for a 1,5 hour meditation class.After
      4.5-months, all patients will be evaluated and merged together into a single group. Patients
      will then receive 09 to 12 more months of the meditation protocol. The investigators are
      expecting to recruit 50 to 60 patients to start. Patients will be blinded to the content of
      the protocol in the other group at baseline and until one group shows greater efficacy on the
      primary efficacy variable. The intake physician will be blinded to the treatment groups of
      the patients.
