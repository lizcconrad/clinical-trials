      The purpose of this study is to improve the current standard of care of repairing mouth soft
      tissue defects.

      This study will test a tissue equivalent ex vivo produced oral mucosa equivalent(EVPOME),
      which is a subject's own cells grown on top of a piece of AlloDerm (a commercially available
      freeze dried human cadaver tissue that is routinely used in present day surgical
      reconstructive procedures) to create a new piece of soft tissue for use only in that
      subject's body. The tissue equivalent product will be tested against a non-experimental
      method of grafts, the gold standard a piece of palatal oral mucosa (POM) to see which works
      best. Each subject will be randomly assigned to receive either the EVPOME or POM to cover the
      defect in their mouth. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy for
      the use of human EVPOME for soft tissue intraoral grafting procedures compared to the &quot;gold
      standard&quot; palatal oral mucosa (POM) graft.

             significant (as described by investigators) renal, hepatic, cardiac, endocrine,
             hematologic, autoimmune, or any systemic disease which may complication execution of
             the protocol and/or interpretation of results

          -  Current radiation therapy or history of radiation therapy treatment to the intraoral
             donor biopsy site or recipient site for graft placement
