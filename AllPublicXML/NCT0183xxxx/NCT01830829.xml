      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) describes a common medical condition in men over 45
      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction. The standard medical therapy
      for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or alpha
      blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is the
      combination of these two medications. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed with BPH
      also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain
      syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort. This particular subset of
      patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic dilemma. CP/CPPS (organ
      specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after prostate cancer and
      BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) and represents a significant percentage of
      urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits)resulting in a major impact on quality of
      life of patients and economic costs to society. Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of
      the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower
      Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated
      that up to 30% of men currently diagnosed with CP/CPPS will include men with co-existing
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) We propose to determine the efficacy of JALYN
      (dutasteride-tamsulosin combination) in the amelioration of prostatitis symptoms in men
      diagnosed with CP/CPPS who have the following clinical phenotype; age = 45 years, Lower
      Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS), enlarged prostate and Organ (prostate) specific symptoms (eg.
      BPH and CP/CPPS).

      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) describes a common medical condition in men over 45
      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction [1]. The standard medical
      therapy for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or
      alpha blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is
      the combination of these two medications [2]. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed
      with BPH also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort [3,4,5]. This
      particular subset of patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic
      dilemma [6].

      CP/CPPS (organ specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after
      prostate cancer and BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) [7,8] and represents a
      significant percentage of urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits) [9,10]
      resulting in a major impact on quality of life of patients [11] and economic costs to society
      [12].

      There are no good evidence based therapies for CP/CPPS [13,14], although there is some
      evidence available to consider 5 alpha reductase inhibitor and alpha blocker therapies [22].
      There is an enormous unmet need to evaluate potential therapies for this condition.

      Our current understanding of CP/CPPS patients are that they are a heterogeneous group of
      unique patients (the &quot;snow flake&quot; hypothesis) presenting with different clinical phenotypes
      [15]. We have proposed [16,17], validated [18] and recently proved that clinical phenotyping
      (using our UPOINT classification system) is possible and provides more effective treatment
      strategies [19].

      There are studies that suggest that the same medical therapy that has proven effective for
      the treatment of BPH would also be beneficial for prostatitis like symptoms as well. A number
      of small pilot studies with finasteride [20], including a contemporary 6 month RCT [21], have
      strongly suggested that 5 ARI therapy may be effective in patients with CP/CPPS, but these
      studies were limited by study design including inclusion of all patients with the diagnosis
      of CP/CPPS (ages and clinical phenotypes that we now know could not possibly benefit from a
      5ARI). REDUCE and many other epidemiology studies, have documented that men over 45 years old
      suffer from prostatitis and prostatitis symptoms [23]. REDUCE also clearly shows that
      dutasteride favorably impacts on prostatitis-like symptoms and men with prostatitis-like
      syndrome enrolled in that study [24]. In fact, the potential benefits suggested by
      extrapolating REDUCE results far outweigh any other intervention we have evaluated in any of
      the large North American NIH sponsored RCTs in the last decade [25,26,27]. A further
      sub-analyses of REDUCE shows that men with IPSS â‰¥ 8 and enlarged prostates (eg BPH) have a
      significant symptom benefit with dutasteride, irregardless of prostate size [28].These
      initial findings in REDUCE in patients not specifically diagnosed with CP/CPPS should be
      expanded to examine the benefits in a CP/CPPS population.

      There are more clinical trials evaluating alpha blockers than any other therapy in CP/CPPS
      [22, 29]. While two North American RCTs [25,26] did not show benefit, 6 other alpha blocker
      randomized placebo controlled trials using validated contemporary outcomes were positive in
      terms of measureable benefits [30-35]. The latest clinical trial confirming the benefits of
      alpha blocker therapy in selected CP/CPPS patients (approximately 50 patients per arm in 12
      week study) was recently published [35] and showed benefit, primarily in the LUTS symptom
      domain.

      Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to
      respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate
      related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated that up to 30% of men currently diagnosed with
      CP/CPPS will include men with co-existing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
