      This phase II trial studies how well arsenic trioxide works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic
      trioxide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the complete remission rate of relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients with Mutated Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) gene.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of remission in these patients. II. Determine the in vivo
      biological effect of arsenic trioxide in AML with mutated NPM1.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours daily for up to 45 days.
      Patients achieving complete remission, receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours daily 5
      days a week for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
