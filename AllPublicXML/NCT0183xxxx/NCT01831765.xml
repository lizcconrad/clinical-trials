  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the
      trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) compared
      to insulin aspart, both in combination with insulin detemir in adults with type 1 diabetes.
      This trial consists of two periods: a 26 week treatment period followed by a 26 week
      additional treatment period.

    <description>Observed rate of treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic events per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE) from baseline until week 26. A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode was on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 1 day after the last day of randomised treatment. Severe or BG confirmed is an episode that is severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification (an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions) or BG confirmed by a PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <description>All treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from baseline until 52 weeks of randomised treatment.

      <recruitment_details>Out of 281 sites, selected for recruitment, 165 sites in 9 countries enrolled subjects in the run-in period, of which 163 sites later assigned subjects to randomised treatment: Belgium:5 sites, Canada:12 sites, Czech Republic:5 sitesÍ¾ Finland:6 sitesÍ¾ Germany:25 sitesÍ¾ Hungary:5 sitesÍ¾ Poland:6 sitesÍ¾ United Kingdom:9 sitesÍ¾ United States:92 sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible subjects received once/twice daily insulin detemir and NovoRapidÂ®/NovoLogÂ® during 8 week run-in period. In total, 1290 subjects entered the run-in period, of those147 subjects were run-in failures. Hence 1143 subjects entered the 26-week treatment period followed by a 26 week additional treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Faster Aspart (Meal)</title>
          <description>The subjects in this arm were administered mealtime faster aspart (100 U/mL) in combination with once or twice daily insulin detemir (100 U/mL) in a basalâbolus regimen for an initial 26 weeks treatment period + a 26-week additional treatment period. Mealtime faster aspart was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) 0â2 minutes before each main meal. Subjects who, prior to screening, had used the principles of flexible dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content, and who were assessed by the investigator to be adequately trained in this method, were to continue using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period. All other subjects were to use a predefined bolus dosing algorithm to adjust the bolus dose during the treatment period. Additional bolus dosing was allowed at the investigatorâs recommendation.</description>

Postmeal faster aspart was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) 20 minutes after the start of the meal. Subjects who, prior to screening, had used the principles of flexible dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content, and who were assessed by the investigator to be adequately trained in this method, were to continue using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period.

          <description>The subjects in this arm were administered mealtime faster aspart (100 U/mL) in combination with once or twice daily insulin detemir (100 U/mL) in a basalâbolus regimen for an initial 26 weeks treatment period + a 26-week additional treatment period. Mealtime faster aspart was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) 0â2 minutes before each main meal. Subjects who, prior to screening, had used the principles of flexible dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content, and who were assessed by the investigator to be adequately trained in this method, were to continue using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period. All other subjects were to use a predefined bolus dosing algorithm to adjust the bolus dose during the treatment period.

      <time_frame>Until 52 weeks (26+26) weeks of treatment + 7 days followup for faster aspart (meal) and NovoRapidÂ®(meal) or until 26 weeks of treatment + 7 days followup for faster aspart (post) + 30 day follow-up period for cardio-vascular related events.</time_frame>
      <desc>The safety analysis set included all subjects receiving at least one dose of trial product/ its comparator and contributed to the evaluation âas treatedâ. A TEAE was defined as an event recorded from the first day of exposure to trial product and no later than post-treatment follow-up visit (7 days). Five (5) subjects randomised to the faster aspart (post) group have consistently taken their bolus insulin before meals throughout the trial and are handled as treated with faster aspart (meal).</desc>

          <title>Faster Aspart (Meal)</title>
          <description>The subjects in this arm were administered mealtime faster aspart (100 U/mL) in combination with once or twice daily insulin detemir (100 U/mL) in a basalâbolus regimen for an initial 26 weeks treatment period + a 26-week additional treatment period. Mealtime faster aspart was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) 0â2 minutes before each main meal. Subjects who, prior to screening, had used the principles of flexible dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content, and who were assessed by the investigator to be adequately trained in this method, were to continue using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period. All other subjects were to use a predefined bolus dosing algorithm to adjust the bolus dose during the treatment period. Additional bolus dosing was allowed at the investigatorâs recommendation.</description>

          <title>Faster Aspart (Post)</title>
          <description>The subjects in this arm were administered postmeal faster aspart (100 U/mL) in combination with once or twice daily insulin detemir (100 U/mL) in a basalâbolus regimen for an initial 26 weeks treatment period. Postmeal faster aspart was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) 20 minutes after the start of the meal. Subjects who, prior to screening, had used the principles of flexible dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content, and who were assessed by the investigator to be adequately trained in this method, were to continue using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period. All other subjects were to use a predefined bolus dosing algorithm to adjust the bolus dose during the treatment period.

          <description>The subjects in this arm were administered mealtime NovoRapidÂ®/NovoLogÂ®, 100 U/mL in combination with once or twice daily insulin detemir (100 U/mL) in a basal-bolus regimen for an initial 26 weeks treatment period + a 26-week additional treatment period. Mealtime NovoRapidÂ®/NovoLogÂ® was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) 0â2 minutes before each main meal. Subjects who, prior to screening, had used the principles of flexible dosing based on the meal carbohydrate content, and who were assessed by the investigator to be adequately trained in this method, were to continue using this method for bolus adjustment during the treatment period.
