  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims at investigating the duration of human fecal carriage of bacteria harboring
      plasmid-borne resistance genes expressing Extended Spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), risk
      factors for infections with such bacteria and persistence, mobility and spread of ESBL in the
      environment and within households. It also aims to compare different methods of detecting
      ESBL carriage and treat patients with urinary tract infection caused by these bacteria.

    <description>Patients included in the study with urinary tract infection (UTI) and treated as part of normal routine were followed for 14 days and further prescriptions of antimicrobials normally used for treatment of UTI will be considered treatment failures. Only participants that received pivmecillinam are reported here. In the paper published in PlosOne &quot;High Rate of Per Oral Mecillinam Treatment Failure in Community-Acquired Urinary Tract Infections Caused by ESBL-Producing Escherichia coli&quot; the mecillinam treatment group were compared with the group that did not receive mecillinam.</description>
