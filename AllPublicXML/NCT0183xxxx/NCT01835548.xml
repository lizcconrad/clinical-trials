  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 3 trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of NT0102 in the treatment of Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age in a laboratory
      classroom study.

    <measure>Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 8 (Day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was derived from the SKAMP-Combined score calculated as the total score of all 13 items of the SKAMP-Combined score. The SKAMP-Combined score was obtained by summing up each item score where each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal to 6=maximal impairment) for a total possible score of 0 to 78. A lower score indicates less symptomatology (i.e., is better). The SKAMP was a rating scale that specifically measures the classroom manifestations of ADHD. The SKAMP ratings were completed for all subjects at baseline (pre-dose) and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 13 hours post-dose on the classroom testing day (Visit 8). The primary analysis time point for the primary efficacy endpoint was the average of all post-dose SKAMP scores during the 13-hour period.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 8 (Day 42) at 1 hour (h), 3 h, 5 h, 7 h, 10 h, 12 h and 13 h</time_frame>
    <description>Onset of effect was defined as the first time point at which NT0102 separates from placebo on SKAMP-Combined scores. A separation was defined as a statistically significant difference at the 5% level of active drug over placebo. Data was collected separately for NT0102 and Placebo arms and is reported as a comparison analysis of the two arms. This assessment was collected on the full classroom day, Visit 8.</description>

    <measure>The Average of the SKAMP-Attention Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 8 (Day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP Rating Scale was comprised of 2 behavioral subscales, including the &quot;Attention&quot; subscale (4 items). The SKAMP-Attention subscore evaluates concentration in the classroom and is obtained by summing up each item score where each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal to 6=maximal impairment) for total possible combined score of 0 to 24. A lower score indicates less symptomatology (i.e. is better). The SKAMP-Attention subscores were derived from 20 minutes of direct observations of participant behavior. Ratings were based on the frequency and quality of behaviors.</description>

    <description>The PERMP consisted of 400 math problems and was graded as number of problems &quot;Attempted&quot; (PERMP-A) and number of problems &quot;Correct.&quot; (PERMP-C). It was an objective measure of performance during the classroom testing day.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 9 (Day 43)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Score</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was derived from the SKAMP-Combined score calculated as the total score of all 13 items of the SKAMP-Combined score. The SKAMP-Combined score was obtained by summing up each item score where each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal to 6=maximal impairment) for a total possible score of 0 to 78. A lower score indicates less symptomatology (i.e., is better). The SKAMP was a rating scale that specifically measures the classroom manifestations of ADHD. The SKAMP ratings were completed for all subjects at baseline (pre-dose) and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 13 hours post-dose on the classroom testing day (Visit 8). The primary analysis time point for the primary efficacy endpoint was the average of all post-dose SKAMP scores during the 13-hour period.</description>

The SKAMP-Attention subscore evaluates concentration in the classroom and is obtained by summing up each item score where each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal to 6=maximal impairment) for total possible combined score of 0 to 24. A lower score indicates less symptomatology (i.e. is better). The SKAMP-Attention subscores were derived from 20 minutes of direct observations of participant behavior.

        <title>The Average of the SKAMP-Deportment Scores</title>
        <description>The SKAMP Rating Scale is comprised of 2 behavioural subscales, including the “Deportment” subscale (4 items). The SKAMP-Deportment subscore evaluates behaviour in the classroom and is obtained by summing up each item score where each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal to 6=maximal impairment) for total possible combined score of 0 to 24. A lower score indicates less symptomatology (i.e. is better). The SKAMP-Attention subscores were derived from 20 minutes of direct observations of participant behaviour. Ratings were based on the frequency and quality of behaviours.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
