    <textblock>
      Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a common disorder whose pathophysiology is poorly
      understood. Some evidence suggests it may be related to sustained esophageal contractions
      (SECs) of longitudinal smooth muscle. The investigators have previously shown that acid is a
      trigger for SECs and results in shortening of the esophagus. In this study, the investigators
      plan to prospectively evaluate esophageal shortening responses to acid in a group of patients
      with NCCP compared to controls. The investigators will use high resolution esophageal
      manometry coupled with acid infusion to evaluate shortening. The investigators hypothesize
      that at least a subset of patients with NCCP will have an exaggerated esophageal shortening
      response to acid which correlates with symptom production. If our hypothesis proves true,
      this may lead to a future therapeutic target in the treatment of these patients.
