  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggests a role of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium
      (GIRK) channel in the pathology of excitement of nerve, and the medicine with the action
      (like the Tipepidine Hibenzate) is expected as a new curative medicine of Attention Deficit /
      Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD).

      The purpose of this research is to confirm the effect by carrying out the additional dosage
      of the Tipepidine Hibenzate to the AD/HD patients.

      If suggestion is obtained by this research about the effect on AD/HD of Tipepidine Hibenzate,
      it can contribute to development of the medical treatment of AD/HD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS) Japanese Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in ADHD-RS at 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD Rating Scale-IV obtains parent ratings regarding the frequency of each ADHD symptom based on DSM-IV criteria.
The ADHD Rating Scale-IV is completed independently by the parent and scored by a clinician. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition using DN-CAS (Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System) Japanese Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in the scores of battery at 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DN-CAS is an assessment battery designed to evaluate cognitive processing. It was developed to integrate theoretical and applied areas of psychological knowledge using cognitive processing theory and tests designed to measure—Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive Processing (PASS)—in individuals ages 5-17.
This assessment facilitates mental health professionals in the identification of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, learning disabilities, Mental Retardation, and giftedness.</description>
