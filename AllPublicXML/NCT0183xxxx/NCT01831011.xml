    <textblock>
      Mildronate an inhibitor of carnitine-dependent metabolism, is considered an anti-ischemic
      drug. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mildronate injection in treating
      acute ischemic stroke.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study was made on mildronate injection for
      treating acute cerebral infarction. 113 cases in the experimental group were given with
      mildronate injection, while 114 cases in the active-control group were given with cinepazide
      maleate injection. In addition, both groups were given aspirin as basic treatments. Modified
      Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 2 weeks and 3 months, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS) score and Barthel Index score at 2 weeks after treatment, vital signs and adverse
      events were evaluated.
