  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-market surveillance research project consists of data collection at specified time
      points using standard questionnaire instruments to compare pain level, mobility and function
      pre and post procedure using the D-Fine StabiliT® Vertebral Augmentation System and StabiliT®
      Bone Cement, an FDA approved product used in the standard treatment of vertebral compression
      fractures.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, post market surveillance pilot study of an FDA cleared product, to
      evaluate the procedural and clinical profile of an ultra high viscosity cement vertebral
      augmentation system for the treatment of vertebral compression vertebral fractures due to
      osteoporosis.

      Twenty (20) consenting evaluable adult male and female patients between the ages of 50 and 90
      who meet the inclusion criteria for the study and are treated using the D-Fine StabiliT®
      Vertebral Augmentation System and StabiliT® Bone Cement as part of their standard treatment
      for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures will be enrolled in the study.

      The participants will be followed after the procedure for 3 months by telephone and/or mailed
      questionnaire by an IRB certified member of the research team. Information collected will
      include the patient's ability to ambulate independently and activity level pre and
      post-treatment, decrease or increase in pain level compared to pre-treatment, and monitoring
      adverse events. Data will be collected at enrollment, procedure, discharge (or 1 day post
      procedure), 1 week, 1 month and 3 months post procedure using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      for pain score, Oswestry Disability Index. Standard of care radiographs and MRI or CT/bone
      scan are evaluated by a board certified radiologist. The data collected will be compared to
      measure outcomes.
