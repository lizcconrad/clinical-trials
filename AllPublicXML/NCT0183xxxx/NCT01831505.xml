  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer patients are prescribed drugs to which their cancer is already resistant - and
      thus suffer toxicity with no potential for benefit. Previous attempts to assess
      chemoresistance or sensitivity in vitro have failed. This is a feasibility study in human
      patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent lymphoma to determine how human cancerous lymph
      nodes in situ respond to standard of care therapeutics precisely microinjected with the
      CIVO(tm) microdosing system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or over

          -  Has enlarged lymph node(s) highly suspicious of lymphoma; or has been diagnosed with
             lymphoma but is untreated; or has persistent recurrent, or progressive lymphoma

          -  At least one enlarged lymph node that is considered accessible for percutaneous
             injection by the investigator and that is at least 2 cm in longest dimension.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (or a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;50%).

          -  Labs required for enrollment: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3, platelet count &gt;
             50,000/mm3, hematocrit &gt; 25%, creatinine &lt;3.0 mg/dl, total bilirubin &lt;4.0 mg/dl, SGOT
             and SGPT less than five times the institutional upper limits of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lymphoma patients in which the delay of surgery until the lymph node resection date or
             other factors associated with the study are not feasible.

          -  Patients with central nervous system disease.

          -  Any therapy that is potentially immunosuppressive or has anticancer activity in the 4
             weeks prior to device microinjection.

          -  Patients with active fungal, viral, or bacterial infections

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Inability to give informed consent.
