  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding is the most avoidable cause of death in trauma patients. Up to one-third of severely
      injured trauma patients are found to be coagulopathic and forty percent of the mortality
      following severe injury is due to uncontrollable hemorrhage in the setting of coagulopathy.
      It has been established that early administration of fresh frozen plasma decreases mortality
      following severe injury, replacing lost coagulation factors, improving the coagulopathy and
      restoring blood volume. This study will determine if giving plasma to severely injured trauma
      patients during ambulance transport versus after arrival to the hospital will help reduce
      hemorrhage, thus decreasing both total blood product administration and mortality.

      Study Design: Severely injured trauma patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 70 or
      SBP ≤ 90 with a heart rate ≥ 108 bpm at the scene will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      either 2 units of frozen plasma thawed in the field or normal saline (the current standard of
      care), as the initial resuscitation fluid. After this initial resuscitation fluid, both
      groups will receive the same standard of care, including packed red blood cells, additional
      normal saline, or plasma as needed based on laboratory and clinical evidence of coagulopathy.
      Blood samples and clinical information will be collected throughout the hospital stay up to
      28 days after injury.

    <description>If the patient is randomized to experimental arm, 2 units of frozen Type AB plasma (FP24) will be thawed in the Plasmatherm Dry Thawing and Warming Device according to the operator manual as approved by the FDA in the ambulance and infusion will commence as soon as the Type AB plasma is ready, and will continue during transport to the ED. After infusion of 2 units of Type AB plasma is completed, subsequent care will proceed per institutional, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guided resuscitation with acute packed red blood cells (pRBC) administration determined by hemodynamic response and additional blood component administration guided by rapid thrombelastography (rTEG) and coagulation panel assessment in conjunction with clinical scenario.</description>
