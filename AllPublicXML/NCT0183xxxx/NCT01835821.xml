      This clinical study has the objective to compare the longevity and the clinical behaviour
      (CDA Index, soft tissue behavior, success and survival rates) of single cemented ceramic
      crowns made with shaded zirconia (NobelProceraTM Shaded Zirconia) and NobelProceraTM full
      contour crowns IPS e.max CAD lithium disilicate on molars.

    <measure>success of Porcelain-fused and IPS e.Max CAD Crowns</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A &quot;successful crown&quot; is when the CDA index (Marginal integrity, Color match, Surface texture and Anatomic form) shall be Romeo or Sierra (excellent or acceptable) at delivery and remain so during the study period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>survival of Porcelain-fused and IPS e.Max CAD Crowns</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A &quot;surviving crown&quot; is when the crown remains in occlusion, and when the subject's treatment is functionally successful even though all the individual success criteria are not fulfilled.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be at least 18 (or age of consent) and less than 70 at the time of
             inclusion.

          -  The subject is healthy and compliant with good oral hygiene.

          -  The subject is in need of at least two paired contalateral single-tooth full coverage
             molar restorations in the maxilla and/or mandible.

          -  The subject shall have a stable occlusal relationship with a fully restored, fixed
             opposing dentition.

          -  Obtained informed consent from the subject.

          -  No apical disorder or inflammation of abutment teeth, adjacent and opposing teeth.

          -  Good gingival / periodontal / periapical status of restoring, opposing and adjacent
             teeth. Healed situation of soft tissue augmentation is allowed.

          -  The subject is available for the 5-year term of the investigation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent to participate.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in patient records or in patient history.

          -  Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the patient's
             total situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in patient records or in patient
             history.

          -  An existing condition where acceptable retention of the restoration is impossible to
             attain

          -  Mobility of the tooth to be restored.

          -  Pathologic pocket formation of 4 mm or greater around the tooth to be restored.

          -  Severe bruxism or other destructive habits.

          -  Amount of attached soft tissue is insufficient (no attached gingiva on the buccal side
             of the tooth).

          -  Health conditions, which do not permit the restorative procedure.
