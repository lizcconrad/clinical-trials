      The study aims at evaluating the effect of omega-3 on patients suffering recurrent oral
      aphthous ulcers

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the administration of omega 3 improve the
      quality of life in patients suffering recurrent oral ulceration and improve associated
      symptoms of pain in addition to reduction of ulcers episode.
