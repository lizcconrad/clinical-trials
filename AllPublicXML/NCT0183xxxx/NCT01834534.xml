      The objective of this research is to test the efficacy of &quot;CarePartners for Depression&quot;
      (CP-D) intervention, which was designed to increase between visit monitoring of depression
      status and enhance self-management.

      **In order to participate, subjects must be patients at participating clinics: Alcona Health
      Center, Cherry Street Health Services, Dua Family Practice, Morang Chester.

      This project will test a practical intervention that uses low cost technologies to activate
      depressed patients' existing social networks for self-management support. The intervention
      links patients with a &quot;CarePartner&quot; (CP), i.e., a non-household family member or close friend
      who is willing to support the patient in coordination with the clinician and any existing
      in-home caregiver (ICG). Through weekly automated telemonitoring, patients report their mood
      and self-management status, and receive tailored guidance on self-management. The CP receives
      a corresponding update along with guidance on how to best support the patient's
      self-management efforts, and the primary care team is notified about clinically urgent
      situations. The intervention will be tested among depressed primary care patients from
      clinics serving low-income and underinsured patients, whom the intervention was especially
      designed to benefit. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare
      the effectiveness of one year of telemonitoring-supported CP for depression versus usual care
      (control) on depression severity. Specific Aim 2 is to examine key secondary outcomes
      (response and remission, impairment, well-being, caregiving burden, healthcare costs) and
      potential moderators. Specific Aim 3 is to use a mixed-methods approach to enrich our
      interpretation of the statistical associations, and to discover strategies to enhance the
      intervention's acceptability, effectiveness, and sustainability. If the intervention proves
      effective without increasing clinician burden or marginal costs, then its subsequent
      implementation could yield major public health benefits, especially in medically underserved
      populations.
