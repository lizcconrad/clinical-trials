      The development and pilot testing of a self-management program that would be delivered in a
      one time mailing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mailing will consist of (1) A self-test that will help users know how he or she can best
      use the materials and where to start; (2) A copy of the 2012 Living Healthy Life with Chronic
      Conditions book. If people are visually impaired or have low literacy an audio CD of the book
      will be available in place of the print copy; (3)An exercise CD with flexibility and
      strengthening exercises at three different levels of intensity, designed for people with
      chronic conditions; (4) A relaxation CD with three different relaxation exercises; and (5) In
      addition, there will be tip sheets, one for each major tool such as managing pain, managing
      sleep, etc. It is expected that there will be 10-20 tip sheets in total.

      The key content of the self-test and the tip sheets will be developed surveying master
      trainers of the existing small-group Chronic Disease Self Management Program (100 active
      trainers) and asking about 500 additional trainers to rank importance of key content items
      generated in initial survey. Pilot testing of the program will be by 250 people with chronic
      diseases. Participants will be surveyed by mailed questionnaires at baseline and six-months.
      A subgroup with diabetes (estimated 25-30%) will be asked to submit hemoglobin A1C blood test
      kits at baseline and six months.
