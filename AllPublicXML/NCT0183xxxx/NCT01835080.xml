      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pulmonary arterial hypertension can worsen
      or even cause sleep apnea. It is hypothesized that if pulmonary arterial hypertension does
      indeed worsen or cause sleep apnea, then the treatment should first focus on the underlying
      pulmonary arterial hypertension instead of the sleep apnea.

      To determine if a person has sleep apnea, they will undergo one overnight polysomnogram
      (sleep study). If it is found that they have mild to moderate sleep apnea, then the subject
      will be invited to continue in the study and their pulmonary arterial hypertension will be
      treated by their managing primary physician. After the subject has had treatment for their
      pulmonary arterial hypertension, the study center will have them return for a follow up sleep
      study to learn the effects of pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment management on their
      sleep apnea, 12-24 weeks after the first sleep study.

      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is associated with fluid retention. Currently, the
      treatment paradigm for newly diagnosed PAH patients includes evaluation for Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea (OSA). The investigators propose that untreated or sub-optimally managed PAH patients
      have significant fluid retention which redistributes to the upper body during sleep and
      exacerbates or even mimics OSA. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of PAH patients
      with vasodilators and diuretics to optimize fluid balance will attenuate or even resolve OSA
      prior to the initiation of specific therapy for OSA (CPAP).

    <description>All patients will undergo a sleep study (polysomnogram) before their PAH is treated (or treated optimally) and each patient will have a repeat sleep study at 12- 24 weeks after their PAH treatment is optimally managed by their primary managing physician. These sleep studies will be centrally scored to determine whether a decrease in RDI of at least 10 events/hour has been met.</description>
