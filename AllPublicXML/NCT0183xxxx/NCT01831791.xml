    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs) and Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) until Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease(new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, drug-induced liver injury, breast cancer in male participants, prostate cancer, spontaneous abortion in female partner of male participants</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Drug-related, Treatment-emergent AEs and AE Leading to Premature Study Drug Discontinuation and Possible Suicidality-related Adverse Event (PSRAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) until Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is considered drug-related if the relationship variable indicates so, or if the variable value is missing. Any AE with a start date on or after the treatment start date and on or before the last dose of treatment is considered on-treatment (treatment-emergent). This includes an AE with a missing onset date. Any AE which occurred, in the investigator's judgement and is possibly related to suicidality, is defined as possible suicidality-related adverse event (PSRAE). Suicidality was assessed by using the columbia-suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) as determined by the investigator. The C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Mean of Median Score for Panel Global Assessment of Improvement From Baseline to 26 Weeks and 52 Weeks for Vertex and Frontal Views</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A central panel of 3 dermatologists independently assessed change in hair growth from Baseline to Week 26 and Week 52 using a 7-point scale: greatly decreased (-3), moderately decreased (-2), slightly decreased (-1), no change (0), slightly increased (1), moderately increased (2), and greatly increased (3). The median score, across the 3 panel members, is summarized. This assessment was performed by comparing the global photographs obtained at Baseline (Screening) with those subsequently obtained at Week 26 and Week 52. This assessment was made separately based on the global photography of the vertex and frontal views. The LOCF method for missing data was used for the assessment, if a participants was missing the Week 26 global photograph, but has a global photograph from an earlier assessment (i.e., a withdrawal visit), then that photograph was assessed during the panel review.</description>

          -  History or current evidence of any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical or
             psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could, in the opinion of the
             investigator or GSK medical monitor, interfere with the subject's safety, obtaining
             informed consent, or compliance with study procedures. Note: the investigator may
             consult with GSK medical monitor if a condition could interfere with the subject's
             safety.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal finding on the Screening electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Global scalp hair thinning, including occipital areas.

             of ketoconazole shampoo on the scalp is prohibited during the study, but use before
             Screening is not a reason for exclusion. Cimetidine is prohibited during the study,
             but use before Screening is not a reason for exclusion, Topical estrogen or
             progesterone, Topical prostaglandin analogs on the scalp, Tamoxifen, Drugs potentially
             causing hypertrichosis (e.g., cyclosporine, diazoxide, phenytoin, psoralens), Drugs

        <description>An AE is considered drug-related if the relationship variable indicates so, or if the variable value is missing. Any AE with a start date on or after the treatment start date and on or before the last dose of treatment is considered on-treatment (treatment-emergent). This includes an AE with a missing onset date. Any AE which occurred, in the investigator’s judgement and is possibly related to suicidality, is defined as possible suicidality-related adverse event (PSRAE). Suicidality was assessed by using the columbia-suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) as determined by the investigator. The C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Platelet Count and White Blood Cell Count at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of platelet count and white blood cell count at Baseline, Week 26 and Week 52 visits and the early withdrawal visit where applicable. Change from Baseline in the platelet count and white blood cell count values are summarized for each post-Baseline assessment as well as for the final assessment (the last post-Baseline value in the study [final value]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Bilirubin and Creatinine at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the measurement of total bilirubin and creatinine at Baseline, Week 26 and Week 52 visits and the early withdrawal visit where applicable. Change from Baseline in the total bilirubin and creatinine values are summarized for each post-Baseline assessment as well as for the final assessment (the last post-Baseline value in the study [final value]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Laboratory Value Shifts From Baseline at Any Time Post-baseline</title>
        <description>Blood samples for the assessment of the indicated laboratory parameters were taken at the Baseline, Week 26 and Week 52 visits and the early withdrawal visit where applicable. The laboratory parameters included ALP, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, total protein, sodium, potassium, albumin, glucose, creatinine, urea/BUN, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). A laboratory value (LV) that is within the normal range is considered normal. A LV that is above the upper limit of the normal range is considered high abnormal. A LV that is below the lower limit of the normal range is considered low abnormal. Number of participants with any LV shifts from BL at any time post-BL are presented for, normal at BL to abnormal; normal at BL to high; normal at BL to low; normal or low at BL to high; normal or high at BL to low.</description>

        <description>Blood pressure measurements were taken to observe vital signs and included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the Screening visit, Baseline visit, Weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52 visits and the early withdrawal visit if applicable. Change from Baseline in SBP and DBP is summarized for each post-Baseline assessment as well as for the final assessment (the last post-Baseline value in the study [final value]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date).</description>

          <description>Vital sign monitoring included heart rate measurement at the Screening visit, Baseline visit, Weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52 visits and the early withdrawal visit if applicable. Change from Baseline in heart rate is summarized for each post-Baseline assessment as well as for the final assessment (the last post-Baseline value in the study [final value]). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date).</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The number of participants answering yes/no responses to questions about suicidal ideation (Question [Que] 1 and Que 2) at Baseline and post-Baseline (since last visit) and suicidal behaviors (Que 6 – Que 10) at post-Baseline (since last visit) are presented. Questions included the presence (yes) or absence (no) of the following: Que 1 - a wish to be dead; Que 2 - nonspecific (NS) active suicidal thoughts; Que 6 - preparatory acts or behavior; Que 7 - aborted attempt; Que 8 - interrupted attempt (int. att.); Que 9 - non-fatal actual suicide attempt; Que 10 - completed suicide and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. Final assessment (FA) is the last post-Baseline measurement during the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in Target Area Hair Count Within a 2.54 Centimeter (cm) Diameter Circle at Week 26 and Week 52</title>
        <description>Target area hair count is based on the nonvellus hair(&gt;= 30 micrometer[μm] in width) count within a target 2.54cm(1 inch) diameter circle at the vertex and was assessed by macrophotographic technique. A cosmetic ink dot was placed by means of a tattoo at BL on the scalp in the center of the circle as a marker to guide the placement of the hair count area at subsequent time points. If the ink dot faded between study visits, it was redone. For the macrophotography, hair was clipped before each photograph. Change from BL is defined as post-BL value minus BL value. The BL value is defined as the latest assessment on or before the BL date(latest non-missing value of either treatment start date or randomization date). The last observation carried forward(LOCF) method for missing data was used by carrying forward the last non-missing post-BL assessment value for participants with missing data and/or for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>

        <description>A central panel of 3 dermatologists independently assessed change in hair growth from Baseline to Week 26 and Week 52 using a 7-point scale: greatly decreased (-3), moderately decreased (-2), slightly decreased (-1), no change (0), slightly increased (1), moderately increased (2), and greatly increased (3). The median score, across the 3 panel members, is summarized. This assessment was performed by comparing the global photographs obtained at Baseline (Screening) with those subsequently obtained at Week 26 and Week 52. This assessment was made separately based on the global photography of the vertex and frontal views. The LOCF method for missing data was used for the assessment, if a participants was missing the Week 26 global photograph, but has a global photograph from an earlier assessment (i.e., a withdrawal visit), then that photograph was assessed during the panel review.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline (BL) in the Stage of Androgenic Alopecia (AGA) According to the Norwood-Hamilton Scale at 26 Weeks and 52 Weeks</title>
        <description>The investigator/designee assessed the stage (Stage I to Stage VII) of AGA (i.e., male pattern baldness [MPB]) by utilizing the Norwood-Hamilton scale, used to measure the progression of MPB. Stage VII indicates worse balding than Stage I. Assessment was made by direct visual examination (aided by pictures) of the participant at Screening (Baseline), Week 26, and Week 52. &quot;v,&quot; vertex; most of the hair loss (commonly seen with advancing age) is on the vertex. &quot;a,&quot; type a variant; major features are (1) the entire anterior hairline border recedes in unison; (2) there is no simultaneous balding of the vertex. The number of participants with stage changes from Baseline are summarized. The LOCF method for missing data was used by carrying forward the last non-missing post-Baseline assessment for participants with missing data and/or for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline (BL) in the Stage of Androgenic Alopecia (AGA) According to the Norwood-Hamilton Scale at 26 Weeks and 52 Weeks</title>
          <description>The investigator/designee assessed the stage (Stage I to Stage VII) of AGA (i.e., male pattern baldness [MPB]) by utilizing the Norwood-Hamilton scale, used to measure the progression of MPB. Stage VII indicates worse balding than Stage I. Assessment was made by direct visual examination (aided by pictures) of the participant at Screening (Baseline), Week 26, and Week 52. &quot;v,&quot; vertex; most of the hair loss (commonly seen with advancing age) is on the vertex. &quot;a,&quot; type a variant; major features are (1) the entire anterior hairline border recedes in unison; (2) there is no simultaneous balding of the vertex. The number of participants with stage changes from Baseline are summarized. The LOCF method for missing data was used by carrying forward the last non-missing post-Baseline assessment for participants with missing data and/or for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the ITT population.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sexual Problems as Assessed by the Problem Assessment Scale of the Sexual Function Inventory (PAS SFI) at Week 13, Week 26, Week 39, and Week 52</title>
        <description>The Problem Assessment Scale of the Sexual Function Inventory (PAS SFI) questionnaire was used to assess participant-perceived problems in sexual function using 3 questions assessing problems with sex drive, erections and ejaculation. They are scored on a 5-point scale of 0 to 4 (0=big problem, 1= medium problem, 2=small problem, 3=very small problem, 4=no problem). Total scores range from 0-12. Change from Baseline in PAS SFI scores is defined as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date). The LOCF method for missing data was used by carrying forward the last non-missing post-Baseline assessment for participants with missing data and/or for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Sexual Problems as Assessed by the Problem Assessment Scale of the Sexual Function Inventory (PAS SFI) at Week 13, Week 26, Week 39, and Week 52</title>
          <description>The Problem Assessment Scale of the Sexual Function Inventory (PAS SFI) questionnaire was used to assess participant-perceived problems in sexual function using 3 questions assessing problems with sex drive, erections and ejaculation. They are scored on a 5-point scale of 0 to 4 (0=big problem, 1= medium problem, 2=small problem, 3=very small problem, 4=no problem). Total scores range from 0-12. Change from Baseline in PAS SFI scores is defined as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date). The LOCF method for missing data was used by carrying forward the last non-missing post-Baseline assessment for participants with missing data and/or for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 13, Week 26, Week 39, and Week 52</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item validated measure developed specifically to assess quality of life (QoL) in participants with dermatological conditions. It assesses six domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work ⁄school, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI total is the sum of 10 questions, each ranging from 0 (unanswered/not relevant,not at all) to 3 (very much). The higher the score, the greater the impairment of (QoL). Change from Baseline in DLQI scores is defined as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value of an assessment is defined as the latest assessment on or before the Baseline date (latest non-missing value of either the treatment start date or the randomization date). The LOCF method for missing data was used by carrying forward the last non-missing post-Baseline assessment for participants with missing data and/or for participants who discontinued from the study.</description>
