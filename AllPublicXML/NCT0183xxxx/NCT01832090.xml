      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of Radiesse® Injectable
      Dermal Filler for hand treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, masked, controlled study to investigate the effectiveness
      of Radiesse® Dermal Filler for hand treatment, comprised of a 3-month main study followed by
      an open-label extension (OLEX) study through 12 months. At 3 months, untreated controls
      received Radiesse Dermal Filler for hand treatment and were followed for the remainder of the
      study. All study subjects were eligible for retreatment 6 months after initial treatment, and
      all subjects were followed through 12 months from study enrollment in the OLEX.

    <measure>Mean Change on Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS), by Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by a mean change on the 5-point Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS) between baseline and 3 months, by hand, among treated subjects and untreated controls. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score.
MHGS categories are as follows:
0 = no loss of fatty tissue;
1 = mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins; 3 = moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons; 4 = severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons; and 5 = very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons.</description>

          <title>Fitzpatrick Skin Type</title>
          <description>The Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) represent a standard classification of skin color based on one's response to sun exposure (i.e., burns or tans), rather than defined by race or ethnicity.
All FST were eligible for participation in the current study.

        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by a mean change on the 5-point Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS) between baseline and 3 months, by hand, among treated subjects and untreated controls. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score.
MHGS categories are as follows:
0 = no loss of fatty tissue;
1 = mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins; 3 = moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons; 4 = severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons; and 5 = very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons.</description>

        <title>≥ 1-point Change on Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS), by Subject, With Subjects Stratified by Age &lt; 60 Years or ≥ 60 Years</title>
        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by a ≥ 1-point change on the 5-point Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS) between baseline and 3 months, by subject, among treated subjects and untreated controls, stratified by age &lt; 60 years or ≥ 60 years. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score.
MHGS categories are as follows:
0 = no loss of fatty tissue;
1 = mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins; 3 = moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons; 4 = severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons; and 5 = very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons.</description>

        <title>Mean Change on the Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS), by Hand, Among All Treated Subjects With Retreatment</title>
        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of Radiesse for hand treatment as measured by mean change on the 5-point Merz Hand Grading Scale (MHGS) between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, by hand, among all treated subjects receiving retreatment. A measure of successful or improved treatment effect is demonstrated by a decrease in MHGS score.
MHGS categories are as follows:
0 = no loss of fatty tissue;
1 = mild loss of fatty tissue; slight visibility of veins; 3 = moderate loss of fatty tissue; mild visibility of veins and tendons; 4 = severe loss of fatty tissue; moderate visibility of veins and tendons; and 5 = very severe loss of fatty tissue; marked visibility of veins and tendons.</description>
