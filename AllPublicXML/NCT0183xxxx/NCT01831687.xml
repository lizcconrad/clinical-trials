      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Etodolac Extended Release Tablets USP 600mg of Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the
      corresponding Reference Product: Etodolac Extended Release Tablets 600 mg of Teva
      Pharmaceutical Ind. Ltd., USA under fed condition in healthy, adult, human subjects in a
      randomized crossover study.

      The study was conducted with 36 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 600 mg
      dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting
      position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 15 days including washout period of 11
      days between administrations of study drug in each study period.
