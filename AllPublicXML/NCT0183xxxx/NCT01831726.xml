      The purpose of this signal seeking study was to determine whether treatment with dovitinib
      (TKI258) demonstrated sufficient efficacy in select pathway-activated solid tumors and/or
      hematologic malignancies to warrant further study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase II, open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with
      dovitinib (TKI258) in patients with a diagnosis of select solid tumors or hematological
      malignancies that have been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have mutations,
      translocations or amplifications and whose disease has progressed on or after standard
      treatment.

      Genomic profiling is becoming more accessible to patients and their physicians. As such, more
      patients have been identified with potentially-actionable mutations, translocations or
      amplifications but do not have access to targeted drug treatment. This is a signal-seeking
      study to match patients with tumor pathway activations inhibited by dovitinib to the RTK
      inhibitor dovitinib. Pre-identification of mutations, translocations, or amplifications will
      be performed locally at a CLIA certified laboratory prior to participation on the trial.

      For the purpose of this study, genomic profiling is not considered part of screening.
      Informed consent must be signed before any screening activities take place. Once eligibility
      (screening criteria met) has been confirmed by Novartis, the patient will initiate therapy
      with dovitinib single-agent. The patient may not receive any additional anti-cancer therapy
      during treatment with dovitinib.

      Patients received study treatment until disease progression (assessed by investigator per
      RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematologic response criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or
      discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.g., withdrawal of consent, start
      of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise known
      as End of Treatment. All patients who discontinue from study treatment due to disease
      progression must have their progression clearly documented.

      Disease assessment (by RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematological response criteria) will be
      performed every 8 weeks (±4 days) after first dose of study drug (Day 1 of every odd cycle),
      until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever occurs first. The frequency of
      disease assessment may be reduced to every 12 weeks for patients who have at least 4
      post-baseline disease assessments and are clinically stable (except AML patients). Scans was
      assessed locally by the investigator. After discontinuation of treatment, patients,
      regardless of reason for treatment discontinuation, will be followed for safety for 30 days
      after the last dose.

      All patients will be followed for survival status every 3 months for 2 years after the last
      patient has enrolled in the study,regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if
      consent is withdrawn or patient is lost to follow-up)

             Highly effective contraception methods included:

               -  Total abstinence (when this was in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post- ovulation methods) and withdrawal were not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.

             In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner was the sole partner for that subject.

               -  Combination of the following (a+b):

                    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

         30. Oral, implantable, or injectable hormone contraceptives might be affected by
             cytochrome P450 interactions, and were therefore not considered effective for this
             study Women of child-bearing potential (sexually mature women) who had not undergone a
             hysterectomy or who were not naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive
             months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months),
             were required to have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 days prior to starting
             study drug.

         31. Post-menopausal women were allowed to participate in this study. Women were considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea
             with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
             without hysterectomy) at least six weeks prior to entry in the study. In the case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by
             follow up hormone level assessment, then she was considered not of child bearing
             potential.

         32. Fertile males not willing to use contraception. Fertile males must use condom with
             spermicide. Highly effective contraception, as defined above, was to be used by both
             sexes (male patients and their female partners) during study treatment and for 90 days
             after the last dose of study medication and was not to father a child in this period.
             A condom was required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery
             of the drug via seminal fluid.
