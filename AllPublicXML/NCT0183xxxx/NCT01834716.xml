    <textblock>
      5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease (AD) costing $185 billion annually, while 15
      million caregivers look after these individuals. AD is the sixth leading cause of death, but
      the only one in the top 10 causes that cannot be prevented.

      This study may demonstrate exercise in an amount attainable by many will be preventative in
      asymptomatic individuals including those with brain Abeta deposition already that are at
      impending risk of the disease. Sperling and colleagues(1) coined the research term
      AD-pathophysiological process (abbreviated AD-P) for use in studies such as the intervention
      in this proposal.

      Our long term goal is to assess whether exercise may be preventative of AD at older ages
      (=73, mean=75), when more than 40% of cognitively normal persons have A beta deposits, the
      hallmark of AD pathogenesis, in their brains. In a NIH RO1 grant submission the investigators
      proposed to conduct a partially blinded controlled preventative trial in 150 cognitively
      normal individuals, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 18 months of moderate aerobic exercise
      versus 18 months of toning and stretching. All persons would have baseline and 18 month brain
      Abeta PET studies. The study was designed to determine whether an exercise intervention in
      persons mean age 75 would lead to decreased brain Abeta accumulation, increased hippocampal
      volume, improved cognition, and improved dementia-related biomarkers compared to the control
      group. The study would be unique in that the investigators would be able to examine if
      aerobic exercise slows the accumulation of brain Abeta in an older population, at which time
      Abeta deposition is common. If successful, this would provide an additional motivating reason
      to recommend exercise for most elderly persons.

    <description>In this pilot study, we will mail to 3,000 persons and determine the response rate, though we will only recruit until 20 volunteers have been successfully randomized. To demonstrate that we can recruit and randomize 20 cognitively normal volunteers to the study, with 14 undergoing aerobic exercise and six undergoing a non-aerobic exercise program. Sixteen volunteers will have positive amyloid findings and four will have negative findings on the CT/PET scan. Two volunteers with negative findings will be in the aerobic exercise group and two will be in the non-aerobic exercise group.</description>
