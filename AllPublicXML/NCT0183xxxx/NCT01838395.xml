  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if BL-8040 in combination with
      cytarabine (Ara-C) can help to control the disease in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML) that has relapsed or did not respond adequately to previous treatment. The safety of
      the study drug combination will also be studied.

      Open-label, multicenter, phase IIa, dose escalating study in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML, defined according to WHO criteria (1), including subjects who failed
      chemotherapy only and those who failed previous Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) /
      Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT), provided at least 6 months have passed from
      transplant.

      Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 (&quot;monotherapy period&quot;)
      over two days (one injection per day) followed by concurrent administration of BL-8040 with
      standard salvage chemotherapy (&quot;combined period&quot;) over 5 days. During the &quot;combined period,&quot;
      BL-8040 will be administered 4 hours prior to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy will consist of
      cytarabine (Ara-C) 1.5 or 3 g/m2/d per dose (based on age), administered intravenously (IV)
      over 3 hours, for 5 days and will not be escalated.

      The first part of the study (Part 1) will include escalating dose groups and be considered
      the 'escalation phase'. Six potential dose levels (see Table 1) will be investigated starting
      at dose level 1. Patients will be accrued in a conventional 3+3 design. Applying this study
      design, the first cohort of 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1 and evaluated for dose
      escalation.
