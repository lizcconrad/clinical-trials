  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if exercise added to usual treatment improves
      cocaine dependence treatment. The primary objective of this study is to investigate if
      exercise can facilitate cocaine craving reduction. The secondary aims are to evaluate if
      exercise can reduce negative mood states, improve quality of life and facilitate abstinence
      of cocaine.

      This study is designed as two-groups, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an 8-week exercise program added to usual treatment compared with a health
      education program in 20 cocaine dependent patients. These participants will be randomized to
      one of the following two groups: a) exercise group: supervised moderate-vigorous exercise in
      group based on strength and calisthenics exercises, b) control group: supervised health
      education in group. All participants must have DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence as the
      primary disorder and must be in treatment.
