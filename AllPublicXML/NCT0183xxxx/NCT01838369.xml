    <measure>To assess the change in disease activity measured as M-protein levels in serum/urine following BI-505 treatment compared to base line according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>M-protein will be measured at screening, prior to each dose and at end of study visit, for up to 19 weeks.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The clinical safety of BI-505 will be assessed by reporting the numbers of AEs, the severity and the relationship to IMP.</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit and up to 28 days after the last dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by measuring the following clinical safety parameters; Adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, ECG and immunogenicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pharmacokinetic profile of BI-505 will be determined by calculating the following pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC, % AUCex, Cmax, Tmax, CL, Vss and T1/2.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after the last dose.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pharmacodynamics of BI-505 will be assessed by measuring soluble biomarkers and ICAM-1 saturation on bone marrow plasma cells.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after the last dose.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The immunogenicity profile of BI-505 will be assessed by measuring antibodies towards BI-505.</measure>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Smoldering multiple myeloma based on the International Myeloma Working
             Group criteria:

               -  Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 3 g/dL and/or bone marrow plasma cells
                  greater than or equal to 10 percent.

               -  Absence of end-organ damage such as lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia or
                  renal failure that can be attributed to a plasma cell proliferative disorder.

          -  Male or female, 18 years or older.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0-1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma or a clinical suspicion of
             an ongoing progression into symptomatic multiple myeloma.

          -  Prior or current treatment having a proven or potential impact on myeloma cell
             proliferation or survival (including conventional chemotherapies, biological
             therapies, immunomodulatory drugs, or proteasome inhibitors), as judged by the
             Investigator.

          -  Severe other conditions.
