  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of the Dignicap System to prevent chemotherapy induced alopecia will
      be evaluated in women with early breast cancer undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy regimens. The scalp cold cap will be applied at each chemotherapy cycle. Hair
      loss will be evaluated by patient self assessment of 5 standardized photographs taken prior
      to each chemotherapy cycle. A concurrent control group not using a cold cap will also be
      evaluated.

    <description>The DigniCap™ System consists of the digitized system for controlled scalp cooling (Digni C3) in conjunction with the soft, tight-fitting silicon cap (DigniCap™), the neoprene outer cap (DigniTherm™), and the liquid coolant (DigniCool). DIGNISTICK™ is prepared to log data from a treatment when inserted in the slot. DIGNICARD™ is a key card which has to be inserted in order to start a treatment.</description>
