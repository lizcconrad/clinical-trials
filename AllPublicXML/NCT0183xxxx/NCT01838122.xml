    <textblock>
      In view of recent suggestion of American Diabetes Association(ADA)to screen women with PCOS
      for HbA1C,we intend to study its prevalence in all categories of obesity in women with PCOS.

      Women with PCOS by Rotterdam criteria will be screened for insulin resistance by using
      different techniques or tests.

      Further, the sensitivity and specificity of HbA1C will be compared with sensitivity and
      specificity of other insulin resistance markers such as OGTT, Free androgen index, free
      testosterone, fasting insulin to glucose ratio, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B-CELL.
