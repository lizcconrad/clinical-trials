  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single arm prospective study, aiming at identifying biomarkers of early
      response to trastuzumab. It is a prognostic factor study recruiting all consecutive cases of
      HER-2 positive breast cancer eligible for a pre-operative treatment by trastuzumab, followed
      by breast conserving surgery. The investigators will study the association between the value
      of biomarkers measured at diagnosis and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      response (partial and complete response) using a logistic regression (main analysis).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Female patients aged 18 years or older.

          -  Histologically or confirmed untreated invasive carcinoma of the breast

          -  Previous treated invasive breast carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ are allowed,
             assuming there is no evidence of disease at the moment of the inclusion in the
             protocol, and patients are not on any current treatment

          -  Candidates for breast conserving surgery: patients with a minimum size of 11 mm
             measured by breast US. Bilateral and multifocal tumors are allowed, assuming the
             biopsies pre- and post-treatment are performed in the same target lesion.

          -  HER2-positive (defined as either immunohistochemistry [immuno-histochemistry ] 3+ or
             in situ hybridization [ISH] positive) as assessed by local laboratory on primary tumor
             (ISH positivity is defined as a ratio of 2.2 or greater for the number of HER2 gene
             copies to the number of signals for abnormality on chromosome 17 (CEP17), or for
             single probe tests, a HER2 gene count greater than 4) and/or by PCR.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0/1.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 50%

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential (premenopausal or less than
             12 months of amenorrhea post-menopause, and who have not undergone surgical
             sterilization).

          -  For women of childbearing potential who are sexually active, agreement to use a highly
             effective, non-hormonal form of contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal
             contraception during and for at least 6 months post-treatment.

          -  Maximum time allowed between collect of the informed consent and first administration
             of treatment :21 days

             chemotherapy (T3 acceptable if multifocal and decision primary surgery).

                  has documented Gilbert's syndrome)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])
