  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research represents a pioneering effort to design a brief, cost effective and readily
      transportable program that will enable disadvantaged elders to become more effective
      participants in their health care.

      The intervention is expected to result in trained elders becoming more knowledgeable health
      care partners. Trained patients will be prepared for appointments and will engage their
      primary care physicians in active dialogue regarding cancer prevention and screening.

      Based on self-advocacy, these patients are expected to receive better preventive care and
      report greater satisfaction with care. Program participation can subsequently contribute to
      general health improvements and minimize health disparities.

      In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 400 older adults, the investigators will assess
      the efficacy of the &quot;Speak Up&quot; intervention (N=200) relative to an attention control group
      &quot;Connect&quot; program (N=200), aimed at enhancing social and civic engagement. Participants will
      now obtain resource materials that include decision aids and diary logs to bring to visits
      with doctors. The investigators will implement &quot;Speak Up&quot; and &quot;Connect&quot; programs in two
      unique study populations: 1) participants in the ongoing NCI study and 2) older adults
      attending senior center programs sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Participants
      will be assessed prior to the intervention and 2 month, and 12 months post intervention. The
      investigators will have an observation window of 12 months to determine whether and when the
      older adult obtained screening. The selection of a shorter follow-up time frame will help
      reduce attrition.

    <description>Perception of Physician Quality Scale(Lee &amp; Kasper, 1998) will be used to measure patient satisfaction with physician care (p. 21). Questions include satisfaction with physician visits and satisfaction with physician knowledge of respondent's medical problems. This scale has been utilized with elderly populations (e.g. Burton et al. 2002) and has been found to be a valid and reliable (Cronbach's alpha greater than .8) measure of patient satisfaction (Lee &amp; Kasper, 1998).</description>
