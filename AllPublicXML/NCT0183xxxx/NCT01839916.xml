    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving donor T cells after donor stem cell
      transplant works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. In a donor stem cell
      transplant, the donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy
      any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T
      cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of escalating dose regimen (EDR) donor lymphocyte infusion
      (DLI) as measured by the proportion of patients who receive at least one DLI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years after stem cell transplant (SCT) for
      high-risk hematologic malignancies receiving T-cell depleted grafts followed by escalating
      dose regimen (EDR) prophylactic DLI compared to historical controls not receiving DLI.

      II. To assess the safety of EDR DLI for high-risk hematologic malignancies as measured by
      cumulative incidence of severe grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      III. To measure outcomes of grade II-IV acute GVHD, non-relapse mortality, overall survival
      and chronic GVHD of EDR DLI.

      IV. To assess the full donor chimerism rate in the CD3 compartment and immune reconstitution
      after EDR DLI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DLI intravenously (IV). Treatment repeats every 4-8 weeks for 5 doses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.

          -  SGOT and SGPT &gt;= 5 x ULN; liver biopsy preferred for such patients
