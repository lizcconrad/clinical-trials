      To investigate the safety, immunogenicity and immune effect of the Varicella vaccine after
      the 2nd dose vaccination in Chao yang district, Bei jing, since the 2nd varicella vaccination

      &quot;Breakthrough&quot; varicella cases and varicella cases were monitored to evaluate the protective
      effective in a large population.

      Make the basic evaluation of safety for the two dose of varicella vaccination

      Monitoring the Varicella virus origin and virus types from illness cases in Chao yang
      district

      Make the evaluation of healthy costs reduce for the varicella emergency vaccination after
