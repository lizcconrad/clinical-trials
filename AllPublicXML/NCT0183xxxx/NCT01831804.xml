  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind (subjects and investigators will be
      blinded, GSK internal personnel will not be blinded), parallel-group, two part (Part A, Part
      B) trial in healthy volunteers and subjects with diabetic foot ulcers. Part A is designed to
      evaluate single applications of GSK1278863 in one cohort of healthy volunteers (intact skin)
      and approximately 3 cohorts of diabetic subjects. Part B is designed to evaluate first
      single, and then repeat applications of GSK1278863 in diabetics, both in the clinic and by
      subjects at home. Part B will include approximately 3 cohorts in which the concentration of
      drug applied will be determined by pharmacokinetic data from Part A and earlier cohorts in
      Part B.

             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the Investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor agree
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures. Subjects with hemoglobin (Hb) values higher than
             ULN the normal range should always be excluded from enrollment.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 90 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

             ulcer will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Non-study ulcers being treated
