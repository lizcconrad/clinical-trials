  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase IV, open, randomized, multi-center, controlled vaccine trial conducted
      in healthy Latin American infants, utilizing one or two supplemental doses of IPV in children
      previously vaccinated with 3 doses of bOPV. We will examine the impact of supplemental IPV on
      stool shedding and humoral immunity, as well as intra-IPV manufacturer comparability, and
      safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The world polio eradication effort is near its goal of reducing the number of new cases of
      polio to zero. However, final and definitive eradication of the disease will require stopping
      the use of oral polio vaccines (OPV's) which contain live virus and can rarely revert back to
      disease producing strains. This period will result in a risk of polio re-emergence as
      immunity will wane while some vaccine poliovirus will still be circulating. Inactivated polio
      vaccine (IPV) could potentially play a central role during this process but at present
      barriers of cost and logistics prevent its routine use in resource limited countries, and
      concerns exist as to whether IPV provides enough immunity in the intestine to reduce the
      spread of polioviruses in communities once OPV's are stopped. We plan a multi-center trial in
      Latin America in which we will administer 1 or 2 doses of IPV to children previously
      vaccinated with an OPV containing type 1 and 3 poliovirus (bOPV), and then assess the
      shedding in the stool of a type 2 OPV virus administered later. A decrease in the amount of
      virus shed compared to children not given IPV would indicate that the IPV boosted intestinal
      immunity, and would suggest that spread of virus in communities could be reduced using this
      strategy. We will also measure the impact of supplemental IPV's on antibody formation in the
      blood, which is a marker of protection of the individual from polio disease. A secondary aim
      will be to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three IPV's produced by different
      manufacturers. The overall goal will be to inform policy makers in polio eradication
      regarding the potential role that one or two doses of IPV might play in the final steps
      toward polio eradication.

    <measure>Change in the stool poliovirus excretion after mOPV2 challenge (shedding index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 28 days of mOPV2 challenge</time_frame>
    <description>The basis for calculation of the quantitative shedding index endpoint is to measure the change of viral concentrations shed in stool post-mOPV2 challenge from the baseline timepoint at day 0 to 7, 14, 21 and 28 days as measured from time of mOPV challenge. Quantitative shedding index endpoint will be computed as an area under the viral shedding curve based on these three log10-transformed measurements.</description>

    <time_frame>At 6 and 14 weeks, and then before and 1 week after mOPV2 challenge</time_frame>
    <description>The first serologic response endpoint is neutralizing antibody titer defined as the estimated dilution at which 50% neutralizing activity is achieved. The second serologic response endpoint is the binary seroconversion indicator. Seroconversion is considered to be achieved by the time of the subsequent time point if type-specific titers measured at that time are ≥1:8 and &gt; 4-fold over expected levels of maternally-derived antibody computed from the observed titer at baseline assuming an exponential decay with ½ life of 24 days. The third serologic response endpoint of seroprotection is a binary outcome computed from a single antibody titer measurement with seroprotection being achieved if the measured titer is &gt; 1:8.</description>
