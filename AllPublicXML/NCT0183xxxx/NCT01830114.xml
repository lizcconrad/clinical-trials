  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a web
      application called Check-up and Choices (CC). CC will be developed for use in primary care.
      It would tightly integrate screening for heavy drinking and drug use, a brief motivational
      intervention for hazardous or heavy drinkers, a moderation training protocol for less
      dependent problem drinkers, and an abstinence-oriented protocol for more dependent drinkers
      and drug abusers. The brief motivational intervention will be tailored to the patient's age.
      Its purpose will be to motivate problem drinkers to change their drinking. The
      action-oriented moderation and abstinence protocols are cognitive-behavioral interventions
      (CBIs) that provide patients with the skills to maximize their chances of success with
      changing their drinking and/or drug use.

      The investigators have already developed these elements but they are not integrated into a
      single program with appropriate branching between them. Nor has the content been tailored for
      use in primary care.
