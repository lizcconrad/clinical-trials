    <textblock>
      Self-efficacy predicts behavioural and rehabilitation outcomes and may be an important
      psychological factor for wheelchair mobility. A feasibility study will evaluate a novel
      self-efficacy enhanced wheelchair training intervention (WheelSee) to determine if:
      1.WheelSee improves self-efficacy compared to standard care; 2. study design is appropriate;
      and 3. The WheelSee intervention protocol is suitable. This feasibility study will allow for
      study design and protocol refinement and will provide pilot data for an experimental trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of administering a novel
      self-efficacy enhanced wheelchair training intervention (WheelSee) for manual wheelchair
      users who are at least 19 years of age. Self-efficacy for wheelchair use is an important
      construct, which may influence wheelchair mobility and participation. Pilot data obtained
      from this study will inform the design of an experimental trial and refinement of the
      WheelSee intervention and protocol.

      This study will use a randomized controlled, single blind design with a sample of 24 (12
      intervention, 12 control). Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or
      control group using a computer generated table of random numbers. Participants allocated to
      the intervention group will take part in WheelSee in groups of 2-4. The WheelSee intervention
      consists of 6 (twice weekly, minimum 3 days apart) x 1.5 hour sessions. Participants will be
      encouraged to bring a family member to each session, who may act as a spotter during the
      practice of wheelchair skills. If no family member is available, a student volunteer spotter
      will be available to ensure a 1:1 spotter: wheelchair user ratio. All spotters will be
      trained in appropriate spotting techniques.

    <measure>Wheelchair-use Confidence Scale (WheelCon) Version 3.0 Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wheelchair-use Confidence Scale (WheelCon) Version 3.0 for manual wheelchair users is a 65-item self-report scale (0-100) with documented reliability and validity. Responses indicate current level of perceived confidence (%) to navigate the physical environment in a wheelchair, perform activities in a wheelchair, problem solve, advocate for specific needs, and manage social situations and emotions. The WheelCon was selected as the primary outcome measure because it is a standardized tool for evaluating confidence using a wheelchair, the primary construct of interest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wheelchair Skills Test Version 4.1 Questionnaire (WST-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wheelchair Skills Test Version 4.1 Questionnaire (WST-Q) for manual wheelchair users is a standardized subjective evaluation of ability to execute 32 manual wheelchair skills (pass/fail) and the safety of skill execution (safe/unsafe). Total percent scores (0-100%) are calculated for both skill execution and safety.The WST was selected as a secondary measure because it measures wheelchair skills capacity and safety, both of which may influence or be influenced by confidence using a wheelchair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life-Space Assessment (LSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Life-Space Assessment (LSA) is a 20-item questionnaire that tracks the mobility habits of wheelchair users in a continuum of environmental contexts (home; around the home; in the neighbourhood; in town; and outside of town). Participants report on their attainment of each life-space during the past 4 weeks, the frequency of attainment, and whether assistance was required. The LSA was selected as an outcome measure because it provides information about an individual's mobility habits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Wheelchair Outcome Measure (WhOM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wheelchair Outcome Measure (WhOM) is a client-specific measurement tool that identifies satisfaction with participation in desired activities for wheelchair users. Rates of perceived 'importance' of the goal (0-10) and 'satisfaction' with current performance of this activity (0-10) will be obtained. Scoring is calculated by multiplying 'importance' by 'satisfaction'. The WhOM was selected to obtain some information about participation goals of manual wheelchair users and to explore whether a wheelchair training intervention could influence perceived satisfaction with participation.</description>

    <description>WheelSee sessions will be administered by a peer-trainer, who will be trained in a 2-day workshop to use social cognitive approaches (i.e. facilitating successful performance of wheelchair skills, learning through observation of peers, positive verbal reinforcement from peers and family members, and re-interpretation of physiological symptoms) to foster the improvement of self-efficacy for wheelchair use. Each WheelSee session will be tailored to the individual goals of participants, which will be identified during the start of each WheelSee session.</description>
