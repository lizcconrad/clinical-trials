  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conceptually, awareness of pressure occurs only during wakefulness. Thus reducing the
      pressure during wakefulness may improve therapy comfort and potentially adherence without
      compromizing therapy efficacy. SensAwake™ is a unique pressure relief technology developed by
      Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare which detects irregularity in the flow signal indicative of the
      transition from sleep to wake. When the transition from sleep to wake is detected the device
      promptly reduces the pressure to help facilitate a return to sleep.

      The purpose of this study is to compare adherence and sleep quality outcomes in patients
      treated by CPAP with and without SensAwake technology.

      It is hypothesised that participants with SensAwake on will have improved adherence and sleep
      quality.

    <measure>Daytime Sleepiness (Subjective Sleep Quality)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected through the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) which is a subjective questionnaire and the participant answer 8 question with rating on the chance of dozing (from 0= no chance of dozing to 3 = high chance of dozing). The total is added with a range from 0-24. A total score of 0 means that the participant is not experiencing day time sleepiness, while total score of 24 means that the participant si extremely sleepy during the daytime.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (Subjective Sleep Quality)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). There are seven question with each question having a scale of 0 (no issue) to 4 (very severe). The total score is added up. If the participant has a total score of 0-7 = no clinical significant insomnia, total score of 8-14 = sub threshold insomnia, total score of 15-21 = clinical insomnia (moderate), total score of 22-28 = clinical insomnia (severe).</description>

    <measure>OSA Impact of Daily Life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected through the Short Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10). The questionnaire has 10 questions which ask how daytime sleepiness has impacted their quality of life. Each question has a scale of 1 = yes extreme to 4 = No. Lower total score (min 10) means that the disease is affecting your quality of life while a higher total score (maximum 40) means that the disease is not affecting your quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OSA Impact of Daily Life (Fatigue)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected through the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). There are 9 question on fatigue with each question having a scale of 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. A lower total score (minimum of 9) = low severity with fatigue while a higher total score (maximum of 63) indicates a higher severity with fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected through the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI).The questions ask &quot;Since beginning CPAP therapy, how would you describe the chance (if any) in symptoms related to your OSA. The questions has a scale of 1 = no change (or condition has got worse) to 7 = a great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference.</description>
