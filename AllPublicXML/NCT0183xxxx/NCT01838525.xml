      To assess the potential value of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) for early diagnosis and
      prognosis of patients with sepsis, and then compared with C-reactive protein (CRP),
      procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cell (WBC) counts, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
      Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. 164
      patients were enrolled in the study, including 25 cases with systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (SIRS) and 139 cases with different levels of sepsis (46 moderate sepsis, 52 severe
      sepsis and 41 septic shock ). Serum levels of Alpha-1-acid Glycoprotein (AGP), C-reactive
      protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were measured on
      the day of admission to intensive care unit (ICU).
