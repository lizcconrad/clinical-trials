    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure intrahepatic HCV RNA levels at the time of liver
      transplantation in patients receiving antiviral therapy while on the liver transplant waiting
      list. This will eventually be correlated with the degree of hepatic fibrosis present within
      different geographic sites in the cirrhotic liver. Tissue samples will be obtained from the
      patient's liver explant as well as hilar lymph nodes. Upon the removal of the cirrhotic liver
      at the time of transplantation, the explant will be biopsied multiple times in different
      segments of the liver and preserved for viral detection studies as well as analysis of the
      degree of fibrosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be obtained for viral
      detection at the time of transplantation. Serum HCV RNA levels will also be obtained at 1
      month, 3 months and 6 months post liver transplantation.

      Study Hypotheses:

        -  Virological relapse or non-response is higher is patients with cirrhosis due to failure
           of antiviral medication to concentrate adequately in a fibrotic liver having an altered
           sinusoidal micro-architecture

        -  HCV may persist in different geographic regions of the fibrotic liver in part predicated
           on blood supply to that area and this may have an effect on overall virological
           response. These differences in viral persistence and detection may exist in different
           lobes of the liver or even within a few centimeters within the same portion of the liver
           parenchyma.

        -  PBMC and hilar lymph nodes may be extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV viral persistence in
           patients receiving antiviral therapy and may account for virological relapse
           post-therapy

        -  There may be varying degrees of fibrosis within the same cirrhotic liver which may
           impact on hepatic synthetic function and antiviral response to treatment.

    <description>To assess the degree of hepatic fibrosis at the site of intrahepatic HCV viral detection in order to ascertain whether HCV viral detection correlates with the degree of fibrosis. This study will also examine whether there can be different degrees of hepatic fibrosis in different geographic portions of the same liver and whether there would be a correlation with the patients' natural MELD score, degree of hepatic synthetic function and ultimate virological response to antiviral therapy.</description>
