      This research attempts to better understand the altered and preserved memory mechanisms in
      Alzheimer disease, particularly to better apprehend learning implicit memory processes, and
      give a scientific support to non-pharmalogical interventions. At the present time, it is
      possible to delay the emergence of the symptoms related to this disease, eventually to
      decrease it, but not to cure it. Yet, care these patients became a crucial question and the
      solutions proposed to healthy aging people are not appropriate for Alzheimer patients who
      present specific disorders. The improvement of the quality of life of the institutionalized
      patients lies on a better comprehension of their disorders but also of their preserved
      abilities. The literature testifies of a great heterogeneity in the clinical expression of
      this disease, however we noticed two constants with regard to the capabilities generally
      announced as being preserved, on one hand, the implicit memory, and on the other hand the
      artistic aptitudes, and more particularly musical capabilities.

      Patients with Alzheimer disease present a particularly severe and early deterioration of
      episodic memory. Thus, at the beginning of the disease the explicit acquisition of new
      knowledge becomes increasingly difficult. However, some clinical observations, such as new
      learning of unknown songs, even with patients at a severe stage of the illness, seem to
      support the assumption of a preservation of some implicit learning abilities. Indeed, several
      studies already showed preserved implicit memory capabilities among patients with Alzheimer
      disease, mostly at the beginning stage of the illness: preserved effects of perceptual
      priming, procedural learning. Thus, we are mainly interested by the effects of exposure and
      the rising of a feeling of familiarity, both showing preserved implicit learning abilities,
      for moderate to severe Alzheimer patients. However, no study was carried out to date using
      the neuroimaging techniques, among Alzheimer patients at a moderated to severe stage of
      illness, with the main objective to identify the cerebral substrates implied in the learning
      of new knowledge.

      Indeed, several studies already showed preserved implicit memory capabilities among patients
      with Alzheimer disease, mostly were performed at the beginning stage of the illness and none
      of them have studied theses learning abilities for moderate to severe Alzheimer patients.

      The objective of this work is to specify, in severe form of Alzheimer disease, the cognitive
      mechanisms allowing the memorizing (feeling of familiarity) of new information and thus to
      highlight neural networks underlying this learning process (recently learned stimuli vs old
      stimuli). The goal is to propose a positive image of the Alzheimer patients, in understanding
      which cognitive mechanisms and cerebral areas allow these learning capabilities.

      20 patients Alzheimer at a moderate to severe stage, 20 patients at a mild to moderate stage
      of the illness, and 20 healthy aging participants, are selected after a neurological
      interview and a neuropsychological evaluation. The whole of the included participants take
      part of the experimental protocol organized in two phases: - the phase of familiarization and
      the phase of test. The phase of familiarization consists of the repeated exposure (daily
      session before the MRI acquisition) of new songs and new painting until obtaining a high
      feeling of familiarity for each item. The phase of test is carried out in the 3T MRI camera,
      it comprises an anatomical (T1, T2 MRI) and a functional acquisitions. The functional
      acquisition corresponds to a passive listening and seeing tasks of musical and pictorial
      stimuli. Finally, all participants realize a debriefing phase that allows obtaining a
      feedback on the familiarity of stimuli presented during the functional acquisition.
