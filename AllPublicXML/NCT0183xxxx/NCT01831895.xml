      To evaluate the safety and performance of the MobiusHD system in subjects with resistant
      hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, first-in-man clinical trial to be conducted inside the
      United States. Eligible subjects with stage 2 resistant systemic arterial hypertension
      currently being treated with a minimum of three (3) anti-hypertensive drugs, who consent to
      study participation will be assigned to treatment with the MobiusHD system.

      Potential study participants will be consented and then screened at two (2) baseline visits
      beginning at least 30 days prior to MobiusHD placement. Qualified patients will undergo
      placement of the MobiusHD under angiographic visualization, and will then be followed for 36
      months.

             anti-hypertensive medications, of which at least one (1) must be a diuretic. Any
             combination medications will be counted per the active ingredient. (For example,
             Zestoretic (Lisinopril +HCTZ) equals two (2) anti-hypertensive medications)
