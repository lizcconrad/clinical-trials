      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Boston Scientific's
      Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system in the treatment of patients with with advanced,
      levodopa-responsive bilateral Parkinson's disease (PD) which is not adequately controlled
      with medication.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of bilateral idiopathic PD (H&amp;Y ≥ 2) with a duration of PD ≥ 5 years.

          -  Persistent disabling Parkinson's disease symptoms or drug side effects (e.g.,
             dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, or disabling &quot;off&quot; periods) despite optimal medical
             therapy.

          -  Able to understand the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides
             written informed consent before any study-specific tests or procedures are performed.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any intracranial abnormality or medical condition that would contraindicate DBS
             surgery.

          -  Have any significant psychiatric condition likely to compromise the subject's ability
             to comply with requirements of the study protocol

          -  Any other active implanted devices including neurostimulators and /or drug delivery
             pumps

          -  Any previous thalamotomy, pallidotomy or subjects who have undergone a DBS procedure.

          -  Have any significant medical condition that is likely to interfere with study
             procedures or likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints.

          -  A female who is breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential with a positive urine
             pregnancy test or not using adequate contraception.
