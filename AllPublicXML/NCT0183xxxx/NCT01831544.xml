      This multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm trial will investigate the safety
      and performance of the Miniaturized Ventricular Assist Device (MVAD®) system over 24 months
      in subjects with advanced heart failure. The primary endpoint is survival at 6 months
      presented as a simple proportion (subjects alive on the MVAD® pump divided by endpoint
      eligible subjects). Secondary endpoints include the incidence of bleeding, incidence of major
      infections (per INTERMACS definitions), time to death, incidence of all device failures and
      device malfunctions, Health Status improvement, and Functional status improvement. Safety
      measures will include the frequency and rates of adverse events, overall and for each
      specific event, which will be collected throughout VAD support.
