      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate equivalence in exposure to insulin glargine given as test formulation T and
      reference formulation R in steady state conditions after 6 once-daily subcutaneous (SC) doses

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess relative Pharmacodynamic activity of the insulin glargine test formulation T
           to the insulin glargine reference formulation R in steady state conditions after 6
           once-daily SC doses

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the test and reference formulations of two new
           insulin glargine formulations

      Total study duration per subject: 29 to 64 days including screening visit

      Duration of each part of the study for one subject:

        -  Screening: 3 to 21 days before 1st dosing (Day -21 to Day -3)

        -  Treatment Period 1 and 2: 8 days (dosing on 6 days)

        -  Washout between last/1st dosing days of the treatment periods: 7-21 days (preferentially
           7 days) End-of-Study Visit: 7-10 days after last dosing
