      The main objective of this study is to determine recommended phase II dose and safety of
      tetrathiomolybdate (TM) in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in chemo-naive
      metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

      Platinum resistance is a major limitation in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. Previous studies suggest that reduced tumor platinum levels may significantly
      contribute to platinum resistance and thus poor outcome following platinum-based chemotherapy
      in lung cancer.

      Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a fast-acting copper chelator that has been under significant
      investigation as an anti-cancer strategy due to its anti-angiogenic property. Furthermore,
      more recent preclinical evidence suggests that combining TM with platinum drugs resulted in
      higher intratumoral platinum concentration and greater tumor response. The oncologists at the
      University of Rochester are studying addition of TM to commonly used 1st line platinum-based
      doublet, carboplatin/pemetrexed, in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

    <description>Dose Escalation - Dose level -1: 20 mg TM orally 3 x daily x 21 days in combination with carboplatin IV area under the curve (AUC) = 6 and pemetrexed IV 500/mgm2 day 1 x 1 cycle.
Dose level 1: 40 mg TM orally 3 x daily x 21 days in combination with carboplatin IV AUC = 6 and pemetrexed IV 500 mg/m2 day 1 x 1 cycle.
Dose level 2: 60 mg TM orally 3 x daily x 21 days in combination with carboplatin IV AUC = 6 and pemetrexed IV 500 mg/m2 day 1 x 1 cycle.
Patients in the dose-expansion cohort will continue on carboplatin and pemetrexed (without TM) at the discretion of the treating physician.
Dose Expansion - Maximum tolerated dose of TM determined from the dose-escalation cohorts combined with carboplatin IV AUC = 6 and pemetrexed IV 500 mg/m2 day 1 x 4 cycles.</description>
