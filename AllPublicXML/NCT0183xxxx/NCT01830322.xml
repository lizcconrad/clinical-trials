    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients
      with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary outcome measure is Overall Survival (OS). The
      secondary outcome measures are: changes in CA 19-9, Quality of Life (QOL), Progression-Free
      Survival (PFS), and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from dose-escalated Phase I trials indicate that CPI-613 is safe and effective against
      metastatic pancreatic cancer (Lee et al. 2012; Retter et al. 2012). Accordingly, this Phase
      II trial is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Primary Outcome Measure:

      - Overall Survival (OS)

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Changes in CA 19-9

        -  Quality of Life (QOL) assessment

        -  Progression-Free Survival (PFS)

        -  Safety

    <description>CA 19-9 is monitored through blood work ≤2 weeks before treatment and after every third cycle (12 weeks) of treatment while on-study. CA 19-9 is a pancreatic tumor biomarker and a decline in CA 19-9 during and after therapy may be a marker of treatment efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Monitored before, during, and 1-week after treatment with CPI-613, for an expected average of 20 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>QOL will be assessed as described by Aaronson NK, et al. 1993. It assesses how the various treatments and the disease affect the daily living abilities of the patient.</description>

    <time_frame>Monitored just before study treatment, and during study treatment at the end of every 4-week treatment cycle, for an expected average of 20 weeks.</time_frame>

    <description>This arm is for patients that have failed, or are not eligible for, all available therapies INCLUDING gemcitabine-based therapies. CPI-613 drug product, provided in concentrated form at 50 mg/mL, must be diluted with D5W prior to administration. CPI-613 is to be infused intravenously (IV) via a central venous catheter. CPI-613 will be given 2x weekly, administered on Days 1 and 4 of each of the 3 treatment weeks, followed by a week of rest. The dose of CPI-613 will be 3,000 mg/m2 infused IV over 2 hours (this is approximate maximum tolerated dosing [MTD]), via a central venous catheter with D5W running at a rate of about 125-150 mL/hr.</description>

    <description>This arm is for patients that have failed, or are not eligible for, all available therapies INCLUDING gemcitabine-based therapies.

    <description>This arm is for patients who have failed, or are not eligible for, all available therapies EXCEPT gemcitabine-based therapies. When gemcitabine and CPI-613 are administered in combination, gemcitabine will be administered via 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion at a concentration of 1,000 mg/m2 once-a-week on Day 1 for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a week-of-rest. CPI-613 will be infused twice a week, administered on Days 1 and 4 for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a week-of-rest, the same as gemcitabine. The dose of CPI-613 will be 710 mg/m2 infused IV over 2-hours (this is approximate maximum tolerated dosing [MTD] found from Phase I studies in combination with gemcitabine). To note, the dose of CPI-613 may be increased from 710 mg/m2 if ongoing Phase I trial data shows that the MTD of CPI-613 is higher than 710 mg/m2 CPI-613, diluted with D5W.</description>
