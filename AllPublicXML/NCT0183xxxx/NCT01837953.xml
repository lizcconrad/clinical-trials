  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge Eating Disorder (BED) affects as many as 3% of women and men in Ontario, 8% of obese
      individuals, and 30% to 50% of those participating in weight loss programs. BED, the most
      common eating disorder, is characterized by over-eating with loss of control (i.e., binge
      eating), but with no purging (e.g., vomiting).Our previous research indicates that the total
      health care costs for women with BED is 36% higher than the Canadian average for women of a
      similar age, and that health care costs significantly decreased following intensive treatment
      at our Centre. The main goal of our study is to inform the development of a stepped care
      approach to the treatment of BED. Stepped care involves providing easily accessible low
      intensity treatment first, and then providing more expensive intensive treatment second, if
      necessary. The second goal is to assess if a second more intensive step of treatment provides
      added value. Although stepped care for BED is suggested by a number of clinicians and
      researchers, no study adequately tests predictors of who might benefit from minimal treatment
      alone and who would require the more intensive second step. The results of this study will
      guide decision making regarding who benefits from stepped care, and will help to increase the
      accessibility, availability, and cost effectiveness of psychological treatments for BED.

    <measure>Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one and a half years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one and a half years</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report measure. The PHQ-9 is used in assessing the severity of depressive symptomology and can act as a diagnostic tool (Kroenke et al., 2001).</description>

    <measure>Rapid Response to Treatment: Self-Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of the start of unguided self-help to the end of self-help (Up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self monitoring of binge eating is an indicator of rapid response to USH, which is a predictor of USH outcome. Daily record sheets will be used to assess objective binge eating episodes on an on-going basis throughout the course of USH. In each daily record, participants record whether they had any overeating behaviors (including objective binge episodes) and how many. The daily record forms provide a definition of objective binge episodes based on the EDE definition. These definitions will be reviewed with participants at the start of USH.</description>

    <description>The ECR-S, a predictor of USH outcome, is a 12-item measure comprising two 6-item scales (Avoidance and Anxiety). Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = Disagree Strongly to 7 = Agree Strongly. The ECR-S was derived from the full ECR scale which was derived from existing self-report adult romantic attachment measures.</description>

    <measure>Therapeutic Factors Inventory (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of Group Psychodynamic Interpersonal Psychotherapy (GPIP) to the end of GPIP (Up to 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The full 99-item TFI will not be used in its entirety but rather the 9-item subscale of cohesiveness will only be used to measure levels of group cohesion throughout GPIP. It is a 7-point Likert-type scale with responses ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).</description>

    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination - Questionnaire (EDE-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one and a half years</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-Q, an outcome scale, is a 28-item self-report measure modeled on the EDE interview (Fairburn &amp; Cooper, 1993). The EDE-Q Restraint scale measures dietary restraint, Eating Concern scale measures concern about eating, Shape Concern scale measures preoccupation with one's body shape, and Weight Concern scale measures preoccupation with one's body weight (Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 1994)). The EDE-Q also provides a single overall score of eating disorder psychopathology based on the scales.</description>

    <description>For those participants randomized to the USH + Group Psychodynamic Interpersonal Psychotherapy (GPIP) condition, this intervention will consist of 16 weekly 90 minute sessions of GPIP. GPIP was developed and empirically tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at our Centre. GPIP will be preceded by an individual pre-group preparation session conducted by a psychologist trained in GPIP to orient the patient to the therapy. Patients are given a rationale for the treatment. Examples of the patient's cyclical relational patterns (CRPs) that may underlie their symptoms are discussed and the patient will be encouraged to work on these in the groups. Therapists will be given a written summary of each patient's CRP.</description>

    <intervention_name>Unguided Self-Help</intervention_name>
    <description>All participants will first receive 10 weeks of Unguided Self-help. The USH will be based on Dr. Christopher Fairburn's CBT-oriented and evidence based self-help treatment plan for binge eating explained in his book, Overcoming Binge Eating. The USH program follows six steps: (1) Getting Started: Self-monitoring, weekly weighing; (2) Regular Eating: Establishing a pattern of regular eating; (3) Alternatives to Binge Eating: Substituting alternative activities; (4) Problem Solving and Taking Stock: Practicing problem solving and reviewing progress; (5) Dieting and Related Forms of Avoidance: Tackling the three forms of dieting and other forms of avoidance eating; and (6) What Next? Preventing relapse and dealing with other problems.</description>
