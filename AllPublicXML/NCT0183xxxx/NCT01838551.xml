      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of ascending doses of
      COR-003 in subjects with elevated levels of cortisol due to endogenous Cushing's Syndrome by
      assessment of reduction in Urinary Free Cortisol (UFC) concentrations and to identify the
      range of safe and effective doses of COR-003 that reduce mean UFC concentrations ≤ULN (upper
      limit of normal) of the assay at month 6 of the maintenance phase of dosing without a prior
      dose increase in that phase.

      This will be a single period, open-label, dose titration study to assess efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and PK of COR-003 in subjects with CS. The trial design will identify both the
      minimally effective and maximally tolerated doses in this CS population. Following an initial
      screening period, this study will be conducted in 2 treatment phases as follows:

        -  Dose titration phase: approximately 2 to 16 weeks to achieve an effective and tolerable
           maximum dose (the therapeutic dose)

        -  Maintenance phase: 6 months of treatment at the therapeutic dose without a prior dose
           increase following the establishment of the appropriate dose identified in the titration
           phase;

        -  Extended evaluation phase: 6 months of continued treatment after the maintenance phase
           (6 - 12 months); dose adjustments will be allowed as required for treatment

      Efficacy will be assessed by measuring UFC concentrations at specified times as described in
      the clinical protocol.

      Blood samples for the PK determination will be collected at the times indicated in the
      clinical protocol.

      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety of the drug
      throughout the study. The constituents of the DSMB membership and a adjudication committee is
      specifically described in the clinical protocol.

      Subjects completing the 6-month maintenance phase of the study will remain in the study for
      an additional 6 months for extended evaluations.

      COR-003 will be provided under a compassionate use protocol for subjects who wish to continue
      treatment with COR-003.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all the following criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 years of age

          2. Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures being
             performed; eligible subjects must be able to understand the informed consent form
             prior to inclusion into the study.

          3. Confirmed diagnosis of newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent CD if subjects are not
             candidates for surgery or radiotherapy CD is defined according to the criteria in the
             Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for diagnosis of CD (Nieman 2008).
             Previous medical records will be collected and used to support the diagnosis of CD.

             Specifically, CD is defined as

               -  Mean 24-hour UFC level of ≥1.5X ULN on repeated determination

               -  Morning plasma corticotropin (ACTH) level of 5 ng/L (1.1 nmol /L) or more

               -  Either MRI confirmation of pituitary macroadenoma, or inferior petrosal sinus
                  gradient &gt;3 after corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation for those
                  patients with a microadenoma, or for subjects who have had prior pituitary
                  surgery, histopathology confirming and ACTH-staining adenoma. If inferior
                  petrosal sampling had been performed without CRH, then a central to peripheral
                  pre-stimulation gradient &gt;2 is required

          4. Confirmed diagnosis of newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent endogenous CS of other
             etiology if subjects are not candidates for surgery or radiotherapy. CS will be
             defined according to the criteria in the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline
             for diagnosis of CS (Nieman 2008). Previous medical records will be collected and used
             to support the diagnosis, and the differentiation of the cause of CS, specifically

               -  Mean 24-hour UFC level of ≥1.5X ULN on repeated determination

               -  Ectopic ACTH secretion, not of pituitary origin

               -  Ectopic CRH secretion

               -  Adrenal-dependent CS (adrenal adenoma, adrenal autonomy)

               -  Etiology unknown

          5. Subjects MUST have elevated mean 24-hour UFC levels ≥1.5X ULN of assay based on a
             minimum of four measurements from adequately collected urine. Urine may be collected
             on sequential days.

          6. In addition to elevated mean UFC, presence of abnormal values from one of the
             following tests:

               -  Abnormal DST: Elevated 8 AM serum cortisol ≥1.8 ug/dL (50 nmol/L) after 1 mg
                  dexamethasone orally at 11 PM the evening prior (if not conducted already in the
                  diagnostic workup of the subject within the previous 2 months before start of
                  Screening Phase; in that case previous test results and details of conduct will
                  need to be available by the Baseline visit)

               -  Elevated late night salivary cortisol concentrations (at least two measurements)
                  &gt;ULN NOTE: For subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR as
                  determined by Modified Diet in Renal Disease MDRD equation) &gt;40 and &lt;60
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 in addition to meeting the UFC criteria, late night salivary
                  cortisol test results (≥2 measurements) MUST also demonstrate evidence of CS.

          7. Previously irradiated subjects with CD or CS of other etiology will be allowed as long
             as the radiation treatment occurred &gt; 4 years ago and subjects have not exhibited
             evidence for improvement in their underlying Cushing's disease for 6 months. The total
             number of previously irradiated subjects enrolled in this study will not exceed 10.

          8. Subjects with CD or CS of other etiology who are not candidates for surgery, refuse
             surgery, or in whom surgery will be delayed for &gt;6 months. Subjects may be allowed to
             participate in the trial while awaiting surgery, but must agree to complete this study
             prior to surgery. For subjects who have already undergone surgery, a minimum of 3
             months should have elapsed before the subject can be deemed a surgical failure.

          9. Subjects on treatment for CD or endogenous CS of other etiology for whom treatment has
             been inadequate or not well tolerated must agree to the following minimum washout
             periods prior to the Baseline Visit:

               -  Inhibitors of steroidogenesis (including ketoconazole): 2 weeks

               -  Dopamine agonists: bromocriptine (2 weeks), cabergoline (8 weeks)

               -  Octreotide acetate LAR and lanreotide Autogel®: 12 weeks

               -  Lanreotide SR/long-acting pasireotide: 8 weeks

               -  Octreotide acetate (immediate release formulation) or short-acting pasireotide: 1
                  week

               -  Mifepristone (RU 486): 4 weeks

         10. Subjects on megesterol acetate (medroxyprogesterone acetate) must agree to a washout
             period of at least 6 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit

         11. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:

             Non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile
             females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral
             oophorectomy or tubal ligation.

             Post-menopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with
             an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone
             replacement therapy. However in questionable cases, a blood sample with FSH &gt; 40MIU/ml
             and estradiol &lt; 40pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory.
