      Background:

      - Oculocutaneous albinism, type 1B (OCA1B) is a genetic disease caused by problems in the
      gene that makes tyrosine. Tyrosine is an amino acid needed to produce pigment in the skin,
      hair, and eyes. People with OCA1B have pale skin, white hair, and light-colored eyes. Pigment
      in the back of the eye helps vision, so people with OCA-1B often have visual problems.
      Researchers want to see if a drug called nitisinone can help improve eye pigmentation and
      vision in people with OCA1B. Nitisinone is approved for treating a related genetic disease
      that causes problems with tyrosine, so it may help people with OCA1B.

      Objectives:

      - To see if nitisinone can help improve eye pigmentation and vision in people with OCA1B.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have OCA1B.

      Design:

        -  This study will last about 18 months. It requires eight outpatient visits, each about 3
           months apart. Each visit will require 1 to 2 days of testing.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, eye exam, and medical history. They
           will have additional vision and neurological tests. They will be tested to see how their
           brain and retinas respond to light. They will also take hair and blood samples, and
           answer questions about diet.

        -  Participants will receive the study drug. They will take one pill a day for 1 year. They
           will keep track of the dose in a study diary.

        -  At the outpatient visits, participants will have the following tests:

        -  Medical history and physical exam

        -  Neurological and eye exams

        -  Retina function tests

        -  Tests of the skin and brain's response to light

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Dietary consultation

        -  Visual function questionnaire.

        -  After the end of the study, participants will return to the care of their regular eye
           doctor.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate oral nitisinone as a treatment
      that improves ocular pigmentation in adult participants with oculocutaneous albinism, type 1B
      (OCA1B). Secondary objectives of this study are to determine whether the selected outcome
      measures are robust enough to use in a larger trial and to assess whether oral nitisinone
      improves visual function, skin pigmentation, and hair pigmentation in participants with
      OCA1B.

      Study Population: Five participants with OCA1B will be enrolled initially. However, up to an
      additional three participants may be enrolled to account for participants who withdraw from
      the study for any reason before the Month 12 visit.

      Design: In this pilot, phase 1/2, single-site, prospective, open label trial, participants
      will receive 2 mg of oral nitisinone daily for at least one year, and they will be followed
      for at least 18 months. Ocular and non-ocular data will be collected at least every three
      months, with the first follow-up visit occurring three months after the final baseline visit.
      Participants will be required to have at least 8 outpatient visits at the NEI clinic over a
      period of 18 months. This study has a common termination date and therefore may continue for
      up to four years.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for the study is the absolute mean change in iris
      pigmentation on an 8-point scale at 12 months as compared to baseline. Participants left and
      right eyes will be analyzed. The absolute mean change in iris pigmentation for each eye on an
      8-point scale at 3, 6 and 9 months compared to baseline will be assessed as secondary
      outcomes. Other secondary outcomes include the absolute and percent change in
      semi-quantitative iris pigmentation on image analysis; the absolute change in electronic
      visual acuity (EVA) for each eye and binocular vision; the absolute change in contrast
      sensitivity without glare, with medium glare, and with high glare for binocular vision; the
      absolute change in full-field ERG measures for each eye; and the absolute and percent change
      in melanin content in skin using skin reflectometry at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months as compared to
      baseline; Qualitative changes in hair, skin, and fundus pigmentation at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
      as compared to previous visit will be assessed. The absolute and percent change in hair
      melanin will also be assessed at 12 months as compared to baseline. The number and severity
      of adverse events and the number of withdrawals will be assessed as safety outcomes.

    <measure>Absolute Mean Change in Iris Pigmentation on an 8-point Iris Transillumination Scale at 12 Months as Compared to Baseline. Participants Left and Right Eyes Will be Analyzed.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>High-resolution (2544x1696) digital images of the anterior segment of both eyes were captured prior to pupil dilation using diffuse illumination and iris transillumination. An independent reviewer selected two transillumination images from each eye of each participant for each visit according to preset quality criteria. Images were coded, randomized and presented to a panel of 18 graders on a SHARP 90&quot; HD LED TV. After instruction and a practice dataset, graders scored each image using an 8-point scale. Graders could score images with a single decimal place if they felt an image fell in between two of the standards. The iris transillumination scale ranged from 0 to 8, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean across all graders and the two images for each participant's eye at baseline and 12 months was calculated; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline at 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change in Semi-quantitative Iris Pigmentation for Each Eye at 3 Months as Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>In Adobe Photoshop 7.0 the high resolution slit lamp image was divided into 4 quadrants with vertical and horizontal lines transecting the center of the iris. Using the elliptical marquee tool, a circle, approximately 0.25 times the diameter of the iris, was drawn in the center of each quadrant. Gaussian blur with radius of 50 was applied to the area enclosed in the 4 circles. With the dropper tool, the red pigment value corresponding to the degree of iris transillumination was sampled at the center of each circle. The 4 values were averaged to yield a composite transillumination score for each subject. Quantified values were then correlated to a scale score from 1 to 8 to generate an 8-point iris transillumination scale, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean score across the 2 images for each participant's eye was calculated at baseline and 3 months; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change in Contrast Sensitivity Without Glare at 3 Months Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gratings, images with alternating light and dark bars, assess contrast sensitivity via spatial frequency and contrast. Spatial frequency (SF), the number of pairs of bars (1 light, 1 dark) imaged within a given distance of the retina, is measured as the number of cycles per degree (cpd) of visual angle, where a cycle is 1 pair of bars. Grating of high SF corresponds to narrow bars; grating of low SF corresponds to wide bars. Contrast is the intensity difference between light and dark bars. The minimum contrast required to detect a given SF is the threshold contrast. The lower the threshold contrast, higher the contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity without glare was measured at frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Absolute change from baseline to 3 months was calculated. Raw values were used for the planned descriptive analysis; logarithmic transformation was not used as formal statistical analysis was not planned and was not appropriate as a majority of the raw values were 0.</description>

Grating of high SF corresponds to narrow bars; grating of low SF corresponds to wide bars. Contrast is the intensity difference between light and dark bars. Minimum contrast required to detect a given SF is the threshold contrast. The lower the threshold contrast, higher the contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity with medium glare was measured at frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Absolute change from baseline to 9 months was calculated. Raw values were used for the planned descriptive analysis; logarithmic transformation was not used as formal statistical analysis was not planned and was not appropriate as a majority of the raw values were 0.</description>

    <description>Microflash 200D is a diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer that uses a prism photodiode to provide information at 10 nm increments along the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm. Percent reflectance (PR) at a specific wavelength was placed into context by relating it to the reflectance of a blank at the equivalent wavelength (i.e. relating the object's reflectance to the maximum reflectance possible). Apparent absorbance (AA) at a given wavelength was determined as log10 (PR of blank/PR of object) at that wavelength. Adjusted Melanin (AM) index is calculated as the slope of AA levels from 650 to 700 nm. Lower values of AM index correspond to higher melanin concentrations. Measurements were collected 5 times at each visit from each of the following sites: forehead, inner forearm, outer forearm, inner bicep and lower back. The mean of these five measurements was calculated at each visit. Absolute change from baseline was calculated using these mean values.</description>

        <title>Absolute Mean Change in Iris Pigmentation on an 8-point Iris Transillumination Scale at 12 Months as Compared to Baseline. Participants Left and Right Eyes Will be Analyzed.</title>
        <description>High-resolution (2544x1696) digital images of the anterior segment of both eyes were captured prior to pupil dilation using diffuse illumination and iris transillumination. An independent reviewer selected two transillumination images from each eye of each participant for each visit according to preset quality criteria. Images were coded, randomized and presented to a panel of 18 graders on a SHARP 90” HD LED TV. After instruction and a practice dataset, graders scored each image using an 8-point scale. Graders could score images with a single decimal place if they felt an image fell in between two of the standards. The iris transillumination scale ranged from 0 to 8, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean across all graders and the two images for each participant's eye at baseline and 12 months was calculated; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline at 12 months.</description>

        <description>High-resolution (2544x1696) digital images of the anterior segment of both eyes were captured prior to pupil dilation using diffuse illumination and iris transillumination. An independent reviewer selected two transillumination images from each eye of each participant for each visit according to preset quality criteria. Images were coded, randomized and presented to a panel of 18 graders on a SHARP 90” HD LED TV. After instruction and a practice dataset, graders scored each image using an 8-point scale. Graders could score images with a single decimal place if they felt an image fell in between two of the standards. The iris transillumination scale ranged from 0 to 8, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean across all graders and the two images for each participant's eye at baseline and 9 months was calculated; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline at 9 months.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Semi-quantitative Iris Pigmentation for Each Eye at 3 Months as Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>In Adobe Photoshop 7.0 the high resolution slit lamp image was divided into 4 quadrants with vertical and horizontal lines transecting the center of the iris. Using the elliptical marquee tool, a circle, approximately 0.25 times the diameter of the iris, was drawn in the center of each quadrant. Gaussian blur with radius of 50 was applied to the area enclosed in the 4 circles. With the dropper tool, the red pigment value corresponding to the degree of iris transillumination was sampled at the center of each circle. The 4 values were averaged to yield a composite transillumination score for each subject. Quantified values were then correlated to a scale score from 1 to 8 to generate an 8-point iris transillumination scale, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean score across the 2 images for each participant's eye was calculated at baseline and 3 months; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline.</description>

Quantified values were then correlated to a scale score from 1 to 8 to generate an 8-point iris transillumination scale, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean score across the 2 images for each participant's eye was calculated at baseline and 9 months; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Semi-quantitative Iris Pigmentation for Each Eye at 12 Months as Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>In Adobe Photoshop 7.0 the high resolution slit lamp image was divided into 4 quadrants with vertical and horizontal lines transecting the center of the iris. Using the elliptical marquee tool, a circle, approximately 0.25 times the diameter of the iris, was drawn in the center of each quadrant. Gaussian blur with radius of 50 was applied to the area enclosed in the 4 circles. With the dropper tool, the red pigment value corresponding to the degree of iris transillumination was sampled at the center of each circle. The 4 values were averaged to yield a composite transillumination score for each subject. Quantified values were then correlated to a scale score from 1 to 8 to generate an 8-point iris transillumination scale, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean score across the 2 images for each participant's eye was calculated at baseline and 12 months; these mean grades were then used to calculate absolute change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Semi-quantitative Iris Pigmentation for Each Eye at 9 Months as Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>In Adobe Photoshop 7.0 the high resolution slit lamp image was divided into 4 quadrants with vertical and horizontal lines transecting the center of the iris. Using the elliptical marquee tool, a circle, approximately 0.25 times the diameter of the iris, was drawn in the center of each quadrant. Gaussian blur with radius of 50 was applied to the area enclosed in the 4 circles. With the dropper tool, the red pigment value corresponding to the degree of iris transillumination was sampled at the center of each circle. The 4 values were averaged to yield a composite transillumination score for each subject. Quantified values were then correlated to a scale score from 1 to 8 to generate an 8-point iris transillumination scale, with lower scores reflective of greater iris pigmentation (melanin content). The mean score across the 2 images for each participant's eye was calculated at baseline and 9 months; these mean grades were then used to calculate percentage change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Contrast Sensitivity Without Glare at 3 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Gratings, images with alternating light and dark bars, assess contrast sensitivity via spatial frequency and contrast. Spatial frequency (SF), the number of pairs of bars (1 light, 1 dark) imaged within a given distance of the retina, is measured as the number of cycles per degree (cpd) of visual angle, where a cycle is 1 pair of bars. Grating of high SF corresponds to narrow bars; grating of low SF corresponds to wide bars. Contrast is the intensity difference between light and dark bars. The minimum contrast required to detect a given SF is the threshold contrast. The lower the threshold contrast, higher the contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity without glare was measured at frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Absolute change from baseline to 3 months was calculated. Raw values were used for the planned descriptive analysis; logarithmic transformation was not used as formal statistical analysis was not planned and was not appropriate as a majority of the raw values were 0.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Contrast Sensitivity Without Glare at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Gratings, images with alternating light and dark bars, assess contrast sensitivity via spatial frequency and contrast. Spatial frequency (SF), the number of pairs of bars (1 light, 1 dark) imaged within a given distance of the retina, is measured as the number of cycles per degree (cpd) of visual angle, where a cycle is 1 pair of bars. Grating of high SF corresponds to narrow bars; grating of low SF corresponds to wide bars. Contrast is the intensity difference between light and dark bars. The minimum contrast required to detect a given SF is the threshold contrast. The lower the threshold contrast, higher the contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity without glare was measured at frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Absolute change from baseline to 6 months was calculated. Raw values were used for the planned descriptive analysis; logarithmic transformation was not used as formal statistical analysis was not planned and was not appropriate as a majority of the raw values were 0.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Contrast Sensitivity With Medium Glare at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Gratings, images with alternating light and dark bars, assess contrast sensitivity via spatial frequency and contrast. Spatial frequency (SF), the number of pairs of bars (1 light, 1 dark) imaged within a given distance of the retina, is measured as the number of cycles per degree (cpd) of visual angle, where a cycle is 1 pair of bars. Grating of high SF corresponds to narrow bars; grating of low SF corresponds to wide bars. Contrast is the intensity difference between light and dark bars. Minimum contrast required to detect a given SF is the threshold contrast. The lower the threshold contrast, higher the contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity with medium glare was measured at frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Absolute change from baseline to 6 months was calculated. Raw values were used for the planned descriptive analysis; logarithmic transformation was not used as formal statistical analysis was not planned and was not appropriate as a majority of the raw values were 0.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Contrast Sensitivity With High Glare at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Gratings, images with alternating light and dark bars, assess contrast sensitivity via spatial frequency and contrast. Spatial frequency (SF), the number of pairs of bars (1 light, 1 dark) imaged within a given distance of the retina, is measured as the number of cycles per degree (cpd) of visual angle, where a cycle is 1 pair of bars. Grating of high SF corresponds to narrow bars; grating of low SF corresponds to wide bars. Contrast is the intensity difference between light and dark bars. Minimum contrast required to detect a given SF is the threshold contrast. The lower the threshold contrast, higher the contrast sensitivity. Contrast sensitivity with high glare was measured at frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Absolute change from baseline to 6 months was calculated. Raw values were used for the planned descriptive analysis; logarithmic transformation was not used as formal statistical analysis was not planned and was not appropriate as a majority of the raw values were 0.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Adjusted Melanin Index at 3 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Microflash 200D is a diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer that uses a prism photodiode to provide information at 10 nm increments along the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm. Percent reflectance (PR) at a specific wavelength was placed into context by relating it to the reflectance of a blank at the equivalent wavelength (i.e. relating the object’s reflectance to the maximum reflectance possible). Apparent absorbance (AA) at a given wavelength was determined as log10 (PR of blank/PR of object) at that wavelength. Adjusted Melanin (AM) index is calculated as the slope of AA levels from 650 to 700 nm. Lower values of AM index correspond to higher melanin concentrations. Measurements were collected 5 times at each visit from each of the following sites: forehead, inner forearm, outer forearm, inner bicep and lower back. The mean of these five measurements was calculated at each visit. Absolute change from baseline was calculated using these mean values.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Adjusted Melanin Index at 3 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Microflash 200D is a diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer that uses a prism photodiode to provide information at 10 nm increments along the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm. Percent reflectance (PR) at a specific wavelength was placed into context by relating it to the reflectance of a blank at the equivalent wavelength (i.e. relating the object’s reflectance to the maximum reflectance possible). Apparent absorbance (AA) at a given wavelength was determined as log10 (PR of blank/PR of object) at that wavelength. Adjusted Melanin (AM) index is calculated as the slope of AA levels from 650 to 700 nm. Lower values of AM index correspond to higher melanin concentrations. Measurements were collected 5 times at each visit from each of the following sites: forehead, inner forearm, outer forearm, inner bicep and lower back. The mean of these five measurements was calculated at each visit. Percent change from baseline was calculated using these mean values.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Melanin Index at 3 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Microflash 200D is a diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer that uses a prism photodiode to provide information at 10 nm increments along the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm. Percent reflectance (PR) at a specific wavelength was placed into context by relating it to the reflectance of a blank at the equivalent wavelength (i.e. relating the object’s reflectance to the maximum reflectance possible). Melanin (M) index was calculated as follows:
Eqn 1= [ (PR at 650nm + PR at 660nm + 0.5*PR at 640nm + 0.5*PR at 670nm)/3 ]/100; M index = 100*log (1/Eqn 1) Higher values of M index correspond to higher melanin concentrations. Measurements were collected 5 times at each visit from each of the following sites:forehead, inner forearm, outer forearm, inner bicep and lower back. The mean of these five measurements was calculated at each visit. Absolute change from baseline was calculated using these mean values.</description>

        <description>Microflash 200D is a diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer that uses a prism photodiode to provide information at 10 nm increments along the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm. Percent reflectance (PR) at a specific wavelength was placed into context by relating it to the reflectance of a blank at the equivalent wavelength (i.e. relating the object’s reflectance to the maximum reflectance possible). Melanin (M) index was calculated as follows:

        <title>Percent Change in Melanin Index at 12 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Microflash 200D is a diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer that uses a prism photodiode to provide information at 10 nm increments along the visual spectrum from 400 to 700 nm. Percent reflectance (PR) at a specific wavelength was placed into context by relating it to the reflectance of a blank at the equivalent wavelength (i.e. relating the object’s reflectance to the maximum reflectance possible). Melanin (M) index was calculated as follows:
Eqn 1= [ (PR at 650nm + PR at 660nm + 0.5*PR at 640nm + 0.5*PR at 670nm)/3 ]/100; M index = 100*log (1/Eqn 1) Higher values of M index correspond to higher melanin concentrations. Measurements were collected 5 times at each visit from each of the following sites:forehead, inner forearm, outer forearm, inner bicep and lower back. The mean of these five measurements was calculated at each visit. Percent change from baseline was calculated using these mean values.</description>
