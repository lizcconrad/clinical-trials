      The Study examines the molecular basis of food allergy. It explores the interaction between T
      cells, InKT cells and cytokines in the development of food allergy. The study also explores
      these factors in development of tolerance &quot;outgrowing&quot; food allergy. It will also explore the
      genetic factors that lead to the development of food allergy.

      The study examines all type of food allergy including IgE mediated reactions, Eosinophilic
      Esophagitis and Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food Allergy (FA) is a common pediatric atopic disease. Characteristically children affected
      by FA become sensitized to food in the first few months of life and spontaneously outgrow the
      disease by 5-6 years of age in about 80% of cases. At the present time, diagnosis of FA is
      made by a combination of history, skin testing and food challenge. The pathogenic mechanisms
      leading to food sensitization and subsequent spontaneous tolerance development are not
      understood.

        Inclusion Criteria for Study Group:

          1. Males or females age 1 month to 65 years.

          2. Diagnosis of Food Allergy. Food Allergy can be either IgE or non-IgE mediated food
             allergy including Eosinophilic Esophagitis and Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis.

        Inclusion Criteria for Control group:

          1. Age and sex matched patients without food allergies

          2. Sibling and parents of patients with food allergies

        Inclusion Criteria for Control group with atopy:

          1. Age and sex matched patients without food allergies

          2. Sibling and parents of patients with food allergies

          3. Patients with atopy

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Underlying disease or medical problem that is judged to serious or risky to allow 3
             ml/kg of blood to be drawn from a vein (such as serious anemia, cancer, poor vein
             abscess, serious infections).

          2. Subjects that do not meet the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations
             of these criteria will be reported in accordance with IRB policies and procedures
             study procedures.
