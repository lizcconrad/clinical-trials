  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ever expanding breast cancer survivor population urges the health care system to develop
      (cost-)effective screening and management of convalescent care needs that can be easily
      implemented in conventional follow-up care. Internet-delivered systems may be well-equipped
      to meet these demands. The aim of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of a
      web-based support system. Key features of this system are patient self-screening of physical
      and psychosocial problems, tailored patient education on reported problems and self-referral
      to professional care. In this era of high internet usage, we expect that internet is a highly
      suitable medium to provide tailored support for breast cancer patients and will empower the
      patient to take control over their convalescence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from 6 to 12 weeks follow-up in optimism and control over the future</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' optimism and control over the future will be measured by the subscale 'increased optimism and control over the future' of the 'Constructs Empowering Outcomes Questionnaire'. The subscale 'optimism and control over the future' represents a single concept/outcome measure. The concept cannot be assessed at baseline due to the retrospective nature of the questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Change from 6 to 12 weeks follow-up in knowledge level</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient knowledge level will be measured by the subscale 'being better informed' of the 'Constructs Empowering Outcomes Questionnaire'. The concept cannot be assessed at baseline due to the retrospective nature of the questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from 6 weeks to 12 weeks follow-up in acceptance of problems</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' acceptance of their problems will be measured by the subscale 'improved acceptance of the illness' of the 'Constructs Empowering Outcomes Questionnaire'. The concept cannot be assessed at baseline due to the retrospective nature of the questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 12 weeks follow-up in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Cancer-specific quality of life will be measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 12 weeks follow-up in psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological distress will be measured by the Dutch Distress Thermometer and Problem List.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A personalized website (username/password) will become available to patients assigned to the intervention arm for 12 subsequent weeks. Key features of the website are self-screening, tailored patient education and self-referral. Self-screening will be performed by an online version of the Dutch Distress thermometer (DT) and Problem List (PL). Patients will receive digital feedback on their DT score immediately after test completion together with information regarding problems reported on the PL, (self)help options and possibilities for referral to professional care. Contact information of one of the investigators will also be available to discuss questions, problems and/or referral needs. Patients may also request a telephone call.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to standard convalescent care will receive the usual follow-up care delivered by their treating oncologists. Patients will be referred to psychosocial or allied care by their oncologist and/or oncology nurse if certain physical and/or psychosocial problems require more in-depth professional care</description>
