  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective (SA) disorders are comprised of several debilitating
      symptoms. It was suggested that compounds with neuroprotective effects might be useful in the
      management of SZ/SA symptoms. Our previous clinical trials indicated significant beneficial
      effects for augmentations with two different neuroprotective agents: Pregnenolone and
      L-Theanine. Pregnenolone (PREG) is a neurosteroid, which displays multiple effects on the
      central nervous system. Our recent 8-week, randomized, double-blind trial among patients with
      chronic SZ/SA disorders, in which PREG versus placebo and DHEA was added to antipsychotics,
      yielded encouraging results: PREG augmentation demonstrated significant amelioration of
      positive symptoms, EPS, as well as an improvement in attention, and working memory
      performance of SZ/SA disorder patients (Ritsner et al 2010). L-Theanine is a unique amino
      acid present almost exclusively in the tea plant. It possesses neuroprotective,
      mood-enhancing, and relaxation activities. L-theanine augmentation to antipsychotic therapy
      can ameliorate positive, activation, and anxiety symptoms in SZ/SA disorder patients (grant #
      06TGF-911, (Ritsner et al 2010). This proposed study would extend our prior research with
      Pregnenolone and L-theanine by combining both agents versus placebo. We hypothesized that
      addition of both these compounds to ongoing antipsychotics would significantly improve the
      clinical status of SZ/SA patients.

      Methods: In an 8-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial a combination of
      PREG (50 mg/day) with L-theanine (400 mg/day) versus placebo will be added to the stable
      ongoing antipsychotic treatment of 200 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorders. This trial will be conducted at five sites in Israel. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. A battery of research
      instruments will be used for the assessment of psychopathology, side effects, general
      functioning and quality of life

    <textblock>
      This is a two-year randomized placebo-controlled double-blind investigation of the
      augmentation of PREG with L-theanine in the management of patients with SZ/SA. The study will
      consist of two phases: a 2-week continued stability (lead in) phase and an 8-week
      double-blind treatment phase. In the lead-in phase, patients receiving antipsychotic
      medication will remain on their maintenance regimen for at least two weeks. Clinical
      stability is defined as two consecutive weekly CGI ratings with no change in score, and with
      no more than a 20% change in PANSS total score. The treatment phase will be 8-week parallel
      groups, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of adjunctively administered PREG with
      L-theanine or placebo. Assignment to PREG with L-theanine or placebo will be on a random,
      stratified (i.e., FGAs/SGAs, inpatient/outpatient) basis. PREG (50 mg/day) with L-theanine
      (400 mg/day) and placebo will be administered in divided doses in the form of capsules. If a
      patient relapses during the treatment phase of the study, the patient will be removed from
      the study. All attempts will be made to obtain end-of-study ratings. If such measures cannot
      be obtained, four- and six-week data, if collected prior to relapse, will be informative.
      Patients who fulfill the entry criteria will enter the 8-week double-blind treatment phase of
      the study. Assignment to PREG with L-theanine or placebo will be on a random, stratified
      (i.e., conventional/new generation antipsychotic treatment, inpatient/outpatient) basis. PREG
      (50 mg/day) with L-theanine (400 mg/day)/placebo will be administered in divided doses in the
      form of white capsules. If a patient relapses during the treatment phase of the study, the
      patient will be removed from the study. All attempts will be made to obtain end-of-study
      ratings. If such measures cannot be obtained, four- and eight-week data, if collected prior
      to relapse, will be informative.

      Subjects will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment using
      psychiatric rating scales, and self-report questionnaires. Neurobiological (plasma cortisol,
      PREG, dehydroepiandrosterone, BDNF and other biologically active molecules) and immunological
      (the pro-inflammatory cytokines and others) testing will be conducted at baseline, and after
      treatment. The efficacy and safety of augmenting antipsychotic treatment of PREG with
      L-theanine will be analyzed.
