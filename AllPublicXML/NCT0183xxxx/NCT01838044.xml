  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with celecoxib and pregabalin together
      would prove to be more effective in relief of pain than treatment with celecoxib alone in
      people who have chronic low back pain with a probable neuropathic component.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant use of pregabalin and
      celecoxib compared with celecoxib monotherapy for the symptomatic relief of pain in patients
      with chronic low back pain with a probable neuropathic component.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Demonstrate the additional benefit of adding pregabalin to celecoxib monotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the concomitant use of pregabalin and celecoxib compared to celecoxib
           monotherapy in a set of patient reported measures (sleep, depression, anxiety, impact of
           pain in daily functions, patient's global impression of change and patient's perception
           of the treatment).

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of celecoxib and of the concomitant
           administration of pregabalin and celecoxib.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale - Sleep Disturbance Subscale at Week 5 and Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. With the exception of sleep adequacy, optimal sleep, and quantity, higher scores reflect greater impairment in the MOS-Sleep subscales. Sleep Disturbance: Range=0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater sleep disturbance. Negative changes indicate improvement.</description>

          <title>Arm A</title>
          <description>During Period 1, participants in Arm A were administered a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 150 mg (75 mg twice-daily [BID]) for 1 week followed by pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID) daily for the remaining 4 weeks (during Weeks 2, 3, 4 and 5). During Period 2, all participants were administered concomitant treatment of a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID). All participants completed a treatment taper (a) after completing the second study period or (b) after premature study discontinuation. During treatment taper, the pregabalin dose was decreased to 150 mg (75 mg BID) daily and participants had participated in a follow up visit for a final safety assessment.</description>

The BSW was administered by the investigator or designated site personnel in the local language as a standardized interview during the follow-up visits. The BSW can potentially be self-administered; however, this method of administration has not been tested. Participants completed this questionnaire at Visit 4 and Visit 6.</description>

During Period 2, all participants were administered concomitant treatment of a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID). All participants completed a treatment taper (a) after completing the second study period or (b) after premature study discontinuation. During treatment taper, the pregabalin dose was decreased to 150 mg (75 mg BID) daily and participants had participated in a follow up visit for a final safety assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) Anxiety Scores at Week 5 (Visit 4) and Week 10 (Visit 6)</title>
        <description>The HADS is a self-administered questionnaire measuring anxiety. Each subscale consists of 7 statements and the participants respond as to how each item applies to them on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = No anxiety, to 3 = Severe feelings of anxiety). Separate scores are calculated for each subscale and a score (ranging from 0 to 21) is obtained for each subscale. The higher the score the more severe the anxiety.</description>

During Period 2, all participants were administered concomitant treatment of a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID). All participants completed a treatment taper (a) after completing the second study period or (b) after premature study discontinuation. During treatment taper, the pregabalin dose was decreased to 150 mg (75 mg BID) daily and participants had participated in a follow up visit for a final safety assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI sf) - Pain Severity Index Score at Week 5 and Week 10</title>
        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during the past 24 hours. The Pain severity domain: The BPI severity domain includes pain at its ’worst,’ ’least,’ ’average,’ and ’now’ (current pain) on 0-10 NRS scales and takes the mean of these 4 items. Scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine), therefore higher scores indicate greater pain severity.</description>

        <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. With the exception of sleep adequacy, optimal sleep, and quantity, higher scores reflect greater impairment in the MOS-Sleep subscales. Sleep Disturbance: Range=0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater sleep disturbance. Negative changes indicate improvement.</description>

        <group group_id="E1">
          <title>Arm A</title>
          <description>During Period 1, participants in Arm A were administered a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 150 mg (75 mg twice-daily [BID]) for 1 week followed by pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID) daily for the remaining 4 weeks (during Weeks 2, 3, 4 and 5). During Period 2, all participants were administered concomitant treatment of a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID). All participants completed a treatment taper (a) after completing the second study period or (b) after premature study discontinuation. During treatment taper, the pregabalin dose was decreased to 150 mg (75 mg BID) daily and participants had participated in a follow up visit for a final safety assessment.</description>

          <title>Arm B</title>
          <description>During Period 1, participants in Arm B were administered a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg and placebo of pregabalin for 5 weeks (during Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). During Period 2, all participants were administered concomitant treatment of a daily fixed dose of celecoxib 200 mg once daily and pregabalin 300 mg (150 mg BID). Participants in Arm B were initiated on pregabalin 150 mg (75 mg BID) daily for 1 week, before pregabalin was up‑titrated to 300 mg (150 mg BID) daily. All participants completed a treatment taper (a) after completing the second study period or (b) after premature study discontinuation. During treatment taper, the pregabalin dose was decreased to 150 mg (75 mg BID) daily and participants had participated in a follow up visit for a final safety assessment.</description>
