  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of all US adults have trouble understanding and using health information, or low
      health literacy. Health literacy is considered to be an important patient safety issue, and
      has been linked to poor medication management. Low health literacy is a risk factor for
      parent errors in administering medications to their children; difficulty understanding
      provider medication instructions is likely to contribute to errors.

      To address these issues, bilingual (English/Spanish), low literacy, picture-based medication
      instruction sheets were developed. This study will look at the effectiveness and feasibility
      of the medication instruction sheet-based intervention as it is used by providers in 2
      pediatric emergency department settings, as part of a planned roll out of HELPix within the
      hospital system. The investigators hypothesize that there will be reduced medication dosing
      errors, improved medication adherence, reduced hospital revisit rates, and improved
      provider-parent communication. The investigators also hypothesize that provider technology
      experience, knowledge, and attitudes, will affect the extent to which providers use the tool.
