  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an intravenous lidocaine infusion (compared to
      placebo) intraoperatively will decrease time to return of bowel function postoperatively,
      decrease postoperative pain, diminish postoperative opioid requirement, minimize inflammatory
      markers and shorten time to discharge after colorectal surgery.

      Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic that has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.
      Lidocaine infusion is a very useful pain medication that is underutilized to treat surgical,
      chronic, and cancer pain in children. The investigators propose to examine the perioperative
      use of lidocaine infusion in children undergoing colorectal surgery that involves an
      abdominal incision. The investigators plan to measure the following outcomes: length of stay
      in hospital following abdominal surgery, postoperative pain scores, cumulative morphine
      consumption, incidences of opioid adverse-effects: respiratory depression, sedation, nausea,
      vomiting, time to passage of flatus, time to first bowel movement and end-tidal Sevoflurane
      in operating room throughout surgery. The following laboratory values will be measured:
      serial lidocaine levels of pharmacokinetics and safety levels, Pro- and anti-inflammatory
      cytokine measurements: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1RA and genetic variants.
