  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to estimate and compare the percentage of patients with
      abnormal glucose metabolism at 4-12 weeks postpartum between two groups: patients diagnosed
      with gestational diabetes before or after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Abnormal glucose metabolism
      is defined as type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance or impaired fasting glucose.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare between the two groups:

      A. the rate of type 2 diabetes only, glucose intolerance only, impaired fasting glucose only,
      and patients requiring insulin at 4-12 weeks postpartum

      B. rates of maternal and obstetric complications

      C. risk factors (age, body mass index, personal history of gestational diabetes or
      macrosomia, first degree family history of diabetes).

      D. For fasting glucose done before 24SA, we will calculate the optimal threshold for
      predicting abnormal glucose metabolism in the immediate postpartum period among women with
      gestational diabetes.
