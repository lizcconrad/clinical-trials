  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the accumulated knowledge regarding Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection increased
      substantially over the past years, several issues still deserve further investigation. The
      epidemiology of this disease has been changing, perhaps influenced by new immunosuppressive
      strategies currently used and growing and widespread use of prophylaxis. The knowledge of the
      CMV viral load kinetics, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR-based assay), among renal
      transplant recipients not receiving any prophylactic therapy will allow the determination of
      risk factors for and the impact of earlier intervention on CMV infection and disease. The
      goal is to ultimately improve the clinical outcomes for renal transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains one of the most common complications affecting organ
      transplant recipients, with significant morbidity and occasional mortality. The adverse
      impact of CMV infection on graft function underscores the importance of CMV on transplant
      outcomes.

      CMV prevention strategies have resulted in significant reductions in CMV disease and
      CMV-related mortality. The reduction in the incidence of &quot;indirect effects&quot; of CMV infection
      has also been attributed to the use of CMV prevention. Nevertheless, management of CMV
      infection varies considerably among transplant centers. Two major strategies are commonly
      used for prevention of CMV: universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy. Within each of
      these strategies, significant variation in clinical practice exists, including type of
      cellular or molecular diagnostics, antiviral therapies, monitoring and criteria for stopping
      treatment.

      Although the use of universal prophylaxis has increased since the availability of
      valganciclovir, there is still a debate regarding the superiority of this strategy over the
      preemptive approach. Furthermore, this costly therapy or any other CMV prophylaxis is
      currently not reimbursed by our unified public health system. Therefore our strategy has been
      to use preemptive therapy. Additionally, because we consider different immunosuppressive
      regimens according to pretransplant stratified evaluation of risk of rejection, only kidney
      transplant recipients at high risk to develop CMV infection or disease, i.e., negative
      recipients of positive organ donors, patients receiving induction therapy with thymoglobulin
      and patients treated for acute rejection undergo preemptive strategy. Using this strategy,
      our currently overall incidence of CMV infection or disease is currently 25%. This incidence
      is higher among recipients who received thymoglobulin induction, tacrolimus and mycophenolate
      maintenance combination or treatment for acute rejection with either high dose of
      corticosteroids or thymoglobulin.

      Because none of the kidney transplant recipients at our institution receive any prophylaxis
      for CMV infection and because immunosuppressive regimens are selected according to
      immunological rejection risk, this is the ideal population to investigate the natural history
      of CMV infection and disease using more recent, sensitive and specific molecular tolls.

    <description>Within each of these strategies, significant variation in clinical practice exists, including type of cellular or molecular diagnostics, antiviral therapies, monitoring and criteria for stopping treatment.We estimate that approximately 200 patients will be enrolled for this research. For this assessment we use monitoring for CMV replication:
Samples will be collected every week for up to 3 months for determination of antigenemia and viral load. Investigators will be blinded to the results of the PCR analyses, unless unblinding is clinically indicated.
Antigenemia test: Method: Antigen pp65 by indirect immunofluorescence. Reference: Zero Positive Cells /200.000 cells.
Viral load test: Method: Real Time PCR - TaqMan Result: &lt; 50 copies/mL Log: &lt; 1.70 Detection Limit: 50 copies/mL Observations: Viral loads above 100 copies/mL should be considered active replication. Range of 50 to 109 copies/ml.</description>
