      The purpose of this study is to determine if systemic cooling to a target temperature of 34
      to 35°C, started within 6 hours of symptom onset and maintained for 12 hours, improves
      functional outcome at 3 months in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

    <description>In patients randomised to therapeutic hypothermia, induction of cooling will be started by infusion of 4°C isotone saline or Ringer's lactate administered over a period of 30 to 60 minutes. A body temperature between 34.0 and 35.0°C will be targeted. Body temperature will be monitored through bladder or rectal thermal probes, and cooling procedures will be adapted to keep body temperature as close as possible to the target. Maintenance of body temperature in the target range will be performed with a surface or endovascular cooling device. After a cooling period of 24h, controlled rewarming to 36°C with a rate of 0.2°C/h will be started. After 36°C have been reached, the device will be disconnected.</description>
