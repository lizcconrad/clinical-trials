      This study will evaluate bimatoprost 0.01% (LUMIGAN® RC) in patients with elevated
      intraocular pressure (IOP) due to primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension
      (OHT) in a clinical setting.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperemia is engorgement of the blood vessels (redness) of the bulbar conjunctiva of the eye (the clear membrane covering the white surface of the eye). Hyperemia is graded on a 5 point scale where 0=none (normal), 0.5=trace (trace flush reddish pink), 1=Mild (mild flush reddish color), 2=Moderate (bright red color) and 3=severe (deep bright diffuse redness). Naive patients did not use glaucoma medication prior to study entry.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in IOP in the Study Eye of Previously Treated (Switched) Patients</title>
        <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. Previously treated patients used glaucoma medication prior to study entry and were switched from their previous therapy to study treatment. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in IOP (improvement), and a positive number change from baseline indicates an increase (worsening).</description>

        <description>Hyperemia is engorgement of the blood vessels (redness) of the bulbar conjunctiva of the eye (the clear membrane covering the white surface of the eye). Hyperemia is graded on a 5 point scale where 0=none (normal), 0.5=trace (trace flush reddish pink), 1=Mild (mild flush reddish color), 2=Moderate (bright red color) and 3=severe (deep bright diffuse redness). Previously treated patients used glaucoma medication prior to study entry and added study treatment as adjunctive therapy.</description>
