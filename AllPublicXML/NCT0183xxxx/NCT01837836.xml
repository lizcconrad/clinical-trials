    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the drinking water handling practices at household
      level and to determine the effect of health education on the drinking water handling.
      Participants from study villages, mainly homemakers, school children and water tank operators
      who are willing to participate, will be targeted.

      Baseline assessment of household practices related to water will be done. Followed by a
      health education regarding the healthy practices will be given to them. Practice of household
      water chlorination will be promoted. The healthy behavior will be reinforced through
      reminders and community activities of self help groups for one year.

      The study participants will be benefited from survey in terms of

        1. Improved knowledge and practices of drinking water handling

        2. Risk reduction of water borne illness to family members
