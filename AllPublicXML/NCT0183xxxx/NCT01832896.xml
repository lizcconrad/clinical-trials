  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      Subcutaneous (SC) dose of Ecallantide in children and adolescents with Hereditary Angioedema
      (HAE).

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of a single SC administration of ecallantide in up to approximately
      10 pediatric subjects with HAE during an initial acute attack. The study is planned to enroll
      subjects 2 through 15 years of age who present with an acute cutaneous, abdominal, or
      laryngeal HAE attack. No more than 3 study sites will be included until a goal of 10 patients
      is achieved.

      After treatment for an initial attack, one additional open label treatment with ecallantide
      will be offered to subjects contingent upon having been treated previously and presenting
      with a subsequent acute cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal attack of HAE at least 7 days
      after initial treatment. Open-label treatment for a second HAE attack will continue until 10
      patients have been treated for an initial attack. Safety evaluations will be performed at
      each subsequent ecallantide-treated attack as for the initial treated attack

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 2 through 15 years of age, inclusive (ie, from the second birthday through the day
             prior to the sixteenth birthday) at the time of the subject's first attack.

          2. Documented diagnosis of HAE type I or II. Diagnosis must be confirmed by a documented
             immunogenic (below the lower limit of normal) and/or functional (&lt; 50% of normal
             levels) C1- Inhibitor deficiency. Diagnosis may be on the basis of historic data or by
             diagnostic testing conducted at the time of screening.

          3. Informed consent (and subject assent as appropriate) signed by the subject's parent(s)
             or legal guardian(s).

          1. History of an adverse reaction (AE) to Ecallantide in the past

          2. Diagnosis of angioedema other than HAE

          3. Participation in another clinical study during the 30 days prior to treatment

          4. Any known factor/disease that might interfere with the treatment compliance, study
             conduct, or result interpretation

          5. Congenital or acquired cardiac anomalies that interfere significantly with cardiac
             function.

          6. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 7 days prior to
             treatment.
