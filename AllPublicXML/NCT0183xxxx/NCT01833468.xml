  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a group of rheumatic diseases Foot involvement of the
      SpA is common and enthesitis, erosive changes or ankylosis are the frequent lesions. The
      functional status of the SpA patients are usually evaluated globally.The aim of this study is
      to assess specifically the foot -related functional limitations of the SpA patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SpA patients who had foot pain at least for 4 weeks and those having bilateral
      anteroposterior and lateral feet x-rays will be included into the study. Foot x-rays will be
      evaluated by a radiologist by using the spondyloarthropathy tarsal radiographic index
      (SpA-TRI). The foot related functional status of the patients will be determined by the
      Turkish version of the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS).
