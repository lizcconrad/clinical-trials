      Chronic pain after Lichtenstein hernioplasty is a common problem with an incidence of 11%.
      Many factors influence the onset and persistence of pain. Mesh characteristics and fixation
      have been pointed as important etiologic factors. This study compares two types of fixation
      for the same mesh. The mesh used is a lightweight parietex mesh. In the control group this
      mesh will be fixed with non absorbable sutures. In the study group sutures will not be needed
      because of self gripping microhooks on the surface of the mesh.

      Methods: The HIPPO trial is a multicenter double blind randomized clinical trial. Patients
      will be randomly allocated to the sutured mesh or the self-gripping mesh. Hernia repair will
      be done according to Lichtenstein as described by Amid et all. Included will be all
      unilateral primary inguinal hernia in man patients aged 18 years or older not meeting the
      exclusion criteria. Patients will be followed for two years. The main endpoint is the amount
      of post-operative chronic pain evaluated by VAS scores. The existence of neuropathic pain
      will be evaluated by the Paindetect questionnaire (and a bedside variant of the QST).
      Secondary endpoints are recurrence rate, post-operative complications, costs, hospital stay,
      QOL, return to work and daily activities, genital and sexual problems. To demonstrate a
      difference in VAS score of 10 with Î±=0.05 and power 80% a sample size of 400 patients is
      calculated.

      Discussion: Hypothesized is that the self gripping non-sutured mesh (Parietex Progrip) will
      cause less post-operative and chronic pain without enhancing the recurrence rate.

      INTRODUCTION

      In 1984 Lichtenstein popularized routine use of a heavy weight polypropylene mesh fixed with
      non-absorbable sutures to create a tension-free hernioplasty. This technique became the gold
      standard in many clinics due to its low rate of recurrence and direct post-operative pain6.
      Focus has now shifted to the occurrence of chronic pain and neuralgia after Lichtenstein
      hernioplasty. Chronic post-operative pain has been defined as pain lasting more than 3 months
      after surgery. The surgical repair technique seems to be an important etiologic factor in
      this. This includes aspects like type of mesh used, manner of fixation of the prosthetic
      material and handling of the cutaneous nerves.

      The aim of this study is to investigate differences in incidence of chronic post-operative
      pain between the two types of fixation for the same mesh. The mesh used is ligthweight and
      made of polyester. The mesh will be fixated by either non-adsorbable sutures, according to
      Lichtenstein, or by small microhooks on the lower surface of the mesh (Parietex Progrip Mesh,
      Covidien).

      Rationale for the Parietex Progrip Mesh

      To reduce post-operative chronic pain it is thought being important to use low weight large
      pore size oligofilament meshes fixed with a minimal use of devices or no devices at all. This
      both to minimize compression/entrapment neuropathy and inflammation. The Parietex Progrip
      mesh biocompatibility is enhanced using low-weight monofilament isoelastic polyester with
      large pores. The hydrophilic characteristics of polyester are known to cause less shrinkage
      and fibrotic tissue formation than the more standard polypropylene.

      The need for fixating devices is bypassed by small absorbable microhooks (polyactid acid,
      PLA) on the surface of the Progrip Mesh. Mesh fixation by the micro hooks to the underlying
      groin tissue is achieved instantly after exerting light pressure on the mesh. The fixation by
      the micro-hooks is achieved for the fully mesh area in contrast to other meshes in which only
      the margins of the mesh are sutured. Therefore it is likely that there is less risk of
      movement or displacement of the hernial sac under the mesh. The PLA micro hooks will be
      completely resorbed after 15 months. Then the mesh is firmly connected to the groin bed by
      tissue ingrow. After resorption of the PLA only the low-weight (38 g/m2) monofilament
      polyester (PP) will be left in situ.

      The mesh has an oval shape with a self-gripping flap to be placed around the spermatic cord
      at the internal ring.

      A recently performed pilotstudy comparing the Parietene (made of polypropylene) Progrip mesh
      to the standard mesh in the clinic, a heavy weight sutured polypropylene mesh, revealed a
      significant lower incidence of chronic pain in the Parietene Progrip group (P=0.012).
      Recurrence rates were not different. Operation time was significantly shorter for the
      Parietene Progrip Mesh group.(p=0.002).

      METHODS

      Study objective

      The aim is to compare two types of fixation for the same mesh in inguinal hernia repair as
      described by Lichtenstein; a lightweight polyester mesh which has to be sutured will be
      compared to a lightweight polyester mesh with self-gripping properties not needing any
      fixating devices. It is already proved that lightweight meshes reduce the amount of foreign
      body reaction resulting in less chronic pain. The self fixing properties are believed to
      enhance this effect by minimizing entrapment of muscle and nerve fibres.

      Primary endpoint

      The primary endpoint is the amount of post-operative chronic groin pain. This will be
      evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Mc Gill Pain questionnaire. In a subgroup of
      50 patients the amount of pain en pain threshold before and after the hernioplasty will be
      objectified by quantitative sensory testing (QST).

      Secondary endpoints

      Secondary objectives are recurrence rate, per operative and post-operative complications,
      operating time, duration of hospital stay, costs, return to work and daily activities, QOL,
      genital and sexual problems.

      Study design

      The HIPPO trial is a multicenter double blind randomized clinical trial. Preoperative
      randomization will be done using an official randomisation program. All included study
      subjects will be registered in this program. On the day of surgery the operation assistant
      will login in the randomisation program and start the randomisation procedure for the patient
      to be operated. The outcome will appear in a couple of seconds and will be stored in a
      secured database. Which type of mesh is to be used will be known for the surgeon not earlier
      than preparation of the inguinal floor is finished and the surgeon is ready to place a mesh.
      In the case the patient is not sleeping during the operation it is possible that he notice
      whether the mesh is fixed with sutures or not. To be sure this will not happen patients who
      do not want to sleep will get an ear-radio and eye mask.

      The investigator assessing the outcome on the outpatient department will not be informed
      about the outcome of randomisation. Besides this, operation reports will not mention which
      type of mesh has been used. The randomisation code can be broken by the owner of the
      randomisation program, but only in case of a medical urgency and in order of a medical
      doctor.

      Patients

      Patients will be included on the outpatient clinic of the department of General Surgery of
      the departing hospitals. This will be done by surgeons and supervised residents. After
      inclusion patients have to sign informant consent and fill in a couple of questionnaires:
      SF36 (Short Form, measuring quality of life), McGill pain questionnaire, VAS, Dutch and
      Inguinal hernia questionnaire (to be validated). Follow-up will be at 2weeks, 3 months, 12
      months and 24 months post-operatively. For each follow-up visit patients have to complete the
      same questionnaires at home. Besides this they will be examined on the clinic for the
      detection of complications (eg recurrence, wound problems) and to perform sensibility tests.

      Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any
      consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent
      medical reasons

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Primary unilateral inguinal hernia

        -  Capacitated male person

        -  Age â¥ 18 years

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Concurrent femoral hernia

        -  Incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia

        -  ASA 4 or ASA 5

        -  Impaired adequate follow up

        -  Participation in another trial

      Sample size calculation

      The primary endpoint is the VAS score. A difference of 10 in post-operative Visual Analogue
      Scale score between the intervention and control group is considered to be the minimum
      relevant clinical difference. According to the power analyse, 169 patients per treatment
      group are needed to achieve this with a power of 80% with an alpha of 5%. The calculation was
      made with a two-sided test for the VAS pain score at 3 months. Based on the pilotstudie the
      standard deviation was set at 20.

      Statistical comparison will be made using the Wilcoxon test for continuous data and the
      Pearson chi squared test for ordinal data. The Wilcoxon test will also be used to analyse the
      SF36 scores and nominal operative parameters. P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.

      Ethics, informed consent

      The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 59th
      amended by the World Medical Association General Assembly, Seoul, October and in accordance
      with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). The protocol has been approved
      by the independent ethics committee of the participating hospitals and the Leiden University
      Medical Centre. All patients who are asked to co-operate in the study are verbally informed
      and by patient information letter. The handling of personal date will comply with the Dutch
      Personal Data Protection Act. Data will be saved for maximal 5 year after public disclosure
      of the research results.

      Diagnosis

      An inguinal hernia is defined as a protrusion of the contents of the abdominal cavity or
      preperitoneal fat through a hernia defect in the inguinal area which can be congenital or
      acquired. This situation can give rise to complaints such as discomfort and pain. Conform the
      recommendation of the EHS (European Hernia Society, last version 2009) the diagnosis of
      inguinal hernia will be established by means of physical examination. Groin diagnostic
      investigations will be performed only in patients with obscure pain and/or swelling. The
      inguinal hernia will be classified using the EHS classification.

      Anesthesia

      Pre-operatively all patients will be seen by the anaesthetist on the pre-operative outpatient
      clinic. The type of anaesthesia (general or spinal with short acting agents) will be decided
      by the anaesthetist taking into account the preference of the patient. There are standard
      protocols for the general or spinal anaesthesia.

      Surgical technique

      The inguinal hernia will be corrected according to Lichtenstein, as described by Amid et all.
      This is the treatment recommended for primary unilateral inguinal hernia by the Dutch Society
      of Surgeons and the European Hernia Society. In half of the study population a lightweigth
      polyester mesh (Parietex Mesh, Covidien) will be used, fixed with non-absorbable sutures as
      described by Amid. In the other half a lightweigth self gripping polyester mesh (Parietex
      Progrip Mesh, Covidien) will be used. This mesh will be placed the same way as the sutured
      mesh e.g. tension free over the posterior wall of the inguinal canal 1cm overlapping the
      pubic bone and inguinal ligament. The self gripping flap will be closed loosely around the
      spermatic cord. Fixation will be achieved by applying light pressure on the mesh. No fixating
      suture(s) are necessary. The parietex progrip mesh is preshaped, but corrections in size are
      allowed to be made.

      Conform the recommendations of the EHS the inguinal nerves at risk (ilio-inguinal,
      iliohypogastric and genitofemoral nerve) will be tried to be identified, because this may
      reduce the risk of nerve damage and post-operative groin pain. In principle the nerves will
      be preserved, but in case of damage or interference with the mesh they will be resected.

      It is recommended that, in the case of large hernia sac, transection of the hernia sac is
      performed and the distal hernia sac is left undisturbed, so as to prevent ischaemic orchitis.
      If necessary, a large direct hernia will be sutured tension-free with continuous soluble
      sutures until a flat posterior wall has been created with a normal internal ring. Operations
      will be performed by surgeons or supervised residents.

      Post-operative pain control and recovery

      After hernia repair the wound will be locally infiltrated with analgesics to provide extra
      pain control and limit the use of analgesics. The amount of painkillers given to the patients
      will depend on their VAS score. This is a standardised regimen based on current practice.
      Post-operative painkillers include paracetamol 1 gram four times daily and diclofenac 50 gram
      three times daily. When this is not satisfying tramadol 50mg 3 times daily can be given.
      According to the EHS there are no limitations placed on patients following inguinal hernia
      operation and patients are, therefore, free to resume activities. They are only advised to
      limit heavy weight lifting for 2-3 weeks after surgery.

      CONCLUSION

      The HIPPO is a double blind randomised controlled trial that aims to show a reduction in
      chronic pain after anterior inguinal hernia repair with placement of a self gripping Parietex
      Progrip Mesh compared to the same mesh but sutured according to Lichtenstein. Hypothetically
      the Parietex Progrip Mesh reduces chronic pain compared to Lichtenstein because of less harm
      to underlying nerve and muscle fibers.

      Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Objective
      analyses will be performed on the TULIP data. There will be no violating of this study
      protocol.
