      Study population: Subjects with long standing symptoms from calcific tendonitis,
      non-responsive to other forms of conservative treatment

      Study method: A cohort of 50 patients with symptomatic calcific tendonitis will be treated by
      ultrasound-guided needle lavage. At baseline all study subjects will be assessed by clinical
      examination, imaging of the shoulder by x-ray and sonography and by the self-report section
      of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES). Follow-up will be performed after 1
      and 4 weeks (score only), 3 (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray), 6 and 12 months (score
      only), and after 24 months (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray). Patients with insufficient
      treatment effect will be offered physiotherapy, re-lavage or surgical treatment by
      acromioplasty.

      Purpose of the study: The investigators want to find out

        -  if shoulder function, measured by a shoulder score, will increase during follow-up

        -  how much of the calcific material can be aspirated (in ml)

        -  to which extend the calcific deposit disappears on x-rays and sonographic images

        -  how many patients will need surgical treatment

    <measure>The self-report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES) consists of two equally weighted parts for pain and shoulder function, each contributing 50 points to a maximum score of 100. Pain measurement is performed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale divided into 1 cm increments. Shoulder function is measured by classifying 10 activities of daily living on a four-point ordinal scale. Change in points on the ASES scale from baseline to 24 month follow-up is the primary outcome measure of our study.</description>

    <description>A 18-gauge needle connected to a 5 ml syringe with 4 ml of saline solution will be used to puncture the calcification with freehand technique and under constant sonographic monitoring. With the tip of the needle placed in the center of the deposit, the calcification will be flushed. If backflow of calcific material can be identified in the syringe, lavage of the deposit will be performed by successive propulsion and aspiration with the syringe plunger. In cases where no material can be extracted, repeated perforation of the deposit will be performed to possibly initiate or accelerate spontaneous resorption.</description>
