      How are the health related quality of life among patients with chronic pain effected by
      interventional pain managment?

      Hypothesis:

      Health related quality of life can be improved by interventional pain management both among
      patients with localizable pain focuses and among patients among whom no pain focuses can be
      found.

      Method:

      Health related quality of life using EQ-5D and EQ-VAS is registered at first visit, at the
      time of treatment for pain focuses an during the following 12 months.

    <description>EQ-VAS is measured at first visit, at time for treatment and 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. EQ-VAS gives a value of quality of life, and mainly used to verify the results achieved from EQ-5D since it is not possible to calculate QALY from EQ-VAS</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is assessed at first visit, at time for treatment and 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Quality of life is calculated from EQ-5D using the TTO-valuated UK value sets. This value can also be used for calculation of QALY, Quality adjusted life years.</description>
