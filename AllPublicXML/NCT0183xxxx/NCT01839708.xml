      Mothers in Motion will draw on the successes of the pilot intervention of the same name and
      will promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes (eating more fruits and vegetables,
      increasing physical activity, dealing with stress) in low-income WIC mothers of young
      children. The intervention group's weight change (difference between the initial enrollment
      and 3 months post intervention) will differ from the control group's weight change by an
      average of at least 2.8 pounds.

      Mothers in Motion will draw on the successes of the pilot intervention of the same name and
      will promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes (eating more fruits and vegetables,
      increasing physical activity, dealing with stress) in low-income WIC mothers of young
      children. Both treatment groups will receive usual WIC care (nutrition counseling and similar
      services). The control group will receive generic printed health and nutrition materials to
      read at their own pace if they wish. The intervention group will watch the culturally
      sensitive DVD chapters according to a study calendar, complete action plan worksheets, and
      call in to peer support group teleconferences to discuss the DVD chapter contents. The
      teleconferences will be led by moderators trained in motivational interviewing (MI) and group
      facilitation. Participants will complete phone interviews and provide body weight
      measurements at baseline (T1), immediately after (T2) and 3 months after (T3) the
      intervention time period. T3 body weight will be the primary outcome.

    <description>self-reported fat intake behavior using Rapid Food Screener (17 items total). Responses to each fat intake item were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (1 time or less per month) to 4 (5 or more times per week). Summed responses ranged from 0 to 68.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>self-reported fruit and vegetable intake (7 items total). Responses to each fruit and vegetable intake item were rated on a 6-point scale and were rated as 0 = less than 1 time per week, 1 = once a week, 2 = 2-3 times a week, 3 = 4-6 times a week, 4 = once a day, and 5 = 2 or more times a day.

    <measure>T1 Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported using the Pregnancy Infection and Nutrition 3 survey (24 items/activities). Participants reported frequency and duration (in hours) of physical activity that was done in seven categories and in the past 7 days. These categories were recreation (4 activities), indoor (5 activities) and outdoor (4 activities) household tasks, child and adult care (5 activities), transportation (2 activities) and activity at work and school (4 items). We first calculated hours spent on (frequency x duration) each activity, then sum all activities from 7 categories to create the total hours of moderate physical activity in the past 7 days (range 0 to 72 hours/past 7 days). The more hours, the more physical activity.</description>

    <measure>T1 Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report using the Perceived Stress Scale (9 items) to measure stress perception. Participants were asked about their perception of stress in the past month. Response options were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely or never) to 4 (usually or always). The overall stress score was the mean of the 9-item scores, with a higher score indicating lower stress.</description>

        <description>Self-reported using the Pregnancy Infection and Nutrition 3 survey (24 items/activities). Participants reported frequency and duration (in hours) of physical activity that was done in seven categories and in the past 7 days. These categories were recreation (4 activities), indoor (5 activities) and outdoor (4 activities) household tasks, child and adult care (5 activities), transportation (2 activities) and activity at work and school (4 items). We first calculated hours spent on (frequency x duration) each activity, then sum all activities from 7 categories to create the total hours of moderate physical activity in the past 7 days (range 0 to 72 hours/past 7 days). The more hours, the more physical activity.</description>

Participants reported frequency and duration (in hours) of physical activity that was done in seven categories and in the past 7 days. These categories were recreation (4 activities), indoor (5 activities) and outdoor (4 activities) household tasks, child and adult care (5 activities), transportation (2 activities) and activity at work and school (4 items). We first calculated hours spent on (frequency x duration) each activity, then sum all activities from 7 categories to create the total hours of moderate physical activity in the past 7 days (range 0 to 72 hours/past 7 days). The more hours, the more physical activity.</description>

        <description>Self-report using the Perceived Stress Scale (9 items) to measure stress perception. Participants were asked about their perception of stress in the past month. Response options were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely or never) to 4 (usually or always). The overall stress score was the mean of the 9-item scores, with a higher score indicating lower stress.</description>
