  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-efficacy predicts behavioural and rehabilitation outcomes and may be an important
      psychological factor for wheelchair mobility. A feasibility study will evaluate a novel
      self-efficacy enhanced wheelchair training intervention for older adults (WheelSeeU) to
      determine if: 1.WheelSeeU is feasible to administer; 2. WheelSeeU improves wheelchair use,
      confidence for wheelchair use, wheelchair mobility, and satisfaction with participation in
      older adults compared to group-based information sessions; and 3. the study design is
      appropriate. This feasibility study will allow for study design and protocol refinement and
      will provide pilot data for an experimental trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a two-site (Vancouver and Quebec City), single blinded (Tester) RCT to
      compare differences in older adults' wheelchair skill with WheelSeeU versus group-based
      information sessions. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group
      (WheelSeeU) or a control group (information sessions) using a 1:1 allocation ratio between
      groups. To support balance between groups and blinding of assignment, a central computerized
      randomization process will be designed by our team statistician, with an undisclosed block
      size and stratified by site (Vancouver n = 20 [+4 for 20% dropout]; Quebec City n = 20 +4 ).
      Once subjects are enrolled, the Tester will collect baseline data and enter them into a
      secure database. The Site Coordinator will contact Dr. Goldsmith via telephone or email and
      obtain group assignment within 48 hours. Subject contact information will be forwarded to the
      appropriate group Trainer to arrange for an initial training session or peer support session.
      To address bias, subjects will be instructed not to discuss their program and the Testers (1
      per site) will be blinded to group allocation. Follow-up testing will occur at immediately
      and 6 months post-intervention.

      To mask the participants from the study objectives, participants in both the intervention and
      control groups will be told that the intervention is designed to improve wheelchair use. The
      findings from the study will be summarized and mailed to each participant upon study
      completion.

      WheelSeeU and the control group will be held at Blusson Spinal Cord Centre, GF Strong or in
      the community depending on participant preference.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wheelchair Skills Test Version 4.1 (WST) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Wheelchair Skills Test Version 4.1 (WST) for manual wheelchair users is a standardized objective evaluation of the execution of 32 manual wheelchair skills (pass/fail) and the safety of skill execution (safe/unsafe). Total percent scores (0-100%) are calculated for both skill execution and safety. The WST was selected as the primary measure because it is a standardized tool for evaluating wheelchair capacity, the primary construct of interest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wheelchair-use Confidence Scale (WheelCon) Version 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Wheelchair-use Confidence Scale (WheelCon) Version 3.0 for manual wheelchair users is a 65-item self-report scale (0-100) with documented reliability and validity. Responses indicate current level of perceived confidence (%) to navigate the physical environment in a wheelchair, perform activities in a wheelchair, problem solve, advocate for specific needs, and manage social situations and emotions. The WheelCon was selected as a secondary outcome measure because confidence for using a wheelchair has been shown to influence wheelchair skills capacity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wheelchair Skills Test Version 4.1 Questionnaire (WST-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Wheelchair Skills Test Version 4.1 Questionnaire (WST-Q) for manual wheelchair users is a standardized subjective evaluation of perceived ability to execute 32 manual wheelchair skills (pass/fail). Total percent scores (0-100%) are calculated for wheelchair performance, based on whether or not the individual has successfully accomplished the skill in the past month. The WST-Q was selected as a secondary measure because it measures wheelchair skills performance, which may influence or be influenced by confidence using a wheelchair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life-Space Assessment (LSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Life-Space Assessment (LSA) is a 20-item questionnaire that tracks the mobility habits of wheelchair users in a continuum of environmental contexts (home; around the home; in the neighbourhood; in town; and outside of town). Participants report on their attainment of each life-space during the past 4 weeks, the frequency of attainment, and whether assistance was required. The LSA was selected as an outcome measure because it provides information about an individual's mobility habits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wheelchair Outcome Measure (WhOM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Wheelchair Outcome Measure (WhOM) is a client-specific measurement tool that identifies satisfaction with participation in desired activities for wheelchair users. Rates of perceived 'importance' of the goal (0-10) and 'satisfaction' with current performance of this activity (0-10) will be obtained. Scoring is calculated by multiplying 'importance' by 'satisfaction'. The WhOM was selected to obtain some information about participation goals of manual wheelchair users and to explore whether a wheelchair training intervention could influence perceived satisfaction with participation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) is comprised of a 16-item disability component and a 40-item function component, which includes 8 items specific for individuals who use assistive devices for mobility. Participants are first asked to identify the frequency of performing life tasks using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often) and then asked to identify the extent that they feel limited in performing specified tasks using a scale ranging from 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all). Item responses are summed to obtain two dimension scores and four domain scores in the disability component, and one overall function score and three domain scores in the function component. The scores are then converted into interval level scores ranging from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Health utility measurement is useful in performing cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses of new rehabilitation interventions. The HUI3 is a brief questionnaire that asks subjects about their health status, reflected in a single-score measure of health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</description>

    <description>Control group subjects will take part in 6 x 1.5 hour sessions of group-based information sessions facilitated by a trained instructor, consisting of topics on general wheelchair use, transportation, pain and fatigue management, nutrition, and internet resources.

    <description>WheelSeeU sessions will be administered by a peer-trainer (older adult wheelchair user), who will be trained in a 2-day workshop to use social cognitive approaches (i.e. facilitating successful performance of wheelchair skills, learning through observation of peers, positive verbal reinforcement from peers and family members, and re-interpretation of physiological symptoms) to foster the improvement of self-efficacy for wheelchair use. Each WheelSeeU session will be tailored to the individual goals of participants, which will be identified during the start of each session.</description>
