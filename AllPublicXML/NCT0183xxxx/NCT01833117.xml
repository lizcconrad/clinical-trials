  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of FID 119515A to Blink® Tears on the
      integrity of tear film in adults with a history of dry eye in both eyes.

      Subjects who met the enrollment criteria were randomized in a 2:1 manner to receive treatment
      with FID 119515A or Blink® Tears respectively for this 1-day, single-dose study.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) at 60 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein dye was instilled in the eye to assess tear break-up time. After instillation of the fluorescein, the subject was instructed to blink 3 times, then stare and not blink. The investigator measured the time from the last blink until the first black (dry) spot appeared in the precorneal tear film. Tear break-up time was assessed prior to test article instillation (baseline) and at 60 minutes. Three consecutive measurements were taken per eye at each time point, with the average of the 3 scores being the value analyzed. An increase in total score equates to improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) at 60 Minutes</title>
        <description>Fluorescein dye was instilled in the eye to assess tear break-up time. After instillation of the fluorescein, the subject was instructed to blink 3 times, then stare and not blink. The investigator measured the time from the last blink until the first black (dry) spot appeared in the precorneal tear film. Tear break-up time was assessed prior to test article instillation (baseline) and at 60 minutes. Three consecutive measurements were taken per eye at each time point, with the average of the 3 scores being the value analyzed. An increase in total score equates to improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used.</description>
