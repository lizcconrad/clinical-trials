  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties and utility of new,
      computerized, neurocognitive measures in humans with depression, and humans with depression
      undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The benefits of the study outweigh the risk as
      there is the possibility of developing better computerized neurocognitive measures, and the
      risks are limited to no more than minimal test related fatigue and psychological stress.

      Depressed humans, depressed human participants undergoing ECT, and humans diagnosed with
      Parkinson's disease (age 18-85) will be invited to participate in this study. After providing
      informed consent participants will undergo a clinical psychiatric evaluation to confirm the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. After the clinical psychiatric evaluation, participants will
      complete common and new neurocognitive measures. There will be a total of two testing visits
      (baseline, 1-month follow-up). The anticipated duration of the participant's involvement is
      no more than 2 study visits that can take place over a 4-day period (i.e., the clinical
      evaluation can occur on day 1 and the neuropsychological measures can be administered on day
      2 of each study visit) equating to approximately 6-hours (3-hours each day) per study visit.
