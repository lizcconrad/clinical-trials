      This study addresses NCCAM's request for research that investigates the neuropsychological
      mechanisms underlying mind-body therapies, and for precise criteria and better delineation of
      meditation practices.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy and mechanism of action of 2
      component practices of &quot;mindfulness meditation&quot;, i.e. focused awareness (FA) and open
      monitoring (OM) in comparison to each other and to the standard package, Mindfulness-Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).

    <textblock>
      Meditation, particularly mindfulness meditation, is one of the most popular Complementary and
      Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies for alleviating emotional stress, depression and
      anxiety. While standardized meditation-based treatment packages like Mindfulness Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) have reliably shown sustained
      improvements in emotional disturbances and wellbeing, they contain so many different
      components and practices that the active ingredient cannot be ascertained. What is commonly
      called &quot;Mindfulness&quot; meditation is actually comprised of two separate practices: 1) focused
      awareness practice (FA), and 2) open-monitoring practice (OM). This project aims to create
      separate 8 week programs for FA and OM meditations, compare their clinical efficacy and
      investigate their separate mechanisms of action in individuals with clinically significant
      levels of persistent negative affect and depression. The clinical benefit and mechanism of
      action of focused awareness (FA) vs open-monitoring (OM) vs MBCT will be examined with a
      3-armed randomized control trial of these 8 week interventions. Outcome variables include
      negative affect (depression, anxiety, stress) and wellbeing. Hypothesized mediating processes
      include objectively measured attention, emotion regulation and the basic wakefulness on which
      they depend.
