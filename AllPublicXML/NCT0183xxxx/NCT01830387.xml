  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes and the operative costs of
      appendectomy performed with the Hem-O-Lok polymetric clips compared to endoscopic staplers.
      Prospective data will be collected before, during, and after surgery on patients undergoing a
      laparoscopic appendectomy that have the Hem-o-Lok 速 stapler used to close the stump after the
      appendix is removed. Use of the Hem-o-Lok 速 stapler is standard for appendectomy patients at
      Duke Regional Hospital. Retrospective data will be collected from patients who had an
      appendectomy prior to 1/2012 using a different clip as part of their surgery, or an open
      appendectomy to compare outcomes.
