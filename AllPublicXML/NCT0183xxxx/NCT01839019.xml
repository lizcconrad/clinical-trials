          -  Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastro-intestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological, urogenital or
             psychiatric disease as judged by the investigator.

          -  Any condition requiring regular concomitant drug treatment, including herbal products,
             or likely to need any concomitant drug treatment during the study.

          -  Susceptibility to severe allergic reactions.

          -  Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study within 2 weeks
             prior to the first study drug administration or within less than 5 times the
             elimination half-life of the medication.

          -  Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits,
             about 13 g of alcohol).

          -  Current use of nicotine-containing products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day.

          -  Inability to refrain from using nicotine-containing products during the stay in the
             study centre.

          -  Inability to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing beverages during the first 24
             hours after treatment administration e.g. propensity to experience headache when
             abstaining from caffeine-containing beverages.

          -  Blood donation or loss of a significant amount of blood within 2 months prior to the
             screening visit.

          -  Abnormal 12-lead ECG finding of clinical relevance after 10 min rest in supine
             position at the screening visit

          -  HR &lt; 45 beats/minute or &gt; 90 beats/minute after 10 minutes rest in supine position at
             the screening visit.

          -  At the screening visit, systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg after 10 minutes in supine
             position, diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg after 10 minutes in supine position, or
             symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg of systolic BP or
             decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg of diastolic BP after 3 minutes in standing position.

          -  Abnormal 24-hour Holter ECG recording of possible or confirmed clinical relevance

          -  Any abnormal laboratory value, vital sign, or physical examination finding, which may
             in the opinion of the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the test
             results or cause a health risk to the subject if he takes part in the study.

          -  Suspected current use of illicit drugs (according to medical history enquiry or
             physical examination), positive drug screen or history of long-term drug abuse.

          -  Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibodies (HIVAgAb),
             hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCVAb).

          -  Participation in another clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the first
             treatment administration in this study.

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             evaluation of the results or constitute a health risk for the subject.
