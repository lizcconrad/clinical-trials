  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IL-13-PE is a chemical similar to one made by the body that is connected to a toxin to
      specifically attack cancer cells. Researchers want to look at different doses of IL-13-PE to
      find one that may be safe and effective against cancer that has returned, spread to other
      organs, or that cannot be surgically removed.

      Participants will receive physical exams and report side effects. Blood and urine samples
      will be collected. Imaging studies, tissue samples, and other tests will be used to study the
      tumor before the start of treatment and during the study. IL-13-PE therapy will be given to
      each participant on days 1, 3 and 5 of each monthly cycle for up to 4 monthly cycles.

      The study will be done in two parts, with a six-month period between them. If the cancer
      continues to grow, participants will stop taking IL-13-PE. If the cancer continues to shrink
      or not grow the study will continue, even into a follow-up period after the second part of
      the study.

      The first part of this study will determine how much IL-13-PE can be tolerated. For this
      part, the study is recruiting adult patients with various types of cancer. After six
      participants have taken the lowest dose with no more than one experiencing dose-limiting
      toxicity, two participants may begin the study taking the medium dose. If they tolerate the
      medium dose for a month, up to four more may begin at that dose. When at least three
      participants have tolerated the medium dose, two may attempt the highest dose. When they have
      tolerated the highest dose for one monthly cycle, 1-4 more may begin the study, receiving the
      highest dose.

      Adrenal cortex cancer (ACC) is a rare tumor in the gland above the kidney. It affects only
      1-2 people per million each year and causes hormone problems. This tumor affects children
      under age 5 and adults aged 30-40, causing death within five years for up to 80% of them.
      During the second part of the study, all participants will be ACC patients. They will receive
      the highest dose tolerated during Part 1 on days 1, 3, and 5 of each monthly cycle for up to
      four months.
