      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the effect of SAR302503 (500 mg) administered as 14-day repeated doses on the
      QTcF interval compared to 1-day placebo in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of SAR302503 administered as 14-day repeated doses on heart rate
           (HR), QT, QTcB, and QTcN, PR and QRS compared to placebo.

        -  To assess the clinical and laboratory safety of SAR302503

        -  To document the plasma concentrations of SAR302503 at the time of ECG investigation.

        -  To explore the Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic relationship between SAR302503
           concentration and QTcF

        -  To explore antitumor activity

          -  Prior history of torsades de pointe, or congenital long QT syndrome.

          -  Conditions with screening ECG in which repolarization is difficult to interpret, or
             showing significant abnormalities. This includes, but is not limited to: High degree
             atrioventricular (AV) block, pacemaker, atrial fibrillation or flutter

          -  Screening ECG with QTc B or QTc F ≥480 msec (within 8 days of Day-1)

          -  Significant hypokalemia at screening (K+ &lt;3.5 mmol/L) (within 8 days of Day-1)

          -  Significant hypomagnesemia at screening and inclusion (Mg++ &lt;0.7 mmol/L) (within 8
             days of Day -1)

          -  Patient receives (and cannot discontinue), or is scheduled to receive, a concomitant
             treatment known to carry a risk of both QT prolongation and torsade de pointe for 2

          -  Participation in any study of an investigational agent (drug, biologic, device) within
             30 days prior to initiation of study drug, unless during non-treatment phase.

          -  Anticipation of need for a major surgical procedure or radiation therapy during the
             study treatment.

          -  Concurrent treatment in another clinical trial or with any other cancer therapy

             with compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with
