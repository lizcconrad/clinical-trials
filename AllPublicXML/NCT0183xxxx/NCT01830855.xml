  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at a new vaccine that might prevent meningococcal disease, and will
      study whether healthy adolescent subjects receiving different lots of vaccine respond in a
      similar way. The study will also look at the safety of the new vaccine as well as how it is
      tolerated.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With &gt;=4 Fold Rise in Serum Bactericidal Assay Using Human Complement (hSBA) for 4 Primary Strains and Composite Response (hSBA &gt;=Lower Limit of Quantification [LLOQ] for All 4 Primary Strains Combined) for Group 1</measure>
    <time_frame>One month after third bivalent rLP2086 vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Groups 2 and 3 were included for the Lot consistency analysis for primary strains only (hSBA geometric mean titer). The immunogenicity of two MnB strains in lots 1,2,3 were required to test for lot consistency. These data are presented separately in the other endpoints. The data for all the strains in Lot 1 (Group 1) is sufficient to describe the immunogenicity expected with the vaccine. The analytical plan was included in the protocol and agreement was reach with EMA and FDA. Here, N signifies participants with valid and determinate hSBA titers for given strain at specified time point.</description>

             function, those receiving chronic systemic (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular)
             corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects in the
             United States with terminal complement deficiency are excluded from participation in
             this study.

          6. Significant neurological disorder or history of seizure (excluding simple febrile
             seizure).

          7. Current chronic use of systemic antibiotics.

          8. Received any investigational vaccines, drugs, or devices within 28 days before
             administration of the first study vaccination.

          9. Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including, but not limited to,
             transverse myelitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.

        <description>Groups 2 and 3 were included for the Lot consistency analysis for primary strains only (hSBA geometric mean titer). The immunogenicity of two MnB strains in lots 1,2,3 were required to test for lot consistency. These data are presented separately in the other endpoints. The data for all the strains in Lot 1 (Group 1) is sufficient to describe the immunogenicity expected with the vaccine. The analytical plan was included in the protocol and agreement was reach with EMA and FDA.

The immunogenicity of two MnB strains in lots 1, 2, 3 were required to test for lot consistency. These data are presented separately in the other endpoints. The data for all the strains in Lot 1 (Group 1) is sufficient to describe the immunogenicity expected with the vaccine.

        <description>Groups 2 and 3 were included for the Lot consistency analysis for primary strains only (hSBA geometric mean titer). The immunogenicity of two MnB strains in lots 1, 2, 3 were required to test for lot consistency. These data are presented separately in the other endpoints. The data for all the strains in Lot 1 (Group 1) is sufficient to describe the immunogenicity expected with the vaccine. The analytical plan was included in the protocol and agreement was reach with EMA and FDA.</description>
