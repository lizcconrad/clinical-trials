  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II multi-institution prospective open label study in which up to
      90 subjects with metastatic, locally advanced unresectable or recurrent pancreatic cancer who
      previously received treatment with chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX or FOLFIRINOX-like regimen
      will be enrolled into one of two arms:

      A: NPC-1C with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or B: gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Part 1 of the study, the safe and tolerable dose of NPC-1C in combination with
      Gemcitabine will be determined. Upon completion of the phase I study up to 90 patients be
      randomized to one of two arms:

      A: Patients will receive NPC-1C(NEO-102) infusion at a dose of 1.5mg/kg IV nab-paclitaxel
      (125 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion, maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed
      by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion) for 3 consecutive weeks (on Day 1, 7 and
      15 ) followed by a week of rest (for a 28 day cycle).

      OR B: Patients will receive on Day 1, 7 and 15 nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 as a 30 minute
      infusion, maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2
      as a 30 minute infusion) for 3 consecutive weeks (on Day 1, 7 and 15). NPC-1C(NEO-102)
      infusion at a dose of 1.5mg/kg IV 30 minutes following the completion of the gemcitabine on
      days 1 and 15 of the 28 day cycle.
