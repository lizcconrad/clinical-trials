      PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:

      Phase II

      No. OF PATIENTS:

      Approximately 40 (Stage I: 15 evaluable patients, Stage II: 25 evaluable patients)

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      • To evaluate non-progression disease (non-PD) rate at the end of cycle 6

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS)

        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the duration of non-PD

        -  To evaluate objective response rate (ORR; where ORR= CR+PR) and duration

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of TLC388

        -  To evaluate change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at the end of cycle 6

      STUDY DESIGN:

      This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to evaluate TLC388 monotherapy
      in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Adult patients defined by age ≥ 18 years

          2. Histologically confirmed Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)

          3. Locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Locally advanced RCC: defined as a stage T3/T4
             disease, not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy, with involvement of
             renal vein/vena cava/peripelvic and perirenal fat/adrenal gland, or invasion beyond
             Gerota's fascia. Metastatic RCC: equivalent to Stage IV RCC, according to American
             Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging

          4. Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2. But for the
             patient with failure of ≥ 2 prior target therapies, ECOG should be ≤ 1.

          5. Documented RCC disease with measurable or non-measurable lesion on imaging by RECIST
             v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria

          6. Documented treatment failure of at least 1 prior target therapy (sorafenib, sunitinib
             pazopanib or other VEGF TKI, bevacizumab, temsirolimus, everolimus or other mTOR
             inhibitor) for advanced or metastatic RCC. If treatment-naïve, patients with poor
             prognosis features according to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) risk
             criteria are acceptable

          7. Any acute or chronic adverse effects of prior therapy have resolved to &lt;Grade 2 as
             determined by CTCAE v4.0 criteria

          6. History of Class III or IV congestive heart failure according to New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) classification

          7. History of another malignancy, except for non-basal-cell carcinoma of skin or
             carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix, and not disease free ≥5 years

          8. History or presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis or leptomeningeal
             tumors as documented by CT or MRI scan, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid or
             neurological exam

          9. History of human immunodeficiency virus infection

         10. Presence of active, uncontrolled infection

         11. Radiotherapy received within 4 weeks prior to baseline

         12. Use of any investigational agents within 4 weeks of baseline

         13. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to baseline

         14. Receipt of radiotherapy to &gt;25 % of bone marrow

         15. Concomitant treatment with, or anticipated use of, pharmaceutical or herbal agents

             unless approved by the Sponsor

         16. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would jeopardize patient safety, or interfere
