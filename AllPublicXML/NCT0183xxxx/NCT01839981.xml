    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine initial estimates of overall survival (OS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate. II. To determine progression free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5
      of week 1 (pre-course 1 only), days 1 and 4 of weeks 2 and 3 (course 1 only), and days 1 and
      4 of weeks 1-3 (courses 2-6). Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
