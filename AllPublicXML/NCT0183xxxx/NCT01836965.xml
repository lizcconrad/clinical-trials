    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to validate a social skills training program manual for
      adolescents (ages 13-17) with Asperger's Syndrome or high functioning autism. Approximately
      150 adolescents with autism spectrum disorders will participate in this study, in groups
      consisting of 6 adolescents and 6 peer volunteers. Participants will participate in both
      group therapy and peer generalization sessions (in the form of a photography class) once a
      week over the course of twelve weeks. Participants and their parents will complete paper and
      pencil, online, or phone measures and video-recordings to assess the participant's social
      skills prior to the intervention, at completion of the intervention and three months later.

      This study is a pre-test, post-test single group design with post test measures at one week
      after completion of intervention and follow-up at three months. Approximately 300 adolescents
      will participate in this study. The study will be conducted in ten cohorts of 12. Each cohort
      will have 6 participants and 6 adolescent volunteers (peers). Cohorts will be run in a time
      sequential manner with up to four cohorts running at a time. Participants and their parents
      will complete pre-test measures including both paper and pencil, online, or phone measures
      and a video-recording to assess the participant's social interaction skills and fluency.
      These adolescents will participate in both group therapy and peer generalization sessions
      once a week over the course of twelve weeks. Upon completion of the intervention,
      participants and parents will complete paper and pencil, online, or phone measures and video
      post-test measures. Participants will be encouraged to participate in a follow-up session
      where the paper and pencil and video measures will be completed again.

    <description>The intervention is a 12-week social skills training program that will consist of a 90 minute group therapy session followed by a 90 minute peer generalization session (in the form of a photography class with typically developing peers) meeting once per week. Each cohort will consist of 6 adolescents with Aspergers or high-functioning autism, who will be joined by 6 typically-developing peers for the photography class. During the group therapy session adolescents will discuss and watch video clips addressing social skills topics relevant to their age group. They will have a chance to practice these skills when paired with a typically developing peer for the photography class.</description>
