  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several host factors underlie the pathogenesis of the reciprocal cycle of childhood diarrhea
      and undernutrition in developing countries. These include intestinal inflammation, mucosal
      damage, and alterations in intestinal barrier function that lead to malabsorption, growth
      failure, and heightened susceptibility to recurrent and prolonged episodes of diarrhea.
      Recent studies from Northeast Brazil demonstrate the benefits of a novel
      alanyl-glutamine-based oral rehydration and nutrition therapy (Ala-Gln ORNT) in speeding the
      recovery of damaged intestinal barrier function in cell culture, animal models, patients with
      AIDS, and underweight children.

      Oral supplementation with Alanyl-Glutamine (Ala-Gln; 24g a day for 10 days) improves
      short-term gut integrity and weight velocity 4 months after therapy in a group of
      undernourished children from Northeast Brazil. Intervention and Mechanisms of
      Alanyl-Glutamine for Inflammation, Nutrition, and Enteropathy (IMAGINE) is a study designed
      to answer the following questions: 1) What is the lowest dose of Ala-Gln that improves
      intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, and nutritional status in children at
      risk of underweight, wasting, or stunting? 2) What are the mechanisms by which Ala-Gln exerts
      these benefits?
