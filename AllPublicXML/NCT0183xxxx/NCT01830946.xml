  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is recognized as a major public health concern because of its link to potential fatal
      complications arising from metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Despite many
      pharmacological advances in this field, lifestyle strategies that emphasize proper nutrient
      intake and physical activity continue to be the primary strategy for individuals to fight
      obesity. However, controversy exists regarding the type and timing of exercise and specific
      nutrient intake to maximize fat loss, muscle gain, and beneficial cardio-metabolic
      adaptations derived from these lifestyle interventions. Furthermore, limited data exists
      investigating the impact of nutrient timing at times other than immediately before or after
      exercise and no studies have examined time-of-day nutritional intake in overweight or obese
      individuals.In addition, many individuals attempting to improve body composition and
      cardio-metabolic health are concerned with what food choices are appropriate in the late
      evening to support positive physiological adaptations. However, research-based information
      examining this topic is scarce.

      The investigators hypothesize that consumption of a protein beverage in the late evening
      before sleep will improve body composition, cardio-metabolic health, and adaptations to
      exercise more than an isocaloric placebo beverage. The investigators also hypothesize that
      the different digestion and absorption kinetics of whey and casein proteins will elicit
      different effects on the measures variables.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of consumption of a protein beverage in
      the late evening before sleep along with the combination of resistance and high-intensity
      interval training on improving body composition, muscle strength and overall health compared
      to a carbohydrate placebo beverage in overweight and obese individuals. Specifically, we will
      be measuring heart rate, blood pressure, body composition, resting metabolism, maximal
      strength,cardiovascular function, hormones levels, blood lipid profile, appetite, mood state,
      and dietary intake. Specific aims of the study are:

      To determine if acute ingestion of a liquid ready-to-drink protein supplement (30g whey or
      casein protein per serving) consumed in the late evening before sleep will alter the
      physiological milieu to favor anabolism and alter lipolysis and fat oxidation more than the
      carbohydrate placebo (34g of maltodextrin per serving).

      To determine if 4 weeks of daily protein supplementation (same supplement as above) in the
      late evening along with 3 days of exercise training per week will improve body composition,
      blood lipid profile, strength, cardiovascular risk profile more than a placebo beverage.

    <description>Completed 3 d/wk for 4 wks (2 d of Resistance Training (RT) and 1 d of High-Intensity Interval Training (HITT)). RT exercises were chest press, seated row,leg press, shoulder press, leg extension, and leg curl (3 total sets: 2 sets of 10 repetitions and a 3rd set to muscular exhaustion with a load equaling 75-85% of 1-Repetition Maximum(RM)). All exercises and sets were separated by 90-120 sec of rest. HIIT training was completed on commerical cardiovascular equipment and requires subjects to rate their perceived exertion on a scale from 1 to 10 (1= resting quietly, 5= a warm-up level, 10= an all-out exertion). Subjects warmed-up for 2 min at level 5 and increased their exertion each min for 3 min until level 9 is perceived and then recover at level 6 for 1 min. This pattern was repeated 4 times, where the 4th cycle subjects increased their last min of exertion to level 10, followed by 1-min recovery at the initial warm-up level 5.</description>
