  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, and a leading cause
      of premature mortality worldwide. Early hypertension studies showed that treating elevated
      blood pressure (BP) reduces patients' risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.
      In subsequent research, patients achieved greater improvement in cardiovascular outcomes when
      their treatment was aimed at a moderate systolic BP target (&lt;150mmHg) than at higher targets.
      Although observational data suggest that even lower BP targets may be beneficial, this has
      not been seen in randomized trials; instead, &quot;intense&quot; treatment of hypertension (i.e., to a
      target systolic BP &lt;120mmHg) was found to have no effect on participants' risk for renal
      disease, cardiovascular disease, or all-cause mortality.

      One potential explanation for this apparent lack of benefit of intense BP targets is that the
      study protocols targeted reductions in clinic BP rather than ambulatory BP. Ambulatory BP
      monitoring (ABPM) allows for assessment of BP throughout the day and night. Of all the BP
      measurements, nighttime systolic BP appears to be the best predictor of cardiovascular
      disease and all-cause mortality. Because recent trials assessing intense BP targets did not
      include ambulatory BP measurements, the effect of intensive treatment on nighttime BP is
      largely unknown.

      To address this important gap in knowledge, we will conduct ABPM in 600 participants as part
      of an ancillary study to the ongoing Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). The
      goal of the ancillary study is to evaluate the effect of intensive vs. standard clinic based
      BP targets on nighttime BP (primary outcome), as well as night/day BP ratio, timing of peak
      BP, 24hr BP, and BP variability (secondary outcomes). The SPRINT trial includes approximately
      9250 participants at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

      The investigators hypothesize that intense targeting of clinic systolic BP does not lower
      nighttime systolic BP compared to a standard target.
