  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 26,600 Down Syndrome newborns every year in China. The economic burden of this
      disease is 65,000 USD for lifetime of every patient. The common prenatal screening and
      diagnosis procedure for fetal chromosomal abnormalities in China is maternal serum prenatal
      screening in second trimester followed by amniocentesis. The detection rate of MSS is 70%-75%
      with 5% false positive rate. There are only 13.9% of pregnant women can receive prenatal
      screening testing in China. It is very urgent that we build a training system and convenient,
      efficient, cost-effective procedure suitable to rural China.

      The use of dried blood spots (DBS) technology in conjunction with the second trimester
      prenatal screening protocol has been proved to be as efficient as serum screening by our
      previous study. Noninvasive prenatal testing that uses cell free fetal DNA (cff DNA) from the
      plasma of pregnant women offers a tremendous potential for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. A
      positive test should be followed by invasive prenatal diagnosis to confirm the test results.
      Cff DNA is a good supplement to the DBS technology in rural China. A combination of the two
      methods can increase the screening rate and accuracy without increasing the demand of
      amniocentesis and cytogenetic test. This procedure with adequate training system should be
      suitable to rural China.

      Our study will build a training system for DBS and cffDNA prenatal screening procedure in
      Pinggu, Beijing. Two thousand pregnant women will receive prenatal screening. DBS sample will
      be collected in the second trimester, Cff DNA is offered to confirm the positive screening
      test results, and lastly amniocentesis is offered for confirmation of the test results. All
      of the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes will be followed. We can estimate the efficiency and
      cost-effectiveness of DBS followed with cff DNA screening procedure.

      Goals To build a training system and DBS and cffDNA prenatal screening procedure that is
      suitable to rural China.

      Objectives Develop a standardized prenatal screening test training program. Evaluate the
      efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DBS and cffDNA prenatal screening procedure in rural
      China.

      Specific activities

        -  Train the medical staff: Select two hospitals in Pinggu Village. Train all of the
           obstetricians and family doctors, nurses in these counties about the prenatal screening
           test as well as DBS and cff DNA technology. Build a series of standardized training
           profiles for the doctors and nurses. Evaluate the knowledge of the trained staff and
           compare the prenatal screening rate as well as some key health outcome variables pre and
           post the training.

        -  collect DBS sample in the 2nd trimestaer: Two thousand pregnant women will receive
           prenatal screening. DBS sample together with serum screening samples will be collected
           in the second trimester.

        -  Cff DNA for DBS high risk pregnant women: Cff DNA is offered to confirm the positive
           screening test results.

        -  amniocentesis for Cff DNA high risk pregnant women: Amniocentesis is offered for
           confirmation of the test results.

        -  Follpw-up the neonatal outcome: All of the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes will be
           followed.

        -  Statistical analysis: We can estimate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DBS
           followed with cff DNA screening procedure. We can give the recommendation to the
           government for a potential expansion of new screening diagnosis procedure to be used in
           the countryside.

      Analytic methods Build the database by visual Foxpro 5.0. Use the SAS9.2 software to do
      statistical analysis.

      Expected results and products Develop standardized prenatal screening test training program
      for the doctors and nurses in rural China. Estimate the training outcome. Estimate the
      detection rate of DBS and compare with maternal serum screening test. Estimate the
      sensitivity of specificity of cffDNA test. Estimate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
      DBS and cff DNA screening procedure. Make sure if DBS and cffDNA is suitable to rural China
      and successfully decreases the birth defects.

      Timetable

        -  Year 1 Select the hospitals and form the contracts with local staff. Develop the
           training program and finish training. Evaluate the training outcome. Start to collect
           DBS samples followed with cffDNA. Enroll the pregnant women in the second trimester who
           sign the consent form.

        -  Year 2 Follow-up the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Finish the statistical analysis
           and paper writing.
