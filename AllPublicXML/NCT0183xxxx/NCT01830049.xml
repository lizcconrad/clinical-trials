  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is strongly associated with aging. With the rapidly expanding aging
      population and the increase in life expectancy, an increase in the prevalence of ED is
      expected in the years to come. Currently, the mechanism of ED is not fully understood.
      MicroRNAs (MiRNA) are endogenous small RNA molecules that control gene expression
      post-transcriptionally. It has been included in many in vitro physiology and pathophysiology
      processes, which also involved in the process of ED. This research was designed to
      investigate the differential plasma MiRNA profiles in ED and normal erectile function in
      older males. The results might tell us which MiRNA and how did it involved in the process of
      ED in aging.

        Group I: older males came to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment of ED. Group II: older
        males came to our clinic for physical examination and the erectile function was normal.

        Group III: young males came to our clinic for physical examination and the erectile
        function was normal.
