  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a staggered, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD) study
      evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GS-5745 in participants with
      moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. This study will provide valuable data that
      can help establish the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of GS-5745 in participants with
      ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the safety of the drug and a system has been built into the trial design
      to ensure participant safety. Participants will be given different concentrations of the drug
      (known as &quot;cohorts&quot;) starting from a lower dose to a higher dose.

      Single-Dose Treatment:

      A thorough assessment of safety and tolerability will be performed before escalating to the
      next higher dose. For example, the first 2 participants will be dosed in a staggered fashion
      24 hours apart. Provided that there are no significant safety signals up to 24 hours
      post-dose for the first 2 participants, the remaining 4 participants will be dosed. A
      thorough assessment of safety and tolerability (through day 14 post-dose) will be performed
      by the safety review committee before escalating to the next higher dose. Participants
      enrolled in a SAD cohort will be eligible to participate in a MAD or adaptive MAD cohort if
      eligibility criteria are met.

      Multiple-Dose Treatment:

      This design follows the same set-up as the Single-Dose Treatment. Dosing will not commence in
      the first MAD cohort until safety data from the second dose level SAD cohort has been
      reviewed through Day 15. Successive MAD cohorts will only be dosed after safety data from the
      previous, lower dose MAD cohort through Day 43 and the next higher dose SAD cohort through
      Day 15, have been reviewed by the safety review committee. An additional Adaptive MAD cohort
      will explore a subcutaneous dosing of GS-5745 150 mg prefilled syringe once a week for 5
      weeks.
