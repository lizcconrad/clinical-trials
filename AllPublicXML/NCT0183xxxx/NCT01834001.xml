      Background:

      - Radiation is a common treatment for prostate cancer. It helps damage tumor cells and causes
      them to die. Radiation can be effective, but some tumors may be harder to treat with
      radiation or even with surgery. This happens to a small number of men who have either
      radiation or surgery for prostate cancer. Most men who have these hard-to-treat tumors do not
      know if the tumor has recurred only in the prostate or has spread to another area. Also, men
      whose prostate cancer has recurred only after radiation may have different treatment options.
      This study will use improved imaging studies to better understand why some men do not respond
      as well to initial radiation treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To use detailed imaging studies to look at the results of local radiation therapy for
      prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Men at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have radiation for prostate cancer.

        -  Men at least 18 years of age whose prostate cancer has returned after earlier
           treatments.

      Design:

        -  All participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples
           will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to evaluate the cancer at the start of
           the study.

        -  All participants will have an initial full magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the
           prostate. Tumor and healthy tissue samples will be collected.

        -  Those whose cancer has recurred after treatment will discuss possible treatment options
           with the study doctors.

        -  Participants who are scheduled to have radiation will have radiation therapy. This will
           be given according to the current standard of treatment.

        -  After radiation, participants will have regular follow-up tests and imaging studies.
           They will have another full MRI scan 6 months after the end of radiation treatment.

      Background:

      Radiation therapy is a commonly used therapy for prostate cancers. The majority of men with
      prostate cancer will be cured by therapy; however a subset, typically men with bulky or
      higher risk disease will develop PSA failure after definitive radiotherapy.

      Currently, men with a rising PSA after radiotherapy may receive hormonal therapy or may
      undergo further evaluation for local failure.

      It is not known how many men with rising PSA after radiotherapy may have a local failure and
      would benefit from a salvage local therapy. With the availability of a growing number of
      local salvage options, accurately defining the presence and characteristics of local failure
      is critical.

      Objective:

      To determine the rate of local recurrence in patients with prostate cancer treated with
      radiotherapy using multiparametric prostate MR guided and standard biopsies

      Eligibility:

      Patients with no local therapy for prostate cancer:

      Age greater than or equal to 18 years

      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

      Intermediate or high risk prostate cancer (clinical stage greater than or equal to T2b,
      Gleason score 7 or higher, or PSA greater than10, extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle
      invasion on MRI).

      Patient will be treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

      ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

      Patients with biochemical relapse after radiotherapy for prostate cancer:

      Evidence of prostate cancer recurrence (palpable abnormality after radiotherapy, radiographic
      evidence of local failure, biochemical relapse)

      ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

      Age greater than or equal to 18 years

      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

      Design:

      Patients with untreated prostate cancer:

      Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests
      (CBC, chemistries, liver transaminases, PSA, PT/PTT), and imaging studies (as appropriate to
      staging).

      Patients will undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR guided prostate biopsy of all
      suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research)

      Patients will receive radiotherapy at NIH or at an outside facility.

      Patients will return for follow up at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years and then every
      six months for 5 years for PSA measurement.

      Patients will undergo a multiparametric MR at 6 months after therapy. No biopsy is obtained
      unless patients meet the definition of treatment failure. This study would allow future
      correlation with early changes that may predict for eventual outcome.

      Patients with a rising PSA that meet the criteria for biochemical failure by the Phoenix
      definition will undergo repeat multiparametric prostate MRI with biopsy of suspicious lesions
      (diagnostic and research).

      Patients with recurrent prostate cancer:

      Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests
      (CBC, chemistries, Liver transaminases, PSA, PT/PTT), and imaging studies.

      Patients will undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR guided prostate biopsy of all
      suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research)

      120 patients with untreated prostate cancer and 70 patients with biochemical recurrence after
      radiotherapy will be accrued to this study.

               1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer. The
                  outside pathology report is acceptable for study entry. Every effort will be made
                  to acquire the outside pathology slides to be confirmed by the Laboratory of
                  Pathology, NCI

               2. Intermediate or high risk prostate cancer (clinical tumor stage T2b or higher,
                  Gleason 7 or higher, or PSA greater than 10). Previously obtained MR imaging may
                  be used for clinical T staging (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle
                  invasion).

               3. No prior local therapy (prostatectomy, radiation, cryotherapy) or hormonal
                  therapy for prostate cancer.

               4. Age greater than or equal to18 years.

               5. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal
                  to 60%).

               6. Radiotherapy is planned as definitive therapy for prostate cancer. For patients
                  not treated at NCI ROB patients must have a radiation oncologist who is willing
                  to collaborate with the ROB and provide documentation of treatment.

               7. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
                  consent document.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: for men with presumed prostate cancer relapse

          1. Patients must have a history of histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate
             cancer. The outside pathology report is acceptable for study entry. Every effort will
             be made to acquire the outside pathology slides to be confirmed by the Laboratory of
             Pathology, NCI

          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          3. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to
             60%).

          4. Radiotherapy (external beam irradiation alone or in combination with hormonal therapy
             and/or brachytherapy) was delivered as definitive therapy for prostate cancer and
             documentation is available.

          5. Evidence of prostate cancer recurrence (biochemical relapse by the Phoenix definition,
             enlarging palpable prostatic abnormality, imaging evidence strongly suggestive of
             local failure)

          6. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients unable to tolerate MRI (patients with pacemakers, cerebral aneurysm clips,
             shrapnel injuries, or other implantable electronic devices or metal not compatible
             with MRI).

          2. Evidence of metastases (pelvic lymph node involvement is not an exclusion criteria).
             For patients with recurrent prostate cancer, oligometastatic disease (3 or lessfewer
             visible metastases) is not an exclusion criterion.

          3. Patients with coagulopathies who are at increased risk for bleeding or on active
             anticoagulation therapy (platelets less than 100,000 per mm^3 or PT/PTT greater than
             1.5 times the upper normal limit (UNL). Patients are eligible if the underlying cause
             is correctable.

          4. Subjects weighing greater than 136kg (weight limit for scanner)

          5. Patients with active urinary tract infections

          6. Patients with renal insufficiency with a GFR less than 30, due to the fact that they
             will not be able to undergo gadolinium enhanced MRI

          7. Uncontrolled illness or comorbidity that in the judgment of the PI would preclude
             participation in the study

          8. Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C active infection

          9. HIV-positive patients are ineligible because HIV is known to increase radiation
             toxicity and may result in under-dosing or alterations in the treatment plan that
             would alter the likelihood of local recurrence. Appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in HIV positive patients when indicated.
