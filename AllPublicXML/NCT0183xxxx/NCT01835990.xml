  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma patients are at a high risk of developing blood clots in the legs (deep vein
      thrombosis - DVT), which can travel to the lungs and cause serious health consequences.
      Often, these patients cannot receive blood-thinning medication to prevent these blood clots
      because of the risk of bleeding; in this case, they are usually given intermittent pneumatic
      compression devices (IPCs) to prevent blood clots. IPCs are inflatable sleeves that fit over
      the legs and periodically inflate and deflate, helping to pump blood out of the legs and thus
      reduce the risk of blood clot formation. Several studies suggest that IPCs are working
      properly on the patient only 60-70% of the time. Some patients also find them uncomfortable.
      A new device (geko) that works by stimulating the leg muscles and increasing blood flow in
      the legs has recently been developed. To compare the geko with IPCs, this study will randomly
      assign trauma patients who cannot receive blood thinners for blood clot prevention to either
      IPCs or geko. The main goal is to determine the feasibility of doing a larger study which
      would compare the efficacy of these devices in preventing blood clots. The amount of time the
      devices are properly used on the patients, comfort and tolerability, development of blood
      clots, and blood flow in the leg veins and arteries will also be measured and compared
      between the devices.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of completing a larger, phase III trial with DVT incidence as primary outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>earliest of when 40th subject is enrolled or 18 months from study start</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint will be considered to have been met if, after enrollment of 40 subjects, both of the following conditions are met:
i. the time from enrollment of the first subject to enrollment of the 40th subject is less than 18 months; AND ii. all secondary outcomes are evaluable for at least 80% of subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Twice daily (excluding weekends and holidays), until subject exits study</time_frame>
    <description>Study personnel will assess compliance. For subjects randomized to gekoTM, the subject will be considered compliant for the visit if:
i) one gekoTM device is attached to each leg; AND ii) a muscle contraction caused by each device can be visualized with the subject's leg at rest;
For subjects randomized to IPCs, the subject will be considered compliant for the visit if:
i) one calf sleeve is affixed to each leg; AND ii) both sleeves are visibly inflating and deflating.
A compliance statistic will be computed for each subject by dividing the number of compliant observations by the total number of observations. A mean value will be determined for each study arm. The means will be compared using a two-tailed Student's t-test with alpha = 0.05. The proportion of subjects with a compliance statistic of at least 80% will be calculated. The proportion of subjects with at least 80% compliance will be compared between study treatment arms using Fisher's exact test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of venous thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>At time subject exits from study (day 10 or earlier)</time_frame>
    <description>Development of VTE defined either by 1) a positive screening duplex ultrasound of the deep veins of the legs, or 2) an objectively verified clinical diagnosis of DVT and/or PE, established by patient's treating physician.
The proportion of patients in each arm who develop VTE during the study will be calculated. The sample is projected to be too low to enable any further statistical comparison of efficacy in prevention of VTE.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>At time subject exits from study (day 10 or earlier)</time_frame>
    <description>The tolerability questionnaire will be administered by the research coordinator on the day of study exit.
The proportion of subjects selecting each of the possible answers for each of the questions on the tolerability questionnaire will be computed for each study arm. Further statistical comparison between the groups will not be undertaken for the tolerability questionnaire, but the data will be used for hypothesis-generation regarding specific causes of increased or decreased tolerability between the devices.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Venous and arterial physiological flow</measure>
    <time_frame>At time subject exits from study (day 10 or earlier)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean values and standard error for each study arm will be computed for the volume flow and peak velocity in the superficial femoral vein and femoral artery using pulsed Doppler by duplex ultrasound.
The values will be compared using a two-tailed Student's t-test (alpha = 0.05).</description>
