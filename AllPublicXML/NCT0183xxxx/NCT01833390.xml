  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate hyperpolarized xenon (HXe) as a medical
      imaging drug (agent) for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the human lung ventilation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HXe MRI provides a diversity of imaging techniques for interrogating pulmonary function and
      lung microstructure. The most mature of these techniques utilizes HXe spin-density MRI to
      depict regional lung ventilation. Prior work suggests that ventilation imaging has utility in
      all obstructive lung diseases. This is a Phase II clinical trial to assess HXe MRI capability
      of providing qualitative and quantitative clinical information regarding lung ventilation.
      Proton and xenon images will be acquired within single breath holds on 28 subjects per year,
      including healthy volunteers and patients with COPD and asthma. All studies will include
      repeat scans and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT). Ventilation scans with Technetium-99m
      (Tc-99m) diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) aerosol scintigraphy will be acquired on
      lung patients.

      The primary goal of this aim is to validate the effectiveness of HXe ventilation MRI for
      delineating regions of normal and abnormal lung ventilation. To validate the regional
      depiction of ventilation, HXe MRI ventilation will be compared with nuclear medicine Tc-99m
      DTPA ventilation scintigraphy. The comparatively low spatial and temporal resolution of
      ventilation scintigraphy will limit this study to demonstrating only that HXe MRI ventilation
      is not inferior to the current clinical standard. Additionally, the concordance between
      measurements of the whole lung volume from both proton MRI and HXe MRI with PFT, the current
      clinical standard for lung volume measurement, will be assessed as a secondary outcome of the
      study.

    <description>Depiction of ventilation defects with HXe MRI is not worse than presently accepted clinical method, Tc-99m DTPA scintigraphy, as judged by skilled readers and software analysis. The primary outcome variable will be binary: if ventilation is detected the value is 1, the value is 0 otherwise (defect). The level of agreement between HXe MRI and Tc-99m DTPA will be statistically calculated.</description>

    <description>Each subject will inhale a dose of HXe gas (up to one liter HXe) while lying inside an MRI scanner. A high-resolution 3D map of the lung spaces filled with HXe gas will be acquired during a short breath-hold. Additionally, proton MRI of the chest cavity will be recorded during the same breath-hold for registering the lung boundaries. All subjects will undergo Pulmonary Function Tests. Subjects suffering from obstructive lung disease will have Tc-99m DTPA lung scintigraphy performed for comparing with HXe images.</description>

    <description>MagniXene (HXe) is an Investigational New Drug made of xenon noble gas. Through a physical process using alkali vapors and powerful lasers, xenon atoms have their nuclear spin preferentially aligned (hyperpolarized), thus offering a highly enhanced signal inside an MRI scanner. High-resolution images of the lung spaces are acquired within a short breath-hold after inhalation of HXe.</description>
