  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project includes a systematic review to inform refinement of intervention components and
      a pilot RCT to determine the uptake, feasibility, and potential value of a hypertension
      self-management strategy using personal health records. The review follows generally
      acceptable systematic review and/or meta-analytic techniques; with specific attention devoted
      towards accessing information and effectiveness data from unpublished studies or reports
      within grey literature and contacting individuals with expertise in chronic disease
      management in primary care. Findings of the review will be used to expand/modify an existing
      intervention 'template' to yield an evidence-based strategy with potential to enhance
      self-management of hypertension in primary care. The pilot RCT will assess the utility of the
      multifaceted intervention, delivered in part via a secure patient-controlled personal
      electronic health record, compared with the usual family practice management, for patients
      with undiagnosed or uncontrolled elevated blood pressure. Patients who are hypertensive or
      identified as high risk are expected to benefit from the increased flexibility and autonomy
      of out-of-physician-office self-monitoring with self-management support. This initial
      evaluation will focus on the change in hypertension knowledge, patient self-efficacy, and
      patient engagement in self management activities after 3 months, in the intervention group
      compared to the control group; the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to
      patients and providers; and the processes involved in linking the patient self-management
      experience back to the patient's health care providers to promote coordination of care.
      Secondary outcomes include change in blood pressure, number and content of interactions with
      providers, and changes in management, including antihypertensive medication.

    <description>MyOSCAR, a web-based patient-controlled personal health record, provides a mechanism for patients to enter/track health information and can encourage longitudinal patient engagement, better interaction between patients and health care providers, and patient self management. The intervention will provide access via MyOSCAR to a cardiovascular risk profile and BP tracker with sharing to providers enabled. Patients can receive general information about hypertension management; tailored messages related to their modifiable risk factors; and secure messaging with multiple providers. Providers can draw on a 'menu' of links/resources to share with patients. A lifestyle changes planner/checklist and an enhanced medication diary are additional components.</description>
