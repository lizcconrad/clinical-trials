      RATIONALE:

      The way in which information about a drug is provided may affect the ability of patients and
      doctors to understand how a drug works and the side effects of the drug.

      PURPOSE:

      This randomized trial is studying how well a drug facts page works compared with a short drug
      summary in helping patients and doctors understand medical information.

      This is a randomized study. Participants are contacted by phone via random-digit dialing for
      initial interview using the computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system. Eligible
      participants are then randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Compare the effect of a prescription drug summary (one-page summary of drug information
           that includes a table with data on drug benefit and side effects) vs standard brief
           summary in direct-to-consumer advertisements on the comparisons of two drugs for the
           same indication, knowledge of drug efficacy and side effects of each drug, perceptions
           of drug efficacy and side effects of each drug

        -  Comprehension of information contained in the drug facts box
