      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover study.
      Approximately 72 healthy, surgically sterile or postmenopausal subjects will be enrolled and
      have urine collected over 72 hours following administration of risedronate for all 4
      treatment periods).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females 40 - 70 years at time of first dose

          -  BMI less than or equal to 32 kg/square meter

          -  Non-lactating and either surgically sterile or postmenopausal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, or thyroid disease

          -  Had a major surgical operation requiring inpatient hospitalization within 1 month
             prior to screening or plans to have a major surgical operation during the course of
             the study

          -  A history of cancer within the past 5 years, except for basal cell carcinoma with
             documentation of a 6-month remission at screening. Subjects with a more recent history
             of successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ will not be excluded, provided
             there is documentation of a 12-month remission

          -  Any disease or surgery known to alter normal gastrointestinal structure or function

          -  A history of gastrointestinal disease (peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding,
             ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or moderate to severe
             gastro-esophageal reflux disease that requires prescription or frequent [&gt; 3
             times/week] nonprescription medicinal intervention [eg, antacids])

          -  A history of gastrointestinal surgery, with the exception of appendectomy and hernia
             repair that did not require bowel resection (subjects who have undergone appendectomy
             or hernia repair within the 12 months prior to screening will be excluded from the
             study)

          -  Acute gastritis, diarrhea or constipation within the 14-day period prior to the
             predicted first dosing day. If screening occurs &gt;14 days before the first dosing day,
             subjects will be re-evaluated for eligibility at admission. Diarrhea will be defined
             as the passage of liquid feces and/or a stool frequency of greater than 3 times per
             day. Constipation will be defined as having less than 3 bowel movements per week or as
             having fewer bowel movements than is usual for the subject

        Exclusion at Admission:

          -  Any significant change from screening which in the investigator's opinion would impact
             safety of subject or interfere with the evaluation of the study drug.

          -  Had any acute illness within the past 2 weeks.

          -  Consumed alcohol, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, orange juice, chocolate, or caffeine
             within 72 hours of dosing.

          -  Used a bisphosphonate since screening.

          -  Reported exposure to any known enzyme inducer or inhibitor, transport induceror
             inhibitor or nonmedical enzyme-inducers such as paint solvents or pesticides since
             screening.

          -  A positive pregnancy test.
