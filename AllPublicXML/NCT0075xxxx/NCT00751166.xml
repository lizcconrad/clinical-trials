    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study that used both an
      active control (cetirizine) and a placebo control to evaluate desloratadine 5 mg once daily
      during a 28-day treatment period. The active treatments and placebo were allocated in a 2:2:1
      ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have demonstrated their willingness to participate in the study and comply with its
             procedures by signing a written informed consent. For pediatric patients, the parent
             or legal guardian was to have signed a written informed consent.

          -  Be between 12 and 70 years of age, of either sex and any race.

          -  Have had signs and symptoms of CIU for at least 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Have been experiencing a current flare of their CIU of at least 3 weeks prior to the
             Baseline Visit. Hives were to have been present for at least 3 days per week during
             the current flare prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Have an overall condition of CIU that was at least of &quot;moderate&quot; severity (minimum
             score of 2) at both Screening and Baseline Visits.

          -  Have at least a moderately severe pruritus score (minimum score of 2) and hives
             (minimum score of 1) present at Screening.

          -  Have, at Baseline, a total pruritus score of 14 or greater for the sum of AM and PM
             (reflective) diary scores for the 3 days prior to Baseline and the AM diary score on
             Day 1.

          -  Understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to
             assess and record their symptom severity scores, medication times,concomitant
             medications, and adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary.

          -  Be in general good health and free of any clinically significant disease (other than
             CIU) that would have interfered with study evaluations.

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, have had a negative urine (hCG) pregnancy
             test at the time of Baseline (Visit 2).

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential were to be counseled in the appropriate use
             of birth control while in the study. They were to be using a medically accepted method
             of birth control, for example: double barrier method, oral contraceptive,
             Depo-Provera®, or Norplant®, prior to Baseline and during the study. Women who were
             not sexually active were to agree and consent to use one of the above-mentioned
             methods should they become sexually active while participating in the study. If the
             subject had had a tubal ligation or was using an intra-uterine device, or if the
             husband/partner had had a vasectomy, another method was to be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had asthma requiring chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Had been unresponsive to antihistamine treatment in the past.

          -  Had a history of allergies to more than two classes of medication or who were allergic
             to or unable to tolerate antihistamines.

          -  Had used any investigational drug in the last 30 days prior to Baseline.

          -  Had food or drug allergies manifested as skin reactions. Subjects with urticaria that
             was primarily due to physical urticaria or other known etiology.

          -  If female, were pregnant or nursing.

          -  Had a history of hypersensitivity to the study drug or its excipients.

          -  Were family members of the investigational study staff involved with this study.

          -  Had previously been randomized into the study.

          -  Had current evidence of clinically significant hematopoietic, cardi distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of the study medication or with the subject's ability to
             reliably complete the diary card.

          -  Were morbidly obese (BMI &gt;= 35, as described in Appendix 6 of the protocol)

          -  Had a compromised ability to provide informed consent.
