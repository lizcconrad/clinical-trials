  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological care during labor is considered as an important supplemental procedure for
      alleviating delivering stress and pain. Although Doula has been recommending that should be
      given for parturients, its precise effect on nulliparous and multiparous women is still
      unknown. The investigators hypothesized that multiparas had experienced the process of labor,
      but the nulliparas were not, so Doula support would produce different effect on these two
      population.
