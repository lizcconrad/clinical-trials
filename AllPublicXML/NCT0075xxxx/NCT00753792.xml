    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double blind clinical trial. The investigators
      will study 48 patients with remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) experiencing moderate
      or severe attack receiving immunomodulatory therapy or not. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two groups.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind clinical trial to test whether oral
      methylprednisolone (MP) is not inferior to intravenous methylprednisolone for the treatment
      of multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse in terms of clinical and radiological efficacy.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups.

      Group A: methylprednisolone 1.000 mg/day intravenous administered during three days + placebo
      of methylprednisolone orally administered

      Group B: methylprednisolone 1.250 mg/day orally administered during three days + placebo of
      methylprednisolone intravenously administered.

      Clinical visits will be conducted at 7, 28 and 90 days after treatment starting.
