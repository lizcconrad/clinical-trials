      Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized registry. 100 patients will be enrolled at up to 10
      clinical sites in Europe. The results of this study will be compared to the TAXUS™ ATLAS
      clinical trial to evaluate the safety of the product.

      The JACTAX Drug Eluting Stent has been designed to minimize the amount of polymer in contact
      with the vessel surface, thus potentially reducing the incidence of untoward side effects.
      The Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating Process is capable of exclusive coating on the ablumenal
      side of pre-mounted bare metal stents. Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating is a proprietary
      formulation containing a bioerodable polymer. The combination of the Juxtaposed Ablumenal
      Coating Process and Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating create a unique microstructure surface, and
      reduces the amount of required polymer.

          3. Patient demonstrates LVEF of ≥ 25%

          4. Patient or legal guardian understands and agrees to comply with all specified study
             requirements and provides written informed consent to this effect

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Target lesion is de novo native coronary artery lesion (i.e., a coronary lesion not
             previously treated)

          2. Target lesion can be treated with one stent, with overlap onto the healthy tissue, as
             specified in visual estimate guidelines.Max lesion length is 20 mm(i.e. approximately
             4mm on each side, based on visual estimate and available stent lengths)

          3. Reference vessel diameter is between 2.75mm and 3.5 mm

          4. Study lesion diameter stenosis is ≥70%

          5. Study lesion has been successfully pre-dilated

          6. Patients enrolled for treatment may demonstrate multiple lesions in target vessel.
             However lesions must be covered completely by one study stent

          7. Patient must have no more than two lesions requiring treatment. These lesions must be
             in different vessel distributions. For example, if the target lesion is in the LAD,
             then the non target lesion must be present in either the circumflex or RCA. The
             non-study lesion may not be in a branch vessel or distal to the target vessel location

          8. The non target lesion must be successfully treated prior to the treatment of the
             target lesion. The non target lesion must be treated with either a TAXUS paclitaxel
             eluting stent or a bare metal stent.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a life expectancy of less than 24 months due to another medical
             condition

          2. Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or structurally related
             compounds

          3. Patient exhibits cardiogenic shock (systolic pressure &lt;80 mmHg and PCWP&gt; 20mm Hg or
             cardiac index &lt;1.8 liters/m or intra-aortic balloon pump or intravenous inotropes are
             needed to maintain a systolic pressure &gt;80 mmHg) for any time within 24 hours prior to
             index procedure

          4. Patient demonstrates evidence of acute or chronic renal dysfunction (serum creatinine
             &gt;2.0 mg/dl or 177umol/l)

          5. Planned cardiac surgery procedure &lt;= 9 months post index procedure

          6. Patient demonstrates evidence of a myocardial infarction (elevated CK, CKMB or
             Troponin) within 72 hours prior to index procedure and/or CK&gt; 2X local lab's ULN,
             unless CK-MB is &lt;2X ULN

          7. Patient exhibits acute ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) within 72 hours prior to the
             index procedure

             months prior to planned index procedure

         14. Anticipated treatment with paclitaxel or oral rapamycin during any period in the 9
             months after the index procedure

         15. Patient has received a drug eluting stent within 12 months prior to planned index
             procedure

         16. Previous or planned treatment with intravascular brachytherapy in target vessel

         17. Known allergy to stainless steel
