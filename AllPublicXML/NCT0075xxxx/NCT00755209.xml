      The study's objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid for
      adult patients with moderate to severe TBI.With the research question as &quot;Does TXA reduce the
      incidence of progressive intracranial haemorrhage by 50% compared to placebo in moderate to
      severe adult TBI patients at Khon Kaen Hospital?&quot;

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem with poor outcome especially
      with progressive intracranial haemorrhage (PIH) in severe patients. There are links between
      coagulopathic change after brain injury and delayed traumatic haemorrhage revealed by CT
      brain. Antifibrinolytic treatment can reduce blood loss after surgery and perhaps in moderate
      to severe TBI by similar haemostatic responses. It is justified to determine benefit for
      reversing hyperfibrinolysis after TBI. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to have
      significant clinical benefit in effectively reducing surgical bleeding in systematic reviews.
      It has been shown to have no effect on coagulation parameters and no demonstrated harmful
      effect in systematic reviews. This study is designed to determine the effectiveness of TXA in
      preventing PIH in patients with moderate to severe TBI. The treatment regimen if effective
      can be applied in general trauma practice worldwide.
