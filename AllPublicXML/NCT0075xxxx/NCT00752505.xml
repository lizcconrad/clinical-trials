  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess if esreboxetine can improve the cognitive function of
      patients with fibromyalgia. Cognitive function is defined as the ability to concentrate,
      remember things and make decisions or problem solve. The study is also designed to assess if
      there is a difference in cognitive function between fibromyalgia patients and matched control
      subjects.
