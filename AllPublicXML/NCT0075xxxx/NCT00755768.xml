      The purpose of this study is to determine whether spending more time with a dietitian will
      improve dietary compliance in a group of hemodialysis patients, with particular respect to
      phosphate control.

      -  randomised prospective controlled trial

        -  stable haemodialysis patients on thrice weekly haemodialysis (URR &gt; 66%)

        -  either had standard dietetic review - 6 monthly or intensive review - monthly

        -  all patients had to have a serum phosphate &gt; 1.8 mmol/l over the previous three months
           to be recruited

        -  study period 6 months, and then patients followed for a further 3 months
