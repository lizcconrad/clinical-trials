      The main goals of this Phase I study are to learn about the side effects that may occur when
      everolimus and bevacizumab are given to children and young adults and to find the highest
      doses of these drugs that can be given together without causing severe side effects.
      Bevacizumab will be given into the vein (IV) over 30-90 minutes every two weeks and
      everolimus tablets will be given daily by mouth. A cycle of therapy will be four weeks.

    <textblock>
      This is a traditional phase I dose finding study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination of bevacizumab,
      administered every 2 weeks IV and everolimus administered orally daily to children with
      recurrent or refractory solid tumors including CNS malignancies. Patients will receive
      bevacizumab every two weeks IV, and everolimus orally daily. Four consecutive weeks will
      constitute one course and subsequent courses will immediately follow with no break in the
      administration of either drug. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity, treatment can continue for 2 years. The bevacizumab dose will start at 10 mg/kg.
      Everolimus will start at 4 mg/m2, 80% of the MTD established in our current phase I trial. A
      traditional 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design will be used to determine the joint MTD
      for these two agents. Doses to be studied are detailed in the table below. Consistent with
      the traditional design, we will enroll cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level starting with
      dose level 1 and will escalate to the next higher dose, if none of these 3 experiences a DLT.
      If one of 3 patients experiences a DLT at a dose level then 3 more patients will be studied
      at this level. If none of these 3 experiences a DLT then escalation to the next level will
      occur. Otherwise the current dose will be considered too toxic and de-escalation will occur.
      Under this setting, MTD will be the dose level at which 0/3 or 1/6 patient would have
      experienced DLT and the next dose level is determined to be too toxic.

      Exploratory objectives:

        1. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of the combination of everolimus and
           bevacizumab within the confines of a phase I study

        2. To assess the incidence of PTEN and PI3Kinase pathway activation in recurrent or
           refractory solid tumors of childhood

        3. To assess everolimus pharmacokinetics in children, including the effect of concomitant
           drug therapy (e.g., dexamethasone).

        4. To explore changes in correlative magnetic resonance imaging in children receiving
           everolimus and bevacizumab

        5. To identify additional genes both within and outside of the mTOR pathway that may act as
           determinants of response to everolimus

        6. To explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms responsible for everolimus disposition
           (e.g., metabolism and elimination)

        7. To test the ability of everolimus to inhibit mTOR pathway signaling in patients with
           recurrent solid tumors including CNS malignancies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells

        8. To estimate blood levels of VEGF, BFGF, TSP-1, I-CAM, v-CAM and circulating endothelial
           cells prior to, during therapy and after therapy

             phenytoin, carbamazepine, etc, please see Appendix II for a list of drugs that are
             inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A)

          -  Informed consent explained to and signed by parent/legal guardian or patient if the
             patient is ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patient must begin therapy within 7 calendar days of registration.

          -  Patient must be able to swallow whole tablets

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrently receiving any other concomitant anticancer or experimental drug therapy.

          -  Have ≥ Grade 2 uncontrolled hypertension

          -  History of a stroke, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina in the previous 6
             months

          -  Evidence of a bleeding diathesis or PT INR&gt;1.5

          -  Pre-existing Coagulopathy

          -  Major surgical procedure(s) within previous 4 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Minor surgical procedures within 7 days prior to study enrollment

          -  History of an abdominal fistula, GI perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within
             previous 6 months.

          -  A serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  In patients with CNS tumors or known CNS metastases, evidence of intracranial or
             intratumoral hemorrhage on baseline MRI obtained within 14 days prior to study
             registration.

          -  If there is proteinuria present on dipstick, patients are excluded if they have &gt;500
             mg protein on 24 hour urine collection.

          -  Require treatment with any of the medications listed in Appendix II (Excluding
             dexamethasone: Corticosteroid therapy is permissible only for the treatment of
             increased intracranial pressure in patients with malignancies in the CNS or for spinal
             cord compression. Corticosteroid should be used at the lowest dose to control symptoms
             and discontinued if possible).

        Use of H2 antagonists such as ranitidine, cimetidine and proton pump blockers such as
        omeprazole are permissible only in conjunction with corticosteroids in the setting of
        increased intracranial pressure or for spinal cord compression, as these drugs interfere
        with CYP3A4. If patients are given such drugs, they must be taken at least 4 hours after
        intake of everolimus.

          -  Have an uncontrolled infection.

          -  History of infection with the hepatitis B and/or C viruses or positive hepatitis B
             virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody.

          -  Pregnant. Females of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry. The effects of everolimus on the
             developing human fetus are unknown. However, bevacizumab is known to be teratogenic
             and detrimental to fetal development in animal models. In addition, bevacizumab may
             alter corpus luteum development and endometrial proliferation, thereby having a
             negative effect on fertility. For these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately and will be removed from
             the study.

          -  Breastfeeding. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with everolimus or bevacizumab,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian/representative to
             give written informed consent.
