      This is a prospective, long-term, comprehensive growth and development study of the pediatric
      craniofacial skeleton following fracture.

      This study will encompass two specific aims:

        1. To compare the growth and development of the pediatric craniofacial skeleton after
           fracture to publish standardized means of dentofacial growth in the Bolton-Brush Growth
           Study. Patients will be matched according to age, gender, and ethnicity. The status of
           dental eruption will be recorded as well as the vertical and anteroposterior
           classification of occlusion. The effect of trauma on the eruption and vitality of
           permanent teeth will be recorded. We will further assess the popularly held theories of
           craniofacial growth and effects of injury to various facial growth sites (i.e.
           mandibular condyles, nasal septum).

        2. Attempt to evaluate the effects of various treatment modalities of facial fracture on
           skeletal growth and development (i.e. open reduction and internal fixation versus closed
           reduction and external fixation), (open reduction and internal fixation with metallic
           vs. absorbable fixation). We will evaluate the effect of metallic internal fixation on
           subsequent craniofacial skeletal growth and development, as well as the routine needed
           for its removal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Criteria for inclusion in the research study will be any pediatric patient, birth to
             18 years, who are in the active phase of craniofacial skeletal growth, and have
             sustained a craniofacial fracture.

          -  The racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subject population
             reflects the demographics of the University of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area
             and/or the patient population of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

          -  The investigators shall attempt to recruit subjects in respective proportion to these
             demographics. No exclusion criteria shall be based on race, ethnicity, gender or HIV
             status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Criteria for exclusion in the research study will be any pediatric patient, birth to
             18 years, who are not in the active phase of craniofacial skeletal growth, and have
             not sustained a craniofacial fracture.
