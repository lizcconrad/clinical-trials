    <textblock>
      The Vitamin D study is designed to investigate the effect of body fat mass on vitamin D
      levels in children. Earlier studies have shown that individuals with increased fat mass may
      have low vitamin D levels.

      Our specific hypothesis states that children with increased fat mass will have lower blood
      levels of vitamin D when compared to non-obese children.Since vitamin D is the primary
      hormone for bone mineralization in humans, low levels of vitamin D could lead to decreased
      bone mineral content in these children.

      Fifty prepubertal male and female children of ages between 3-12 years will participate in
      this study. Of these, 25 obese children will be enrolled in the study group, and 25 non-obese
      children will serve as controls.

      All subjects will fill out a comprehensive mineral intake questionnaire as part of the study
      to ensure adequate calcium intake prior to the study.

      All subjects will collect a first morning urine sample for calcium, creatinine, and NTX.

      Fasting blood samples will be drawn for the following analytes: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,
      25-dihydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, osteocalcin, insulin,
      c-peptide, fasting blood glucose, leptin, and adiponectin.

      Bone Mineral Content will be evaluated in 16 obese subjects with vitamin D level of &lt; 30
      nmol/L.
