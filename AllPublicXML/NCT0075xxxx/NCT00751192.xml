  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for the greatest burden of the HIV and Sexually
      Transmitted Infection (STI) epidemic in Peru. Current interventions that promote early
      identification and treatment of these diseases target a limited number of this population
      because they rely solely on peer education. To assess the use of the Internet as an
      alternative tool to reach this population the investigators propose to conduct an online
      randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of HIV-testing motivational videos versus
      standard public health text, both offered through gay websites. The methodology the
      investigators will use is divided in: (1) the development period, where the investigators
      will select gay websites for banner advertisement, create and refine effective recruitment
      messages and design the online survey and the video-based intervention (2) the intervention
      period, where participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized into a video
      or a standard public health text. The videos will be customized for three audiences based on
      self-identification: gay, non-gay and trans and will be framed within the health-belief model
      and the stages of change theory (3) in the outcome evaluation period we will compare the
      'intentions to get tested' and 'time to HIV testing at the clinic' among MSM of each of the
      trial arms. If the Internet is an effective venue to reach MSM for HIV testing, Peruvian
      health programs that target this population may start considering the delivery of web-based
      interventions and other online prevention services to this under served and hard-to-reach
      population.
