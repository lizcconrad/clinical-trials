    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary open angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma, pigmentary
             glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

          -  Open angle glaucoma appearing more than 6 months after cataract surgery is recognized
             as primary open angle glaucoma. (individuals requiring treatment bilaterally must
             fulfill eligibility criteria for both eyes.)

          -  IOP of 22mmHg or higher obtained during the pre-study period.

          -  Patients currently not treated or on single-drug treatment for the elevated IOP are
             eligible after a medication free period (wash-out) of:

               1. 3 weeks for B-adrenergic antagonists

               2. 2 weeks for adrenergic agonists

               3. 5 days for cholinergics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of acute angle closure.

          -  Severe trauma at any time.

          -  Intraocular surgery or argon laser trabeculoplasty within 6 months.

          -  Current use of contact lenses.

          -  History of severe dry eye syndrome.

          -  Ocular inflammation/infection with three months of inclusion.

          -  Any condition preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

          -  Unacceptable finding at pre-study ocular examination as specified in the Case Report
             Forms.

          -  In Investigator regards monotherapy insufficient with respect to optic nerve head
             and/or visual field status.

          -  Treatment of elevated IOP with any topical B-adrenergic antagonist regularly for a
             period longer than 3 months and/or treatment at any time during 6 months prior to
             study start.

          -  Cardiac failure, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree of atrio-ventricular
             block.

          -  Bronchial asthma, history of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease.

          -  Having participated in any other clinical study within the last month.
