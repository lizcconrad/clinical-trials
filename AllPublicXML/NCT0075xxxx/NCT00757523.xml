      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two marketed products in
      subjects with facial acne vulgaris
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple physiopathological factors have been associated with acne vulgaris. Drug
      combinations are frequently used to address these factors and to improve efficacy in the
      treatment of acne. The current study proposes to compare a fixed-dose (once-daily)
      combination gel product containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO)and clindamycin against a fixed-dose
      (once-daily) combination gel product containing BPO and adapalene for the treatment of facial
      acne vulgaris.

    <measure>Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy assessor performed a count of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules, including nasal lesions) each study visit. Lesion counts were confined to the face. Baseline was defined as the value at Day 1 (Visit 1). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline from the post-randomization value at Week 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants who achieved treatment success, defined as improvement of 2 grades or more in their Investigator Static Global Assessment (ISGA) acne severity scale from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ISGA success was defined as the improvement of 2 grades or more in the participant's acne severity scale at Week 12. The area considered for assessment must be confined to the face. Acne severity of the participant's face was assessed by the assessor using the ISGA scale, ranging from 0 to 5 where 0=Clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. ;1=almost clear: Rare non-inflammatory lesions with no more than one small inflammatory lesion ;2=mild: Some non-inflammatory lesions with no more than a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions). ;3=moderate: Up to many non-inflammatory lesions and may have some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion; 4=severe: Up to many non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions, but no more than a few nodular lesions and 5= Very Severe: Many non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions and more than a few nodular lesions. May have cystic lesions. The higher score indicated more severe lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females 12 to 45 years of age, inclusive, in good general health.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             baseline. Sexually active women of childbearing potential participating in the study
             must use a medically acceptable form of contraception

          -  Subjects who have been treated with estrogens, androgens, or anti-androgenic agents
             for more than 12 consecutive weeks prior to the first dose of study product are
             allowed to enroll as long as they do not expect to change dose, drug, or discontinue
             use during the study.

          -  The ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled
             visits, and successfully complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or who are lactating.

          -  Any clinically relevant finding at their baseline physical examination or medical
             history such as severe systemic diseases or diseases of the facial skin other than
             acne vulgaris.

          -  Facial hair that may obscure the accurate assessment of acne grade.

          -  History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (eg,
             ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, or a history of
             antibiotic-associated colitis) or similar symptoms.

          -  Used topical antibiotics on the face or systemic antibiotics within the past 2 and 4
             weeks, respectively.

          -  Used topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids within the past 4
             weeks. Use of inhaled, intra articular or intra-lesional (other than for facial acne
             lesions) steroids is acceptable.

          -  Used systemic retinoids within the past 6 months.

          -  Using drugs known to be photosensitizers (eg, thiazides, tetracyclines,
             fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of
             increased phototoxicity.

          -  Using neuromuscular blocking agents. Clindamycin has neuromuscular blocking
             activities, which may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents.

          -  Used topical anti-acne medications (eg, BPO, retinoids, azelaic acid, resorcinol,
             salicylates, sulfacetamide sodium and derivatives, glycolic acid) within the past 2
             weeks.

          -  Used any investigational therapy within 4 weeks of study day 1.

          -  Using the following types of facial products: astringents, toners, abradants, facials,
             peels containing glycolic or other acids, masks, washes or soaps containing BPO,
             sulfacetamide sodium or salicylic acid, non-mild facial cleansers, or moisturizers
             that contain retinol, salicylic acid, or α- or β-hydroxy acids.

          -  Using medications that are reported to exacerbate acne (eg, mega-doses of certain
             vitamins such as vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamins B2, B6, and B12; haloperidol;
             halogens such as iodide and bromide; lithium; hydantoin; and phenobarbital) as these
             may impact efficacy assessments.

          -  Have had a facial procedure (chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion, artificial
             ultraviolet [UV] therapy) performed by an esthetician, beautician, physician, nurse,
             or other practitioner, within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any of the active
             components, lincomycin, adapalene, clindamycin, BPO, or excipients of the study
             medication.

          -  Employees of a clinical research organization involved in the study, or Stiefel
             Laboratories, or an immediate family member (partner, offspring, parents, siblings, or
             sibling's offspring) of an employee.

          -  Have a member of the same household in this trial.
