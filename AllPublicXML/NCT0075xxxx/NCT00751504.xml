  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotics have been found not only to be beneficial in the treatment of
      psychotic disorders, but even for depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.
      Remarkably, preliminary data suggest that the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine has
      antidepressive properties. Until now, there is limited knowledge concerning the efficacy of
      quetiapine in major depressive illness and especially in psychotic depression. In our own
      clinical practice, several patients with psychotic depression were successfully treated with
      quetiapine as add-on therapy or as monotherapy. On the background of that, the convincing
      effects of quetiapine in bipolar depression, single-case reports and pilot studies concerning
      its effectiveness in depressive mood states in psychotic disorders as well as our clinical
      experiences, it is to assume that a treatment with quetiapine over a 6 weeks period show
      similar effects in major depressive episode with psychotic features, i.e. psychotic
      depression. In this pilot study we plan to investigate 20 patients with psychotic features of
      depression under treatment with quetiapine.
