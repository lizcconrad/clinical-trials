      The purposes of this study are to examine the needs (symptoms, support, information) and
      satisfaction of women during follow-up in the community after completing treatment for
      endometrial cancer. This information will be collected from the perspective of the women
      themselves, their primary care providers (family physician or gynecologist) and the health
      care providers (oncologist, nurses, social worker, psychologist) at the cancer centre.

        will also be identified by health records as provided by the endometrial cancer patient
        when they registered with the TOHCC.
