  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of phosphatidylcholine (PPC) and deoxycholate (DC) injected into subcutaneous
      fat is often popularly referred to as &quot;Lipodissolve&quot; therapy. Despite its attractiveness as
      an easy and noninvasive cosmetic treatment, the safety, effectiveness, and how the injections
      might work remain unclear. This study will investigate the hypothesis that injections of
      PPC/DC will reduce the amount body fat in the treated area. If so, the mechanisms responsible
      for the fat loss will be explored to find out whether fat cells die from toxic effects or are
      broken apart by the PPC/DC. Patients will receive at least 2 (no more than 4) treatments with
      PPC/DC injections every 2 months. Several methods of measuring fat loss will be used in the
      study, including photography and measurement of patients, tissue biopsy, blood tests, and
      MRI. The study will also record side effects of the treatments as well as patient
      satisfaction.
