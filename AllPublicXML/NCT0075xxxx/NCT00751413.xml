    <measure>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of MK0633 in pediatric asthma patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, laboratory safety tests (blood chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), urine ß-hCG test, and 12-lead ECGs will be performed at various scheduled time points throughout the study.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To obtain information on plasma pharmacokinetics (e.g., AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, apparent t½,) of MK0633 after a single oral dose administration in pediatric asthma patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Plasma will be analyzed at specific time-points for MK0633 concentrations. Urine will be collected for the measurement of LTE4 concentration.</time_frame>
