  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, thromboembolism is a common occurrence,
      especially following tourniquet deflation. The resulting cardiopulmonary emboli can
      potentially lead to hypoxemia, hypotension, hemodynamic collapse and post operative cognitive
      dysfunction due to emboli. The standard surgical technique involves placing an intramedullary
      rod in the femur to determine the angle and degree of resection from the end of the femur. A
      new surgical technique utilizes computer navigation system to perform the desired cuts in the
      appropriate position. The investigators hypothesize that the avoidance of intramedullary
      instrumentation in computer assisted total knee replacement will result in fewer
      thromboembolic events compared with the standard technique using manual instrumentation in
      the femur. The present study will test this hypothesis by quantifying the extent of
      thromboembolism during both surgical techniques.

      Currently, Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is routinely used intraoperatively to
      monitor patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for thromboembolic events. Video
      recording (without any patient identifiers) of the TEE loops before and after tourniquet
      release, offline analysis to quantify the extent of thromboembolism and the two surgical
      techniques will be compared. Patients are assigned to a particular technique according to
      some non-rigid criteria. This study has no impact on their selection into one group or the
      other. Participation in this study does not influence the choice/selection. We will simply
      record and analyze the echo loops in twenty patients already assigned to each surgical
      technique.
