  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed project is to characterize the neutrophile proteases which
      participate in the chronic inflammatory phenomenon associated with the cystic fibrosis and
      which are responsible for the degradation of the lung tissue.

      The respiratory failure which results from it is one of main causes of the fatal evolution of
      this pathology but the anti-inflammatory therapies based on the use of antiproteases
      targeting specifically the soluble elastase did not end, until now, in the hoped results.

      The identification of the other noxious targets is a crucial element to give new orientations
      to the anti-inflammatory strategies based on the administration of antiproteases which remain
      a promising way.
