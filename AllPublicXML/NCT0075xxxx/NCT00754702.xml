  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic oral
      vinorelbine taken three times a week plus daily lapatinib without break, as salvage treatment
      in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous administration of oral vinorelbine, given three times a week (metronomic) is
      feasible and exceptionally well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg. Early results show activity
      against refractory tumors and provide evidence towards clinical proof of efficacy for
      metronomic chemotherapy. Recently, lapatinib plus capecitabine was proven superior to
      capecitabine alone in women with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that has progressed
      after treatment with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.
