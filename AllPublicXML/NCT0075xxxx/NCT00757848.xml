  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if treatment with AZD9668 for 28 days is
      effective in treating Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and if so how it compares to placebo (a substance
      which does not have any action).

    <description>The Bronkotest diary card includes 8 questions on signs and symptoms. Symptom scores were recorded for night-time symptoms, breathing, sputum colour, sputum amount, sputum type, wellbeing, and cough, generally scored on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (worst symptoms). ANOVA models were fitted to compare the change from baseline between AZD9668 and placebo for each question separately, with a p-value of 0.1 considered statistically significant. The number of number of these 8 measures with significant differences is reported.</description>
