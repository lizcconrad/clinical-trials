  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous phase II study, the safety and efficacy of a novel formulation of malathion
      0.5% was evaluated in patients 2 years of age and older. Based on the results of that study,
      this formulation is currently in a phase III study for that population.

      The current study will use blood markers and clinical evaluations to determine the safety and
      tolerability of this formulation when used in children 6-24 months of age.

    <measure>Participants With a Change in Cholinesterase Level at 1 Hour (Day 0).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient (aged 6 - 24 months) was assessed at 1 hour (Day 0). The mean percent change (reduction) in plasma and RBC cholinesterase activity from baseline to 1 hr after application was calculated and accompanied by 95% confidence intervals.
If the half-widths of the derived confidence intervals are sufficiently narrow, it will demonstrate that any observed reductions in plasma and RBC cholinesterase activity fall within established safety guidelines.
Concentration of RBC-cholinesterase (RBC-ChE) and plasma cholinesterase were obtained at baseline, at 1 hr (Day 0) and at 24 hrs (Day 1) after the application of the treatment.
Mean percent change (reduction) = (Post treatment value - Baseline)/ Baseline x100.</description>
