  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking to school is one of the objectives for children and adolescents in Healthy People
      2010 and in previous studies was associated with higher levels of overall physical activity,
      which has been shown to decrease obesity. Therefore, more children walking to school should
      result in increased physical activity and presumably reduce obesity. However, increasing
      child pedestrian activity could increase the risk of child pedestrian injuries. Walking with
      an adult who provides instruction in pedestrian skills and monitors the child's actual
      behavior may be the most important component of a successful intervention. Walking with an
      adult reduced child pedestrian injury risk by almost 70%. A walking school bus (WSB)
      addresses safety concerns by providing a period of physical activity supervised by several
      responsible adults and teaching opportunities around pedestrian safety skills on the way to
      and from school. Children may join the WSB at various points along the set route. Despite the
      growing popularity of WSB programs in the United States, randomized, controlled-studies are
      lacking that examine the impact on children's safety, physical activity, and health. We seek
      to help fill this gap in the literature by piloting a WSB program in elementary schools in
      the Houston Independent School District to test feasibility. We hypothesize that a WSB
      program will: (1) increase the number of students walking to school and decrease the number
      of students driven to school by car, (2) increase students' pedestrian safety behaviors (3)
      increase students' physical activity, and (4) decrease students' excess weight gain.
