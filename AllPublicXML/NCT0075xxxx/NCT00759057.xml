  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-inferiority study will compare the clinical outcomes of subjects implanted with the
      Dynesys Spinal System versus the clinical outcomes of subjects implanted with an instrumented
      posterior lateral spinal fusion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Dynesys Spinal System for patients requiring one or contiguous two-level posterior spinal
      stabilization of the lumbar, and/or sacral spine following decompression. The ability for
      this implant to maintain spinal alignment and non-fusion of spinal segments, while positively
      affecting clinical outcomes, will be assessed and compared to a posterior lateral spinal
      fusion (PLF) procedure using autogenous bone with a semi-rigid, polyaxial posterior spinal
      fixation system.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having degenerative spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis (up to Grade 1)
             AND/OR Patients having lateral or central spinal stenosis or other stenosing lesion as
             diagnosed by radiculopathic signs, neurogenic claudication or imaging studies;

          -  Candidate for single-level or contiguous two-level PLF between L1-S1;

          -  Patients have a predominate component of leg rather than back symptoms; symptoms
             include pain, muscle weakness, and/or sensation abnormality as evidenced by patient
             history and diagnostic studies.

          -  Patients may require decompression at the levels considered for treatment

          -  Pre-operative leg pain score greater than or equal to 40 mm on a 100 mm Visual Analog
             Scale (VAS);

          -  Leg pain must be unresponsive to conservative (non-surgical) management for minimum of
             3 months;

          -  Pre-operative Oswestry score greater than or equal to 30 indicating at least moderate
             disability;

          -  Skeletally mature individual between ages 20 and 80;

          -  Must be willing and able to comply with study requirements; including willing and able
             to sign a study-specific, IRB-approved informed consent form, complete necessary study
             paperwork and return for required follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary diagnosis of discogenic back pain at affected levels as evidenced by a larger
             back than leg pain component. In the event of multi-level pathology a discogram should
             be considered;

          -  Patients with leg pain due to etiologies other than those listed above, such as
             trauma, peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy should be excluded;

          -  Degenerative scoliosis greater than 10 degrees at the affected motion segment;

          -  Supplemental interbody column support (e.g., bone graft, spacers or fusion cages) is
             planned at the affected level(s);

          -  Greater than Grade I spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis at the affected level(s);

          -  Radiculopathic signs from more than two contiguous or two noncontiguous vertebral body
             segment(s);

          -  Previous lumbar fusion attempt(s), previous total facetectomy or trauma at the
             affected level(s);

          -  Receiving immunosuppressive or long-term steroid therapy;

          -  Active hepatitis (viral or serum) or HIV positive, renal failure, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, or any other significant medical conditions which would substantially
             increase the risk of surgery;

          -  Documented history of titanium alloy, PET or PCU allergy, or intolerance;

          -  Active malignancy or other significant medical comorbidities;

          -  Current chemical dependency or significant emotional and/or psychosocial disturbance
             that may impact treatment outcome or study participation as evidenced by three or more
             positive Waddell Signs;

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Incarceration;

          -  Severe muscular, neural or vascular diseases that endanger the spinal column;

          -  Missing bone structures, due to severely deformed anatomy or congenital anomalies,
             which make good anchorage of the implant impossible;

          -  All concomitant diseases that can jeopardize the functioning and success of the
             patient;
