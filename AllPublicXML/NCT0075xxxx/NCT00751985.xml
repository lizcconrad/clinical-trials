      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a web-based ultra-brief intervention,
      consisting of personalized normative feedback or standardized self-help material, is
      effective in lowering self reported alcohol use in heavy drinkers.

      Background and purpose:

      The Danish national board of Health has awarded funds for two studies that will test methods
      that can be used for effective and early detection of heavy drinkers. The study will be
      carried out in 12 Danish municipalities in 2008. The study is part of the 'Diet, Smoking,
      Alcohol and Exercise' nationwide health study of the Danish population. It takes place in 13
      municipalities in 2007 and 2008.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a web-based ultra-brief intervention,
      consisting of personalized normative feedback or standardized self-help material, is
      effective in lowering self reported alcohol use in heavy drinkers.

      Design:

      The experiment is designed as a randomized controlled trial, where heavy drinkers will be
      allocated to either:

      A) an intervention group receiving web-based personalized normative feedback (PFI) B) an
      intervention group receiving web-based self-help material (SHM) C) a control group receiving
      nothing.

      After 6 and 12 months there will be follow-up and the participants will receive a
      questionnaire with questions about their alcohol consumption (internetbased and paper).

    <measure>Reduction of 15% in alcohol consumption with an average volume of approximately 38-41 grams alcohol per week in the PFI group . In the self-help material group we expect that 5 - 10% will reduce their consumption equivalent.</measure>

    <description>Personalized normative feedback (PFI). The PFI was a single-session intervention; it was displayed in a single screenshot and addressed the participant by name. It consisted of a summary of the participant's weekly consumption, a comparison with maximum drinking limits and a graphical comparison of the participant's consumption to the average level in the municipality (gender-specific), followed by information about health and social risks of heavy drinking as well as links for further self-help material and a local alcohol treatment facility.</description>

    <description>The intervention can be classified as a minimal ultra-brief intervention consisting of only a single session.
The brief personalised normative feedback will comprise the result of the participant's amount of alcohol consumption, previously given in an online questionnaire.
Alongside, information about alcohol and how it might affect them at their current drinking levels is provided. The feedback is also comparing their drinking, in graphical format, to the average drinking in the municipality concerned. Contact details are also provided about local alcohol treatment possibilities if the participants feel they need further help.</description>
