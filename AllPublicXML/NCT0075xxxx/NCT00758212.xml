  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza vaccination has proved it's effectiveness over many years of usage including
      HIV/AIDS patients who are immunocompromised. In those patients, however, a noted rise in HIV
      viral load which follows intramuscular injection of the vaccine is of unknown significance
      over the long run. Mesotherapy is a procedure developed and practiced in france by which a
      reduced and diluted amounts of antigens is being introduced by multiple intradermal
      injections over the torso and upper back. Mesotherapy is mainly used as a vehicle for
      introducing pain medicine and cosmetics.

      We will test the effectiveness of mesotherapy as a vehicle for influenza vaccination.We will
      use 1:10th of the amount of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine in approx.50 HIV/AIDS
      patients.A control group of approx.50 matched patients for age ,treatment schedule and immune
      status will receive the regular injection of trivalent vaccine. We will follow patients
      clinically for symptoms compatible with seasonal influenza and for direct side effects of the
      vaccine.In addition we will measure anti influenza antibody in the two groups .Follow up will
      be for 6 months following vaccination.Anti influenza antibody will be measured at 1,3,6months
      using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test.
