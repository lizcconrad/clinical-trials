        Inclusion criteria (for both study populations):

          1. Men or women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) aged 18 to 65 years inclusive at
             screening.

             WONCBP may be included if they are either surgically sterile (hysterectomy and/or
             oophorectomy) or postmenopausal for more than 1 year (with follicle-stimulating
             hormone [FSH] level greater than or equal to 8 mIU/mL) and must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test result within 48 hours before administration of test article. Women who
             are surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative
             report or by ultrasound scan. Sexually active men must agree to use a medically
             acceptable form of contraception during the study and continue using it for 12 weeks
             after test article administration.

          2. Have a high probability for compliance with and completion of the study.

        Exclusion criteria (for both study populations):

          1. History of clinically important cardiovascular disease.

          2. Family history of QT prolongation, syncope, seizure, or unexplained cardiac-related
             death.

          3. Presence or history of any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the
             study.
