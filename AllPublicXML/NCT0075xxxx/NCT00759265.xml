  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired mobility is a major health problem affecting many subjects with diabetes mellitus.
      It is associated with loss of quality of life and it is a strong predictor for poor health
      outcomes. Reduced lower extremity muscle function, as a consequence of diabetic
      polyneuropathy, is a major cause of impaired mobility. We hypothesize that a programme of
      resistance training will counterbalance the effects of polyneuropathy on muscle wasting, and
      will improve mobility and associated quality of life.

      The objective of this study is to develop a resistance training intervention that improves
      mobility and quality of life in diabetic patients. It is also our intension to achieve a
      better understanding of the relation between diabetic neuropathy and muscle weakness, limited
      mobility and quality of life. Moreover, insight will be gained in optimizing training
      programmes for neuropathic patients.

    <description>During 24 weeks, the patients of the intervention group will participate in a resistance training program. Two subsequent intervention programmes will be offered. Initially the first 12 week resistance trainings stage will aimed at improving function of lower leg muscles; subsequently a more extended programme affecting total limb musculature (lower- and upper leg) will be provided (also 12 weeks).
During these trainings period, patients will train 3 times a week; once a plenary training session of 1,5 hour provided by a physical therapist. And 2 trainings sessions of half an hour each, by them selves at home.</description>
