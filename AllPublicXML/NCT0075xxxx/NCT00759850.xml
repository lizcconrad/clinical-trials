    <textblock>
      Stent implantation is the best treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      referred for primary angioplasty (pPCI). However the occurrence of in stent restenosis is
      responsible for the need of repeat intervention. Both Sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and
      Paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) have been proven to virtually abolish in-stent restenosis in
      elective patients in simple e more complex lesions. Both SES and PES have raised concerns
      regarding occurrence of late stent thrombosis, especially in complex lesion subsets or in
      high risk patients. The PaclitAxel or Sirolimus-Eluting Stent vs Bare Metal Stent in primary
      angioplasty (PASEO) trial was a prospective, single-center, randomized trial evaluating the
      benefits of SES or PES as compared to BMS implantation in patients undergoing primary
      angioplasty for acute STEMI. From 1 October 2003 we randomized with 1:1:1 ratio, 270 patients
      with STEMI and treated with pPCI, to implantation of a bare metal stent (BMS n=90), PES
      (n=90) or SES (n=90).

    <description>Open-label randomization was performed after initial angiography by the treating physician when eligibility criteria were met. All patients received in the CCU 70U/Kg i.v. bolus of UFH plus 1000U/h infusion (to maintain an ACT of at least 200 seconds), aspirin intravenously (500 mg) and clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose). All patients received upstream Gp IIb-IIIa inhibitors administration as a routine adjunctive therapy before primary PCI. Postinterventional antiplatelet therapy for all patients included in the three study group, consisted of aspirin (100 mg) indefinitely and clopidogrel (75 mg for six months). Stenting procedures were performed according to standard techniques. The number and length of stents, and the type of BMS to be implanted, were left to the operator's discretion. The operator was allowed to implant DES to cover the entire length of the lesion with coverage of the entire stented segment and of 5 mm proximal and distal segments.</description>
