      This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TriCilest as comparted with Diane-35
      among female patients with moderate acne vulgaris. The study design was double-blind,
      randomized, parallel and active controlled. The sponsor planned to recruit approximately 50
      patients to complete 40 evaluable patients. At the end of the study, a total of 48 patients
      were randomized.

      TriCilest (noregestimate-ethinyl estradiol), 0.18mg-0.035mg or 0.215mg-0.035mg or
      0.25mg-0.035mg, Oral admistration, The duration was three consecutive menstrual cycles.
