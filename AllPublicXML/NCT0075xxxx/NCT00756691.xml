  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia (little of no oxygen) is considered to be an important characteristic of a patient's
      tumour that may help predict patient outcomes and/or help inform patient management
      decisions. 18F-FAZA Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can detect hypoxic tumours because
      18F-FAZA accumulates in hypoxic tissues. This study is being done to learn more about the
      processes by which 18F-FAZA is absorbed, distributed, metabolized (built-up and broken down)
      and eliminated by the body.

      A Phase I Radiopharmacokinetic and Radiodosimetric study of 18F-FAZA. Prior to treatment,
      subjects will receive a single injection of 18F-FAZA. Subjects will undergo a series of 5-5
      PET scans, and will have 8-13 blood samples and 2 urine samples taken at specified time
      points over a 4.5-5.5 hour period. 18F-FAZA PET images will be reviewed to develop a dynamic
      uptake model, and blood and urine samples will be analyzed for unchanged 18F-FAZA and its
      metabolites.
