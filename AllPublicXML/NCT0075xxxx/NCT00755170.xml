      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of metronomic vinorelbine and bevacizumab
      combination in patients with pretreated, advanced non small cell lung cancer

    <textblock>
      Intravenous (IV) vinorelbine is a standard chemotherapy option for the treatment of
      metastatic NSCLC, either alone or in combination with other agents such as CDDP or
      Carboplatin with overall response rates (ORR) of 15-35% as 1st line treatment and less than
      10% as salvage treatment. For the past few years vinorelbine is available for per os (po)
      administration with acceptable and reliable pharmacokinetic profiles and with a
      bioavailability of approximately 40% of the IV dose. In randomized phase II studies IV and po
      vinorelbine have shown comparable response and overall survival rates. The low dose
      metronomic chemotherapy that is administered in short intervals has been shown in vitro an in
      vivo to have antiangiogenic effects. Bevacizumab is a well known anti-angiogenic agent.
      Recently, a phase III study of 1st line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC showed that the addition of bevacizumab to a platinum-based regimen provided a survival
      benefit. This study will evaluate the combination of metronomic vinorelbine and bevavizumab
      as 2nd line treatment of NSCLC.
