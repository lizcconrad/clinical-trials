  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients
      with daily low back pain below the 12th thoracic vertebra of greater than 3 months duration.
      Patients also had an average daily pain score of 4 or greater on an 11-point categorical pain
      scale for the last 3 days of the baseline phase. The study began with a 14-day washout period
      of previously used pain medications. At the end of the 14-day baseline phase, patients were
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatments: Flurbiprofen tape applied once daily for 12 hours,
      Flurbiprofen tape applied once daily for 24 hours, placebo tape applied once daily for 12
      hours, or placebo tape applied once daily for 24 hours. During the 7-day treatment phase,
      patients applied 2 treatment tapes once daily for 7 days. The tapes remained on for 12 or 24
      hours of continuous treatment, depending on the treatment to which they were randomized.
      Patients were provided with rescue medication. After 7 days of tape treatment, patients
      returned to the clinic for a study exit visit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID+)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 4 and 7 of tape treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative summed pain intensity difference (SPID+) at Days 4 and 7 of the tape treatment phase as computed from the daily categorical pain scale score reported on the patient's daily diary during the tape treatment phase; pain was rated on an 11-point scale, where: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable.
Summed pain intensity difference is the sum of the pain intensity differences (PID). PID at each post-baseline evaluation was computed as the average baseline categorical pain scale score minus the post-baseline categorical pain scale score from the daily dairy. For patients with multiple pain scores reported on a given post-baseline study day, the PID scores were averaged to compute one daily PID score for each patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Difference (PID+)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7 of tape treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>+PID = pre-treatment value at baseline - post-treatment value at day of evaluation, where: pre-treatment value at baseline = average daily pain over the last 3 days of the baseline phase (ie, average of daily averages of the categorical pain scale scores for the last 3 days of the baseline phase). Pain was rated on an 11-point scale, where: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable.
A positive PID indicates a reduction in pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Daily Categorical Pain Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7 of tape treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rated their lower back pain, caused by normal activity and movement, on an 11-point categorical pain scale, where:
0 = no pain, and 10 = worst pain imaginable. Patients rated their lower back pain every 12 hours, at any time they took medication including rescue medication for any type of pain, and if they applied or removed their treatment tapes at a time other than the scheduled time.
Data are reported as the daily average categorical pain scale score by treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Functional Rating Index (FRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 7 of tape treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed the FRI, a 10-item back pain-specific measure of function questionnaire describing the condition at the time the questionnaire was completed; each item (pain intensity, sleeping, personal care, travel, etc.) was rated on a 5-point scale, where 0 = best outcome, 4 = worst outcome.
FRI was reported as the percent change from baseline at Day 7 of the tape treatment phase, where:
Total FRI score = sum of the 10 questions. The total FRI score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 40 (worst outcome). Percent change = ([baseline - Day 7]/baseline)*100.
A positive percent change indicates a favorable treatment effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Tender Point Examination Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 7 of tape treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline and Day 7 of the tape treatment phase, patients had an assessment of tenderness bilaterally at the sacroiliac joint, greater trochanter of the hip, gluteus medius and minimus, and paraspinal muscles at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1. The investigator or research nurse pressed 12 specific areas of the body (6 locations, left and right sides), and patients were asked to rate the intensity of their pain at those 12 areas using an 11-point scale, where:
0 = no pain, 10 = the worst pain the patient has ever experienced. The total tender point examination score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 120 (worst outcome). Change from baseline = baseline - Day 7. A positive change indicates a favorable treatment effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>At Day 7, patients provided their PGIC with regard to lower back pain response to treatment, using a 7-point scale, where:
1 = very much improved, 7 = very much worse.</description>

        <type>Primary</type>
        <title>Cumulative Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID+)</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative summed pain intensity difference (SPID+) at Days 4 and 7 of the tape treatment phase as computed from the daily categorical pain scale score reported on the patient's daily diary during the tape treatment phase; pain was rated on an 11-point scale, where: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable.
Summed pain intensity difference is the sum of the pain intensity differences (PID). PID at each post-baseline evaluation was computed as the average baseline categorical pain scale score minus the post-baseline categorical pain scale score from the daily dairy. For patients with multiple pain scores reported on a given post-baseline study day, the PID scores were averaged to compute one daily PID score for each patient.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Functional Rating Index (FRI)</title>
        <description>Patients completed the FRI, a 10-item back pain-specific measure of function questionnaire describing the condition at the time the questionnaire was completed; each item (pain intensity, sleeping, personal care, travel, etc.) was rated on a 5-point scale, where 0 = best outcome, 4 = worst outcome.
FRI was reported as the percent change from baseline at Day 7 of the tape treatment phase, where:
Total FRI score = sum of the 10 questions. The total FRI score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 40 (worst outcome). Percent change = ([baseline - Day 7]/baseline)*100.
A positive percent change indicates a favorable treatment effect.</description>

The investigator or research nurse pressed 12 specific areas of the body (6 locations, left and right sides), and patients were asked to rate the intensity of their pain at those 12 areas using an 11-point scale, where:
0 = no pain, 10 = the worst pain the patient has ever experienced. The total tender point examination score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 120 (worst outcome). Change from baseline = baseline - Day 7. A positive change indicates a favorable treatment effect.</description>

The investigator or research nurse pressed 12 specific areas of the body (6 locations, left and right sides), and patients were asked to rate the intensity of their pain at those 12 areas using an 11-point scale, where:
0 = no pain, 10 = the worst pain the patient has ever experienced. The total tender point examination score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 120 (worst outcome). Change from baseline = baseline - Day 7. A positive change indicates a favorable treatment effect.</description>
          <population>Reported data are based on Intent-to-Treat patient population. Discrepancy in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure is due to discontinuations: 1 participant in the placebo tape12 hour group and 2 participants in the flurbiprofen tape groups (1 in the 12 hour group and 1 in the 24 hour group).</population>
