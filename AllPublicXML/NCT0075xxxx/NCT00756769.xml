    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe, disabling systemic autoimmune disease
      characterized by the production of autoantibodies. The clinical symptoms and immunologic
      manifestations of SLE are diverse. African-Americans have a 3 fold increased incidence of
      SLE, develop SLE at an earlier age, and have increased morbidity and mortality compared with
      Caucasians. Our central study hypothesis is that there are specific genetic factors that
      interact with environmental exposures leading to the development of SLE. The African-American
      Gullah population lives on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia. They are unique in
      their genetic homogeneity with minimal Caucasian admixture, making them an ideal cohort to
      address questions of environmental and genetic influence on development and progression of
      SLE.
