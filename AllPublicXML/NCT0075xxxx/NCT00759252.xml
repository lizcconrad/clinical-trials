      The purpose of this study is to conduct a cross-sectional survey of primary care patients to
      better understand their perceptions of the risks and benefits of a screen and subsequent
      diagnostic confirmation of dementia.

      The Health Belief Model was used to explore the public's acceptance or enthusiasm for early
      recognition of dementia. Based on this model, prior research and clinical experiences, and a
      systematic literature review, the PRISM-PC instrument was developed. The PRISM-PC items seek
      to capture both the patient's acceptance of dementia screening and the patient's perception
      of potential harms and benefits of such screening. The instrument includes questions
      regarding screening by performance-based questionnaires, blood tests, or brain imaging.

      The PRISM-PC instrument includes 50 items that are organized into 8 sets of questions that
      cover the following areas:

      A) Prior experience with AD (5 items) B) Acceptance of screening for AD (6 items) C)
      Acceptance of screening for other conditions (2 items) D) Benefits of screening for AD (9
      items) E) Stigma of screening for AD (10 items) F) Impact of screening for AD on independence
      (6 items) G) Suffering of screening for AD (4 items) H) Demographics (7 items) Excluding
      section A and H (prior experience with AD and demographics), each item of the six other
      sections is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, don't know, disagree, and
      strongly disagree).

      Based on the previous PRISM-PC pilot study (a survey response rate of 80%) and the Dementia
      screening and diagnosis study (screening acceptance rate of 90%, positive dementia screening
      rate of 20% among participants aged 70 and older, and dementia diagnostic acceptance rate of
      50%), a total of 1,500 volunteers will be approached. A random selection of 200 participants
      will be re-administered the questionnaire within one week to test the short-term temporal
      stability of their responses (test-retest).
