      The purpose of this exploratory study is to evaluate the effects of sertindole and olanzapine
      on neurocognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits, including impairments in areas such as memory, attention, and executive
      function, are major determinants and predictors of long-term disability in schizophrenia. At
      present, available antipsychotic medications are relatively ineffective in improving
      cognition. However, scientific discoveries during the past decade suggest that it may be
      possible to develop medications that are effective in improving cognition in schizophrenia.

      One of the important reasons to focus on cognitive deficits as a target for pharmacological
      treatment, is the association found between cognitive impairment and social dysfunction
      observed in patients with schizophrenia. Pervasive cognitive deficits have a limiting effect
      on the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia including social interaction and
      problem solving, community living, and employment prospects.
