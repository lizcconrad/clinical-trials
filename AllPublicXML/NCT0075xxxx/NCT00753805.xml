      The study was performed to investigate the effects of mare's milk on SCORAD, faecal
      microbiota and immunological parameters in patients with atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mare's milk has been used in the treatment of inflammatory illnesses for centuries since it
      was known to contain antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory substances. The
      aim of this study was to examine whether the consumption of mare's milk by patients with
      atopic dermatitis (AD) has a beneficial effect.

      As a precondition for participating in this study, the subjects were provided information in
      writing and verbally about the details of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all
      volunteers. Before the beginning of the study, all participants were subject to a medical
      examination in the Clinic for Dermatology and Dermatologic Allergology of the Friedrich
      Schiller University Jena. The AD was diagnosed according to the atopy-score of Diepgen.
      Severity of eczema was evaluated by using the SCORAD score. A skin prick test was performed
      for the exclusion of type 1 sensitivity to mare's milk.

      The study was designed as a double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Twenty-three
      patients received 250-ml mare's milk or placebo orally for 16 consecutive weeks. Between the
      two intervention periods, a four week wash-out period without drinking any test substances
      was introduced. The intensity of AD was examined using the Severity Scoring of Atopic
      Dermatitis (SCORAD), which was determined at the start of the study and after 4, 8, 12 and 16
      weeks of each intervention period. Blood samples were taken at the start of the study and
      subsequently after 8 and 16 weeks. Fresh stool samples were taken at the beginning of the
      study and at the end of each intervention period.
