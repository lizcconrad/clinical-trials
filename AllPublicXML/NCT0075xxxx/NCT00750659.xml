  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapeutic results in advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are rather disappointing. Most of these patients will eventually
      undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Nilotinib is a novel TKI tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor with 30 fold more potency than Imatinib. Based on previous preliminary experience
      the author we rationalize that Nilotinib therapy pre- allogeneic transplantation for patients
      with advanced CML and Ph+ALL will reduce tumor mass pre- transplant achieving a state of
      minimal residual disease (MRD) and therefore may improve transplantation outcome without
      increasing toxicity. In addition it will allow time for improving patient medical condition
      and for finding an unrelated donor which will enable allogeneic transplantation , and to
      induce anti tumor effect post PBSC w\o DLI ( donor lymphocyte infusion)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Ph+ advanced CML (&gt;CR1) or Ph+ALL.

          2. Hematological, Cytogenetic (Ph+) and/or BCR/ABL positive documented at diagnosis of
             CML or Ph+ALL pre- alloSCT.

          3. Patients age 18-65 years of age.

          4. .Patients must have an HLA compatible donor willing and capable of donating peripheral
             blood stem cells (first choice) or bone marrow progenitor cells using conventional
             techniques, and blood lymphocytes if indicated (HLA compatible defined as 5/6 or 6/6
             matched related or matched unrelated donor.

          5. Adequate end organ function, defined as the following:

             total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2.5 x UNL , creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

          6. Patient must have LVEF&gt;45% prior entry into study.

          7. Patient must have QTc &lt;450 msec at study entry.

          8. Lung diffusion capacity (DLCO&gt;40% predicted)

          9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female
             patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of
             birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of
             study drug.

         10. Written, voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with CML in first chronic phase

          2. Patient has received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first day of
             study drug dosing, unless the disease is rapidly progressing.

          3. ECOG performance status &gt; 2

          4. Patient is &lt; 5 years free of another primary malignancy except: if the other primary
             malignancy is not currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention,
             or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma in
