    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized trial. A maximum of 130 patients will be enrolled, in a
      2:1 ratio to receive either the JACTAX LD stent or the TAXUS™ Libertè™ stent to evaluate the
      efficacy of the product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The JACTAX Drug Eluting Stent has been designed to minimize the amount of polymer in contact
      with the vessel surface, thus potentially reducing the incidence of untoward side effects.
      The Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating Process is capable of exclusive coating on the ablumenal
      side of pre-mounted bare metal stents. Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating is a proprietary
      formulation containing a bioerodable polymer. The combination of the Juxtaposed Ablumenal
      Coating Process and Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating create a unique microstructure surface, and
      reduces the amount of required polymer.

             (PCI)

          3. Patient demonstrates a LVEF of ≥ 25%

          4. Patient or legal guardian understands and agrees to comply with all specified study
             requirements and provides written informed consent to this effect.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Target lesion is de novo native coronary artery lesion (i.e., a coronary lesion not
             previously treated)

          2. The target lesion can be treated with a maximum of one stent, with adequate coverage
             onto the healthy tissue, as specified in visual estimate guidelines. Maximum lesion
             length is 20mm.

          3. The reference vessel diameter is between 2.75mm and 3.5mm

          4. Study lesion diameter stenosis is ≥70% (visual estimate) and &lt;100% and a TIMI flow &gt;1.

          5. Study lesion has been successfully pre-dilated

          6. Patients enrolled for treatment may demonstrate multiple lesions in target vessel.
             However lesions must be covered completely by one study stent.

          7. Patient must have no more than two lesions requiring treatments. These lesions must be
             in different vessel distributions. For example, if the target lesion is in the LAD,
             then the non target lesion must be present in either the circumflex or RCA. The
             non-study lesion may not be in a branch vessel or distal to the target vessel
             location.

          8. The non target lesion must be successfully treated prior to the treatment of the
             target lesion. The non target lesion must be treated with a TAXUS paclitaxel eluting
             stent or a bare metal stainless steel stent.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a life expectancy of less than 24 months due to another medical
             condition

          2. Patient has a history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or structurally related
             compounds

          3. Patient exhibits cardiogenic shock (systolic pressure &lt;80mmHg and PCWP &gt;20mmHg or
             cardiac index &lt;1.8 liters/minute/m or intra-aortic balloon pump or intravenous
             inotropes are needed to maintain a systolic pressure &gt;80mmHg) for any time within 24
             hours prior to index procedure

             &gt;2.0 mg/dl or 177 umol/l)

          5. Planned cardiac surgery procedure &lt;= 9 months post index procedure

          6. Patient demonstrates evidence of myocardial infarction (elevated CK, CKMB or Troponin)
             within 72 hours prior to the index procedure and/or CK &gt;2X local lab's ULN, unless
             CK-MB is &lt; 2X ULN

          7. Patient exhibits acute ST segment elevation MI within 72 hours prior to the index
             procedure

             months prior to planned index procedure

         14. Anticipated treatment with paclitaxel or oral rapamycin during any period in the 9
             months after the index procedure

         15. Patient has received a drug eluting stent within 12 months prior to planned index
