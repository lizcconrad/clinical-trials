      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from healthy volunteers in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This study is looking at genetic susceptibility to cancer and interactions between
      genes and the environment in healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To obtain blood samples and simple epidemiological information on a population-based
           series of adult individuals without cancer.

        -  To establish whether polymorphisms in putative cancer predisposition genes are
           associated with an increased risk of cancer by comparing the frequency of alterations in
           these genes with the corresponding frequency in a comparable series of cancer patients.

        -  To examine the interactions between genetic and non-genetic risk factors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants complete a simple epidemiological questionnaire.

      Participants undergo blood sample collection. DNA is extracted from these samples for
      polymorphism analysis of low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes in the following related
      clinical trials: MREC-SEARCH-CANCER, MREC-SEARCH-PROSTATE, and MREC-SEARCH-BREAST. They may
      also be used in the analyses of the following related clinical trials: MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN,
      MREC-SEARCH-ENDOMETRIAL, MREC-SEARCH-COLORECTAL.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 male and 2,000 female participants will be accrued for
      this study.
