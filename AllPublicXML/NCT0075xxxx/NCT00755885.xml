      RATIONALE: Abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of abiraterone
      acetate and to see how well it works in treating postmenopausal women with advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of abiraterone acetate in postmenopausal women
           with estrogen receptor- or androgen receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast
           cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of this drug in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To evaluate the clinical benefit rate of this drug at 24 weeks in these patients. (Phase
           II)

      Secondary

        -  To study the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the endocrine impact of this drug on the pituitary-adrenal-gonad endocrine
           axis. (Phase I)

        -  To estimate the duration of objective tumor response in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To correlate response rates and duration of response with the endocrine profile in these
           patients. (Phase II)

        -  To determine overall survival of these patients. (Phase II)

      Tertiary

        -  To enumerate and molecularly characterize circulating tumor cells.

        -  To identify normal genetic variations that predict resistance to this drug using
           pharmacogenomic analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I study followed by a phase II study. Patients enrolled
      in the phase II portion of the study are stratified according to hormone receptor status
      (estrogen receptor [ER]-positive and any androgen receptor [AR] status vs AR-positive and
      ER-negative).

      Patients receive oral abiraterone acetate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically and analyzed for pharmacokinetic assays (phase I
      only), pharmacodynamic assays, circulating tumor cells, and pharmacogenomic analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days.

             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative
             therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for five years and
             are deemed at low risk for recurrence, are eligible for the study.

         15. Significant cardiovascular disease as defined by:

               1. Congestive heart failure with severity NYHA III or IV (see Appendix 4);

         16. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
