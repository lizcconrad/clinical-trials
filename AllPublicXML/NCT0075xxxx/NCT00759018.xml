      For the treatment of pediatric patients who have failed to respond to steroid treatment for
      acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Failing steroid treatment for acute GVHD is defined
      as any Grade B-D (IBMTR grading) of acute GVHD that is not improving after at least 3 days of
      methylprednisolone (≥ 1 mg/kg/day) or equivalent.

      Patients will be treated with Prochymal twice per week at a dose of 2 x 10^6 hMSC/kg (actual
      body weight) for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Infusions will be administered at least 3 days
      apart.
