  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of alogliptin, once daily
      (QD), compared to diet and exercise, sulfonylurea, metformin and a combination of
      sulfonylurea and metformin for treating subjects with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of type 2
      diabetes mellitus varies among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to increase
      with age, obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity.
      Over the next decade, a disproportionate increase in the elderly population will result in a
      marked increase in diabetic patients, placing an ever-increasing burden on families and the
      health care system.

      In response to this problem, Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center, Inc. is developing
      SYR-322 (alogliptin), a selective, orally available inhibitor of the enzyme dipeptidyl
      peptidase IV. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo
      degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely
      glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 14 Weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include blood collection, urine collection,
      vital signs including sitting and standing blood pressure and pulse, body height and weight,
      physical examinations and electrocardiograms.

        <description>The incidence of marked hyperglycemia occurring in participants with a fasting plasma glucose value greater than or equal to 200 mg per dL during study. Overall mean obtained by weighting the hyperglycemia percent incidence values at each time point by number of days in between visits. Mean percent incidence of marked hyperglycemia at each time point is the percent of self-monitored blood glucose measurements greater than or equal to 200 mg per dL, calculated per participant and then averaged across population.</description>
