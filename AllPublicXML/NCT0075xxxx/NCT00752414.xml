  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) suffer from frequent and recurrent
      acute exacerbations (AECB) which are associated with enormous healthcare expenditures and
      significant morbidity, specifically an increased risk of death, a decline in pulmonary
      function and a significant change in quality of life. Bacteria appear to have an important
      role in acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis and COPD. Studies of acute exacerbations in
      COPD have shown a reduction in bacterial load with prolonged exacerbation-free interval. In
      addition, recent studies indicate that acquisition of a new strain of H. influenzae, M.
      catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa are responsible for many of these exacerbations.
      Chronic inflammation and bacterial infection predispose many patients to frequent and
      recurrent acute exacerbations.

      Mpex, (the sponsor on record at time of the study's initial registration) believes that
      intermittent administration of inhaled MP-376 in high risk patients will decrease the
      incidence of acute exacerbations by both by lowering the organism burden, and resultant
      inflammation, as well as pre-emptive eradication of any newly acquired bacterial strains.

      This study will be a Phase 1b, multi-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MP-376 solution for
      inhalation given for 5 days to COPD patients.
