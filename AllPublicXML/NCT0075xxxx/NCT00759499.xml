      Inclusion Criteria

        1. The subject must have a full thickness wound.

        2. The subject must be a candidate for sharp debridement.

        3. The subject must be 18 years of age or older

        4. The subject must be mentally competent as determined by the Principal Investigator.

      Exclusion Criteria

      1. The subject may not be currently incarcerated or pregnant.

        -  Nursing home and hospitalized subjects will not be excluded from this study because
           these subjects represent a large part of the wounded population.

    <description>The intent of this protocol is to salvage wound material that is normally destined for destruction, so it can be used in wound-related scientific studies. This clinical wound material can be studied in order to better understand the molecular, cellular, or ecological components of the wound system. These studies may be able to provide important insights into the keys of wound healing, wound persistence, or wound deterioration.</description>

        Subjects will be identified because their wound(s) possesses something of special interest.
        A special interest wound can include, but will not be limited to wounds that are rapidly
        deteriorating, wounds diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum, wounds showing unusually rapid
        wound healing, wounds with abnormal microorganisms, non-healing wounds, young wounds, and
        others.
