  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A one-year, randomized, attention placebo-controlled trial investigating the value of
      comprehensive adherence specific interventions, over the course of one year, to enhance
      adherence in both (a) newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma, or ocular hypertension patients,
      naive to medical therapy and (b) those who have failed monotherapy with any prostaglandin
      analogue (and are therefore candidates for adjunctive therapy) who then are randomized to
      receive only travoprost monotherapy. Subjects will be randomized to two different
      interventions involving direct physician education, each of which will take approximately the
      same amount of physician time: The first will be intensive adherence education that will
      continue throughout the year. The second will be intensive eye care education, but without
      any direct adherence education. All patients participating in the study will be monitored for
      adherence by the TDA. The study will demonstrate for the first time the role of
      adherence-specific training in improving patient adherence and will validate the TDA in
      monitoring and improving adherence in glaucoma. This will correlate with prior work that has
      documented that greater adherence is associated with marked improvement in intraocular
      pressure (IOP) control. A second goal will be seeing whether improving adherence will change
      the course of glaucoma therapy by making therapeutic failures into therapeutic successes by
      reducing the need for adjunctive therapy using only monotherapy with travoprost.

    <description>Intervention with travoprost therapy and TDA monitoring. Patients of this arm will also be prescribed travoprost and will be followed up in a standard clinical fashion. This group will receive a comparable amount of personal physician attention, but will not be given adherence, or glaucoma education and will not be told that their adherence will be monitored. Their attention placebo intervention will discuss the importance and techniques of good &quot;eye health&quot; (sunglasses, vitamins, cataract development, etc but no details, or discussion of either glaucoma or adherence) will insure that the study results are not a result of a change in physician attention to a patient, per se, rather than adherence training.</description>
