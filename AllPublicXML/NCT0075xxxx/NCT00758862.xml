      A national, prospective single arm phase II study investigating the pharmacokinetics and
      safety of the 2% TD1414 cream when applied 3 times daily for 7 days to adult patients with
      impetigo or Secondarily Infected Traumatic Lesions (SITL). A total of 20 patients will be
      enrolled.
