    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Achieving ≥30% Decrease From Baseline in Pain Intensity as Measured by WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Question 1 &quot;Pain Walking on a Flat Surface&quot; at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of week 4</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC for pain assessment by patient (0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with 0 represent &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represent &quot;extreme pain&quot;)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Patient WOMAC Domain Scores at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in 3 domain scores (pain, stiffness, and difficult in doing daily activity) of WOMAC at week 4 were measured. Each domain comprises of questions and VAS scales for scoring. For pain domain, 0 represents no pain and 100 represents extreme pain; for stiffness domain, 0 represents no stiffness and 100 represents extreme stiffness; for difficult in doing daily activity domain, 0 represents no difficulty and 100 represents most difficulty.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The IGART comprised of five categories: No response, poor response, fair response, good response, and excellent response. The percentage of participants who met the criteria of any of the 5 categories at baseline were collected.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who met the criteria of any of the 3 categories of EQ-5D at baseline and at week 4 were collected.The EQ-5D comprises of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression) to be answered using a 3-categorical Likert's scales of: [No problem, Some problem, and Not able to carry out] for mobility, self-care and usual activities and [Not present, moderate and extreme] for discomfort and anxiety/depression.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Patient TSQM (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) Domain Scores at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM consists of four domains (effectiveness; side effect; convenience and overall satisfaction), domain scores ranged from 0 (0=worst) to 100 (100=best) were derived from converting the original Likert's scales to VAS scale.</description>
