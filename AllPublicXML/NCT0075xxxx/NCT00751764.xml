        Inclusion criteria:

        Healthy lactating women aged 21 to 45 years inclusive at screening. Women should:

          -  Be at least 12-weeks postpartum after uncomplicated delivery with a full milk supply
             established.

             discontinued breastfeeding an infant in order to participate in the study.

          -  Not plan to breastfeed within 9 months of study drug administration.

          -  Be willing to fully express breast milk from both breasts during the duration of the
             milk collection portion of the study. Subjects must be able to express milk from each
             breast at each pumping session using a breast pump.

          -  Body mass index in the range of 18 to 35 kg/m2.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Presence or history of any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the
             study.

          -  Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal,
