      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic value of SENC to that provided by
      conventional wall motion analysis for the detection of inducible ischemia during
      DS-MRI.High-dose dobutamine stress magnetic resonance imaging (DS-MRI) is safe and feasible
      for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans. However, the assessment of cine
      scans relies on the visual interpretation of regional wall motion, which is subjective.
      Recently, Strain-Encoded MRI (SENC) has been proposed for the direct color-coded
      visualization of myocardial strain.

      The assessment of inducible regional wall motion abnormalities during high-dose dobutamine
      stress magnetic resonance imaging (DS-MRI) is an established clinical method with high
      diagnostic and prognostic value for the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease
      (CAD). However, the assessment of cine images relies on the visual interpretation of regional
      wall motion, which is subjective, and objective approaches for the detection of inducible
      ischemia with DS-MRI are still lacking.

      In our study Strain-Encoded-MRI (SENC) is used for the objective color-coded evaluation of
      regional myocardial strain during DS-MRI in patients with intermediate to high pretest
      probability for CAD. We anticipated that this technique would exhibit enhanced sensitivity
      for the detection of anatomically significant CAD compared to conventional wall motion
      reading, with invasive coronary angiography used as the standard reference.
