  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 10% and 25% of newly diagnosed stage IIIB/stage IV patients currently receive single
      agent chemotherapy regimens. A significant proportion of these patients will be elderly (70
      years of age) and many oncologists would consider intravenous vinorelbine or gemcitabine to
      be the standard of care in this patient population. It has been demonstrated that single
      agent vinorelbine offers therapeutic advantages to selected NSCLC patients over best
      supportive care alone.

      Carboplatin plus Alimta have an acceptable toxicity profile and few clinical problems so it
      could be acceptable its use in elderly patients.

      A randomised study is being performed therefore to assess whether progression free survival,
      the primary efficacy endpoint for this study, achieved with Carboplatin plus Alimta is
      superior than achieved with gemcitabine, one of the current standards of care in elderly
      patients with advanced NSCLC.
