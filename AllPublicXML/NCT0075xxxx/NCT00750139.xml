    <description>The first primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects in the NAFT-500 Cream, 2% or 2-week placebo groups with complete cure at Week 6.
The second primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects in the Naftin 1% Cream or 4-week placebo groups with complete cure at Week 6.
Complete cure was defined as negative mycology results from the central laboratory (dermatophyte culture and KOH) and absence of erythema, scaling, and pruritus that were evaluated using a 4 point severity scale.</description>

        <description>The first primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects in the NAFT-500 Cream, 2% or 2-week placebo groups with complete cure at Week 6.
The second primary efficacy variable was the percentage of subjects in the Naftin 1% Cream or 4-week placebo groups with complete cure at Week 6.
Complete cure was defined as negative mycology results from the central laboratory (dermatophyte culture and KOH) and absence of erythema, scaling, and pruritus that were evaluated using a 4 point severity scale.</description>

The FAS is the subset of all subjects in the Safety Evaluation Set (SES) with a positive culture at baseline for whom the primary efficacy variable is available.

          <title>Percentage of Subjects With Mycological Cure and Percentage of Subjects With Treatment Effectiveness at Week 6</title>
          <description>Mycological Cure was defined as negative KOH result and negative dermatophyte culture at Week 6. Treatment Effectiveness was defined as negative KOH, negative culture, and Scaling, Erythema, and Pruritus grades of 0 or 1 at Week 6.</description>
          <population>This was the Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprising of subjects in the Safety Evaluation Set (SES) with a positive culture at baseline for whom the primary efficacy variable was available. This was a Modified Intent to Treat (MITT) principle because the culture results were not available at the start of treatment.</population>
