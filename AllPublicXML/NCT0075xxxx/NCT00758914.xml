  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a variety of changes in the immune system. These changes result in a
      less effective immune response, which places the elderly at a greater risk for infection and
      disease. Respiratory infections cause a great number of morbidity and mortality in the
      elderly population. Vitamin E has been known to improve the immune response of the elderly
      and has been suggested for use in preventative strategies for this population. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the effect of one year vitamin supplementation on respiratory
      infection in the elderly population residing in nursing homes. This study was conducted using
      a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial at 33 long-term care facilities
      in the greater Boston area. A total of 617 subjects over the age of 65 were enrolled in the
      study, with 451 completers. The participants were supplemented wit either 200 IU of vitamin E
      per day or placebo. The primary outcomes consisted of respiratory tract infection, number of
      sick days, and antibiotic use. The study involved use of questionnaires, standard
      anthropometrics measurements, non-invasive body composition, blood and urine sample
      collection, and delayed type test (DTH) using the Mantoux method. This study has been closed
      since August 2000 and is in the stage of data analysis only.
