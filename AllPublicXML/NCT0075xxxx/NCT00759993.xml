  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of patients who suffer from mental illness are treated with serotonin regulating
      FDA approved medications. Some of these medications also block histamine transmission,
      increase blood prolactin levels, induce insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and promote
      sedation. All of which lead to weight gain and obesity. Many of these drugs are generally
      safe and effective but do carry the risk of a long term side effect in that acute and gradual
      weight gain of 10-30 pounds over a few months to a year of treatment. The detrimental gain of
      7% of pre-drug weight is reported with many antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and some
      antidepressants. This weight gain may subsequently add to medical co-morbidity ( ie diabetes,
      hypertension, osteoarthritis, coronary artery diseasem, hyperlipidemia… ) This therapeutic
      manipulation of brain serotonin functioning may be associated with abnormal increases in
      carbohydrate cravings, consumption and weight gain. It is possible that insulin resistance
      occurs as a direct effect or as an indirect effect of weight gain, particularly in patients
      prone to weight gain or diabetes due to genetic loading. Leptin, a chemical associated with
      feedback signaling that reduces appetite and adipose tissue growth may also become
      insensitive. These multiple insults may lead to the worst weight gain in patients taking
      clozapine, olanzapine, and mirtazapine.

      Diet and exercise and lifestyle modification are the usual initial interventions, though
      being depressed, anxious, bipolar, or schizophrenic often interferes with the ability to make
      these changes. In fact most of the studies which look at these weight loss interventions
      occur in patients who are institutionalized, on restricted diets and may respond to token
      economy systems while on longer term inpatient unit stays. This token economy approach is not
      easily translated to usual outpatient or short term inpatient practice settings. In these
      settings, if lifestyle modification approaches fail, patients may be placed on FDA approved
      diet medications (sibutramine, orlistat, ionamin…) which carry significant side effect risks.
      Some patients are even placed on the epilepsy medications such as zonisamide or topiramate at
      an even greater side effect risk.

      In a similar weight gain prone group, there is growing literature in the diabetes population
      that the use of high dose chromium improves (lowers) insulin resistance by way of increasing
      insulin binding to cells, receptor numbers, and insulin receptor kinase activity. Lower
      fasting blood glucose levels in the blood generally occurs. Some reports show a reduction in
      blood lipid/cholesterol levels at higher chromium dosing as well. Recently, chromium
      piccolinate was studied in depressed patients, especially those with atypical features
      (usually fatigue, weight gain, carbohydrate cravings). Although there was no change in
      depression symptoms overall, carbohydrate cravings improved. This paper was presented at the
      2005 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting in Atlanta. As a foil, a few papers in
      non-diabetics,non-depressed healthy volunteers showed little to no effectiveness in lowering
      blood sugar levels. Furthermore, one investigator (JLM) has published data showing acute ,
      clinically significant weightgain in serotonergically treated psychiatric inpatients. The
      authors theorize that the use of chromium may reduce carbohydrate craving, appetite and thus
      protect against weight gain side effects.

      Given this pivotal paper in the depressed population, effectiveness data in the diabetes
      population and some possible metabolic ties between these two populations, the author wishes
      to study the effect of chromium piccolinate in mentally ill subjects who are being started on
      serotonergic manipulating medications while in an inpatient treatment setting. These patients
      will be followed during their inpatient stay and then be followed after discharge for a
      single visit to determine acute interventional effects of chromium piccolinate. We feel
      chromium piccolinate is less toxic/hazardous than many of the weght loss medications that we
      currently use and therefore suggest a long term randomized, controlled study where subjects
      will receive active drug (chromium piccolinate) or placebo at the start of any serotonergic
      treatment while inpatient. The chromium piccolinate and the placbo will be obtained from the
      Nutrition 21 company, which has been approved by the FDA as a source of this product.

          -  The subject must express concern about weight gain as a potential serotonin side
             effect.

          -  The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history,
             medical examination, and cannot have major medical illness that would jeopardize
             patient health during the study.

          -  Women must be of nonchildbearing potential [i.e., postmenopausal, be surgically
             sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation)] or must meet all of the following

          -  Women must be given a urine pregnancy test (ßHCG), unless they are at least 2 years
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile, and the results of the test must be negative.

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to remain
             at the clinic for the required duration during the study period, and willing to return

             utilize the informed consent process due to their mental illness.

          -  The patient is incapacitated by mental illness

             insulin resistance improving drug OR plans to start one upon discharge

          -  The patient has a co-morbid medical problem thought to induce weight gain or make it
             difficult to lose weight (ie hypothyroid, hypercortisol, diabetes…)

          -  The patient has previously ( in the last 2 months) lost or gained a significant amount
             of weight from any weight loss program, weight loss agent, or dietary medication.

          -  The patient has used an investigational drug within 1 month before the screening visit
             or is participating in a concurrent clinical trial.

             metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery).

          -  The patient is highly unlikely to comply with the study protocol, be unreliable in
             providing ratings, or is unsuitable for any reason, as judged by the investigator.

          -  The patient has a clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical
             examination or medical history (renal or hepatic problems) which makes subject
             medically unstable at time of screening.

          -  The subject can not be currently on any medication that is clearly being used to lower
             weight. Examples include: Xenical, Metformin, Wellbutrin, Topomax, psycho-stimulants,
