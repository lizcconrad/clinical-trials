  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine the pharmacodynamics, cardiovascular and
      biochemical effects of succinylcholine when given during electroconvulsive therapy. (ECT).
      This is a single center, prospective, study in patients who will be receiving ECT as
      indicated and prescribed by their psychiatrist. The study will be performed twice on each
      patient, 48-72 hours apart during consecutively scheduled ECT procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive the anesthetic that is traditionally given which includes appropriate
      doses of succinylcholine. Serum potassium and creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels will be
      determined pre and post anesthesia; serum and urine myoglobin will be determined post
      anesthesia. Vital signs data [i.e., heart rate (arrhythmias) and arterial blood pressure]
      will be compared pre and post anesthesia. In addition patients will be asked about the
      presence of muscle pain (myalgia) 1 hour before discharge from the recovery room and the
      following day post ECT.
