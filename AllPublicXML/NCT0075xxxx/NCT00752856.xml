  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCTG 589 is a randomized, open-label, pilot study comparing the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of RAL plus LPV/r to EFV plus TDF/FTC in HIV-infected, treatment-naïve subjects.
      Subjects will be ineligible if they have any evidence of drug resistant virus in the past or
      at the time of screening (if never previously tested). Those who are found to be eligible
      will be randomized 1:1 to initiate either LPV/r (400/100 mg) plus RAL (400mg), both given
      twice-daily, or fixed dose combination of EFV (600 mg), TDF (300 mg) and FTC (200 mg) given
      as once-daily Atripla® for 48 weeks.

      Hypotheses

        1. The novel nucleoside-sparing combination of LPV/r + RAL will have a faster phase 1 viral
           decay rate compared to standard-of-care therapy with EFV/TDF/FTC in antiretroviral-naïve
           patients.

             1. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with improved longer-term
                (week 48) viral suppression.

             2. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with accelerated early (Day
                0-14) clearance of cell-associated HIV DNA.

             3. Faster phase 1 viral decay dynamics will be associated with greater early (baseline
                to week 12) CD4+ T-cell recovery.

        2. The LPV/r + RAL arm will have greater decreases in early (baseline to week 4) CD4/CD8
           T-cell immune activation and apoptosis which will be associated with greater late (week
           12 to week 48) CD4+ T-cell recovery.

        3. Subjects treated with LPV/r + RAL arm will have smaller changes in total cholesterol and
           triglycerides from baseline than those receiving EFV/TDF/FTC.
