  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to demonstrate bioequivalence of Wosulin R to Actrapid with regard
      to its total and to its maximum serum insulin concentrations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test for bioequivalence based on the pharmacokinetic
      parameters Cmax and AUC0-12h between two recombinant soluble human insulin preparations. The
      study also compares the other pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic profiles as well
      as assesses safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations in type 1
      diabetics.

          -  Insulin treatment for at least 12 months before the screening visit

          -  Daily basal insulin requirement between 0.2 and 0.6 IU/kg/day (both inclusive) and
             current total daily insulin dose less than 1.2 IU/kg/day.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 35.0 kg/m2

          -  HbA1c less than or equal to 10.0%

          -  Fasting C-peptide &lt; 0.4 nmol/L

          -  Non-smoker, no nicotine consumption for at least one year.

          -  Subjects considered generally healthy, except for the underlying diabetes mellitus and
             related morbidity (such as well controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia)

          -  Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within 30 days of dosing
             or 5 half-lives of any investigational drug, whichever is longer. If half life of the
             investigational drug is unknown, previous participation in other clinical trials
             within 3 months of dosing.

          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding or intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate
             contraceptive measures (defined as intrauterine device that has been in place for at
             least 3 months, double barrier contraception, sterilization or abstinence, or oral
             contraceptive pill, which should have been taken without difficulty for at least 3
             months, or an approved hormonal implant).

          -  Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged

             the range of 90-140 mmHg systolic or 50-90 mmHg diastolic, or pulse rate outside the
             range 40 to 90 beats per minute, or who are requiring more than two anti-hypertensive
             medications.

          -  Severe neuropathy (in particular autonomic neuropathy), retinopathy or maculopathy

          -  Clinically significant abnormal ECG at screening

          -  Recurrent major hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic unawareness as judged by the investigator
             or hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis during the 6 months preceding the
             screening visit.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past five years and/or any positive test for
             drugs of abuse at screening.

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B or C or HIV

          -  Any systemic treatment with drugs known to interfere with glucose metabolism such as
             systemic corticoids, non-selective beta-blockers, thyroid hormone and monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors within 3 months prior to the first dosing visit.

          -  Use of drugs which may interfere with the interpretation of trial results or are known
             to cause clinically relevant interference with insulin action, glucose utilization or
             recovery from hypoglycemia

          -  Blood donation of more than 500 mL within the last 12 weeks

          -  History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe
