  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study using two FDA approved medications: Testosterone and the study medication,
      Dutasteride (Avodart 0.5mg/day). Half of the subjects will receive dutasteride and half will
      receive a placebo. The study medication will be taken for 12 months.

      The subjects participating in the study are men who are already taking their own testosterone
      supplement because they have low testosterone levels which may cause them to experience
      sexual function difficulties, have fatigue or other symptoms. Testosterone can have an
      adverse effect of causing an enlarged prostate (Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy) (BPH).

      Dutasteride (Avodart) is an approved medication used to decrease the prostate size, prevent
      urinary symptoms and reduce the risk of surgery.

      The researchers would like to see if by taking dutasteride and testosterone at the same time
      they can prevent the adverse effects of testosterone and at the same time get the positive
      benefits of testosterone.

      There will be 6 scheduled visits for the study and 2 diagnostic tests called a TRUS
      (TransRectal UltraSound), to evaluate prostate size. The six visits at will include
      consenting, blood work, two sexual function questionnaires, a physical examination, physical
      measurements, study medication teaching and dispensing of study medication.

             using either the approved transdermal products Androgel® or Testim®, or injections of
             testosterone enanthate or cypionate with a morning serum testosterone concentration
             within the normal range (300 - 1000 ng/dl). These will dispensed either by

             exception that bilirubin elevations up to 2.0 times the upper limit of normal in the
             presence of normal liver enzymes will be permitted in patients with documented
