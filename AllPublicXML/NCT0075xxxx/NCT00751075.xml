    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety of mometasone nasal spray
      once daily or twice daily with amoxicillin or with placebo in treating the signs and symptoms
      of acute rhinosinusitis. Patients received mometasone nasal spray 2 sprays per nostril once
      daily, 2 sprays per nostril twice daily, amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day, or placebo
      three times a day. Patients on nasal spray were treated for 15 days and patients on
      amoxicillin or placebo were treated for 10 days. All patients were followed-up with a 14-day
      no-treatment observation period.
