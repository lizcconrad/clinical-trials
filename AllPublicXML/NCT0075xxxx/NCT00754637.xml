    <textblock>
      FDA has cleared this device via premarket notification 510(k) K063732. By being CE Marked,
      the Microplasty Tibial Tray also conforms to the essential requirements of EC Directive
      93/42/EEC; in accordance to 13485:2003. The data gathered would be collated and used to
      provide feedback to design engineers, support marketing efforts, and answer potential
      questions from reimbursement agencies, and will serve as a part of Biomet's Post Market
      Surveillance System.

      Inclusion/exclusion criteria are identical to those indications and contraindications stated
      in the FDA approved labeling for the device in 510(k) K063732 Surgical techniques and patient
      care are to be standard for the surgeon participating in the protocol and should be
      maintained the same throughout the course of the data-collection. There will be no
      experimental or investigational devices used. There will be no experimental or
      investigational surgical techniques used. The devices and products will be used in accordance
      with their instructions for use and/or approved labeling. Any use of the device or collection
      of clinical data outside of the United States should comply with all local, state, and/or
      national and international regulations.

      Function will be assessed through the Knee Society Score . Survivorship will be documented by
      asking the surgeon to document revisions and complications.

          -  Need to obtain pain relief and improve function

          -  Ability and willingness of the patient to follow instructions, including control of
             weight and activity level

          -  A good nutritional state of the patient, and

          -  The patient must have reached full skeletal maturity

        Non-coated (Interlock®) devices are indicated for cemented application only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria will be identical to the contraindications stated in the FDA
