  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Becker
      Expander/Breast Implant in women who are undergoing primary breast reconstruction. Safety
      information on the rate of complications, such as infection will be collected, and used to
      help determine device safety. These implants are investigational devices.

      Approximately 300 patients at centers across the United States will be enrolled in this
      research study, by up to 30 sites. These patients will be implanted with Becker
      Expander/Breast Implant and monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated
      with the implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.

    <textblock>
      Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in
      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A pre-market approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision subjects.
      Every subject implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, in addition to being offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects. In order to be implanted
      with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in an IDE clinical trial.

      A PMA for Mentor's MemoryGelâ„¢ Silicone Gel-Filled breast implants (which did not include the
      Becker Expander/Breast Implants) was subsequently filed with FDA in December 2003, and
      approved in November 2006 (P030053). As a condition of approval of P030053, new enrollment in
      Mentor's Adjunct Study has ceased, and women no longer have access to the Becker
      Expander/Breast Implants.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Becker
      Expander/Breast Implants for primary breast reconstruction

    <description>The study population will consist of women aged 18 or over who are undergoing primary breast reconstruction.
The Reconstruction cohort will include subjects with loss of breast tissue due to mastectomy, contralateral breast for post-reconstruction symmetry or subjects with deformities secondary to disease, malignancy, trauma, and congenital deformity. Subjects in this cohort cannot have been implanted with breast implants, but may have tissue expanders. A Becker implant is considered a tissue expander until the port and fill tube have been removed. Women who undergo surgery primarily for a mastopexy will not be part of the reconstruction cohort.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mentor Smooth Becker 50 Expander/Breast Implant</intervention_name>
    <description>The Mentor Becker Expander/Breast Implant is comprised of two components: the Becker implant and the injection dome/fill tube. The breast implant is available in a smooth surface. It has a low bleed, gel-filled outer lumen and an adjustable saline-fillable inner lumen. The silicone elastomer fill tube is pre-inserted into the dual self-sealing valve system at the time of manufacture and is joined to the injection dome by the connector system at the time of surgery. The inner lumen can be gradually filled with saline over an extended period of time via the fill tube by injecting saline through the injection dome. Once expanded to the desired volume, the fill tube and injection dome are removed through a small incision under local anesthetic, and the prosthesis remains in position as a breast implant.</description>
