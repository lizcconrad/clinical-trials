    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the relative pharmacodynamic effects and safety of
      crushed and whole ALO-01 compared to MSIR and to Placebo, and of crushed ALO-01 to whole
      ALO-01; to determine the relative bioavailability of plasma morphine from crushed and whole
      ALO-01 compared to MSIR, and from crushed ALO-01 to whole ALO-01; and to determine the
      relative bioavailability of plasma naltrexone and 6-Î²-naltrexol from crushed ALO-01 to whole
      ALO-01.

          -  Male or female subjects 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Subjects had to be opioid users who were not currently physically dependent on opioids
             (based on DSM-IV criteria) but had experience in the use of opioids for
             non-therapeutic purposes (i.e. for psychoactive effects) on at least 10 occasions
             within last year and at least once in the 12 weeks prior to the screening session.

          -  Subjects had to be healthy as indicated by medical history, physical examination,
             vital signs, oxygen saturation, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead ECG performed
             at the screening session.

          -  Subjects had to consent to use two medically acceptable methods of contraception
             throughout the entire study period, including washout periods, and for females until
             one week after the study was completed.

          -  Female subjects had to have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a
             negative urine pregnancy test prior to the qualifying session and each treatment
             session, and not be lactating.

          -  Subject was willing and able to remain in the study unit for the entire duration of
             each confinement period and return to the study site for any outpatient visits.

          -  Subjects with a positive urine drug screen for opiates, amphetamines, cocaine and
             benzodiazepines at screening could enroll, provided they tested negative for the
             substances at the qualifying and each treatment session and had no clinically observed
             signs or symptoms of drug withdrawal.

          -  Subjects with a positive urine screen of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at screening could
             be enrolled, provided the THC levels were stable or decreasing on subsequent drug
             screens (prior to the qualifying and each treatment session).

          -  Subjects with body mass index (BMI) within the range 21-31 kg/m2 and weight greater
             than 55 kg, inclusive.

          -  Subjects had to voluntarily consent to participate in this study, provide their
             written informed consent prior to commencement of any study-specific procedures and
             understand that they were free to withdraw from the study at any time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects excluded from the study were those:

             hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurologic, oncologic or psychiatric disease or any other condition, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the
             validity of the study results.

          -  With a history of clinically significant brain conditions (e.g., neoplasms,
             cerebrovascular disease, history of stroke, syncope, infectious disease or significant
             head trauma) or currently were being treated with medications or treatment regimens
             that lower seizure threshold.

          -  With a history or presence of drug or alcohol dependence excluding nicotine and
             caffeine. This included subjects who had ever been in a drug rehabilitation program.

          -  Who had a current psychiatric illness, except nicotine dependence. Subjects with a

          -  Who had a history of allergic or adverse response to the study drugs or related drugs.

          -  Who had started a significantly restrictive diet during the four weeks preceding the
             first dose of study medication (qualifying session).

          -  Who had donated blood or plasma within 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Male subjects with hemoglobin less than 125 g/L and female subjects with hemoglobin
             less than 115 g/L.

          -  Who had participated in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to the first dose
             of study medication (qualifying session).

          -  Who had used any over-the-counter (OTC) medication, including vitamins and natural
             health products, within seven days prior to the first dose of study medication
             (qualifying session) without evaluation and approval by the study investigator.

          -  Who had used any prescription medication, except hormonal contraceptives or hormonal
             replacement therapy, within seven days prior to the first dose of study medication
             (qualifying session) without evaluation and approval by the study investigator.

          -  Who had a history of glaucoma or any other pupil abnormalities that in the opinion of
             the qualified investigator or designee could interfere with the ability to perform
             pupillometry.

          -  Who were not able to abstain from nicotine smoking while being in the clinical unit

          -  Who had had a positive test for or been treated for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

          -  Who had current or pending legal charges.

          -  Who, in the opinion of the investigator, was not considered to be suitable and was
