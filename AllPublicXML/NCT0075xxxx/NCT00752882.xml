  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningitis is an infection where morbidity and mortality depend on the delay of the initial
      treatment for a good prognostic. The antibiotherapy rapidity allows to decrease the
      mortality. Intermittent administration of ceftazidime is a reference treatment of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa meningitis. In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumopathy, ceftazidime can be
      administered by intermittent injections or by continuous perfusion. The continuous
      administration of ceftazidime is not validated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa meningitis. However,
      ceftazidime is a time dependant antibiotic and continuous treatment would provide a more
      efficient therapeutic. The aim of this study is to determine if the continuous administration
      of ceftazidime could permit a better therapeutic practice of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      meningitis compared with intermittent administrations.

      This study will compare the administration of ceftazidime by intermittent intravenous
      injections (29 mg/kg 30min Ã—3/day) and by continuous infusion (86 mg/kg/24 h, preceded by 29
      mg/kg/30 min). The main evaluation criterion of the study is the measure of the time during
      which ceftazidime concentration is above minimal inhibitive concentration of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa in cerebrospinal fluid. This study will be developed in a neurological intensive
      care department. Inclusion criteria will be essentially, patients aged over 18 years old,
      hospitalised for a cerebrolesion associated to a hydrocephalus drained by an external
      ventricular derivation, an acquired pneumopathy under mechanic ventilation since more 7 days
      in the department of neurological intensive care. This study is a prospective randomised,
      simple blind and divided in two parts. The first part of the study is a study with parallel
      group comparing the treatment initiation between a continuous and an intermittent treatment
      of ceftazidime. The second part of the study is a cross-over study. One patient group will
      receive a continuous treatment of ceftazidime and the other patient group will receive an
      intermittent treatment of ceftazidime.
