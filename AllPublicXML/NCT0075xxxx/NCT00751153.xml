  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with HIV who have viral suppression on current regimen but also have side
      effects/intolerance will change their current regimen to a combination of Raltegravir and
      Atazanavir and be monitored for viral and immunological response and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with intolerance to current regimen will receive Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and
      Atazanavir 400 mg daily will be monitored for viralogical and immunological outcomes, changes
      in lipids, renal and hepatic safety and quality of life.
