    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies have shown that SNDX-275 is able to reactivate the expression of EGFR,
      E-cadherin and ErbB3 expression. The combination of SNDX-275 with erlotinib (an EGFRi) in
      patients who are progressing on erlotinib will show measurable activity as evidenced by the
      disease control rate and with an acceptable safety profile.

             greater than grade 1 toxicity on CTCAE scale or to prior baseline condition)

          4. At least 1 measurable lesion ≥ 20mm by conventional CT scan or ≥ 10mm by spiral CT
             scan
