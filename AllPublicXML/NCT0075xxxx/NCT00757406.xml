      To demonstrate that ImpediMed L-Dex U400 can be used to assess unilateral Lymphoedema of the
      leg using the same principles for arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When Lymphoedema is present, lymph and other fluids build up in the interstitial spaces of
      the tissues. This results in an overall increase in the total amount of extracellular fluid
      (ECF) in the limb, causing swelling. This can be documented by measuring the impedance
      (opposition) to a low frequency current that has been passed into the limb. Low frequency
      current travels predominantly through the ECF, where the Lymphoedema manifests. As the fluid
      builds up in the limb, the impedance to the current decreases and it is in this way that low
      frequency bioimpedance is able to assess Lymphoedema.

      Multi-frequency bio-impedance analysis otherwise known as Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) has
      been reported to be effective for the measurement of ECF and sub clinical changes in ECF to
      predict the onset of Lymphoedema in the arms in studies conducted by Cornish et al. It has
      been reported by Warren et al that BIS can be used as a reliable and accurate tool for
      documenting presence of lymphoedema in patients with wither upper- or lower-extremity
      swelling.

      The L-Dex U400 device uses an &quot;impedance ratio&quot; methodology to assess unilateral Lymphoedema
      of the arm. By this method the unaffected arm acts as an internal and subject specific
      control. The strategy of this study is to show that the L-Dex U400 can use this methodology
      to assess unilateral leg Lymphoedema.
