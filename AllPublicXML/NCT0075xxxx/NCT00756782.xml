  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TAC-101 after
      Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with advanced, unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are being scheduled for TACE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a commonly performed procedure in the
      treatment of unresectable liver tumors for selected patients. TACE is a major palliative
      treatment for these patients. Most patients will have intrahepatic recurrence of their tumors
      following TACE. In this study, which will be conducted in Asian countries excluding Japan,
      TAC-101 will be administered as maintenance therapy after TACE compared with placebo therapy
      after TACE to patients with advanced HCC who are being scheduled for TACE and who either have
      not had any previous TACE procedures or who received their most recent TACE at least 120 days
      before signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and the TACE procedure resulted in complete
      necrosis, to determine if TAC-101 will enhance the benefits of TACE.
