  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Faster recovery from anesthesia is important for obese patients because they are at high risk
      of respiratory complications following tracheal extubation. Isoflurane has several properties
      that make it a preferable agent for anesthesia in obese patients. Its main limitation is a
      longer recovery time due to slower elimination in comparison to other agents. Elimination of
      isoflurane from the lungs can be accelerated by increasing in patient's minute ventilation,
      which decreases the level of CO2 in blood (hypocapnia).Isocapnic Hyperpnoea (IH) is a method
      allowing increased ventilation and therefore enhancement of the elimination of inhalation
      agents while maintaining a normal blood CO2 level. The investigators will compare recovery
      time from isoflurane anesthesia in obese patients during standard anesthesia management
      protocol (control) to a group treated with IH.

    <description>Patient will be disconnected from the anesthetic circuit and connected to the resuscitation bag attached to the IH system. Ventilation will be assisted to maintain tidal volume of 8-10 mL/kg and respiratory rate of 20-25 breaths per minute to achieve minute ventilation of 15-20 L/min. Isocapnia manifold will maintain end-tidal PCO2 in range of 40-50 mm Hg.</description>
