  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Core Gel Study is designed to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Round
      Low-Bleed Silicone Gel-filled Mammary Prostheses in women who are undergoing primary
      augmentation, primary reconstruction, or revision. Safety information on the rate of capsular
      contracture, rupture, and infection will be collected, and used to help determine device
      safety.

      Approximately 1000 patients at centers across the United States will be enrolled in this
      research study. These patients will be implanted with silicone breast prostheses and
      monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the implant surgery as
      well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.

    <textblock>
      Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in
      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A premarket approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision patients.
      Every patient implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, and had to be offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant patients. In order to be implanted
      with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in a core clinical study.

      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the smooth and
      textured surface Mentor Round Low-Bleed Silicone Gel-filled Mammary Prostheses in women who
      are undergoing primary breast augmentation, primary breast reconstruction or revision.

    <intervention_name>Mentor Round Low Bleed Gel-filled Mammary Protheses, both Siltex and Smooth Surface</intervention_name>
    <description>Two types of Mentor Round Low-Bleed Silicone Gel-filled Mammary Prostheses will be used in the study: the Siltex textured surface device and the smooth surface device. Each implant is a silicone elastomer (rubber) mammary device that is supplied individually packaged in a doubled wrapped packaging system, sterile, and non-pyrogenic (does not cause fever). Each device consists of a silicone shell encasing a silicone gel filler material with a patch on the posterior side of the device. The basic smooth device shell consists of a silicone layer sandwiched in between two other silicone layers. This construction acts as a barrier to slow the diffusion of (spread) any gel filler materials through the shell. The Siltex textured shell consists of a smooth shell to which is bonded an additional layer of silicone with a textured pattern imprinted into its surface. The Siltex shell is intended to prevent tissue ingrowth. The implants will be available in sizes 100cc through 800ccs.</description>

The need to differentially pad one bra cup to match the opposite breast size.
Asymmetry due to chest wall deformity such as scoliosis or other deformities of the thoracic cage and/or associated visible differences in shoulder height that can make one breast appear to be at a different height than the other.</description>
