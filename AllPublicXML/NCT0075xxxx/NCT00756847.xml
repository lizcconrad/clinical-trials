  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL147 in combination
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin in adults with solid tumors. XL147 is a new chemical entity
      that inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce
      apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells. In clinical practice, the combination of
      paclitaxel and carboplatin is an accepted treatment regimen for various solid tumors,
      including ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
