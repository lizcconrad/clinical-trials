    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common problem in the adult population. By conservative
      estimates, 4% of the adult female population has SDB. SDB is a recognized cause of
      hypertension and treating SDB can improve blood pressure control in people with hypertension.
      More recently, research efforts have looked at SDB as a possible cause of pregnancy induced
      hypertension (PIH), a condition which complicates 10% of pregnancies. Traditionally, the best
      way to assess SDB required patients to spend a night sleeping in the Sleep Laboratory. This
      is inconvenient and for pregnant women often impossible to arrange, considering the short
      time frame that exists between time of PIH diagnosis and eventual delivery. Researchers at
      the University of Saskatchewan are now looking at whether an adequate sleep assessment can be
      performed at the bedside - either in a patient's home or on the hospital ward. The
      researchers will also look at different treatment options for sleep apnea, to see if these
      can improve blood pressure control in this patient population, and delay the need for early
      delivery. The information from this study may result in a detailed sleep assessment becoming
      part of the complete assessment of women with PIH. There is an association between sleep
      disordered breathing (SDB) and gestational hypertension (GHTN). Treatment for the SDB may
      represent an effective addition to the management of the cardiovascular and metabolic
      perturbations of GHTN We plan to assess women whether treating SDB with one of two methods
      will improve the management of GHTN. We will also assess if one method is more effective than
      the other.
