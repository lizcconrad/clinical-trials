  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache during fasting is a known entity in the scientific literature. The prevalence of
      such a headache is high and in a study conducted in Israel was found in 60% of people with a
      previous predilection for headache. A prior study showed a significant decrease in the
      incidence of fasting headache using rofecoxib, but the drug has been taken off the market.
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of etoricoxib as treatment taken before
      the fast- a COX-2 inhibitor with a relatively long half life to prevent fasting induced
      headache. The study will be a prospective double blind placebo controlled trial using adult
      volunteers with a history of a fasting headache who will be abstaining from food and drink on
      Yom Kippur.

      The study hypothesis is that treatment with etoricoxib prior to a 25 hour fast will decrease
      the incidence of fasting headache.

    <textblock>
      Fasting is a known trigger for headache. More specifically, headache associated with ritual
      fasting in compliance with religious edict has been documented and described in the
      literature. These have been described in Jewish and Muslim ritual fasts, and have been dubbed
      'Yom Kippur headache,' and 'First of Ramadan headache' respectively. The incidence of fasting
      associated headache during the 25 hour fast of Yom Kippur (YK) wherein no food or drink is
      ingested, has been documented in approximately 40% of participants, but as high as 66% of
      those prone to headache. (1) A recent study was published in which the authors were able to
      show a marked reduction in YK headache using rofecoxib 50mg, a Cox 2 specific nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory medication with a relatively long (17 hour) half life. In a placebo
      controlled double blind randomized trial, in a population with a history of fasting headache,
      the drug was ingested just prior to the start of the fast. The placebo group had an incidence
      of headache 65% of the time whereas the treatment group had an incidence of 19%. Headache in
      the treatment set was also on average milder than in the controls. These results were all
      significant statistically. (3)

      Unfortunately for sufferers of fasting headache, rofecoxib (Vioxx), has been removed from the
      market and is no longer available.

      We therefore propose to conduct a second study using etoricoxib (Arcoxia) - a Cox 2 specific
      antiinflammatory medication with a longer half life than rofecoxib.
