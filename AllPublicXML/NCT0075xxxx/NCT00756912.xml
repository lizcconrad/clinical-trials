  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to assess the safety of administration of up to 3 dose levels of
      eritoran in subjects undergoing or scheduled to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant
      (BMT). An allogeneic BMT is the transplantation of blood stem cells taken from the bone
      marrow or blood of another person.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria outlined below in order to be eligible to
        participate in this study:

          1. Adult subjects (aged 18 to 55 years old) undergoing or scheduled to undergo
             myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic BMT, or stem cells from matched donors.

          2. Subjects using either busulfan or total body irradiation (TBI) containing regimens for
             BMT for the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant diseases. For example:

               -  Cyclophosphamide and Total Body Irradiation (CY-TBI) with a TBI dose of at least
                  1200 cGy of fractionated TBI

               -  Etoposide and Total Body Irradiation (VP16-TBI) with a TBI dose of at least 1200
                  cGy of fractionated TBI

               -  Busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU-CY) with at least 14 mg/kg busulfan orally or
                  11.2 mg/kg busulfan intravenously (14 x 0.8 correction factor) or a targeted
                  busulfan dosing strategy aimed at a serum concentration greater than 600 ng/mL at
                  steady state.

          3. Leukemia patients with:

               -  acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)

               -  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or subsequent complete remission

               -  chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in first or subsequent chronic phase or in
                  accelerated phase

               -  myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.

             OR

             Subjects with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who are in complete remission as determined by
             physical exam, CT and PET scans, and are otherwise considered candidates for
             allogeneic BMT as judged by the treating institution

          4. Available matched related CD34+ stem cells (target cell dose between 2 x 10^6/kg and
             10 x 10^6/kg (actual body weight)) for transplantation (matched at 6/6 HLA at Class I
             HLA-A and B and Class II HLA-DRBI).

          5. Sex distribution: men or nonpregnant women. Women of childbearing potential must have
             a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or urine assay prior to eritoran
             treatment or prior to the beginning of conditioning treatment. Menopausal women must
             have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months.

          6. Race: any.

          7. Has signed informed consent before any study-specific procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwilling or unable to agree to be fully evaluated for all follow-up visits. The
             subject or subject's representative and the study staff should agree to perform all
             study assessments even if the subject is discharged from the hospital.

          2. Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); testing is not needed if already
             performed (documentation required) as part of screening for conditioning treatment.

          3. Subjects with a documented or possible systemic infection, or suspected of having a
             medically significant viral, bacterial, or fungal infection at the beginning of
             treatment on Day -3.

          4. Have taken any investigational medications (ie, not approved by the FDA for any
             indication) within the 30-day period prior to enrollment into the study.

          5. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &lt;60%.

          6. Have previously received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.

          7. Are to receive T-cell depleted BMT or stem cell infusions.

          8. Are pregnant or lactating.

          9. Known sensitivity to eritoran or its excipients.

         10. Prior malignancies treated with a curative intent of &lt; 5 years will not be allowed.
             Previously treated cancer with a curative intent of &gt; 5 years will be allowed.

         11. Legal incapacity.

         12. Any of the following laboratory parameters within 2 days prior to the beginning of
             treatment on Day -3:

               -  direct bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN

               -  liver function tests (ALT or AST) with values ≥ 3x ULN

               -  serum creatinine ≥ 2x ULN

         13. Subjects who are enrolled in other interventional, investigational protocols. As aGvHD
             is likely to only occur after treatment with eritoran is completed, investigational
             treatments for Grades III and IV aGvHD may be allowed and should be discussed with the
             Sponsor.

         14. Subjects with a history of or with current pulmonary disease with forced vital
             capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 60% predicted
             (corrected for hemoglobin).

         15. Subjects with a history of a cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 45%, or with marked screening
             or baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval (QTc interval &gt; 470 mSec).
