  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit
      smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking
      cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of
      smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed
      clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED
      patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the
      Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we
      will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency
      departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will
      perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based
      on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on
      brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that
      includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to
      Quitline Iowa for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and
      4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients
      to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month
      telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical
      confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the
      contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of
      guideline-recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic
      regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables.
      In secondary analyses, we will assess the change in attitudes of ED nurses and physicians
      toward smoking cessation counseling. This feasibility study will determine the receptivity of
      patients and ED staff to the guideline-based intervention and will provide estimates of
      effect size in planning a full scale multi-site clinical trial of the study intervention in
      community hospital EDs.
