      Purpose: Comparing a GnRH agonist and an antagonist protocol for IVF/ICSI with regard to

        1. frequency of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (1. outcome measure)

        2. quality of life (2. outcome measure)

        3. live birth rate (2. outcome measure)

        4. gene expression profiles of granulosa and cumulus cells, and concentrations of estradiol
           and vascular endothelial growth factor in follicular fluid(not only compared between
           GnRH agonist and antagonist protocol, but also between patients with OHSS and no OHSS
           and patients becoming pregnant and not becoming pregnant (2. outcome measure), and

        5. number of oocytes removed per treatment, number of embryo transfers per treatment and
           number of spontaneous abortions per treatment (these three parameters are tertiary
           outcome measures).

      In addition to the above mentioned efficacy outcome measures the safety outcome measure
      &quot;frequency of known side-effects&quot; will be compared between the two protocols.

      Patients: 1100 patients are randomized prospectively to either treatment. Stratification:
      =&lt;36 y/&gt;36 y, IVF/ICSI, and treatment centre.

      Methods: OHSS is quantified by consecutive measurements of weight, abdominal diameter,
      ultrasound measurements of ascites and ovarian volume, paraclinical parameters, and by a
      systematic patient questionnaire. Furthermore it is registered if the patients have been
      hospitalized and/or have had ascites drainage performed due to OHSS. Data from the first 100
      patients are used together with Golans OHSS-classification, to make a more precise definition
      of OHSS. This definition is applied prospectively on data from the remaining patients.

      Quality of life is gauged by a questionnaire. Child birth rate is ascertained by a pregnancy
      response questionnaire and by obtaining data from the Danish National Birth Registry.

      Statistics: The study is designed to be able to show a 50% reduction of OHSS comparing short
      to long protocol.
