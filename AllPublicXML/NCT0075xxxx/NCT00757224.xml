  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental smoking is associated with increased frequency of respiratory diseases including
      hospitalizations in infants.

      Study hypothesis: Parental education regarding the association between parental smoking and
      respiratory diseases in the infant, and guidance on ways to decrease smoke exposure by the
      infant, provided shortly after the infant is born, will decrease infants' morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mothers who are in Maternity ward following birth will fill a questionnaire regarding smoking
      habits. Parents will be divided into non-smokers and smokers. Half of the smoking mothers
      will receive guidance regarding the association between parents smoking and respiratory
      diseases in the infant. They will also get ideas on how to reduce smoke exposure by their
      infant. 3 months and 1 year later all parents will be contacted by phone and asked about
      their children's health.
