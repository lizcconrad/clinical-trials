      Specific aim: To test whether transfusion of leukoreduced red cells of lesser storage time
      (versus conventional storage time) reduces mild alterations in pulmonary function and immune
      activation in critically ill patients with mechanically ventilated lungs.

      We propose to perform a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial in critically
      ill patients whose lungs are mechanically ventilated, and who have orders to receive
      transfusion of at least one unit of packed red cells, comparing pulmonary function between
      patients randomly allocated to receive a unit of red cells stored for 5 days or less, with
      similar patients randomly allocated to receive a unit of red cells stored conventionally
      (median 21 days). We will test the hypothesis that transfusion of red cells of lesser storage
      age, (5 days or less) will produce the less changes of pulmonary function and immune
      activation than will transfusion of red cells of conventional storage age (median 21 days).
