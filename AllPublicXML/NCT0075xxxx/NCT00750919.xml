  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a 26-week, open label extension trial to investigate safety and explore
      efficacy of esmertazapine in participants with insomnia who completed protocol
      21106/P05701/MK-8265-002 (NCT00631657).

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This trial was stopped prematurely due to the Sponsor's decision not to continue the
    development of esmertazapine for this indication.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Sleep Time (TST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>TST was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 6 &quot;how much time did you actually spend sleeping&quot; as reported by the participants using a LogPad (hand-held electronic data capture device). Baseline was defined as the TST from the last week of the base study. Daily diary data were converted to weekly averages. For each treatment week the non-missing diary data of that week were taken into account; if a treatment week had three non-missing morning diaries or less, the data of the previous week were taken into account, weighing the data of both weeks, using the number of observed diaries as weights (weighted mean); if no diary data were available for a treatment week the data were considered as missing and were not imputed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 5 &quot;how much time were you awake, after falling asleep initially&quot; as reported by the participants using a LogPad (hand-held electronic data capture device). Baseline was defined as the WASO from the last week of the base study. Daily diary data were converted to weekly averages. For each treatment week the non-missing diary data of that week were taken into account; if a treatment week had three non-missing morning diaries or less, the data of the previous week were taken into account, weighing the data of both weeks, using the number of observed diaries as weights (weighted mean); if no diary data were available for a treatment week the data were considered as missing and were not imputed.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Sleep Latency (SL)</title>
          <description>SL was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 3 &quot;how long did it take you to fall asleep’, &quot; as reported by the participants using a LogPad (hand-held electronic data capture device). Baseline was defined as the SL from the last week of the base study. Daily diary data were converted to weekly averages. For each treatment week the non-missing diary data of that week were taken into account; if a treatment week had three non-missing morning diaries or less, the data of the previous week were taken into account, weighing the data of both weeks, using the number of observed diaries as weights (weighted mean); if no diary data were available for a treatment week the data were considered as missing and were not imputed.</description>
