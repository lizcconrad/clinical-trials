      This study will examine the safety of exenatide once weekly (2.0 mg) in approximately 134
      patients receiving treatment with thiazolidinedione alone or thiazolidinedione in combination
      with metformin. Patients are expected to be treated with exenatide once weekly for at least
      52 weeks.

Minor hypoglycemia: any sign or symptom associated with hypoglycemia that is either self-treated by the patient or resolves on its own AND has a concurrent finger stick blood glucose &lt;3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and not classified as major hypoglycemia. Mean event rate = total number of events for all subjects in a treatment regimen / the total number of subject years of exposure for all subjects in that treatment.
