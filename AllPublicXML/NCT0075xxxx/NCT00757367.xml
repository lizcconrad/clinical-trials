  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lavage fluid (BAL) is inserted into a lung lobe using a flexible bronchoscope. The fluid is
      aspirated out to remove any remaining TI. It's performed twice at specific time points in 12
      healthy volunteers. BAL fluid will be analyzed for insulin and FDKP.

      Informed consent and eligibility occur at Screening. Dosing is at Visit 2. Blood glucose
      levels are monitored and adjusted using IV infusion of glucose. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
      is performed at 30 minutes and 6 hours for Cohort 1 and at 4 and 8 hours for Cohort 2, post
      TI dose. A series of blood samples are taken at specified timepoints. Cohort 3 will proceed
      with dosing if deemed necessary once analysis of BAL from Cohorts 1 &amp; 2 is performed. Visit 3
      is the follow-up safety visit.

    <description>1 60-U dose of TI Inhalation Powder before the bronchoscopy. Cohort 1 will undergo bronchoscopies at 30 minutes and again at 6 hours after the 60-U dose inhalation of TI Inhalation Powder. Cohort 2 bronchoscopies will occur at 4 hours and again at 8 hours after TI Inhalation Powder. The need to run and the timepoints for bronchoscopies for Cohort 3 will be determined based on the results from Cohort 1 and 2. All subjects will undergo 2 bronchoscopies at Visit 2.</description>
