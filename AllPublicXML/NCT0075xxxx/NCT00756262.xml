  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of LGG will be associated with elimination of VRE colonization.

      The primary comparison will be VRE elimination rates among those patients that receive LGG
      compared to those that receive placebo. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of
      patients with VRE at one week after cessation of administration of study medication or
      placebo. The investigators assume that the placebo group will have very little spontaneous
      elimination of VRE and that the LGG group will be more likely to have eliminated VRE
      colonization at the end of one week.

        known or unknown cause with a stool specimen showing fecal leukocytes (if none has been
        done in such a patient this will be requested prior to enrollment). Diarrhea will be
        defined as more than three unformed bowel movements per day. The subject's primary
        physician will be asked to assess the subject's life expectancy, and subjects with an
        estimated life expectancy of less than one year as judged by the physician who knows him or
        her best will be excluded.
