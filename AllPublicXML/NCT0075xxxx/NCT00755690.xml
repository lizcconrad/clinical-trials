    <textblock>
      This study is designed to describe the physiological response to increased and decreased
      dietary phosphate intake on various parameters of mineral metabolism in the blood and urine
      of individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3 and 4 with normal serum phosphate levels.
      This detailed study will give us a far greater understanding of the role of diet in abnormal
      mineral homeostasis early in the progression of this chronic disease. The findings of this
      study will help both physicians and dietitians better determine the optimal time to introduce
      dietary therapy in CKD.

    <textblock>
      The potential benefits of implementation of phosphate management earlier in CKD (Stages 3/4)
      are threefold: 1) prevention of vascular damage early in the progression of CKD thus reducing
      risk of cardiovascular death 2) Improved management of renal bone disease and resultant
      co-morbidities and 3) slowing the progression of renal failure lengthening the time required
      till dialysis is required. Although dietary counseling is currently a normal part of CKD
      care, the utility and effectiveness of lowering phosphate has not previously been quantified.
      In part this is due to the difficulty of measurement of serum phosphate as it is so tightly
      controlled before GFR falls below 30mls/min. No studies have investigated whether is it
      possible to modulate circulating FGF-23 and phosphate excretion in early stages of renal
      failure using diet in individuals with normal serum phosphate levels.

      Study Objectives ;

        1. To measure FGF-23 levels before and after a high phosphate diet, low phosphate diet and
           a low phosphate diet with phosphate binders.

        2. To measure levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25 and 1,25 vitamin D and fractional
           phosphate excretion before and after a high phosphate diet, low phosphate diet and a low
           phosphate diet with phosphate binders.
