  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators applied G-CSF to patients 2 weeks after acute anterior MI and successful
      PCI to evaluate the efficacy and safety of G-CSF in improving myocardial function as cytokine
      which improve inflammation and mobilize stem cells from bone marrow for regeneration of
      myocardium.

      Ten patients in the treatment group and 10 patients in the control group were enrolled in
      this prospective, randomized, double blinded study. Two weeks after myocardial infarction
      that was accompanied by successful recanalization and stent implantation, the patients of the
      treatment group received 10 Î¼g/kg body weight per day (divided BID) G-CSF subcutaneously for
      treatment duration of maximum 5.0 days. In both groups, ejection fraction was evaluated with
      echocardiography and cardiac scan (Gated SPECT method) 10 days after myocardial infarction
      and after 6 months. Tei index was measured by echocardiography.

      Results: No severe side effects of G-CSF treatment were observed. Ejection fraction
      determined by cardiac scan increased in the treatment group from 0.428 to 0.462 and from
      0.470 to 0.496 in the control group but there was no significant improvement of left
      ventricular ejection fraction when the G-CSF treated group was compared to the controls
      (p=0.821 for cardiac scan and p=0.705 for echocardiography). Changes in Tei index was not
      significant in the treatment group (p=0.815) however it reached significant level in the
      control group (p=0.005), respectively.
