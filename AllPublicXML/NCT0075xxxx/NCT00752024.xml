    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the superiority of effect of the modified
      micro-invasive aspiration and drainage and conservative medical therapy in the treatment of
      ICH spontaneously hypertensive scientifically.

      The stereotactic computed tomographic-guided aspiration and drainage is one of the best
      choices in the treatment of a large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral hematoma. It uses
      hardware access technology, in a relatively short time to enter the hematoma center, with
      suction liquefaction technology. It has the advantage of a higher clearance rate of the
      hematoma, simple convenience, small trauma and low-cost. We carry on the suitable improvement
      in this technology's foundation in view of its deficiency, the introduction of the concept of
      the individual, will further reduce the rate of bleeding and mortality, improve survival,
      such as long-term quality of life.

      We will adopt scales such as the rate of rebleeding, mortality, complication,NIHSS, MRS, BI,
      GOS scale to analysis and evaluating efficacy and safety of this technology and conservative
      treatment in the treatment of HICH.

    <description>YL-1 type of intracranial hematoma puncture needle(Pat. NO.is ZL：93244252•8) was originated by Beijing WanTeFu Medical Apparatus Co.Ltd in 1997. With integration of needle and bur drill it is designed as hard tunnel.By the technique of skull self-holding, the puncture needle can being fixed in the target of haematoma for several days.This technique is convenient, simple and safe.
To position haematoma's location, drills 3 millimeter holes in the localization point of puncture, then insert the drainage tube to inhale haematoma, gives the filament resolver interrupted for liquefication drainage afterward.</description>
