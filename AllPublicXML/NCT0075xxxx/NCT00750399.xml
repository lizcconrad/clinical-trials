  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial to test the safety and tolerability of intravitreal
      ranibizumab in the treatment of radiation retinopathy following plaque brachytherapy for
      patients with choroidal melanoma using the incidence and severity of events criteria.

      The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab on regression
      of radiation retinopathy by ophthalmic examination, fundus photography, fluorescein
      angiography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as visual acuity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following plaque brachytherapy as treatment for choroidal melanoma, patients may develop
      radiation retinopathy. Radiation retinopathy is a progressive condition that leads to
      blindness in over 50% of cases within 5 years of treatment.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein is believed to play a critical role in
      angiogenesis and radiation retinopathy. It is one of the key contributors to physiological or
      pathological conditions that can stimulate both the formation of new blood vessels and normal
      vessel incompetence. Ranibizumab is a recently approved vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) inhibitor shown to be effective in treating exudative macular degeneration.
      Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which has
      been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis.

      This is an open label, non-randomized active treatment, Phase I trial to assess the safety
      and tolerability of intravitreal ranibizumab and its ability to reduce radiation retinopathy
      and potentially limit vision loss associated with this disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of radiation retinopathy

          -  History of choroidal melanoma status post plaque brachytherapy

          -  Age &gt; 21 years

          -  Ability to perform written consent and comply with study assessments for the full
             duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation, pre-menopausal women not using contraception

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial

          -  Patient with significantly compromised visual acuity in the study eye due to
             concomitant ocular conditions.

          -  Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery within last 60 days.

          -  Patients who have had intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment within 45 days.

          -  Patients who have had intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide within 4 months.

          -  Patients who have had laser within 60 days.

             access).

          -  Patient has a history of any medical condition which would preclude scheduled visits
             or completion of study.

          -  Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye. Previous violation of
             the posterior capsule in the study eye is also excluded unless as a result of yttrium
             aluminum garnet (YAG) posterior capsulotomy in association with posterior chamber lens
             implantation..

          -  History of glaucoma filtering surgery in the study eye.

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated
