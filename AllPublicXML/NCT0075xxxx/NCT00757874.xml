  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichen Sclerosus is an inflammatory skin condition affecting mostly the genital area of
      persons of all ages, gender or race. The most frequent complaint is that of itchiness of the
      vulva but pain may also occur. Some women will experience no symptoms at all. However, it is
      important to treat this condition since it may increase and cause important scarring and
      deformity. In less than 5% of cases, cancer may develop.

      Lichen Sclerosus is a chronic disease which can be controlled but not cured. Topical
      corticosteroids are the usual treatment for this condition. Though this treatment is
      generally well tolerated, some patients may not present a sufficient response or may develop
      mainly local and rarely systemic side effects. In this perspective, an alternative treatment
      would be beneficial.

      Tacrolimus, a topical immunomodulator has been approved for the treatment of atopic eczema
      and has shown its efficacy in the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus in a limited number of
      patients. Tacrolimus acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAI) without causing
      the usual side effects seen with the prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus in treating vulvar
      lichen sclerosus by comparing it with the standard topical corticosteroid treatment.
