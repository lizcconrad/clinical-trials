  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general hypothesis of this research is that patients who have undergone treatments for
      Head Neck Cancer have a decreased quality of life and experience depression and fatigue.
      Increasing and sustaining physical activity of these patients will improve their emotional
      well-beings, increase their immunological response, improve wound healing, lessen fatigue and
      improve their general functionality and quality of life.

      The purposes of this study are to: (1) determine the effectiveness of the 12-week exercise
      intervention program in increasing physical activity in head and neck cancer patients; (2)
      determine if physically active patients differ in quality of life, depression and fatigue
      during the course of the study; and (3) determine if the change in physical activity levels
      is related to changes in the immune responses in human.

Structured Interview will be conducted at baseline and post-intervention.
Patients assigned to the Intervention group will be given pedometers to obtain distance walked. In addition, patient will be taught how to keep the Exercise diary to record walking and physical activities.
All patients will receive 3 reminder phone calls during the first week of study and 10 minutes social visits in the following weeks by study coordinator on a weekly basis.</description>
