    <textblock>
      This project seeks to determine the effect of prehospital resuscitation with hypertonic
      saline vs. conventional crystalloids on the inflammatory response after injury. The leading
      cause of late mortality following injury is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which
      results from a dysfunctional inflammatory response after injury. Previous studies suggest
      that hypertonic saline may be beneficial by modulating this initial response and decreasing
      subsequent organ injury. This project takes advantage of a unique opportunity, afforded by an
      NIH-funded multi-center clinical trial of hypertonic resuscitation (conducted by the
      Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium), to obtain blood samples from patients enrolled in this
      trial to analyze inflammatory responses early after hypertonic vs. conventional
      resuscitation. This study was an ancillary study to the main randomized clinical trial and
      thus prospective observational in nature

      The proposed study will be carried out in experiments grouped in three Specific Aims: Aim 1
      provides a thorough investigation of the immunomodulatory response following hypertonic
      resuscitation with regard to neutrophil, monocyte, and T cell responses at serial time points
      after injury and resuscitation. Aim 2 comprises experiments to investigate the mechanisms by
      which hypertonicity may alter inflammatory cell signaling. Aim 3 seeks to correlate the
      laboratory findings with clinical endpoints reflective of immune dysfunction including
      inflammation, organ failure, nosocomial infection, and sepsis.

      The investigators hypothesize that hypertonic resuscitation will be associated with
      modulation of the excessive inflammatory response seen after injury and thus will result in
      reduced rates of inflammatory organ injury.

      This was an ancillary study to the larger clinical trials of prehospital hypertonic
      resuscitation conducted by the resuscitation outcomes consortium. This study investigated
      markers of immune function and coagulation in a subset of patients enrolled in the larger
      trials at two of the clinical sites. Four publications detail the results please see
      references
