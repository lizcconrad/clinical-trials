  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In secondary prevention, the beneficial role of cardiac rehabilitation programs after
      myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass is now
      well established. The large majority of patients don't benefit from cardiac rehabilitation
      but for those who do, they usually follow an inhospital short health educational program with
      a sensibilisation to different coronary risk factors like smoking, overweight and inactivity.
      The impact of these inhospital short health educational programs combined to cardiac
      rehabilitation has never been totally evaluated, especially the impact on smoking cessation,
      weight loss and daily physical activity.

      Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact at one year on 400 consecutive
      patients' coronary risk profile of:

        -  an inhospital short health educational program alone

        -  an inhospital short health educational program combined to cardiac rehabilitation

        -  a cardiac rehabilitation program alone

      Classical CV risk factors, quality of life, daily physical activity and energy expenditure,
      smoking dependency and a daily quantification of fat intake are assessed with previously
      validated self-administrated questionnaires. Further factors like the lipid profile and
      glycaemia (with HbA1c in case of diabetes) will also be assessed. These evaluation will take
      place once at the of the hospitalization for acute coronary events in all patients, once at
      the end of any of the three rehabilitation programs for the concerned patients and, finally,
      one year after the hospitalization or the end of the rehabilitation program (mailed
      questionnaires and biological check-up). At this time, smoking dependency, medication, body
      mass index, any coronary event or need of coronary revascularization along with the
      professional ongoing situation (return to work) will be investigated.

      As this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of France's clinical practice in spotting most
      relevant risk factors, the results of the present study could help us to focus the medical
      and paramedical resources on the modification of specific relevant risk factors.
