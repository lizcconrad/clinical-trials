  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, interventional rehabilitation program was initiated to improve exercise
      capacity and psychosocial functioning in patients after lung transplantation (LTx) and to
      evaluate long-term effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

      Study subjects were randomized to either intervention or to control group and were followed
      with regular cardiopulmonary exercise testings and HRQoL measurements (SF-36) for 36±3 months
      after LTx. Patient characteristics did not differ concerning age, gender, and diagnosis at
      study entry. IG patients received regular psychosocial support and performed a home-based
      supervised ergometer training program. CG patients were recommended to perform regular
      exercising.
