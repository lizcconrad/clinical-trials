          -  significant clinical abnormalities in hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis;

          -  significant clinical cardiovascular, neurological, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
             metabolic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders;

          -  female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or female subjects of childbearing
             potential who are not using birth control (oral contraceptives, barrier (diaphragm or
