  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate whether myocardial deformation imaging
      performed by SENC allows for quantification of regional left ventricular function and is
      related to transmurality states of infarcted tissue in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI).

      CMR was performed in 38 consecutive patients with AMI 3Â±1 days after successful reperfusion
      using a clinical 1.5 Tesla MR-scanner. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. SENC is a
      technique that directly measures peak circumferential strain from long-axis views and peak
      longitudinal strain from short axis views. Measurements were obtained for each segment in a
      modified 17 segment model. Wall motion and infarcted tissue were evaluated
      semi-quantitatively from SSFP cine sequences and contrast-enhanced-MR-images and were then
      related to myocardial strain. Comparison of peak circumferential strain assessed by SENC and
      MR-tagging was performed.
