    <textblock>
      : The objective of this study is to determine if bromfenac reduces diabetic macular edema
      (DME) as an adjunct to argon laser therapy (ALT). Leading cause of Blindness in the
      working-aged population in the United States. 60% of patients with Type-II DM, and nearly all
      with Type-I DM progress to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in twenty years. Diabetic Macular Edema
      is the principal cause of vision loss in DR. Approximately 50% of patients with DME will
      experience a loss of &gt;=2 lines of best-corrected visualacuity (VA) after 2 years of
      follow-up. The pathogenesis of DME is multifactorial and complex, but intervention stratagem
      have tended to be singular. Photocoagulation laser applied directly to leaking microaneurysms
      and a &quot;grid&quot; of laser has been the mainstays of treatment since the publication of the Early
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). This landmark clinical trial was an NIH
      sponsored, multicenter, controlled study that demonstrated efficacy of laser for diabetic
      macular edema. It also demonstrated that 20% of patients did not respond. Recent efforts to
      improve the results are focusing on pharmaceutical interventions injected into the vitreous
      cavity. The route of administration and lack of substantiated efficacy are problematic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;18 years of age scheduled to undergo argon laser therapy. Patients
             with diabetic macular edema (DME) and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy as
             evidenced by ophthalmic examination and diagnostics, with either central macular or
             peripheral involvement.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a normal menstrual cycle and a
             negative urine pregnancy test result prior to study entry. Women must be either
             post-menopausal or surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oopherectomy), or women of childbearing potential must use an effective
             method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal
             contraceptives (i.e. pill, patch, ring, injection, implant), intrauterine device
             (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide or condom with spermicide.

          -  The incidence of DME will be determined by 2 methods:

               -  Diagnosis of clinical DME can be made by the masked investigator during the study
                  based on the investigator's medical opinion and expertise

               -  Diagnosis of DME by a masked clinical specialist will review all Optical
                  Coherence Tomography (OCT) after conclusion of study. The diagnosis will be
                  stratified into 3 categories:

                    -  Definite DME: retinal swelling or blurred vision.

                    -  Probable DME: Presence of changes in retinal swelling or blurred vision
                       noted from baseline to follow up.

                    -  Possible DME: subtle to moderate changes in retinal swelling or blurred
                       vision noted.

          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) ranging between 20/40 and 20/400.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received intra-vitreal/sub-tenon corticosteroid injections.

          -  Macular scarring/fibrosis, advanced cataract, advanced glaucoma, retinal pigment
             epithelial detachments (RPEDs).

          -  Other causes affecting visual improvement.

          -  Allergy to bromfenac or NSAIDS.

          -  Sensitivity to sulfite.
