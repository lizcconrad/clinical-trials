      The purpose of the study is:

        -  to compare visual parameters (Subjective refraction and Visual Acuity (VA)) and safety
           (tilt, decentration and posterior chamber opacification (PCO)) in a prospective series
           of 40 patients after bilateral implantation of AcrySof Natural ReSTOR (Model SN60D3) or
           AcrySof Natural Monofocal (Model SN60AT)

        -  to assess patient satisfaction before and after implant

    <measure>Near Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) - Binocular</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after second eye implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with Near Visual Acuity (VA) ≥ 6.5/10 (≤ 0.18 LogMAR) at visit 8 (six months after implantation of the 2nd eye). This test was conducted binocularly and with best correction. The effect of treatment was tested by Chi-square test. VA is acuteness or clearness of vision, which is dependent on the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye and the sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain. VA is measured in logMAR which is the &quot;logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution&quot;. A lower logMAR value indicates better VA.</description>

        <description>Percentage of patients with Near Visual Acuity (VA) ≥ 6.5/10 (≤ 0.18 LogMAR) at visit 8 (six months after implantation of the 2nd eye). This test was conducted binocularly and with no correction. The effect of treatment was tested by Chi-square test. VA is acuteness or clearness of vision, which is dependent on the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye and the sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain. VA is measured in logMAR which is the “logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution”. A lower logMAR value indicates better VA.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>Any formal presentation of data publication from this study has to be a joint presentation from both the Investigators and the Sponsor. Being the study multicentric, it is mandatory that the first publication is based on data from all the centres, analysed according to the protocol. Data from a single Centre can not be presented, unless there is a formal agreement from the other Investigators and Alcon.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Visual acuity data were collected in different units (i.e. c, twentieth, decimal, Jaeger) and were converted to LogMAR after inclusion in the database. This led to inevitable approximations of the data.</limitations_and_caveats>
