      The purpose of this study is to continue to assess the safety of certolizumab pegol in
      combination with methotrexate (MTX).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients having completed the week 34 assessment in the C87077 (NCT00580840) study or having
      met the pre-defined criteria for flare (defined as patients that have randomized at Week 18
      and experienced at 2 consecutive visits between Week 18 and Week 34 inclusive an equal to
      Baseline (W0) or worst swollen and tender joints counts), will be given the option to enroll
      in C87084 and receive certolizumab pegol [400 mg at Entry, Week 2, and Week 4 followed by 200
      mg every two weeks (Q2W)] in combination with MTX until the drug is commercially available
      for the indication of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the patient's country or region or until
      further notice from UCB.

      All patients will continue their MTX treatment at the same stable dose as during the C87077
      (NCT00580840) study, unless there is a need to reduce the dose for reasons for toxicity.

    <description>A TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (eg, noxious or pathological changes) in a subject or clinical investigation subject compared with pre-existing conditions, that occurs during any phase of a clinical trial including Pretreatment, Run-In, Wash-Out, or Follow-Up Phases.
A TEAE is defined as being independent of assumption of any causality (eg, to trial or concomitant medication, primary or concomitant disease, or trial design).
TEAEs are all AEs in which the onset date and time is after the first study drug administration in C87084, up to 84 days after the last injection.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) at Completion/Withdrawal Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (in C87077 [NCT00580840]) to Completion/Withdrawal Visit (up to approximately 54 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Thus, the mean also has a range from 0-3. Change from Baseline is computed as the value at Completion/Withdrawal minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.

        <description>A TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (eg, noxious or pathological changes) in a subject or clinical investigation subject compared with pre-existing conditions, that occurs during any phase of a clinical trial including Pretreatment, Run-In, Wash-Out, or Follow-Up Phases.
A TEAE is defined as being independent of assumption of any causality (eg, to trial or concomitant medication, primary or concomitant disease, or trial design).
TEAEs are all AEs in which the onset date and time is after the first study drug administration in C87084, up to 84 days after the last injection.</description>

        <description>DAS28(ESR) is calculated using the tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Global Assessment of Arthritis where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) at Completion/Withdrawal Visit</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Thus, the mean also has a range from 0-3. Change from Baseline is computed as the value at Completion/Withdrawal minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in PtGADA (Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity) at Completion/Withdrawal Visit</title>
          <description>Change from Baseline in Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity-VAS (0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, 0 being no symptoms and 100 being severe symptoms) is computed as the value at Completion/Withdrawal minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</description>
