      The purpose of this study is to compare the TeenScreen intervention to usual care for
      adolescents who screen positive for mental health problems in a pediatric emergency
      department. It is anticipated that adolescents receiving the TeenScreen intervention will be
      more likely to attend a first session of outpatient mental health services within 60 days of
      the initial screening than those receiving the usual care.
