          -  De novo lesion in the SFA or popliteal artery with a diameter stenosis ≥50%

          -  Target lesion is a de novo occlusion that can be successfully pre-dilated resulting in
             a lesion of &lt;99%

          -  Target lesion stenosis has a length of ≤100 mm based on visual assessment

          -  Target vessel reference diameter is ≥3.0 mm and ≤7.0 mm based on visual assessment

          -  Angiographic evidence of distal runoff defined as minimum one (1) patent tibial artery
             with a straight flow to the foot

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study
             specific procedure

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the
             specified times

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior intervention in the intended target lesion including 10 mm proximal or
             distal from the intended treatment area

          -  Evidence of thrombus in the target vessel

          -  Prior ipsilateral or contralateral lower limb arterial bypass

          -  Treatment of ipsilateral lesions during the index procedure or planned treatment after
             the index procedure

          -  Target lesion is severely calcified

          -  Any known allergies and / or intolerances to the following: ASA, Clopidogrel, Heparin,
             contrast agents (that cannot be adequately pre-medicated).

          -  Any planned surgery within 30 days of the study procedure.

          -  Renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL)

          -  Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study which
             has not reached the primary endpoint yet or which clinically interferes with the
             endpoints of this study

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the patient has a severe co-morbid condition(s) that
             could limit the ability to participate in the study
