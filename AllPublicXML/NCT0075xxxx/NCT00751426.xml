  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric disorders or drug addiction are often regarded as contraindications against the
      use of Interferon-alpha in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The investigators aim is/was to
      get prospective data about adherence, efficacy and mental side effects of IFN-alpha treatment
      in different psychiatric risk groups compared to controls. In a prospective trial, 81
      patients with chronic hepatitis C (positive HCV-RNA and elevated ALT) and psychiatric
      disorders (n=16), methadone substitution (n=21), former drug addiction (n=21) or controls
      without psychiatric history or addiction (n=23) should be/were treated with a combination of
      IFN-alpha-2a 3 x 3 Mio U/week and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day).

      Patients from the Munich University outpatient department of psychiatry or gastroenterology
      as well as inpatients with elevated transaminases were tested for HCV-infection and
      considered for our trial to avoid a positive or negative selection. Medical inclusion
      criteria were a detectable serum HCV-RNA level in a PCR-based assay (AMPLICOR®, Roche
      Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ) for more than 6 months and an elevated alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT &gt; 30 U/L, normal &lt;24 U/L). General exclusion criteria were the presence of other liver
      disease, Child B or C cirrhosis, severe cardiac or neurological disease, co-infection with
      hepatitis B or HIV, hepatocellular carcinoma evaluated by ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein,
      autoimmune disorders, a neutrophil count below 1500 per cubic millimetre, and a platelet
      count below 75000 per cubic millimetre.
