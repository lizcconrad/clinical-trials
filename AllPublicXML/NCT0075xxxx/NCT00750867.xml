  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a progressive sporadic neurodegenerative disorder leading to
      widespread loss of brain cells that results in parkinsonian, cerebellar and autonomic
      dysfunction. The cause of the MSA remains unclear. Available treatment is symptomatic only
      and does not alter the course of disease.

      Although the cause of MSA remains unclear, there is evidence of presence of common
      neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the MSA brains including activation of microglia and
      production of toxic cytokines. This research protocol is based on hypothesis that the MSA
      progression can be altered by blocking the neuroinflammatory activity.

      This protocol includes administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg contains
      antibodies derived from human plasma which can block the inflammatory responses in the brain
      that can lead to loss of brain cells.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the IVIG infusions in patients with multiple system atrophy. The primary endpoint was defined as the frequency of adverse events (AE). AEs including their severity and relationship to the IVIG were assessed throughout the study and at least 60 days after the last infusion. The AEs were considered to be related to the IVIG infusion (infusional AE) if they occurred during an infusion or within 72 hours afterwards. Non-infusional AEs were further classified as possible related to IVIG or likely not related to IVIG. Serious AEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. Any AE was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade.</description>

UMSARS-II has 12 items rated by an examiner, each with assigned score 0-4, where 0 is normal and &gt; are abnormal responses. Total range of UMSARS-II is 0 to 56. The scores of UMSARS-I and UMSARS-II at baseline (month 1) was compared with the scores obtained at the final visit (month 8) which was 8 months apart. The interventions occured at months 2-7, total six times.</description>

The scores of UMSARS-I and UMSARS-II at baseline (month 1) was compared with the scores obtained at the final visit (month 8) which was 8 months apart. The interventions occured at months 2-7, total six times.</description>

          <title>Preliminary Efficacy of IVIg for Treatment of MSA.</title>
          <description>The secondary outcome measure was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of IVIG for the treatment of MSA. The primary efficacy endpoint was change of the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS-I and UMSAR-II) compared to baseline. UMSARS-I and UMSARS-II are validated semiquantitative rating scales for evaluation of severity of MSA. UMSARS-I comprises a historical review of disease-related impairments and UMSARS-II comprises motor examination. UMSARS-I has 12 questions, each with assigned score 0-4, where 0 is normal and &gt; are abnormal responses. Total range of UMSARS-I is 0 to 48. UMSARS-II has 12 items rated by an examiner, each with assigned score 0-4, where 0 is normal and &gt; are abnormal responses. Total range of UMSARS-II is 0 to 56. The scores of UMSARS-I and UMSARS-II at baseline (month 1) was compared with the scores obtained at the final visit (month 8) which was 8 months apart. The interventions occured at months 2-7, total six times.</description>
