      Aim: This study aims at evaluating the performances of an intraoperative gamma camera (field
      of view 10X10 cm), named CarolIReS, to detect axillary drainage and to assess the removal of
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in breast surgery. Patients and Methods: SLN biopsy will be
      performed on 110 patients and the CarolIReS camera will be used preoperatively to localize
      SLNs. During surgery, individual removal of SLNs will be performed using a gamma probe named
      CarolIReS and their activity will be measured with a gamma ray counter. At the end of
      surgery, the CarolIReS camera will be used again to check the quality of surgery which will
      be followed by a surgical excision in case of remaining SLNs. Objectives: The main objective
      of this study is to evaluate the performances of the CarolIReS camera in assessing the
      axillary drainage of breast tumors and the surgical removal of SLNs. In addition, the
      possible correlation between the activity, the size, and the metastatic involvement of the
      SLNs will also be studied.Study hypothesis: Intraoperative cameras could be used to improve
      the efficiency of the SLN procedure

      Group I : The SLN procedure will be initiated 18 hours before surgery using a preoperative
      injection of colloidal rhenium sulphur and technetium (0.4 ml, 20 MBq of Nanocis®; CIS Bio
      International, France) at the four cardinal points in the subareolar area. Lymphoscintigraphy
      will be obtained 3 hours after the injection. Immediately before surgery, the axillary
      drainage will be checked using the CarolIReS camera (FOV 10x10 cm²). During surgery, the
      search for radioactive nodes will be performed using the CarolIReS probe. In order to
      evaluate the CarolIReS camera sensitivity, the activity of the removed SLNs will be measured
      immediately after their resection by a gamma ray counter and they will then be submitted to
      pathological analysis with frozen section.

      Group II : The SLN procedure will be initiated 18 hours before surgery using a preoperative
      injection of colloidal rhenium sulphur and technetium (0.4 ml, 20 MBq of Nanocis®; CIS Bio
      International, France) at the four cardinal points in the subareolar area. Lymphoscintigraphy
      will be obtained 3 hours after the injection. Immediately before surgery, the axillary
      drainage will be checked using the CarolIReS camera (FOV 10x10 cm²). During surgery, the
      search for radioactive nodes will be performed using the CarolIReS probe. In order to
      evaluate the CarolIReS camera sensitivity, the activity of the removed SLNs will be measured
      immediately after their resection by a gamma ray counter and they will then be submitted to
      pathological analysis with frozen section. After SLN removal and during the pathological
      analysis, the axillary area will once again be checked using the CarolIReS camera (followed
      by a further surgical excision in the case of remaining SLNs).

      When the pathological analysis will diagnose a metastatic SLN, complete axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND) will immediately be performed. In the case of negative SLN, serial sections
      and detection of cytokeratine (AE1/AE3; Dako, Zymed, CA, USA) will be performed during
      standard pathological analysis. Macrometastases will be defined as clusters of cancer cells
      ≥2 mm, micrometastases as clusters of cancer cells ≥0.2 mm and &lt;2 mm, and isolated cancer
      cells as clusters of cancer cells &lt;0.2 mm. ALND will be performed in cases of macro- or
      micrometastases.
