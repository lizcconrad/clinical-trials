      THe main goal of our randomized controlled trial with blinded observer will be to compare
      four pediculicide products acting mechanically, Paranix Spray, Paranix Lotion, Paranix Mousse
      and Hedrin against a reference product acting chemically, Prioderm, during a non-inferiority
      (20% equivalence). THe randomization will be balanced every 10 families. The secondary
      objective will be to compare the lenticide efficacy of the products and their local tolerance
      and cosmetic acceptibility.
