    <textblock>
      The first part of the study is an observational part. In eligible patients with early stage
      respiratory cancer, the primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated before and after
      their scheduled radical cancer therapy. The measured variables, include a blood sample,
      pulmonary function tests, level of dyspnea, exercise tests, measurement of body composition,
      respiratory and peripheral muscle force, health related quality of life and psychological
      status. Only registered participants having completed a radical treatment and having either
      less than 70% of the predicted normal value of the quadriceps force (QF) or a decrease of
      more than 10% predicted value of the QF between pre-and post radical treatment, will be
      allowed to participate to the second part of the study. These patients will then be
      randomized in three groups. Group A, the control group, will have the usual care and follow
      up according to clinical symptoms. Group B will be offered a conventional resistance training
      program (CRT), and group C, will be offered a whole body vibration resistance training (WBV)
      on the FITVIBE-platform. All previous variables will be measured after 6 and 12 weeks of
      training.
