      The purpose of this study is to determine if the intra-tumoral injection of a subject's own
      dendritic cells after cryotherapy of the prostate is a safe and effective treatment for
      advanced prostate cancer.

      In theory, the injected dendritic cells will internalize antigens from the tumor cells which
      have been damaged by cryotherapy and activate the subject's immune system against that
      specific tumor.

      Subjects will also receive a low dose chemotherapy designed to lower the number of
      T-regulatory cells which have been shown to lower or stop some immune system responses.

      Hypothesis 1: Dendritic cell injection into cryotreated prostate cancer is non-toxic;

      Hypothesis 2: Dendritic cell injection into cryotreated prostate cancer is medically
      beneficial to the subject.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study treatment dendritic cells (VDC2008) will be injected into the prostate following
      prostatic cryoablation. It is speculated that antigen from the cryoablated cancer will be
      available in the vicinity of the cryoablation field immediately following the procedure.
      Autologous, immature dendritic cells are capable of internalizing antigen, migrating to the
      lymphatic system, and presenting antigenic epitopes to T lymphocytes. In this way, dendritic
      cells are capable of initiating a cell-mediated systemic immune response.

      In concept, the cancer itself should provide a specific and potentially broad spectrum of
      cancer-related antigens. Regulatory T lymphocytes, which have been implicated in dampening or
      halting cell-mediated, antigen-specific immune responses, will be selectively depleted using
      a regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide. Low-dose cyclophosphamide has been empirically shown
      to selectively deplete the number of circulating regulatory T cells.

      Using this combination of therapies, it is thought that a clinically significant anti-cancer
      immune response might be elicited.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: MTD was not reached by any study participant prior to end of the study. Additional participants would have been necessary to determine MTD.</description>

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: MTD was not reached by any study participant prior to end of the study. Additional participants would have been necessary to determine MTD.</description>
