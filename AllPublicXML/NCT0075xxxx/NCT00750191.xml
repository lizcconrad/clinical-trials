  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each patient was assigned to one of the two groups: IDB or Sham. On the day of the procedure,
      an IV was inserted in pre-procedural area and patient transported to the procedure room. The
      procedure will be completed under fluoroscopy in prone position. Patients were given 1-4 mg
      of midazolam for relaxation before the procedure and, if needed, 50-100 mcg of fentanyl IV
      during the procedure. The patients was randomly assigned to treatment or placebo using
      computer-generated codes maintained in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The physician
      performing procedure was informed of the assignment. In IDB group, guided by the fluoroscopic
      imaging, two transdiscal probes was positioned in the posterior annulus using a
      posterolateral, oblique approach. First, two electrically insulated 17G transdiscal
      introducers was used to gain an access to the disc space. Than, two radiofrequency probes
      will be positioned through each of the introducers bilaterally to create a bipolar
      configuration. Placement of the transdiscal probes within the disc annulus will be confirmed
      using oblique, lateral, and anterior-posterior fluoroscopic images. Sham group had their
      introducers and electrodes positioned just outside of the disc. This was also be documented
      using fluoroscopy. Investigator attached the electrodes to inactive heater control device
      that provide a similar auditory and visual experience for the patient. Patients were
      therefore remain blinded to actual treatment and physician performing procedure was not
      involved in patient's follow-up. Patients were awake and communicating with the physician
      conducting the procedure and if pain in legs were present and increased during the procedure,
      the heating protocol would be stopped. Following completion of procedure the patient was
      transferred to recovery and monitored for 45 minutes, then discharged home with instructions.
      The patients were followed over a period of 12 months.

    <description>On the day of the procedure, patients were given midazolam for relaxation and, if needed, fentanyl IV during the procedure. For treatment subjects, two TransDiscal probes were positioned under fluoroscopic guidance in the posterior annulus of the intervertebral disc. The probes were attached to the Radiofrequency generator and Radiofrequency energy was delivered. Placement of the probes within the disc annulus was confirmed using oblique, lateral, and anterior-posterior fluoroscopic images.
Following completion of procedure the patient was transferred to recovery and monitored for 45 minutes then discharged home with instructions. It was expected that the patient limit their activities during the first week after the procedure.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Sham</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sham procedures mimicked active treatment procedures, except that the probes were positioned just outside of the disc and no radiofrequency energy was delivered through the electrodes. Thus, sham patients were provided similar tactile, auditory and visual experiences as treatment patients, without receiving the active RF treatment.
Following completion of procedure the patient was transferred to recovery and monitored for 45 minutes then discharged home with instructions. It was expected that the patient limit their activities during the first week after the procedure.
The study will be unblinded at 6 months. If the patients in the IDB group show significant improvement compared to placebo they will be offered IDB.</description>

After the procedure, you will be asked to rest until the anesthesia wears off and then re-assessed for pain. Once you are awake and communicating with the physician conducting the procedure. Following completion of procedure you will be transferred to recovery and monitored for 45 minutes then discharged home with instructions. It is expected that you will limit your activities during the first week after the procedure.</description>
