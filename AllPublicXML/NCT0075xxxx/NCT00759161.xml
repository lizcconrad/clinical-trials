      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of AN2728 Ointment, 5%,
      compared to Ointment Vehicle in the treatment of plaque type psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind bilateral design. Patients will apply the
      test articles, AN2728 Ointment, 5%, and Ointment Vehicle twice daily. The assigned study
      medication will be applied to two comparable treatment targeted plaques identified at
      baseline. One test article will be applied to one plaque and the other test article to an
      anatomically distinct plaque. All efficacy evaluations will be measured from only the two
      plaques identified at the baseline visit.

    <description>OTPSS is a scale to assess plaque severity. Each target plaque was scored on a severity rating scale ranging from 0 (no plaque) to 8 (very severe plaque), where higher score indicated more severity of a plaque. In this outcome measure, percentage of participants with reduced OTPSS at Day 28 were reported and comparison of ointment and vehicle treated plaque was given as 'Ointment treated plaque versus (vs.) vehicle treated plaque' and 'Vehicle treated plaque vs. ointment treated plaque'.</description>
