    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be treated with maintenance hemodialysis and prescribed a phosphate
             binder.

          -  A controlled serum phosphorus.

          -  Constant dose of concomitant medications.

          -  Women of child bearing potential must be practicing an acceptable form of birth
             control (i.e. double barrier method - intrauterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel
             plus condom). All female patients must have a negative pregnancy test at screening in
             order to be eligible to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been hospitalized within 30 days prior to screening or has a surgery
             scheduled during the study.

          -  Patient has an unstable medical condition, an active infection, active malignancy
             (except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin), a history of major GI tract surgery, or
             a history of hemochromatosis.

          -  Patient is receiving or has received an investigational drug (or is currently using an
             investigational device) within 30 days prior to screening.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
