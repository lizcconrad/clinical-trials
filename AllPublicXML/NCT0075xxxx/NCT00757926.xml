  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, staged dosage escalation study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 3-dose series of Live Attenuated
      Tetravalent (G1-G4) Bovine-Human Reassortant Rotavirus Vaccine [BRV-TV] administered to
      healthy Indian infants concurrently with other standard EPI vaccines would be undertaken to
      evaluate the study hypothesis that a 3-dose series of BRV-TV (containing the VP7 serotypes
      G1, G2, G3, and G4) administered orally to healthy Indian infants at 6-8, 10-12, and 14-16
      weeks of age concurrently with other standard EPI vaccines would be generally well tolerated
      and immunogenic.

          -  Prior receipt of any rotavirus vaccine;

          -  Fever, with an oral temperature ≥38.1oC (≥100.5oF); presumably measured by study
