  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduction of cardiovascular
      events, and red wine seems to offer more benefits than any other type of alcoholic beverages.
      However, the relationship between red wine consumption and endothelial progenitor cells
      (EPCs) remains unclear. The investigators examine whether intake of red wine could enhance
      the number or functional capacity of circulating EPCs by upregulation of nitric oxide (NO)
      bioavailability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate ethanol intake from any type of beverage has been shown to improve lipoprotein
      metabolism and lower cardiovascular mortality risk, but red wine, with its abundant
      antioxidant contents, seems to confer additional healthy benefits. Previous studies indicated
      that the beneficial effects of red wine are derived from increased endothelium-derived nitric
      oxide (NO), implying that enhanced NO bioavailability may mediate the cardiovascular
      protection provided by red wine.

      Increasing evidence suggests that the injured endothelial monolayer is regenerated partly by
      circulating bone marrow derived-endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which accelerate
      reendothelialization and protect against the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.
      Clinical studies demonstrated that the number of circulating EPCs predicts the occurrence of
      cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes and may help to identify patients
      at increased cardiovascular risk. Although many epidemiologic studies have indicated that
      light-to-moderate consumption of red wine can reduce the incidence of CAD, the multifarious
      effects of red wine on circulating EPCs and endothelial function remain to be determined.
      Therefore, we design this study to test the hypothesis that intake of red wine can enhance
      the number and functional capacity of EPCs through increasing NO bioavailability.
