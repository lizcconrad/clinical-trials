  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of saxagliptin with those of placebo as
      add-on therapy to insulin and insulin with metformin in improving glycemic control at 24 and
      52 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An MTT is a 2-part test that measures glucose and insulin levels after an overnight fast and before ingesting a meal consisting of a nutritional drink and power bar and again at prespecified times (30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes) after the start of ingestion of the meal</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Daily Dose of Insulin (MTDDI) (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Based on information recorded in the participant's daily diary. The MTDDI was calculated at every visit using the values patients recorded since the last regularly scheduled visit (minimum of 80% of days with a value). At every visit, the MTDDI was compared with the participant's baseline MTDDI (measured during a 4-week lead-in period) to identify any changes in insulin use at that visit compared with insulin use at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Changes From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52, continuously</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical event that at any dose: results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency or abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization; or prolongs existing hospitalization. Treatment-related=possibly, probably, or certainly related to and of unknown relationship to study treatment.</description>

    <description>Marked abnormality=a laboratory value lying outside the predefined criteria and more extreme (farther from the limit)on-treatment than at baseline. ULN=upper limit of normal; LLN=lower limit of normal; prx=pre-RX=pretreatment.
Criteria 1: if prx=0 use &gt;=2, if prx=0.5 or 1 use &gt;=3, if prx=2 use 4.</description>

The MTDDI was calculated at every visit using the values patients recorded since the last regularly scheduled visit (minimum of 80% of days with a value). At every visit, the MTDDI was compared with the participant's baseline MTDDI (measured during a 4-week lead-in period) to identify any changes in insulin use at that visit compared with insulin use at baseline.</description>

        <description>An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical event that at any dose: results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency or abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization; or prolongs existing hospitalization.
