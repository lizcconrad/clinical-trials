  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan. Recently, there
      are more treatment methods available which result in increased patient survival. Although
      adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were both categorized as non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), the recent advancement of target therapy implied that these two histologies
      behave differently (Shah NT, et al. 2005; Sandler A, et al. 2006). Radiation therapy is an
      important method for locally advanced non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      Computed tomography (CT) is the mainstay for evaluating lung cancer. The advance of multi-row
      detector CT (MDCT) provides volumetric acquisition within a breath hold, and enables detailed
      evaluation of tissue and organ perfusion with excellent resolution. Using this new technique
      with image post processing, excellent spatial resolution and functional perfusion information
      can be obtained simultaneously. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore not only
      the longitudinal change of lung cancer eligible for radiation therapy (including concurrent,
      sequential chemoradiotherapy and high-dose radiation therapy) but also comparison of
      adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancers using perfusion MDCT. Total twenty patients
      with histopathologically proved adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma will be enrolled in
      this study and receive longitudinal study for perfusion MDCT evaluation before, during
      radiation therapy and in early and late phases after complete radiation therapy. Dynamic
      perfusion will be used for processing the image data, and quantitative parameters such as
      tumor blood volume and permeability etc will be derived. From this study, we expect to
      understand the change of tumor vascularity after radiation therapy and characters of
      treatment response of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in addition to the change of
      tumor size.
