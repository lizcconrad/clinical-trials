      The aim of the Antioxidant Study was to compare the efficacy of foods naturally rich in
      antioxidants with that of antioxidants in a pill form on markers of inflammation and plasma
      cholesterol in healthy adults at risk of cardiovascular disease.

      Increasing the amount of antioxidants in your diet is thought to be one way to improve your
      health. If antioxidants do have a beneficial effect, one way to measure that is to examine
      possible changes in the levels of inflammatory markers in your blood.

      Participants were asked to consume an antioxidant supplement including carotenoids, mixed
      tocopherols, vitamin C and selenium, or a placebo for 8 weeks. The doses of antioxidants will
      be similar to the amounts suggested by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
      recommended daily allowances (RDA). In addition, a group of participants will be asked to
      change their usual eating habits and consume more of certain foods that are naturally good
      sources of the four antioxidants contained in the pills.

      Eligible participants were asked to come to the Stanford Campus for 3 fasting blood draws
      over the period of 8 weeks and to complete diet and physical activity questionnaires at the
      beginning, middle, and end of the study period.
