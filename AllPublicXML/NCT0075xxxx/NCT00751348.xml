    <time_frame>At 42 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of antibodies [i.e. titer greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value] in the sera of subjects seronegative [i.e. titer below (&lt;) cut-off value] before vaccination. Cut-off values were the following: Anti-measles concentration ≥ 150 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL); Anti-mumps concentration ≥ 231 units per milliliter (U/mL); Anti-rubella concentration ≥ 4 international units per milliliter (IU/mL); Anti-VZV titer ≥ 1:4 dilution.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Days 0-3) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = cry when limb was moved/spontaneously painful. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 20 millimeters (mm) of injection site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 43-day (Days 0-42) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were fever [defined as rectal temperature ≥38.0 degrees Celsius (°C)], rash, meningism and parotid gland swelling. Any= incidence of the specified symptoms regardless of intensity grade or relationship to study vaccine. Grade 3 fever= rectal temperature above (&gt;) 39.5°C. Grade 3 rash= more than 150 lesions. Grade 3 meningism and parotid gland swelling= meningism/parotid gland swelling symptom which prevented normal everyday activities. Related = general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the 43-day (Days 0-42) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any was defined as an adverse event (AE) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms was reported as an unsolicited adverse event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from Day 0 up to Day 43 or Day 57)</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.</description>

Cut-off values were the following: Anti-measles concentration ≥ 150 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL); Anti-mumps concentration ≥ 231 units per milliliter (U/mL); Anti-rubella concentration ≥ 4 international units per milliliter (IU/mL); Anti-VZV titer ≥ 1:4 dilution.</description>
