  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain and chair use are the second most important health factors for the aging workforce.
      Besides personal suffering, postural discomfort in the workplace reduces performance and
      productivity, both of which can be improved by raising comfort levels. In an attempt to
      improve comfort and reduce injury risk, ergonomic chairs are commonly equipped with lumbar
      supports in an attempt to support a &quot;neutral&quot; spine. However, people often alter their
      position when such a device is in place as they arch their back to conform to it. The Logic
      Back support offers a simple means to alter posture and reduce associated strain on the lower
      back during seated tasks by supporting the &quot;Effortless Neutral Position&quot; or the natural
      curvature of the low back. Although it has been used clinically by many practitioners, its
      effectiveness has yet to be shown by scientific study. The current work will help to
      understand if and why the Logic Back is effective and how it can become a low-cost solution
      to reduce the discomfort of those suffering from low back pain.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the Logic Back and the
      &quot;Effortless Neutral Position&quot; in improving comfort and functional performance during seated
      tasks, as compared to a standard, ergonomic chair.

    <textblock>
      Seventeen of the top Canadian occupations typically have workers sitting a significant
      proportion of their work day. An average of 30% of Ontario WSIB lost time claims since 1996
      involve low back injury. The return to work objective for twenty percent of these patients
      requires prolonged sitting in their work stations. While a number of these studies have
      claimed a relationship between sitting and LBP, the relationship is complex. Back pain and
      chair use are the second most important health factors for the aging workforce. The odds
      ratio for LBP is estimated for seated tasks at 1.9721. Prolonged and monotonous, low-level
      mechanical loads associated with a seated posture are thought to provoke pain.

      Besides personal suffering, postural discomfort in the workplace reduces performance and
      productivity, both of which can be improved by raising comfort levels. According to Corlett
      (2006), other lumbar supports do not exert enough pressure on the spine to actually change
      its configuration. However, the patient often alters their posture when such a device is in
      place as they arch their back to conform to it. The Logic Back support offers a simple means
      to alter posture and reduce associated strain on the lower back during seated tasks by
      promoting the neutral standing lordotic posture. Clinically, it has been shown to support the
      ENP or the natural standing lordotic posture. Although its clinical applicability has been
      accepted by many practitioners, its effectiveness in improving seated comfort and functional
      task performance has yet to be quantified in LBP patients who perform seated tasks. This
      study will help to understand why the Logic Back or ENP must be considered when planning
      return-to-work goals and methods to reduce first-time injury incidence in the workplace.

    <measure>Seated CoP Shift Rate: The CoP wil be measured by use of a TEKSCAN CONFORMat system - a thin sensing mat that is placed on the chair surface and measures the relative pressure applied by the legs and buttocks during seated tasks.</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Performance (Task Repetition Frequency)- three dynamic, seated performance tests are used and include: Test 1 - &quot;Waist level-Up&quot;, Test 2 - &quot;Eye level-down&quot;, and Test 3 - &quot;Overhead work&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reports of Comfort: Tests such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or mapping by body area will be used. Participants will also be asked to record their current level of discomfort on a 10cm VAS for each body area.</measure>

    <description>All participants will perform the five Chair Support tasks: (1) quiet standing, sitting, (2) upper back unsupported, (3) sitting, upper back unsupported with Logic Back in place, (4) sitting in a standard ergonomic chair, and (5) sitting in a standard ergonomic chair with Logic Back in place. Aside from the Quiet Standing trials which will be performed first, the order of Chair Support will be randomized. Participants will perform the Chair Support task for 30 minutes while quietly watching a movie DVD of their choice. The DVDs provided will the &quot;light&quot; in content without a lot of suspense or emotion. Data will be collected for the final two minutes of each 30-minute trial.</description>
