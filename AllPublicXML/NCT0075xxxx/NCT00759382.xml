  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this non interventional study is to assess the independent prognostic role
      on overall survival of primary tumour 18F-FDG uptake value (SUVmax) measured on
      18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) in patients with
      non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancers treated with curative intent, taking into account
      the other conventional prognostic factors (performance status, age, sex, disease stage).
