      This study will test whether transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) can be used
      safely in children with schizophrenia and if it can improve memory and attention span or
      auditory hallucinations in these children, at least temporarily. TDCS has temporarily
      improved memory and attention span in healthy adults and a similar method called TMS has
      relieved auditory hallucinations in adults with schizophrenia. For the TDCS procedure, the
      child sits in a chair and two soft sponge electrodes are placed on the child s forehead and
      held in place with a soft wrapping. One sponge electrode is placed on an arm. The electrodes
      are attached to a stimulator with a wire.

      Children with schizophrenia who meet the following criteria may be eligible for this study:

        -  Are 10 yrs or older age.

        -  Are participating in NIH protocol 03-M-0035.

        -  Are on a stable medication regimen for at least 6 months.

        -  Have problems with memory and attention span or have auditory hallucinations.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either real or sham TDCS on an inpatient or
      outpatient basis in 20-minute sessions daily, except weekends, for 10 days. For real TDCS,
      patients receive stimulation to the front of the brain. For sham stimulation, the children
      have electrodes placed on the forehead, but no actual stimulation is delivered. In addition
      to TDCS, patients have the following procedures:

        -  Checks of blood pressure, pulse and breathing rate before, during and right after each
           stimulation and again 8 hours later.

        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) before starting stimulation and
           after completing the 10 days of TDCS.

        -  Interviews and examinations to check for side effects of TDCS.

        -  Pen-and-paper or computer tests of learning, attention and memory.

        -  At the end of the 10 sessions, children who were in the sham TDCS group are offered the
           same number of sessions of active TDCS.

        -  Follow-up telephone call 1 month after the end of stimulation to see how the child is
           doing.

        -  1- to 2-day outpatient visit 6 months after the stimulation. This visit includes
           interviews with the parent and the child, rating of the child s psychiatric symptoms,
           and pen-and-paper or computer tests of thinking, attention and memory.

      Background: The majority (about 75%) of patients with childhood onset schizophrenia still
      have impairing cognitive and psychotic symptoms after drug treatment optimization. Recent
      studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) indicate moderate efficacy in symptom
      reduction in adult patients with schizophrenia. Transcranial direct current stimulation
      (TDCS) may be a safe and effective additional treatment of residual symptoms of schizophrenia
      in medication stable patients. Recent research into adult-onset schizophrenia established
      both safety and efficacy in 20-minute daily DC polarization (TDSC).

      Objective: To establish whether bilateral DC polarization (using TDCS) of either dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex or superior temporal cortex is safe in patients with childhood onset
      schizophrenia and whether it is associated with improvement in cognitive performance or
      reduction in auditory hallucination (psychotic symptoms) respectively.

      Study population: Up to 40 patients with schizophrenia, ages 10 and older will be recruited.
      All patients will be on optimized medications for at least 2 months prior to this study.

      Design: The design has two concurrent study options; both double-blind sham controlled, with
      10-day, 40-minute daily DC polarization. Patients will be selected for one of the two
      treatment options: 1. Bilateral Anodal DC polarization of prefrontal cortex or 2. Bilateral
      Cathodal DC polarization of superior temporal cortex. A small battery powered device
      (Phoresor II Auto Model PM850) approved by the FDA for iontophoretic transdermal drug
      delivery will be used to administer the DC current. Sham treatment will be electrode
      placement without current.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure would be to determine whether TDCS treatment is
      safe in children and adults with schizophrenia, as assessed by vital signs monitoring,
      reporting/evaluation of adverse effects, clinical ratings and neurocognitive performance.

      Secondary outcome measures: The secondary outcome measures would be improvement on 1)
      Hallucination Change Scale (HCS) and Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS) for auditory
      hallucinations; SAPS, SANS and BPRS scales for psychotic symptoms and 2) performance on the
      working memory (verbal and non verbal), attention/vigilance, and verbal learning sub tests
      for cognitive improvement.

      Exploratory Measure: Effect of DC polarization on regional GM cortical thickness in DLPFC and
      STG regions.
