    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AN2728 Ointment, 5%,
      compared to Ointment Vehicle, applied twice daily for 12 weeks, in the treatment of plaque
      type psoriasis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, bilateral design.
      Patients will apply both test articles, AN2728 Ointment, 5%, and Ointment Vehicle twice daily
      for 12 weeks. The assigned study medication will be applied to two comparable treatment
      targeted plaques identified at baseline. One test article will be applied to one plaque and
      the other test article to an anatomically distinct plaque. All efficacy evaluations will be
      measured from only the two plaques identified at the baseline visit.

    <description>OTPSS is a scale to assess plaque severity. Each target plaque was scored by the investigator on severity scale ranging from 0 (no plaque) to 8 (very severe plaque), where higher score indicated more severity of a plaque. In this outcome measure, percentage of participants with reduced OTPSS at Day 84 were reported and comparison of ointment and vehicle treated plaque was given as 'Ointment treated plaque versus (vs.) vehicle treated plaque' and 'Vehicle treated plaque vs. ointment treated plaque'.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female &gt;18 years of age at time of enrollment

          2. The clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis

          3. Two target plaques of similar severity

               -  ≥ 5 cm2 but ≤ 100 cm2 computed by multiplying the greatest diameter of the plaque
                  by the diameter of the plaque perpendicular to the greatest diameter

               -  Bilaterally located (right/left) plaques on the arms or distinct plaques located

             risk by study participation

          2. Any underlying disease(s) or other dermatological conditions that require the use of
             exclusionary topical or systemic therapy (see below).

          3. Known sensitivity to any of the components of the study medication

          9. Concurrent participation in another drug research study or within 30 days of
             enrollment

         10. Use of lithium or hydroxychloroquine containing products (i.e. Plaquenil)

        <description>OTPSS is a scale to assess plaque severity. Each target plaque was scored by the investigator on severity scale ranging from 0 (no plaque) to 8 (very severe plaque), where higher score indicated more severity of a plaque. In this outcome measure, percentage of participants with reduced OTPSS at Day 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 91 were reported and comparison of ointment and vehicle treated plaque was given as ‘Ointment treated plaque vs. vehicle treated plaque’ and ‘Vehicle treated plaque vs. ointment treated plaque’.</description>
