      The purpose of this his post-market, observational study titled Verification of Pulse
      Oximetry in the Neonatal Population is to gather data to further support the accuracy of
      Nonin's pulse oximeters when used in the neonate population. Neonates who are currently
      undergoing arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling, as part of their medical care will be recruited
      to participate in this study for collecting opportunity samples. Nonin's PureLightÂ®
      noninvasive sensor will be applied to a foot of the neonate; an adhesive wrap secures the
      sensor to the neonate. The sensor immediately begins obtaining SpO2 and pulse rate
      measurements which are sent to the oximeter module for display on the Electronic Data
      Collection System (EDCS). At the time the prescribed ABG is drawn, the EDCS must have a
      marker captured to identify the end of the ABG for SpO2 comparison. The SpO2 accuracy of
      pulse oximeter will be measured by comparing SpO2 readings of the pulse oximeter to values of
      SaO2 (opportunity samples) determined by a CO-oximeter.
