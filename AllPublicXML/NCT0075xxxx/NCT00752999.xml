  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 225 patients meeting study entry requirements will be enrolled and randomized
      (2:1, active versus placebo superimposed on background treatment) to R788 or placebo.
      Patients will be followed for efficacy and safety parameters for 6 months. The investigator
      should taper corticosteroids if clinically warranted.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      Phase II clinical trial. Study enrollment will comprise approximately 225 patients meeting
      study inclusion requirements. The study will be conducted at up to 80 multinational
      investigational sites. Eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into one of two 6 month
      treatment groups. One group (approximately 150 patients) will receive R788 150 mg PO bid; the
      other treatment group (approximately 75 patients) will receive placebo.

             criteria for SLE.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must be fully informed of the potential for R788 to
             adversely affect the fetus and, if sexually active, must agree to use an effective
             method of birth control during the study (oral contraceptive, mechanical barrier, long
             acting hormonal agent).

          -  The patient must otherwise be in good health as determined by the investigator on the
             basis of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory screening tests during
             the screening period.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the patient has the ability to understand the nature of
             the study and any anticipated risks of participation, communicate satisfactorily with
             the investigator, and participate in and comply with the requirements of the entire
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a history of, or a concurrent, clinically significant illness, medical
             condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could affect
             the conduct of the study.

          -  Clinically significant or uncontrolled medical disease in any organ system, other than
             due to SLE.

          -  Background immunosuppressive therapy that has not remained stable ≤ 4 weeks prior to
             baseline.

          -  Severe active or unstable renal disease.

          -  Active severe neuropsychiatric SLE.

          -  Female patients must not be breastfeeding and must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test per the Schedule of Study Activities.

          -  The patient has a history of substance abuse, drug addiction, or alcoholism.
