    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety and efficacy of Acetyl-L-Carnitine and compares it to the
      safety and efficacy of a placebo (inactive) tablet in the prevention of Sagopilone-induced
      peripheral neuropathy. Patients will receive intravenous infusion of sagopilone for 3 hours
      on day 1 of a 3-weeks cycle. Treatment with Sagopilone will be given as long as the patient
      is benefitting. In addition patients will receive ALC or placebo, starting 1 week before
      first sagopilone infusion and ending 30-33 days after the last infusion with sagopilone.
      Safety will be determined by laboratory and other evaluations. Efficacy of ALC will be
      determined by the incidence of all grades of peripheral neuropathy with the results of a
      patient questionnaire. Efficacy of the combination of ALC and Sagopilone will be determined
      by the tumor response.

    <description>Subjects will receive intravenous (i.v.) infusion of Sagopilone for 3 hours on day 1 of a 3-weeks cycle. Treatment will be continued as long as there is benefit. In addition, subjects will receive 21 weeks of placebo 1000 mg tid. After all patients have completed 6 cycles of treatment, an analysis will be performed to see whether ALC was better than placebo. If this is the case, patients still under placebo treatment will be offered to switch to ALC. Subjects with HRPC will also receive Prednisone or Prednisolone 5 mg bid, throughout the treatment with Sagopilone.</description>
