      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the
      blood glucose control when using NovoMix® 50 up to 12 months after initiation subjects with
      type 2 diabetes currently on a therapy with human biphasic insulin. An additional objective
      is also to observe the different regimes of starting and maintaining the treatment with
      NovoMix® 50 during one year.
