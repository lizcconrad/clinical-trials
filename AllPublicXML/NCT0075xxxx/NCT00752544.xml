      This is a Phase I, double-blind (neither the physician or the volunteer knows the dose of the
      study medication), randomized (study medication assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (dose
      without the study medication present) trial to determine the safety, tolerability and plasma
      pharmacokinetics (amount of medication in the blood) of TMC435350 after single and multiple
      oral doses in healthy male Japanese volunteers. 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg doses will be given
      as an oral solution. Six (6) doses will be given with a 3 day follow-up between the first and
      second dose. Additional follow-up will be done for 3 days after the last dose and at
      approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the last dose.

             at least 3 months prior to selection

          -  Normal weight as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI: weight in kg divided by square of
             height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2

          -  Body weight above 50 kg at screening

          -  Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed voluntarily before any trial-related activity

             clinically relevant abnormality.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers must not have any of the following characteristics: Past history of
             heart arrhythmias (extrasystoli, tachycardia at rest) or having baseline prolongation
             of QTc interval &gt; 450 ms, history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome
             (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, family history of long QT Syndrome) or echographically
             suspected cardiomyopathy

          -  History or evidence of current use of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine, recreational

             medication intake

          -  Participation in another investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to the first
             intake of trial medication

          -  Donation of blood or plasma within 60 days preceding the first intake of trial
             medication
