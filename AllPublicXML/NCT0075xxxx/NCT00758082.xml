  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TELFIT is a monocenter, controlled, randomised trial. It focuses on type 1 diabetes patients
      that have attended a functional insulin therapy training course. The Primary objective of the
      TELFIT study is to evaluate whether a PDA with telemonitoring by phone reinforces the effects
      of the functional insulin therapy training course as compared with conventional care.

      Main judgment criteria: comparison of HbA1c means between M0 (start) and M3(3 months)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will attend a functional insulin therapy training course and be randomized into
      2 groups. One group will receive a PDA-phone and one month of phone consultations with a
      nurse and a physician. The other group will only have the usual paper support. This study
      compares the evolution of HbA1c in the 2 groups over a period of 3 months. It also assesses
      time spent by nurses and physicians, changes in quality of life, hypoglycaemia frequency and
      weight changes.
