      The purpose of this study is to determine if the traditional Chinese herbal compound
      (Huo-Luo-Xiao-Ling Dan, or HLXL) is effective in treating OA of the knee in addition to
      participants current OA of the knee treatment(s) and also to determine the best dosage of
      HLXL that is safe and well tolerated.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To determine whether HLXL improves pain and/or function in patients with OA of the knee
           who continue to have symptoms despite receiving standard analgesic and/or
           anti-inflammatory treatment,

        2. To identify an optimal dosage of HLXL, among three dosages, as determined by pain relief
           and/or functional improvement, in a dose-escalation, placebo-controlled double-blind
           randomized phase II clinical trial, in conjunction with indicia of safety and
           tolerability in patients with OA of the knee who are receiving standard analgesic and/or
           anti-inflammatory treatment,

        3. To explore mechanisms of action of HLXL, correlating changes in biological markers of
           suppression of systemic inflammation with changes in clinical response
