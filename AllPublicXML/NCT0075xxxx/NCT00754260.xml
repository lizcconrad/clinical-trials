      A. Statement of Objective: To conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of caffeine
      restriction on Overactive Bladder(OAB) symptoms including urinary frequency, nocturia,
      incontinence episodes, symptom severity and bother and quality of life.

      B. Specific Aims/Hypothesis:

        1. To determine if reduction in caffeine intake decreases urinary frequency, nocturia and
           incontinence episodes as measured on a 3-day voiding diary in women with Overactive
           Bladder (OAB).

           We hypothesize that women with overactive bladder will report less frequent urination
           and decreased nocturia and incontinence episodes with caffeine reduction.

        2. To determine whether caffeine reduction results in decreased symptom severity and bother
           and improved quality of life scores as measured by the Questionnaire for Incontinence
           Severity Index (ISI), Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID),
           Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7).

      We hypothesize that women with OAB who reduce their intake of caffeine will report decreased
      symptom bother and improved quality of life as measured by the ISI, UDI-6 and the IIQ-

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of caffeine reduction education on urinary frequency.

      Methods: Women with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms who scored a 6 on the Questionnaire for
      Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis and who consumed at least 200 mg of caffeine daily were
      recruited. After completing baseline 3-day bladder diaries including amount and type of
      caffeine consumption, as well as validated urinary symptom severity, bother and quality of
      life questionnaires, women were randomized to receive caffeine reduction education vs. a
      control group who reviewed their voiding diary with no counseling to reduce caffeine; both
      groups were asked to maintain total fluid intake. Participants repeated the 3-day bladder
      diary and validated questionnaires following randomization. A total of 80 women were required
      to achieve 80% power with an alpha error of 0.05 to detect a difference of 1.3 in mean number
      of daily voids averaged over a 3-day voiding diary.
