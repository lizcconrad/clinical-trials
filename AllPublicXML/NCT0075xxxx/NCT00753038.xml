  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of
      REOLYSIN® therapeutic reovirus in combination with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin is effective
      and safe in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is the sixth most common cancer in the world.
      More than 50% of patients diagnosed with advanced regional disease will relapse locally or at
      distant sites. Initial therapeutic options include irradiation, surgery and chemotherapy. The
      most commonly used agents are cisplatin and carboplatin, generally in combination with 5-FU
      or a taxane. Erbitux has recently been approved for use in first-line with radiation and in
      second-line as monotherapy. Only about a third of the patients will respond to first-line
      platinum-based therapy and the median overall survival is 6-9 months.

      Preliminary assessment of a Phase 1 study being conducted in the UK investigating the
      combination of REOLYSIN®, carboplatin and paclitaxel suggested that patients with head and
      neck carcinomas may represent a group of patients in whom this treatment combination is
      active.

      This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN® given
      intravenously in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Response is a primary endpoint of this trial. Patients will be clinically evaluated after
      each course of treatment and radiologically every other cycle. A complete or partial response
      must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the first assessment that documents such a response
      and every two cycles thereafter.

      The safety of the paclitaxel, carboplatin and REOLYSIN® combination will be assessed by the
      evaluation of the type, frequency and severity of adverse events, changes in clinical
      laboratory tests, immunogenicity and physical examination.

      Patients may continue to receive therapy under this protocol, provided they have not
      experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does not
      respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  have platinum-refractory metastatic and/or recurrent histologically confirmed stage
             III/IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (oral cavity, larynx or pharynx)
             with no secondary cancers

          -  have evidence of measurable disease

          -  have documented progressive disease (PD) on or within 190 days following the
             completion of treatment of cisplatin-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy in a
             recurrent or metastatic setting and if treatment with cetuximab was considered
             indicated for the patient, documented PD(on or within 190 days of treatment)
