    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability and determine the Japanese
      recommended dose (RD) of bortezomib administered as a once-daily intravenous bolus twice
      weekly for 2 consecutive weeks(Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a 10-day rest period (Days
      12 to 21) in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      In Japan, there is no clear treatment guidance for patients with multiple myeloma that
      repeatedly relapsed and became refractory. At present, various therapies including other
      multi-drug combination chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, corticosteroid
      massive therapy, interferon therapy, thalidomide therapy, radiation therapy and other
      experimental therapies are conducted exploratory as salvage therapies to find the one to
      which the patient shows response. Considering that the antitumor activity of JNJ-26866138
      against relapsed or refractory MM is clear and and the tolerability is acceptable based on
      results of the overseas clinical studies, the development of JNJ-26866138 in Japan is quite
      meaningful. This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study which
      consisting of the two parts: the Phase I part is intended to intravenously administer
      JNJ-26866138 twice daily for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) to establish the Japanese RD
      based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), while the Phase II part is
      intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-26866138 in patients repeatedly treated
      at the Japanese RD.

      Based on the body surface area calculated before treatment in each cycle, the dose is
      calculated for each patient according to the dose level specified by the Patient Enrollment
      Center (0.7mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2 or 1.3 mg/m2). JNJ-26866138 is intravenously administered once
      daily, twice weekly for 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11), followed by a 10-day rest period
      (Days 12 to 21). This is considered one cycle (21 days), and treatment is repeated up to 6
      cycles in patients expected to show a response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on the predetermined diagnostic
             criteria

          -  Patients who received at least standard first-line therapy and had documentation of
             failure to that therapy or relapsed after remission and currently requires therapy
             because of progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator (subinvestigator)
             at enrollment. There is no limitation in the number of prior therapies (salvage
             therapies

          -  Number of regimens)

          -  Patients with measurable disease, defined as follows: Secretory Multiple myeloma:
             Quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (in general, serum M protein values of &gt;=
             1.0 g/dL of IgG and &gt;= 0.5 g/dL of IgA.), When M protein is excreted in urine, M
             protein is quantitatively assayable by urinary protein electrophoresis (in general,
             urinary M protein excretion of &gt;= 0.2g/day.). Non-secretory Multiple myeloma: Presence
             of bidimensionally measurable soft tissue masses (plasmacytomas) with a longer
             diameter of 2cm and more as determined by applicable radiographies (i.e. MRI, CT-scan)
