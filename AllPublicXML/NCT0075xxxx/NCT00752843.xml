      This study is to determine the effect of single and multiple oral doses of mifepristone on
      the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of fluvastatin administered to healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers lasting up to a
      total of 9 weeks: up to 4 weeks screening, approximately 2 weeks for dosing (including a
      1-week washout between periods), and approximately 3 weeks of a drug-free interval until
      termination. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of single and multiple oral
      doses of CORLUX on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of fluvastatin administered to
      healthy volunteers.
