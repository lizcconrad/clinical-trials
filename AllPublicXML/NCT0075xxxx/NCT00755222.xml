      A Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of AA4500 in the treatment of
      subjects with Peyronie's disease.

      During the screening period, subjects had a physical examination including body weight and
      height, vital sign measurements, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory
      testing. Medical history, prior and concomitant medications, and demographic data were
      recorded.

             study drug

          -  Have a penile curvature of at least 30° in the dorsal, lateral, or dorsal/lateral
             plane

          -  Have functional difficulty related to Peyronie's disease (eg, difficulty with
             intromission or erectile dysfunction)

          -  Be judged to be in good health based upon the results of medical history, physical
             examination and laboratory profile

          -  Voluntarily sign an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional Review
             Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must have also signed an
             authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information. The
             protected health information authorization form and informed consent form may have
             been an integrated form or may have been separate forms, depending on the institution

          -  Be able to complete and understand the various rating instruments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had an average of three successive blood pressure readings ≥ 160/100 mmHg during
             screening or the Day 1 assessments

          -  Severe pain during penile palpation

          -  Any of the following conditions:

               -  Chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias

               -  Thrombosis of the dorsal penile artery

               -  Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile curvature

               -  Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum

               -  Ventral curvature from any cause

               -  Presence of sexually transmitted disease

               -  Known Hepatitis B or C

               -  Known immune deficiency disease or be positive for human immunodeficiency virus
                  (HIV)

          -  Previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease

          -  Penile curvature of less than 30° or greater than 90°

          -  Failed to have a rigid erection after pharmacological stimulation with a vasoactive
             injection of Prostaglandin E1 10 to 20 µg, which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             was sufficient to accurately measure the subject's penile deformity

          -  Had a calcified plaque as evident by appropriate radiographic evaluation, penile
             x-ray, or penile ultrasound. Non-contiguous stippling of calcium was acceptable for
             inclusion

          -  Had an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis without curvature

          -  Had the plaque causing curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the
             penis, so that the injection of the local anesthetic would have interfered with the
             injection of AA4500 into the plaque

          -  Received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease administered by the
             intralesional route (including, but not limited to, steroids, verapamil, and the
             naturally occurring low molecular weight protein, interferon-α2b) within 3 months
             before the first dose of study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at
             any time during the study

             tamoxifen, colchicine, pentoxifylline, over-the-counter erectile dysfunction
             medications, or steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) or topical routes (including, but
             not limited to, verapamil applied as a cream) within 4 weeks before the first dose of
             study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during the study

          -  Used any mechanical type device for correction of Peyronie's disease within the 2-week
             period before screening or plans to use any these devices at any time during the study

          -  Used a mechanical device to induce a passive erection within the 2-week period before
             screening or plans to use any of these devices at any time during the study

             phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors

          -  Recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other medical condition, which in the
             investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study

          -  Unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including
             completion of all scheduled study visits

          -  Received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500

          -  Allergy to any concomitant medication required as per the protocol

          -  Received anticoagulant medication (except for ≤ 165 mg aspirin daily or ≤ 800 mg of
             over-the-counter NSAIDS daily) during the 7 days before each dose of study drug

          -  Received doxycycline or a tetracycline derivative during the 7 days before each dose
             of study drug or plans to use these drugs within 2 days after the injection of study
             drug

          -  Received any collagenase treatments within 30 days of the first dose of study drug
