    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate which is the best way to administer cetuximab after
      recurrence in 1st line irinotecan+bevacizumab based treatment and to obtain results of the
      efficacy of the oxaliplatin+cetuximab combination as 2nd line treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the recent advances in the field of systemic chemotherapy for mCRC, like
      irinotecan, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and targeted agents (Cetuximab, Bevacizumab) mCRC
      patients have an overall survival that in some cases reaches 25 months.Irinotecan is an
      inhibitor of the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I, with use in clinical practice for the last 10
      years.In a phase II study with mCRC patients resistant to irinotecan based therapy the
      combination of irinotecan and Cetuximab (an IgG1 anti-EGFR antibody) yielded a response rate
      of 22.5%.Capecitabine was shown to have improved tolerability and response rate compared with
      bolus 5-FU, with comparable time to progression and survival.Oxaliplatin has been approved by
      the FDA for 2nd line treatment in the metastatic CRC setting as a number of trials have shown
      promising data for response rates, disease stabilization rates,median progression free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).KRAS is a predictive marker for clinical benefit
      from EGFR-based antibody treatment. KRAS is the first molecular marker for selection of a
      targeted therapy in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen. Patients with KRAS
      wild-type tumors have a strong benefit from the administration of cetuximab with better PFS
      and objective responses.
