  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopausal and postmenopausal women compose almost 20% of the Austrian population. Two thirds
      of all austrian women suffering from depression or anxiety disorders are over 45 years old.
      The serotonergic system, partially regulated by the steroid hormones estrogen and
      progesterone, plays a major role in the pathogenesis and treatment of these illnesses. To
      examine the effect of the hormone replacement therapy on the serotonergic system, twenty-four
      postmenopausal women will be measured using positron emission tomography (PET). The
      volunteers will participate in two PET scans. The first PET scan will be performed right
      before the hormone treatment starts, the second PET scan about 8 weeks after daily treatment
      with (1) a combination of estrogen and progesterone or (2) estrogen and placebo. This imaging
      study hypothesizes that the expression of the main inhibiting serotonergic receptor (the
      serotonin-1A receptor) will be altered by the hormone therapy. The results of the study might
      lead to new strategies in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses during and after the
      menopausal transition.
