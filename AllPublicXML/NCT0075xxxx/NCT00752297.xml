  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm,
      single-dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mentor Purified Toxin for the
      treatment of glabellar rhytides. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in the study.
      The subjects will be randomized 3:1 (300 Mentor Purified Toxin: 100 placebo) to receive
      either intramuscular injections of 30 U of Mentor Purified Toxin or placebo
      (preservative-free saline).

      Injected subjects will be observed for 180 days of post treatment follow-up. Follow-up clinic
      visits are scheduled for post treatment days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180.

      The study will be conducted at up to ten clinical sites. Safety, tolerability, clinical
      efficacy, onset and duration of effect will be studied during the study

      The effectiveness of Mentor Purified Toxin will be determined by the degree of frown line
      reduction, during maximum forced frown and at rest (neutral expression):

        -  as assessed live by the study doctor,

        -  as assessed live by the subject, and

        -  as assessed by an independent reviewer based on subject photographs

      Frown lines are graded on level of severity based on this scale:

      Severity

        -  Minimal (0)

        -  Mild (1)

        -  Moderate (2)

        -  Severe (3)

          1. Male or female subjects who are 18 years of age or older (subjects should have an
             interest in the effacement of glabellar rhytides) with or without previous botulinum
             Toxin Type A exposure;

          2. In good physical and mental health as determined by the investigator based on medical
             history, physical examination, and/or clinical laboratory tests;

          3. Noticeable presence of the glabellar rhytides for a period of 6 months or longer;

          4. Score at least a 2 (moderate severity) at baseline screening on the investigator's and

             potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

          2. History of autoimmune disease, that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             interfere with subject outcomes (e.g., osteoarthritis is not considered an exclusion
             criteria; however, subjects with dermatomyositis are not permitted to participate in
             this study);

          3. History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic/biliary, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrinological, or neurological disorders
             constituting a possible risk factor that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe
             enough potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

          4. Inability to substantially efface glabellar lines by manually spreading skin apart;

          5. Eyelid ptosis;

          7. Current history of facial nerve paralysis;

          8. Concurrent dermatologic disease of the face in the glabellar area that is deemed by
             the investigator to make the subject an inappropriate candidate for the study;

          9. Recent flu-like syndrome that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe enough
             potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

         10. Neuromuscular disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe enough
             potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

         11. Active multisystems disease that, in the investigator's opinion, might influence the
             outcome measures or the safety of the subject;

         12. Has any condition(s) that in the investigator's opinion would a) warrant exclusion
             from the study, or b) prevent the subject from completing the study;

         13. Currently receiving aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy, curare-like drugs, quinidine,
             succinylcholine, polymyxins, anticholinesterases, magnesium sulfate, or lincosamides;

         14. Has taken any investigational drug during the 30 days prior to screening visit;

             potential must have negative urine pregnancy test results prior to enrollment into the
             study. Such subjects, including peri-menopausal women who have had a menstrual period
             within one year, must use appropriate birth control (see protocol/informed consent for
             description)

         18. Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or to cooperate fully with the
             investigator and site personnel; and

         19. Unable to understand verbal and/or written English or any other language in which a
