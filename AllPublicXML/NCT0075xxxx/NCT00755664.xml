  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether low dose complex B-vitamins (folic
      acid,vitamin B6 and vitamin B12) can lower the risk of developing hyperhomocysteinemia in an
      apparently healthy population with low folate/B12 and high Hcy status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhomocysteinemia has been well known as an independent risk factor for CVD. Numerous
      studies have demonstrated that certain kinds of vitamin B(folic acid,vitamin B6 and vitamin
      B12)can reduce Hcy level and may prevent CVD. However, the majority of those studies has been
      conducted always used high dose vitamin in patient or high risk population. There is thus
      absence of data that the effectiveness of low dose complex B-vitamins on the apparently
      Chinese elderly population with relative sub-nutritional status. Our study is just focus on
      the aforementioned aspect.

    <description>The complex B vitamins supplement has been made as capsule and packaging 31 capsules in 1 bottle with a pre-determined code number on its cover. The main content contains either vitamin C 50mg alone or combination with folate 0.4 mg, vitamin B6 2mg, vitamin B12 10μg and vitamin C 50 mg. Two kinds of the supplements could not be discriminated by appearance, smell, taste, size and package.volunteers in either arms are required to take 1 capsule per day and last for 48 weeks.</description>
