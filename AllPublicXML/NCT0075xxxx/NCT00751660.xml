      RATIONALE: Screening may help doctors find lung cancer sooner, when it may be easier to
      treat.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying screening methods to see how well they find lung
      cancer early in current or former smokers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To develop a new multi-modal screening strategy and integrated methods to detect lung
           cancer early in current and former smokers.

        -  To evaluate the impact of the screening modalities on the quality of life of these
           participants.

        -  To develop a decision analytic framework for determining the cost and effectiveness of a
           novel lung cancer screening strategy in Canada.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants undergo spirometry at baseline. Participants also undergo spiral CT scan at
      baseline and then at 1 and 2 years. Participants with semi-solid or solid nodules of 5-10 mm
      or ground glass opacity (GGO) 8-10 mm or those with growth of an existing nodule, development
      of a solid component in GGO, or a new nodule undergo an additional CT scan at 3 months. Some
      participants also undergo autofluorescence and white light bronchoscopy and bronchial
      biopsies.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and then annually for 2 years for biomarker studies.
      Participants diagnosed with lung cancer undergo additional blood sample collection for
      biomarker studies.

      Participants complete questionnaires on sociodemographic factors, smoking, occupational
      exposure, family history, medical data, quality of life, and anxiety at baseline and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Current or former smoker

               -  A former smoker is defined as one who has stopped smoking ≥ 1 year but &lt; 15 years
                  ago

          -  Estimated 1-year lung cancer risk ≥ 1%

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Not pregnant

          -  Willing to undergo a spiral chest CT scan

          -  No severe heart disease (e.g., unstable angina or chronic congestive heart failure)

          -  No acute or chronic respiratory failure

          -  No bleeding disorder

          -  No other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             the participant's safety during study participation or that would unlikely benefit the
             participant from screening due to shortened life expectancy from the co-morbidity

          -  No diagnosis of cancer, except for any of the following that were previously treated ≥
             5 years ago:

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  More than 2 years since prior chest CT scan

          -  No concurrent anti-coagulant treatment (e.g., warfarin or heparin)
