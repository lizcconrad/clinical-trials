  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will assess the population effectiveness of using routine
      HAART as a PMTCT strategy, through a community-based survey. The survey will be done in the
      catchment areas of four health clinics in rural Zambia both before and after giving routine
      ART in the clinics, so as to estimate population HIV-free survival among infants born in each
      target community.

      The investigators hypothesize that incorporation of routine ART into PMTCT will increase the
      HIV-free survival of exposed infants to 75%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the incremental benefit of a routine ART strategy for
      PMTCT on a population basis, when compared to short-course Zidovudine and single-dose
      Nevirapine (the current PMTCT standard of care).

      We will take advantage of planned implementation of a pilot project for routine ART across
      four primary care centres in rural Zambia (Kafue District). Using a community-based survey
      modeled after the Demographic and Health Survey, we will measure HIV-free survival among
      children under two years of age in the catchment areas surrounding these pilot sites, both
      before and after implementation of services. We will use before-after comparisons in each of
      these four communities to better understand the incremental benefit of providing these
      services.

    <description>Prior to the implementation of the pilot project of giving routine HAART as a method of PMTCT, a minimum of 387 households with children under the age of two will be sampled within each community, for a total of 1,548 households for the first round.</description>

    <description>Two years after full implementation of the pilot project of giving routine HAART for PMTCT across all sites, a minimum of 387 households with children under the age of two will be sampled within each community, for a total of 1,548 households. [Note: At time of implementation, we used the same sampling frame for each community. Because of the population increased observed in parts of Kafue, the final number of households significantly exceeded the minimum threshold.]</description>

    <description>Questionnaires will be used to record detailed information regarding demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, maternal medical history, recent obstetrical history (including access to preventive services for mother-to-child HIV transmission), and infant medical history. Infant deaths will also be recorded as part of the survey. In cases where either the mother or infant has died, we will perform verbal autopsy interviews (Appendix 5) with surviving family members to determine cause of death and gather information regarding HIV infection and/or exposure.
Heel/finger pricks will be taken so as to perform dried blood spot cards, and test for HIV in children and adults.</description>

        Households will be eligible for the full survey if they report that a child was born to a
        household member within the past two years. If the answer to this question is &quot;yes,&quot; an
        attempt will be made to speak with the mother of the child. If the mother of the child is
        not available, then the primary care-taker of the child will be interviewed at that time.
