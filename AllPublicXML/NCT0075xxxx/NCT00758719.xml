        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must, in the investigator's opinion, be psychosocially, mentally, and

             written informed consent.

          2. The subject must be diagnosed with DDD at up to 2 levels from L2-S1 inclusive and
             undergoing up to 2 level posterior lumbar spinal fusion surgery with or without
             anterior column fusion.

          3. Subjects must be between 18 and 75 years of age.

          4. The patient must be skeletally mature (epiphyses closed).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pregnant, lactating or interested in becoming pregnant during the duration
             of the study.

          3. Subject is currently involved in another investigational study.

          4. Subject has a history (present or past) of substance abuse (recreational drugs,
             prescription drugs or alcohol) that in the investigator's opinion may interfere with
             protocol assessments and/or with the subject's ability to complete the protocol
             required follow-up.

          5. Subject is incarcerated.

          6. More than 2 prior spine surgeries/revision surgeries or any previous spinal fusions at
             levels being currently treated.

          7. Traumatic instability.

          8. Any parathyroid or metabolic bone disease.

          9. Any active malignancy.

         10. Osteopenia/Osteoporosis - All subjects will be screened for osteoporosis using SCORE
             (Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation) with a threshold value of 6. All
             subjects with a SCORE value greater than 6 will be referred for DEXA Scan. Subjects
             with a T-Score of £-1-2.5 will be excluded.
