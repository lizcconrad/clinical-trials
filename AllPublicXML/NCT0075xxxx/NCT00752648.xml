      The objectives are: to compare the oral bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetics of
      TMC435350 for 2 different solid formulations to those of TMC435350 formulated as a powder
      blend in a capsule, after a single oral dose of 200 mg in healthy volunteers; to determine
      the short term safety and tolerability of TMC435350 after a single oral dose of 200 mg
      formulated in capsules with 2 different formulations and as a tablet in healthy volunteers

      This is a Phase I, open-label, 3-way crossover trial in 12 healthy adult volunteers to
      compare the oral bioavailability of a single 200 mg intake of TMC435350 salt, formulated as 2
      different solid formulations (a tablet and a capsule) to that of a single 200 mg intake of
      TMC435350 salt, formulated as a powder blend in a capsule. TMC435350 is a protease inhibitor
      in development for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. During 3 sessions,
      each volunteer will receive 3 treatments according to a classical 6-sequence, 3-period
      Williams design.The treatments administered are: Treatment A: single dose of 200 mg TMC435350
      salt, formulated as a powder blend filled in a capsule. Treatment B: single dose of 200 mg
      TMC435350 salt, formulated in a tablet. Treatment C: single dose of 200 mg. MC435350 salt,
      formulated in beads filled in a capsule. All medication intakes will be oral and under fed
      conditions. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between medication intakes in
      subsequent treatment sessions. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of TMC435350 will be determined
      up to 72 hours after administration in each session. Safety and tolerability will be
      monitored continuously throughout the trial. Treatments A, B and C: TMC435350 200mg on Day 1
      of each session.Intakes will be oral and in fed conditions.
