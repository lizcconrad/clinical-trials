    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contraceptive counseling is considered an essential component of post abortion care (PAC)
      programmes and it is recommended to prevent unintended pregnancies and unsafe, repeated
      abortions. Indeed, most maternal deaths related to unsafe abortions could be prevented by
      expanding and improving family planning provision.
