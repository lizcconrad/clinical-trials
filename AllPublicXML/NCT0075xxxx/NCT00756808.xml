  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In face of the increased rates of tuberculosis in residents of long term care facilities,
      annual screening for latent tuberculosis is recommended. Tuberculin skin testing using
      purified protein derivative (PPD) is used for this purpose. Sensitivity of the PPD testing
      is, however, dependent on a normal T cell function. It is now evident that the immune system
      undergoes age-associated alteration known as immune senescence. The depressed T-cell
      responses may clinically manifest as attenuated delayed-type hypersensitivity. This
      attenuated reaction may affect the sensitivity of the PPD in detection of latent TB in the
      elderly.

      This prospective study will examine the utility of interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) based assay,
      T-SPOT.TB, for detection of latent tuberculosis in nursing home patients who are 65 years of
      age or older.
