      Purpose To define the efficacy, tolerability and safety of Vandetanib in combination with
      bicalutamide in patients with chemotherapy naive hormone refractory prostate cancer

      Hypothesis There will be a PSA response when Vandetanib is given in combination with
      Bicalutamide in Chemotherapy Naive Hormone refractory prostate cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      With the advent of PSA surveillance, many patients diagnosed with hormone refractory disease,
      have PSA rising disease only, are asymptomatic, with no evidence of metastatic disease. There
      is no standard of care in this patient population. A standard treatment in this population
      has been the addition of a non-steroidal anti androgen such as bicalutamide. PSA response
      rate (defined as a 50% decrease) have been reported in 20% range with bicalutamide.

      Even in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and metastases that have no
      cancer related symptoms, initiation of chemotherapy is controversial given the palliative
      nature of chemotherapy and potential for serious toxicity.

      These patients are generally well enough to to undergo trials of novel agents and achieve
      adequate drug exposure, such that any cytostatic effect will be apparent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Patients must have biochemically recurrent disease or metastatic disease that is
             asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (total daily morphine dose &lt; 30mg.day) for which
             no curative therapy exists.

          -  Patients must have documented evidence od PSA progression while receiving androgen
             ablative therapy (i.e. must be hormone refractory). Progression is defined as the
             development of new metastatic lesions, or rising PSA defined as at least two rises in
             PSA at least 1 week apart. If the second PSA is not rising, a thrid PSA is required to
             show further increase; if not, a subsequent level must show further increase. The
             third (or subsequent) PSA confirming progression must be within 2 weeks of
             randomization.

          -  The PSA must be =&gt; 2ug/L at the time of study entry.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Age =&gt;18 years

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  No Prior chemotherapy is permissible for hormone refractory disease. Chemotherapy may
             have been received in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting provided it was given 12
             months prior to registration.

          -  Hormone Therapy

               -  Prior hormone therapy in the form of either medical or surgical castration is
                  required. If the patient is receiving medical androgen abalation a castrate level
                  of testosterone (1.7nmol/L) must be present. Therapy with LHRH agonist must
                  continue for those prostate cancer patients already receiving this treatment at
                  the time of registration. If the patients has discontinued the LHRH agonist, this
                  must be restarted and a castrate level of testosterone must be present.

               -  Prior use of nonsteroidal antiandrogens (including bicalutamide) is permitted but
                  must have been discontinued 6 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 4 weeks has elapsed
             between the last dose and registration in the trial. Exceptions will be made for
             limited field, single fraction palliative radiation to bone.

          -  No concurrent treatment with steriods unless steriods have been ingested for 4 weeks
             prior to commencing study at a dose of less than or equal to an equivalent of
             prednisone 20mg per day.

          -  No concurrent experimental trial medication is permitted. No prior use of VEGF/VEGFR
             or EGFR targeting agents for hormone refractory disease is permitted.

          -  Laboratory Requirements- within 7 calendar days prior to registration Hematology:
             haemoglobin &gt;= 100g/L neutrophils &gt;=1.5 x 10(9)/L Platelets &gt;=100 x 10(9)/L INR =&lt;1.5
             x upper limit of normal Biochemistry: AST, ALT = &lt;1.5 x upperlimit of normal Bilirubin
             &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Baseline QTc (Bazett's) &lt;480msec determined by the average of a least 3 consecutive
             electrocardiograms (ECG) taken within 5-10 mins of each other.

          -  Patient consent must be obtained according to local institutional and/or University
             Research and Ethic Board (REB) requirements.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up.

          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 7 calendar days of patient registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancy, except:adequately treated non
             melanoma skin cancer or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of
             disease for 3 years.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases or leptomemingeal disease are excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of nerologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions and/or sensitivity attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biological composition to Vandetanib or other agents used in the study.

          -  Other serious intercurrent illness or medical condition that might be aggravated by
             protocol treatment including;myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study
             entry, congestive heart failure, unstable angina,cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular
             arrhythmias,OTc (Bazett's) &gt;480msec Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;160, diatolic
             &gt;100) Uncontrolled psychotic disorders, serious infections,peptic ulcer
             disease,history of bleeding diathesis

          -  Upper gasrtointerstinal or other conditions that would preclude compliance with oral
             medication

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with Marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV positive patients receiving
             combination ant-retroviral therapy are excluded from study because of possible risk of
             lethal infection and additionally because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions
             with Vandetanib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who require escalating amounts of narcotic therapy to control pain e.g.
             morphine equivalent dose &gt;30mg/day) since these patients would more appropriately be
             offered systemic chemotherapy

          -  Patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin.

          -  Patients who require the following medication:concomittant use of warfarin, Class 1A
             antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) Class

             1C antiarrhythmics (e.g.,flecainide, propafenone), Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g.,
             amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide), antipsychotics (e.g., thioridazine, chlorpromazine,
             pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol), tri/tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g.,
             amitriptyline, imipramine, maprotiline), ketoconazole, antiepileptics and macrolide
             antibiotics.

          -  Patients who cannot stop ingestion of grapefruit/juice.
