    <textblock>
      The investigators questioned whether patients with dry mouth complaints display any reduction
      in residual saliva coating the gingiva and other selected mucosal surfaces. We further
      intended to test the hypothesis that Gingival Crevicular Fluid volume in patients with dry
      mouth could be different from that of control subjects. Correlations between gingival/mucosal
      wetness; and unstimulated whole salivary flow rate or minor salivary gland secretion rates
      and the correlations between clinical periodontal status and salivary measures were also
      attempted.

        The data for this study were taken from 28 subjects at the Department of Periodontology,
        Hacettepe University from 2004 to 2007. The study group consisted of 14 patients with dry
        mouth complaints. All of them had the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome and ten of them were
        on therapy for sicca symptoms.

        Fourteen randomly selected age-matched systemically healthy females were also included as a
        control group
