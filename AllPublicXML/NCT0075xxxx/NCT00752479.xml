      This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and biological/mechanistic effect of the
      systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs in living-related kidney
      transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG
      induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test
      the feasibility of safely achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study.

      Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional
      tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for
      FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC
      infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive
      treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

      This will assess at different time up to 12 months post transplant. In addition the safety
      profile of MSC infusion will be investigated. We have planned to start with the safety and
      biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients
      will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight) at
      the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the
      cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance
      immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be
      performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the
      study.

      Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the
      development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy
      study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance
      immunosuppressive therapy will follow.

      In this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included
      and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive
      patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated
      according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design.

      INTRODUCTION In organ transplantation the immunosuppressive drugs have dramatically improved
      the life of transplant recipients over the past 30 years, but two notable problems
      remain:drug-associated toxicities, and failure of these drugs to prevent chronic graft
      dysfunction and extend long-term graft survival. Given these circumstances, the scientific
      discussion is dominated by designing effective ways to induce transplantation tolerance.
      'Transplantation tolerance' describes a state in which a donor is 'accepted' without chronic
      immunosuppressive therapy, while the remainder of the immune system is left intact. Thus,
      lack of a pathogenic response to the alloantigen is specific, and the recipient is capable of
      responding to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and malignancies. There is abundant
      evidence for active immunoregulatory mechanisms, which may operate to maintain transplant
      tolerance.

      The problems of immunosuppressive drug toxicity could be alleviated by induction of immune
      tolerance.Over the last 25 years, several strategies have been used successfully to induce
      transplantation tolerance. Each of these has been validated in at least one rodent model,
      with varying degrees of success upon extension to large animals, including nonhuman primates.
      Very small minorities of patients, who discontinue their immunosuppression, provide rare
      examples of clinical transplantation tolerance. To this purpose, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
      infusion could represent a novel tolerogenic cell therapy in kidney transplantation.

      Human bone marrow stem cells, more recently referred to as MSCs, are multipotential cells
      that reside within the bone marrow and can differentiate into various components of the
      marrow microenvironment, in addition to supporting growth of hematopoietic progenitors.There
      is also evidence that MSCs escape the immune system, and therefore could be infused into an
      allogeneic host without being rejected and without requirement of conditioning regimens.
      Moreover, they exert an immunoregulatory activity, although the exact mechanism of action is
      unknown. On this line, evidence is available that MSC inhibit naïve T cells and lock
      dendritic cells (DC) into a semi-mature state, thereby favoring peripheral tolerance. It
      should be also pointed out that experimental in vitro evidence has shown that mouse MSCs
      inhibit the response of memory antigen-specific T cells to their cognate peptide. We expect
      that, in kidney transplant recipients, MSC infusion would allow inhibition of
      alloantigen-specific memory T cell response contributing to long-term graft survival.
      Moreover in vitro studies have documented that the CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell population
      increased significantly in MLR when human MSCs were present compared to controls without
      MSCs. These findings suggest that MSC may modulate T cell response even through a regulatory
      mechanism. Furthermore an immunosuppressive effect of MSCs in vivo has been shown in a baboon
      model, in which infusion of ex-vivo expanded matched donor or third-party MSCs delayed the
      time to rejection of histoincompatible skin graft. The immunomodulatory function of MSCs has
      been also documented in preliminary in vivo studies in humans, where cell infusion did exert
      preventive effects on the development of acute and chronic GVHD. Thus, although no data so
      far are available in human kidney transplantation, we expect that peri-transplant intravenous
      infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs under peripheral T-cell depletion/blockade with
      basiliximab and low dose RATG (as induction therapy) and the cover of low dose maintenance
      immunosuppressive drugs would allow to safety achieving graft tolerance in living-related
      kidney transplant recipients. This could be through inhibition of both naïve and memory T
      cells, and promotion of development and activation of regulatory T cells, eventually leading
      to indefinite graft survival.

      Up to now there is no clinical study that MSC infusion has an immunomodulatory effect in
      patients undergoing kidney transplant. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the
      effectiveness and safety of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions.

      The general aim of the present study is to test a cell therapy with syngeneic ex vivo
      expanded MSC as a strategy to induce tolerance in living-related kidney transplant
      recipients. MSC will be prepared accordingly to established protocols, starting from bone
      marrow explants of living-related recipients obtained 3-4 months before kidney transplant.
      From these samples, MSC will be expanded in vitro and used for the present study in patients
      undergoing kidney transplantation.

      AIMS AND STUDY DESIGN This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and
      biological/mechanistic effect of the systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo
      expanded MSCs in living-related kidney transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype
      mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance
      immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test the feasibility of safely
      achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study. Indeed, to complement the
      research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a pilot efficacy study
      of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance
      immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of
      biological/mechanistic tests will document that MSC infusion allows the development of an
      immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance.

      Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional
      tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for
      FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC
      infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive
      treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

      In particular, at different time up to 12 months post transplant, the plan is the following:

      Immunophenotyping

        1. To assess the effect of the treatment on absolute and percent count of circulating CD4+,
           CD8+ T cells (and the CD4/CD8 ratio), B cells and NK cells.

        2. To examine whether changes in circulating naïve and memory T cell count may occur
           (CD45RA/CD45RO).

        3. To characterize the emergence in the circulation of T cell subpopulations with
           immunoregulatory phenotype (CD4+CD25highFOXP3+; CD8+CD28-, CD3-CD56bright).

      Lymphocyte functional assays

        1. To detect whether donor-specific hyporesponsiveness develops post-operatively by
           monitoring T cell activation in response to alloantigen stimulation by mixed lymphocyte
           reaction (MLR), by ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma and by cell-mediated lympholysis (CML).

        2. To determine whether T cell deletion/anergy develops by repeating T cell stimulation in
           MLR and in IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the presence of high doses of IL-2.

        3. To monitor the regulatory properties of T cells circulating in the peripheral blood by
           in vitro proliferative assay, in particular of CD4+CD25high, CD8+CD28- T cells, and
           CD56bright NK cells.

      Urinary FOXP3 messenger RNA

      a)To evaluate whether measurement in urinary cells of mRNA level for FoxP3, a functional
      factor for regulatory T lymphocytes, may provide insight into the immunologic events within
      the renal allograft.

      In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated.

      Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the
      development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy
      study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance
      immunosuppressive therapy will follow. The criteria to document the development of a
      pro-tolerogenic microenvironment (at 12 months post-kidney transplant) are the followings:

        -  Percentage of inhibition of memory T cell response (by IFN-gamma ELISPOT) and/or naïve T
           cell response (by MLR) versus donor antigens higher than 15-20% in patients receiving
           peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the immunosuppressive
           therapy alone, in the context of normal immune responses versus third party antigens,
           mitogens (PHA) and recall antigens (mumps, pertussis).

      and

        -  Induction of donor-reactive T cell anergy in a percentage higher than 15-20% in patients
           receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to those given the immunosuppressive
           therapy alone (evaluated by addition of high dose IL-2 in ELISPOT assay) or

        -  Appearance in the peripheral blood of regulatory T cells in a percentage higher than 80%
           in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the
           immunosuppressive therapy alone and reversal of the inhibition of donor-specific immune
           response (evaluated by depletion of specific regulatory cells in ELISPOT and/or MLR
           assays) in a percentage higher than 50% in MSC-treated as compared with non MSC-treated
           patients.

      We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related
      kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC
      infusion at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls),
      both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance
      immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be
      performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the
      study. This will be when the patients fulfill all the criteria to enter the waiting list for
      kidney transplant from living donor.

      The first patient will receive a single i.v infusion of syngeneic MSC (2x106 MSCs per
      kilogram body weight). If the procedure is safe and no major adverse events related to the
      i.v cell infusion will occur within the first month (early peri-infusion side effects, severe
      infections possibly due to over-immunosuppression), the second patients will be enrolled.
      Should the procedure be safe also in this case, the third kidney transplant patient will be
      enrolled and undergo syngeneic MSC infusion.

      To complement this research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a
      pilot efficacy study of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of
      maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of
      biological/mechanistic tests (at 12 months post-transplant) will document that MSC infusion
      allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, as higher
      inhibition of donor specific memory T cells and/or higher generation of alloantigen-specific
      regulatory T cells than the drug immunosuppressive treatment alone.

      In this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included
      and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive
      patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated
      according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design.
