    <textblock>
      OA knee is a common degenerative diseases of the joint.

        -  There are many methods to treat this condition.

        -  Hyaluronic acid is one of the recomended treatment of OA knee.

        -  There is no any study on MRI change after injection hyaluronic acid.

        -  The Hypothesis is 25 mg of sodium hyaluronate (2.5 ml) would preserve the joint space in
           patient with osteoarthritis of the knee compared to placebo .

      This will be the phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 52 weeks
      duration designed to evaluate the efficacy of sodium hyaluronate to placebo (saline), in
      adult with OA of the knee joints. Randomization will be stratified by Kellgren-Lawrence(KL)
      grade (garde2 or 3), by subjects X-ray. A total of 60 subjects are planed for enrollment in
      this study. The study will be conducted over approximately 52 weeks.
