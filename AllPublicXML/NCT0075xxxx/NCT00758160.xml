    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether familial relationships and psychological
      status of participants or caregivers as well as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) symptoms of participants can be improved by switching from Immediate-release
      Methylphenidate (IR-MPH) to Osmotic Release Oral Delivery System Methylphenidate (OROS-MPH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (study following participants forward in time), single-arm, open-label
      (all people know the identity of the intervention), 8-week, multi-centric (conducted in more
      than 1 center) study. OROS-MPH will be administered orally for 2 months at doses of 18, 36,
      or 54 milligram (mg) to replace IR-MPH. Clinicians will adjust the dose of each participant
      according to participant's clinical responses and/or side effects. During the study period,
      participants will be assessed on Week 2, 4, and 8. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily based
      on change from baseline in Chinese version of the 26-item Swanson, Nolan and Pelham-Fourth
      Edition (SNAP-IV) rating scale assessed by parents and Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ).
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Swanson, Nolan and Pelham-Fourth Edition (SNAP-IV) Rating Scale (Parents) Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Parents were asked to assess their children on a 26-item Chinese SNAP-IV questionnaire consisting of inattention (items 1-9; subscore range 0-27), hyperactivity (items 10-18; subscore range 0-27) and oppositional (19-26, subscore range 0-24) subscales used to assess the qualitative judgments in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Each item was based on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The overall score ranged from 0 to 78. The total score for Inattention and hyperactivity ranged from 0 to 27 and for oppositional ranged from 0 to 21. Mean Change was calculated as mean SNAP-IV score at Week 2 minus mean SNAP-IV score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The CHQ is a self administered screening instrument used to assess psychiatric morbidity in the Chinese community. It was derived from the General Health Questionnaire, and has been validated with satisfactory construct validity and applied in the survey of psychiatric morbidity in the community and in hospital settings. Four factors are included in the structure: somatic symptoms; anxiety and worrying; sleep problems; and depression and poor family relationships. It contains 12 items, with a maximum score of 12. CHQ scores indicated the severity of participants' psychological problems (0-2=normal; 3-4=minor; 5-6=moderate; and 7-12=severe psychological problems). Mean Change was calculated as mean CHQ score at Week 4 minus mean CHQ score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Swanson, Nolan and Pelham-Fourth Edition (SNAP-IV) Rating Scale (Parents) Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>Parents were asked to assess their children on a 26-item Chinese SNAP-IV questionnaire consisting of inattention (items 1-9; subscore range 0-27), hyperactivity (items 10-18; subscore range 0-27) and oppositional (19-26, subscore range 0-24) subscales used to assess the qualitative judgments in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Each item was based on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The overall score ranged from 0 to 78. The total score for Inattention and hyperactivity ranged from 0 to 27 and for oppositional ranged from 0 to 21. Mean Change was calculated as mean SNAP-IV score at Week 2 minus mean SNAP-IV score at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The CHQ is a self administered screening instrument used to assess psychiatric morbidity in the Chinese community. It was derived from the General Health Questionnaire, and has been validated with satisfactory construct validity and applied in the survey of psychiatric morbidity in the community and in hospital settings. Four factors are included in the structure: somatic symptoms; anxiety and worrying; sleep problems; and depression and poor family relationships. It contains 12 items, with a maximum score of 12. CHQ scores indicated the severity of participants’ psychological problems (0–2=normal; 3–4=minor; 5–6=moderate; and 7–12=severe psychological problems). Mean Change was calculated as mean CHQ score at Week 4 minus mean CHQ score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ) at Week 8</title>
        <description>The CHQ is a self administered screening instrument used to assess psychiatric morbidity in the Chinese community. It was derived from the General Health Questionnaire, and has been validated with satisfactory construct validity and applied in the survey of psychiatric morbidity in the community and in hospital settings. Four factors are included in the structure: somatic symptoms; anxiety and worrying; sleep problems; and depression and poor family relationships. It contains 12 items, with a maximum score of 12. CHQ scores indicated the severity of participants’ psychological problems (0–2=normal; 3–4=minor; 5–6=moderate; and 7–12=severe psychological problems). Mean Change was calculated as mean CHQ score at Week 8 minus mean CHQ score at Baseline.</description>

Each item was based on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The overall score ranged from 0 to 78.

        <title>Social Adjustment Scale Score for Children and Adolescents (SAICA)</title>
        <description>SAICA is a 77-item semi-structured interview scale designed for administration to school-aged children with age 6-18 years, or to their parents about their children. SAICA provides an evaluation of children’s current functioning in the domains of school, spare time, peer relations, and home behaviors. Each item ranged on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 with a higher mean score indicating either poorer social function or a more severe social problem.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included of all the participants who received OROS-MPH at least once and provided at least 1 post-baseline efficacy measurement. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) included those participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' included those participants who were evaluable for this measure at specified time point.</population>
