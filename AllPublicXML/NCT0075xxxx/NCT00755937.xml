  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry is a multi-center, prospective, observational program that will gather and
      analyze data on subjects with Crohn's disease being treated with Remicade® as per approved
      product monograph in Canada. In contrast to a controlled clinical trial, there is no imposed
      experimental intervention and treatment with Remicade® is determined solely by the subject's
      physicians. Thus, the data captured and reported in this registry will reflect a &quot;real world&quot;
      approach to the treatment of Crohn's disease with Remicade®.
