  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the disease burden from RV GE among children less
      than 5 years of age using hospital surveillance data. In addition, data collected will
      determine the seasonal distribution, disease severity, age distribution of RV GE. From an
      economic standpoint, the cost and impact of RV will also be assessed.

        treated at the hospital or visiting the emergency room for an acute GE episode or developed
        acute GE at least 48 hours after hospitalisation) with a rapid screen positive test result
        to RV.

          -  Child is brought to the emergency room for acute GE during the study period or develop
             acute GE at least 48 hours after hospitalisation.
