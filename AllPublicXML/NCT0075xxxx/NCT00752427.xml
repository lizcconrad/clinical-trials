  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of flexible
      doses of Extended Release OROS® Paliperidone in the treatment of geriatric subjects with
      schizophrenia after completion of the initial double blind study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the open-label extension phase was the long-term assessment of
      safety and tolerability of Extended Release (ER) OROS paliperidone (3 mg to 12 mg/day) in
      subjects (&gt;65 years of age) with schizophrenia, and the secondary objective was the
      assessment of long-term efficacy.

      Paliperidone ER OROS® tablet formulation (3 to 12 mg/day) to be taken orally
