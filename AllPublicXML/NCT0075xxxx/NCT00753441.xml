  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer is dismal. Hence, palliation of
      tumor-associated symptoms, in particular jaundice due to low bile duct obstruction and
      gastric outlet obstruction, is the primary aim of these patients' care. Endoscopic stenting
      and surgical bypass are currently the two competing treatment options. There is currently no
      randomized trial comparing the recently developed metal stents to surgical bypass.
      Furthermore, there is very limited data on quality of life of these patients receiving either
      therapy. While endoscopic stenting represents the less invasive treatment, surgery may
      provide better long-term control requiring one-time treatment. Due to the incomplete evidence
      the present randomized controlled trial is designed to compare quality of life of patients
      undergoing endoscopic stenting on demand or surgical bypass for palliation of symptoms caused
      by cancer of the pancreatic head requiring with low bile duct obstruction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age equal or greater than 18 years

          -  Diagnosis of unresectable cancer of the pancreatic head (after clinical, laboratory,
             radiological assessment) requiring palliative treatment for biliary obstruction. In
             unclear cases an exploratory laparotomy will be performed and resectability will be
             evaluated intraoperatively

          -  Operability certified by anesthesiologist

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intervention technically/medically not feasible

          -  Expected lack of compliance

          -  One treatment option considered to be clearly in favor of the patient
