  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, interventional study where a subset of participants will be randomized
      to one of two treatment-optimization strategies. Participants with moderate to severe Crohn's
      disease (CD) will receive induction treatment comprised of 3 infusions of infliximab at Weeks
      0, 2, and 6. The participants will be evaluated at Week 10. Participants who are in clinical
      response will enter the observational phase of the study where they will receive standard of
      care treatment, as per the infliximab product monograph. Participants who lose response, may
      qualify for entry into the interventional phase of the study, where they will be randomized
      to one of the following treatment-optimization arms: 1) dose increase: infliximab 7 mg/kg,
      every 8 weeks or 2) shortened interval: infliximab 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks.

      Note: Due to early study termination, no statistical analysis was performed for the
      interventional part of this study, therefore, endpoints dedicated to this phase of the study
      have not been analyzed.

    Factors that led to termination: recruitment challenges and a lower incidence of flares than
    estimated, causing a high risk of the study being underpowered.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had a Clinical Response Using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24 in the Interventional Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 of the Interventional phase</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI incorporates 8 items that are indicators of disease severity. Scores range from 0 to ~600; higher scores indicate worse disease activity. Participants with scores below 150 have inactive disease whereas those with scores above 450 are considered critically ill. Participants provided completed CDAI diary cards and were considered as responders in the interventional phase if their CDAI score at week 24 was decreased by 70 points or greater over their CDAI score at randomization into the interventional phase, or if their week 24 CDAI score is &lt;= 150. Baseline is value at randomization.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Evaluation Week 10, Week 30 and Week 54 of the Observational Phase</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in HBI score from Baseline to Week 10, 30, and 54. HBI score consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0-4), abdominal pain (0-3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0-3), and complications (score 1 per item). Total score is the sum of individual parameters. Minimum score is 0 and no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on the number of liquid stools. Lower scores indicate better well being. Clinical response/ long-term response is defined as a decrease by 3 or more points from baseline value. Loss of response is defined as an increase of &gt;= 3 points.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants That Required Treatment Optimization in the Observational Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 54 in the Observational Phase</time_frame>
    <description>Participants required treatment-optimization if:
Disease progression/lack of response after entering observational phase; or
Participant was successfully randomized into the interventional phase
The definition of loss of response was as follows:
- An increased HBI score &gt;= 3 points over the week 10 evaluation score and a CDAI score &gt;= 175.
Despite:
having received regular infusions of infliximab every 8 weeks during the observational phase with a maximum interval of no &gt; 10 weeks between each infusion, and
having received previous doses of infliximab of &gt;= 4.7 mg/kg.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 14-16 and 48 in the Interventional Phase</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI incorporates 8 items that are indicators of disease severity. Scores range from 0 to ~600; higher scores indicate worse disease activity. Participants with scores below 150 have inactive disease whereas those with scores above 450 are considered critically ill.
Clinical response was defined as a 70-point reduction in CDAI score from randomization into the interventional phase or CDAI &lt; 150 at week 14-16 and 48 in the Interventional Phase. Baseline is value at randomization.</description>

    <description>The CDAI incorporates 8 items that are indicators of disease severity. Scores range from 0 to ~600; higher scores indicate worse disease activity. Participants with scores below 150 have inactive disease whereas those with scores above 450 are considered critically ill.
Clinical response was defined as a 100-point reduction in CDAI score from randomization into the interventional phase or CDAI &lt; 150 at weeks 14-16, 24 and 48 in the Interventional Phase. Baseline is value at randomization.</description>

        <description>Mean change in HBI score from Baseline to Week 10, 30, and 54. HBI score consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0-4), abdominal pain (0-3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0-3), and complications (score 1 per item). Total score is the sum of individual parameters. Minimum score is 0 and no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on the number of liquid stools. Lower scores indicate better well being. Clinical response/ long-term response is defined as a decrease by 3 or more points from baseline value. Loss of response is defined as an increase of &gt;= 3 points.</description>

        <description>Participants required treatment-optimization if:
Disease progression/lack of response after entering observational phase; or
Participant was successfully randomized into the interventional phase
The definition of loss of response was as follows:
- An increased HBI score &gt;= 3 points over the week 10 evaluation score and a CDAI score &gt;= 175.
Despite:
