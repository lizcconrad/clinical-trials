      The purpose of this observation study is to evaluate the effects of an early, 3 week lasting
      rehabilitation program, that starts roundabout 4 weeks after lung or combined lung
      transplantation, on physical activity, functional and physical condition (6-min-walk, FEV1,
      ADL-score) and quality of life (SF36) in lung transplant recipients with a different length
      of stay on the waiting list and a different duration of hospitalization in the
      transplantation centre after transplantation.

      To which extend a prolonged duration from listing for lung transplantation until a successful
      transplantation or a long length of hospitalization may influence the success of a pulmonary
      rehabilitation, that starts after discharge from the transplantation centre, is still
      unknown.

      Long waiting periods before transplantation and surgical, infectious or immunological
      complications after transplantation influence the physical condition and the quality of life
      of the organ recipient.

      A poor physical condition before transplantation results in an unfavourable outcome in the
      first 12 months after transplantation.

      At present it is unclear, whether a structured pulmonary rehabilitation may overwhelm
      differences between patients with a prolonged course roundabout the transplantation compared
      or not. At present it is not clear whether it is necessary for lung transplant recipients to
      participate in a rehabilitation program including structured exercise training.

      The aim of this observational study is to assess the effect of a short-term pulmonary
      rehabilitation, that starts immediately after discharge from the transplantation centre on
      patients with a prolonged waiting period or an extended postoperative hospitalization.

        -  Hypothesis: a structured pulmonary rehabilitation early after transplantation may
           overwhelm poor physical and functional conditions after a prolonged period on the
           transplant waiting listor a prolonged hospitalization after transplantation resulting in
           a significant improvement in all transplanted patients

        -  Antithesis: a prolonged period on the waiting list before transplantation or a prolonged
           hospitalization after transplantation can not be influenced significantly by an early
           transplant rehabilitation resulting in a persistent lack of functional status and
           quality of life compared with a short waiting period or a normal duration of
           hospitalization after transplantation.

        -  Outcomes: functional status (6-min. walk, exercise capacity, FEV1, ADL), and quality of
           life (SF36) will be assessed at the beginning and on discharge from the rehabilitation
           centre.
