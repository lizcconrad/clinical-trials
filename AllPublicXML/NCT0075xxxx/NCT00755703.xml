      The purpose of this study is to test the recombinant vaccine for safety and immunogenicity in
      healthy adults volunteers. Single dose, intranasally administered vaccine using an
      adenovirus-recombinant vector has provided a safe route for inducing protection in animals
      against pandemic influenza in preclinical studies.

      The vaccine is non-replicating, tissue culture based and designed for intranasal delivery.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the AdhVN1203/04.H5 vaccine when
      administered intranasally in two doses with an interval of 28 days in healthy adults 19-49
      years of age.

      The secondary objective is to evaluated the immunogenicity of the AdhVN1203/04.H5 vaccine at
      three different doses (10e8, 10e9 and 10e10 viral particles) when administered intranasally
      in two doses with an interval of 28 days in healthy adults 19-49 years of age.
