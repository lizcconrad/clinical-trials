  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Delirium and long-term cognitive dysfunction (CD) are important complications of
      major surgery and intensive care treatment. Delirium is associated with increased mortality
      and CD has an important impact on mortality, independency, social interactions, and quality
      of life. Delirium is an important risk factor for the development of long-term CD.
      Particularly, patients aged 65 or older undergoing cardiac surgery are at a high risk of
      developing these problems. There are data suggesting that inflammation plays a key role in
      the development of delirium and possibly CD. It has been shown that n-3 fatty acids modulate
      the immune response of patients and have beneficial effects in abdominal surgery.

      Working hypothesis: 1. Administration of n-3 enriched nutrition therapy including will
      modulate the inflammatory response and improve cognitive function after cardiac surgery.

      Specific Aims: This project will test the impact of perioperative enteral n-3 fatty acids
      ProSure, Abbott Nutrition) in elderly patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Primary
      endpoint is CD one week postoperatively.

      Methods: The investigators will investigate 400 patients aged 65 or older undergoing elective
      cardiac surgery. Half of these patients will receive supplementary of n-3 fatty acids to
      modulate the inflammatory response; the other half will receive an isocaloric nutritional
      supplement without n-3 fatty acids (Ensure Plus, Abbott Nutrition). Otherwise the treatment
      of the patients will not be influenced by this study. Cognitive function will be assessed
      preoperatively, 7 days and three months postoperatively. C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-8,
      IL-10, S-100B, and neuron specific enolase will be monitored as markers of systemic
      inflammation and delirium.
