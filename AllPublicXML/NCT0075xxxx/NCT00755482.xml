  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Aquamin F versus placebo on NSAID
      (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) dose reduction in subjects with osteoarthritis of the
      knee.

      Hypothesis 1: After 12 weeks of treatment, subjects taking Aquamin F will use significantly
      less NSAID medications for symptoms of osteoarthritis versus placebo alone.

      Hypothesis 2: No significant differences will be seen for adverse events between the subjects
      taking Aquamin F or placebo.
