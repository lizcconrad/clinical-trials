  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if subjects on 2g AMG 223 will achieve 60% or
      greater reduction in urinary phosphorus from baseline compared to subjects on 2g Renagel®.

      Renagel®, Sevelamer HCl is currently the market leader for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia
      in patients on dialysis.
