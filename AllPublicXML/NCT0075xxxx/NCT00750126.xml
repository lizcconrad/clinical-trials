  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells following reduced-intensity
      conditioning in children presenting with solid tumors or hematological malignancy by
      evaluating post-transplantation chimerism and hematological reconstitution.

      To study acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host reaction (incidence and severity) and immune
      reconstitution, post-transplantation To study the effectiveness of the protocol on tumor
      response.

      To study overall survival.

        -  Adverse effects, graft-related mortality at D90 and at 12 months, incidence and severity
           of acute and/or chronic GVH reactions

        -  Analysis of variations in post-transplantation immunological function profiles

        -  Median duration of response in therapy-responsive patients and median duration of
