    <textblock>
      The purpose of this a randomized withdrawal Phase III, multi-center research study is to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of repeat treatment with an intramuscular dose of
      Mentor Purified Toxin in the reduction of glabellar rhytides (frown lines). Approximately 700
      subjects will be enrolled at approximately 12 clinical sites in the U.S.A.

      Effectiveness will be determined by the degree of frown line reduction, during maximum forced
      frown and at rest (neutral expression):

        -  as assessed live by the study doctor,

        -  as assessed live by the subject, and;

        -  as assessed by an independent reviewer based on subject photographs

      Frown lines are graded on level of severity based on this scale:

      Severity

        -  Minimal (0)

        -  Mild (1)

        -  Moderate (2)

        -  Severe (3)

      There are two parts to this study. In the first part, all study participants will receive
      treatment with an intramuscular injection of 30 Units of Mentor Purified Toxin on two
      separate occasions (Cycles 1 and 2) no more than 6 months apart. In the second part of the
      study (Cycle 3), subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular
      injections of 30 Units of Mentor Purified Toxin or placebo (preservative-free saline) and
      subjects will be followed for 1 month (3:1, PurTox : placebo).

      Each subject will receive five intramuscular injections for a total of 0.5 mL of study drug
      in the glabellar area, during each treatment visit. Participation takes place over a maximum
      of 14 months, including Part 1 (Cycle 1 and 2) and Part 2 (Cycle 3). The number of clinic
      visits will vary from person to person depending upon the subject's response to the study
      drug, but will range from approximately 9 to 19 clinic visits. There will also be up to 4
      telephone follow-up contacts.

          1. Male or female subjects who are 18 years of age or older (subjects should have an
             interest in the effacement of glabellar rhytides) with or without previous botulinum
             Toxin Type A exposure;

          2. In good physical and mental health as determined by the investigator based on medical
             history, physical examination, and/or clinical laboratory tests;

          3. Noticeable presence of the glabellar rhytides for a period of 6 months or longer;

          4. Score at least a 2 (moderate severity) at baseline screening on the investigator's and
             subject's assessments (reference photographs provided) at forced frown; and

          5. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and must have signed the
             informed consent document prior to performance of any study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of psychiatric problems that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe
             enough potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

          2. A history of autoimmune disease, that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             interfere with subject outcomes (e.g., osteoarthritis is not considered an exclusion
             criteria; however, subjects with dermatomyositis are not permitted to participate in
             this study);

          3. A history or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic/biliary, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrinological, or neurological disorders
             constituting a possible risk factor that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe
             enough potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

          4. Inability to substantially efface glabellar lines by manually spreading skin apart;

          5. Eyelid ptosis;

          6. Myasthenia gravis (from medical history or diseases of neurotransmission);

          7. Current history of facial nerve paralysis;

          8. Concurrent dermatologic disease of the face in the glabellar area that is deemed by
             the investigator to make the subject an inappropriate candidate for the study;

          9. Recent flu-like syndrome that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe enough
             potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

         10. Neuromuscular disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, is severe enough
             potentially to interfere with subject outcomes;

         11. Active multisystems disease that, in the investigator's opinion, might influence the
             outcome measures or the safety of the subject;

         12. Has any condition(s) that in the investigator's opinion would a) warrant exclusion
             from the study, or b) prevent the subject from completing the study;

         13. Currently receiving aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy, curare-like drugs, quinidine,
             succinylcholine, polymyxins, anticholinesterases, magnesium sulfate, or lincosamides;

         14. Has taken any investigational drug during the 30 days prior to screening visit;

             potential must have negative urine pregnancy test results prior to enrollment into the
             study. Such subjects, including peri-menopausal women who have had a menstrual period
             within one year, must be using appropriate birth control (see protocol/informed
             consent for description);

         18. Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or to cooperate fully with the
             investigator and site personnel; and

         19. Unable to understand verbal and/or written English or any other language in which a
             certified translation of the informed consent document is available.
