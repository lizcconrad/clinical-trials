  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the role colonic
      self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) placement as a bridge to surgery in patients with acute
      malignant left-sided colonic obstruction. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that
      SEMS placement could be effectively and safely used in this group of patients to relieve
      colonic obstruction thereby allowing safe recovery and medical stabilization before
      proceeding to elective surgery

    <description>Colonic-stenting and elective surgery: Emergency endoscopic colonic stenting followed by elective surgery at a later date for acute left-sided malignant colonic obstruction. Patients who had successful stenting were discharged and re-admitted for elective surgery. Patients in whom stenting was unsuccessful underwent emergency surgery. The choice of surgery performed was up to the individual consultant colorectal surgeon.</description>
