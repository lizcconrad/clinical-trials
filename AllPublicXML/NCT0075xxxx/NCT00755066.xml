  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the effect of fluticasone propionate vs placebo applied as nasal spray on the
      increase of allergen-specific serum IgE levels following nasal exposure to recombinant
      allergens. Nasal sprays will be applied for four weeks starting two weeks before nasal
      provocation and serum IgE levels will be followed during eight weeks after nasal provocation.
