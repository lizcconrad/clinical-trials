      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experimental fluoridated dentifrice is
      effective in the treatment of dental caries
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical fluorides have been proven to be clinically effective in the prevention of dental
      caries. It is generally agreed that anti-caries effect of fluoride (F) is mainly by
      decreasing the rate of enamel demineralization and enhancing the rate of enamel
      remineralization. An in-situ Surface Micro-hardness (SMH) test is widely used to evaluate
      enamel demineralization and remineralization during the caries process. Determination of
      fluoride uptake in-situ also provides better estimation of true fluoride bioavailability of
      fluoride dentifrice products. In this study, an in-situ remineralization fluoride uptake
      model will be used to compare the efficacy of experimental dentifrice with a marketed
      dentifrice and placebo dentifrice. Participants wore partial dentures containing two
      partially demineralized enamel specimens for two weeks- 24 hours per day, except when
      brushing (twice daily) with test dentifrice. Following each treatment period, the enamel
      specimens were analyzed for SMH recovery and fluoride uptake through microdrill enamel biopsy
      technique.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after intra-oral exposure (R) and after in-vitro demineralization (D) using formula: [(D-R)/ (D-B)]*100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Enamel Fluoride Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride (F) divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as ug*F/cm^3. The difference between treatments was calculated with respect to fluoride uptake by enamel.</description>

        <title>Percentage Surface Micro-hardness Recovery (SMHR) of Enamel Specimens</title>
        <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after intra-oral exposure (R) and after in-vitro demineralization (D) using formula: [(D-R)/ (D-B)]*100.</description>

          <title>Percentage Surface Micro-hardness Recovery (SMHR) of Enamel Specimens</title>
          <description>SMH test was used to assess mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after intra-oral exposure (R) and after in-vitro demineralization (D) using formula: [(D-R)/ (D-B)]*100.</description>
