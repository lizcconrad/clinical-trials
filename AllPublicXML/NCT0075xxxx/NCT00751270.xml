    <textblock>
      This phase I study evaluated a Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy approach for malignant
      gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. The purpose of this
      study was to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering an experimental approach called
      GliAtak which uses AdV-tk, an adenoviral vector containing the Herpes Simplex thymidine
      kinase gene, plus an oral anti-herpetic prodrug, valacyclovir, in combination with standard
      of care radiation.

      This study was designed to include patients with newly diagnosed unresectable (Arm A) and
      resectable (Arm B) malignant glioma. Three dose levels of AdV-tk were evaluated with a fixed
      dose level of valacyclovir prodrug. AdV-tk was delivered to tumor cells by stereotactic
      injection into the tumor at the time of biopsy (Arm A) or injection into the tumor bed
      following resection (Arm B). Oral valacyclovir began 1-3 days after the AdV-tk injection and
      continued for 14 days. Standard radiation therapy began 3-7 days following the AdV-tk
      injection to maximize synergy with radiation. Standard temozolomide could be administered
      after completion of valacyclovir.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presumed malignant glioma based on clinical and radiologic evaluation (pathologic
             confirmation of malignant glioma must be made at the time of stereotactic biopsy or
             resection prior to AdV-tk injection; if this is not possible, the injection will not
             be performed and the subject will no longer be eligible for the study).

             midbrain, contained within the ventricular system, or located in an infratentorial
