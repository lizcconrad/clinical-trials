  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of patients with end stage renal disease have hypertension; 70% of whom are
      poorly controlled using conventional Hemodialysis therapy. An expanded extracellular fluid
      volume and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance as a result of hemodynamic/trophic
      effects of an increased sympathetic nerve activity, angiotensin II, asymmetrical dimethyl
      arginine, and decreased nitric oxide are the most frequently quoted mechanisms contributing
      to hypertension in this population. The intermittent nature of conventional hemodialysis
      treatments (4 hours, 3 days/week) results in the majority of patients having a sustained
      expansion of the extracellular fluid volume that likely contributes to the activation of
      neurohormonal pathways. However, daily therapy including short daily hemodialysis (2 hours, 6
      days/week) and nocturnal hemodialysis (6-8 hours, 5-6 days/week) improve or even normalize
      blood pressure. Short daily hemodialysis appears to improve blood pressure secondary to a
      reduction in extracellular fluid volume (7,8) whereas the improvement in blood pressure with
      nocturnal hemodialysis occurs by a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance (8,9,10). This
      is consistent with the Katzarski et al experience (7-8 hours, 3 days/week) and one randomized
      controlled trial in which blood pressure control was due to normalization of extracellular
      fluid volume in some patients and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance in others.
      The majority of the studies in daily dialysis are observational, do not include a run-in
      period to optimize blood pressure management and have not explored the mechanisms of
      improvement in blood pressure in detail. We have designed a 9 month study to determine if the
      mechanism by which short daily hemodialysis is associated with an improvement in blood
      pressure control is secondary to changes in sympathetic nervous system activity and/ or
      extracellular fluid volume. Additionally we would like to explore the potential impact of
      short daily dialysis, compared to conventional dialysis, on markers of inflammation and
      oxidative stress in detail.

      Patients with end stage renal disease have an adjusted risk of cardiovascular mortality that
      is 10-20 times greater than the general population. Of the modifiable risk factors,
      hypertension occurs in 80% of patients with end stage renal disease and is poorly controlled
      in 70% of patients. In several observational studies of daily hemodialysis, blood pressure
      has improved despite a reduction in the number of antihypertensive medications. A randomized
      crossover study in short daily hemodialysis also showed an improvement in systolic blood
      pressure and a reduction in left ventricular mass index. In limited investigation, the
      mechanism(s) responsible for the improvement in blood pressure have been attributed to a
      reduction in extracellular fluid volume (short daily) and a reduction in peripheral vascular
      resistance (nocturnal hemodialysis). The studies to date have been limited by failing to
      include a run in phase to optimize extracellular fluid volume prior to the initiation of
      daily dialysis. Additionally, only one study used a standardized algorithm for the management
      of blood pressure which is vital as the treatments are not blinded. We have designed a
      randomized, unblinded, 9 month cross-over study to determine the mechanism of blood pressure
      control on patients receiving conventional (3 times /week) HD to short daily HD (6 times
      /week 2 hrs/tx). After completing a 3 month run-in phase on conventional HD in which
      patient's dry weight and antihypertensive medications will be adjusted using a standardized
      algorithm, patients are to be randomized to a 3 month cross-over of daily HD versus
      conventional HD. The mechanism of improved blood pressure control will be explored using
      bioelectrical impedance to measure extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) and muscle sympathetic
      nerve activity (MSNA) as well as plasma catecholamines to measure the activity of the
      sympathetic nervous system. Additionally the effect of short daily HD, compared to
      conventional HD, on reactive oxygen species and markers of inflammation will be examined in
      Dr. Rhian Touyz lab. Lastly we will determine the patient's treatment preference.

      <recruitment_details>22 patients were recruited from the hemodialysis (HD) units of the Ottawa Hospital. 3 patients withdrew prior to randomization. 19 patients complete the conventional arm of the study, 2 patients withdrew during the short daily HD arm - they are included in the intention to treat analysis</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a 3 month run in phase in which blood pressure was optimized prior to randomization. The 3 patients who were not randomized - 1) withdrew consent, he did not want his blood pressure taken routinely in dialysis, 2) one patient had concerns about medications being removed during daily dialysis that could not be reconciled, 3) screen failure</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Short Daily Hemodialysis</title>
          <description>After a 3 month run-in period patients who are randomized to this arm received 3 months of short daily hemodialysis(2 hours/day,6 days/week). SBP was monitored according to the Canadian hypertension guidelines pre each dialysis session. Antihypertensive medication wer adjusted accordingly to maintain BP within the guidelines.At the end of this 3 moth period extracellular volume was measured using bioimpedance as well as sympathetic nerve activity using microneurography. Additionally Catecholamines as well as markers of oxidative stress will be collected.</description>
