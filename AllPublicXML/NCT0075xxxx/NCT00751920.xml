    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to apply the techniques of dynamic MRI imaging enhancement to
      research participants with one or more pulmonary nodule to determine if meaningful
      information about the nature of the nodule can be obtained. This data will then be compared
      with follow up information about nodule growth or histology obtained by biopsy or surgical
      resection.

    <textblock>
      The gold standard for investigating the detection of pulmonary metastases is Multi-Detector
      Computed Tomography (MDCT). Computed Tomography (CT) is routinely used in the staging of
      pediatric patients with primary tumors which commonly metastasize to the lungs (with
      approximate percentage incidence of pulmonary metastases at presentation) are Ewing's sarcoma
      (15-20%), osteosarcoma (15-20%), Wilm's Tumor (10%), rhabdomyosarcoma (10%), and
      hepatoblastoma (10%). However, CT scanning has two central limitations. Firstly, it carries
      associated radiation risks. This risk is increased if multiple scans need to be performed
      during treatment and follow up. This is of particular concern in children who frequently have
      curable disease and may have years to live with the radiation risk. Secondly, CT is limited
      in its ability to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules.

      Recently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lung has been shown to be a feasible
      alternative to CT for the detection of pulmonary metastases in adults with sensitivities and
      specificities of over 90% for the detection of nodules 5mm or larger. It has also shown
      promise in the characterization of nodules as benign or malignant. Since MRI does not involve
      radiation, it may prove to be a preferable imaging technique for children. We wish to
      evaluate the potential for MRI to complement or even replace CT in the imaging of pulmonary
      metastatic disease in children.
