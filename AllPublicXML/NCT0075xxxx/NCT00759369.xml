    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common single gene disorder
      that is potentially fatal. ADPKD is caused by mutations in either of two genes (PKD1, PKD2).
      Cysts begin to develop primarily in renal collecting tubules in utero and continue to form
      and expand throughout the patient's life. One of the goals of the study is to formulate a
      water prescription for use in clinical trials to determine the effect of sustained water
      diuresis on the progression of ADPKD.

      The proposed study will devise a quantitative model to estimate the amount of water an
      individual would need to ingest in order to lower the 24 h mean urine osmolality to a level
      below plasma (~285 mOsm/Kg). This osmolality goal is chosen because the 24h median urine
      osmolality of humans is ordinarily ~753 mOsm/Kg, much greater than 285 mosm/Kg (6, 7). In
      other words, normal humans are usually anti-diuretic during waking hours and while asleep.
      Median 24h urine volume is ~1225 ml (range 1051 - 2270). In temperate climates the insensible
      losses of water in sweat, respiration and stool are nearly balanced by the water ingested in
      solid and semi-solid foods and derived from metabolism. Thus, daily urine volume measured
      upon arising in the morning is a reasonably good indicator of the volume of fluids drunk over
      the preceding 24 h.
