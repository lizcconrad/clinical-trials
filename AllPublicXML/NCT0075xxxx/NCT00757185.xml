  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific aims of the study are to determine how peripheral microcirculatory
      responsiveness is altered in obese women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) during local
      heating and to determine the mechanism for testosterone effects on peripheral
      microcirculatory responsiveness in women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In these studies, we propose to use the skin as a relatively non-invasive model to examine
      cardiovascular and endothelial function in obese women with and without PCOS. Data have
      indicated an important role for testosterone in influencing the peripheral microcirculation.
      While testosterone can lead to vasodilation in the peripheral microcirculation in both men
      and in women without PCOS, testosterone appears to induce vasoconstriction in women with
      PCOS. The differential response between women with and without PCOS, and between men and
      women may be the result of differential ET-1 actions in the vessel, and regulated by the
      receptor subtype is involved in these actions.
