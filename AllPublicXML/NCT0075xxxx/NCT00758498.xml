    <measure>Mean Sleep Latency (Minutes) From the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)- Average of Four Scheduled Naps Across Days 1 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>MSLT is an assessment that measures likelihood of falling asleep. Mean Sleep Latency measures the time to fall asleep. On Treatment Days 1 and 2 the subject was instructed on 4 occasions to attempt to fall asleep. Each MSLT nap continued until 3 consecutive 30-second epochs of stage 1 sleep were reached, or any 30 second epoch of stage 2, 3, 4 or rapid eye movement sleep was reached. Each nap was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occured. Average sleep latency for the 4 naps was tabulated across days 1 and 2. Sleep latency was measured from lights out to first epoch scored as sleep.</description>

    <measure>Average of Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) of General Condition Ratings Across Days 1 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S rating scale is the patient's assessment of their general condition. The subject rates their overall condition according to the 7 following categories: 1=normal (no sign of illness), 2=borderline ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill, and 7=among the most extremely ill. The term &quot;ill&quot; refers here to any symptoms of jet lag and overall feeling. Symptoms may include sleepiness, irritability, malaise, gastrointestinal disturbance, and level of performance. The average of PGI-S ratings across days 1 and 2 are presented here.</description>

    <description>The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory is a validated self-reporting instrument used to assess anxiety in adults. The inventory consists of 2 scales, state anxiety, which evaluates how the subject feels currently (transient anxiety), and trait anxiety, which evaluates how the subject feels generally (general tendency towards anxiety). Each scale consists of 20 questions, and a higher score indicates greater anxiety. Scores range from 20 (no anxiety) to 80 (maximum anxiety).

      <pre_assignment_details>Study consisted of a 1 to 8 week screening period, a 3-day double blind treatment period, and a 7-day follow-up period. 1298 subjects were screened, 431 subjects met entry criteria in the US; 4 subjects were ineligible upon arrival in France (due to AEs), and 1 subject randomized to placebo did not have any post-baseline efficacy assessments.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Sleep Latency (Minutes) From the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)- Average of Four Scheduled Naps Across Days 1 and 2</title>
        <description>MSLT is an assessment that measures likelihood of falling asleep. Mean Sleep Latency measures the time to fall asleep. On Treatment Days 1 and 2 the subject was instructed on 4 occasions to attempt to fall asleep. Each MSLT nap continued until 3 consecutive 30-second epochs of stage 1 sleep were reached, or any 30 second epoch of stage 2, 3, 4 or rapid eye movement sleep was reached. Each nap was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occured. Average sleep latency for the 4 naps was tabulated across days 1 and 2. Sleep latency was measured from lights out to first epoch scored as sleep.</description>

        <title>Average of Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) of General Condition Ratings Across Days 1 and 2</title>
        <description>The PGI-S rating scale is the patient's assessment of their general condition. The subject rates their overall condition according to the 7 following categories: 1=normal (no sign of illness), 2=borderline ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill, and 7=among the most extremely ill. The term &quot;ill&quot; refers here to any symptoms of jet lag and overall feeling. Symptoms may include sleepiness, irritability, malaise, gastrointestinal disturbance, and level of performance. The average of PGI-S ratings across days 1 and 2 are presented here.</description>

          <title>Mean Scores From the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) Collected at Bedtime at Day 3</title>
          <description>The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale is a validated subject-rated instrument for measuring sleepiness, based on a scale from 1 to 9 (with 1 indicating very alert and 9 indicating very sleepy, great effort to stay awake, fighting sleep).
The KSS was administered 5 times during the day; before each MSLT nap and before bedtime. The KSS mean score as measured on day 3, collected only at bedtime, is reported here.</description>

        <title>Mean Ratings From the Mean Sleep Latency of the Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) at Baseline</title>
        <description>MSLT measures the likelihood of falling asleep. Mean Sleep Latency measures the time to fall asleep (in minutes). On Treatment Days 1 and 2 the subject was instructed on 4 occasions to attempt to fall asleep. Each MSLT nap continued until 3 consecutive 30-sec epochs of stage 1 sleep were reached, or any 30 sec epoch of stage 2, 3, 4 or rapid eye movement sleep was reached. Each nap was terminated after 20 min if no sleep occurred. Sleep latency was measured from lights out to first epoch scored as sleep. Mean sleep latency from the MSLT at Baseline (Screening Day 2) is presented here.</description>

        <description>The PGI-S rating scale is the patient's assessment of general condition. The subject rates their overall condition according to the 7 following categories: 1=normal (no sign of illness), 2=borderline ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill, and 7=among the most extremely ill. The term &quot;ill&quot; refers to symptoms of jet lag including excessive sleepiness, irritability, malaise, gastrointestinal disturbance, and poor performance. The least squares mean of PGI-S ratings at Baseline is presented here.</description>

        <title>Change in State and Trait Anxiety Inventory Total Score From Baseline to Endpoint</title>
        <description>The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory is a validated self-reporting instrument used to assess anxiety in adults. The inventory consists of 2 scales, state anxiety, which evaluates how the subject feels currently (transient anxiety), and trait anxiety, which evaluates how the subject feels generally (general tendency towards anxiety). Each scale consists of 20 questions, and a higher score indicates greater anxiety. Scores range from 20 (no anxiety) to 80 (maximum anxiety). The change in total score from Baseline to endpoint is presented here.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Latency to Persistent Sleep as Measured by Nocturnal Polysomnography</title>
        <description>Nocturnal Polysomnography records normal and abnormal physiological activity during an entire night's sleep. It documents the adequacy of sleep, including frequency duration, and total amount of stage 1-2, stage 3-4 (slow wave sleep), rapid eye movement sleep, and apnea/hypopnea index. Data presented here represents the difference in mean latency to persistent sleep from Baseline to Day 2 as recorded by nocturnal polysomnography.</description>
