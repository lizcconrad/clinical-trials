      ABSTRACT

      Background: Although there are some comparative studies between laparoscopy and hand-assisted
      laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) in splenomegaly cases, there is no study of the differences
      between HALS and open splenectomy (OS). Our aim was to compare the HALS and OS techniques in
      splenomegaly cases.

      Methods: This prospective study included 27 patients undergoing splenectomy for splenic
      disorders at the Department of General Surgery, Istanbul Medical Faculty between February
      2007 and October 2007. OS was performed on 14 patients, and HALS was performed in the other
      13 patients.

      The advent of laparoscopic surgery, increasing experience in its performance and advances in
      techniques and surgical devices have all greatly influenced general surgery. The usefulness
      of laparoscopic surgery has already been well proven in cholecystectomy, esophageal
      antireflux surgery, and splenectomy for benign diseases (1). Laparoscopy is also now gaining
      recognition for procedures accompanied by lymph node dissection, such as gastric and
      colorectal surgery (2, 3). The development of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) has
      also brought about improvements in regard to various disadvantages that have previously been
      associated with laparoscopic surgery, including lack of tactile sensation feedback, poor
      depth perception, lack of quick access in the event of unexpected hemorrhage, and
      difficulties with intracorporal suturing. Such improvements have enabled the performance of
      advanced laparoscopic surgery (4).

      To solve the problems associated with a long learning curve and long operating times, hand
      ports have been introduced. Through the hand port, the surgeon's hand can be introduced into
      the abdomen while the pneumoperitoneum is preserved. The use of a hand port reduces operating
      time and shortens the learning curve (5). It has already been suggested that procedures
      requiring an incision to remove a specimen or organ are most suitable for HALS (6).

      Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) for the normal-sized spleen has been shown to be a safe
      procedure, resulting in short hospital stays, low postoperative pain scores, technical
      hurdles and, as a result, can be more difficult. LS has advantages over open splenectomy (7),
      and it is now considered by many surgeons to be the procedure of choice for normal-sized
      spleens. Splenectomy for giant spleens using solely laparoscopic approaches is feasible, but
      it can be time consuming and challenging to any surgeon despite his or her high level of
      experience with laparoscopy.

      With increased splenic sizes, LS becomes more technically challenging, although the procedure
      is still feasible (8,5). Hand-assisted laparoscopic technique allows the surgeon to place one
      hand into the abdominal cavity while maintaining the pneumoperitoneum, recovering tactile
      sense and improving the accuracy of manipulation. This has been verified in various
      complicated laparoscopic procedures, including colectomies, nephrectomies, and hepatectomies.
      Based on these experiences, HALS may be well suited for the removal of splenomegaly when the
      final spleen weight is greater than 500 g (9).

      It would be of interest to assess whether outcomes of the HALS hybrid technique approximate
      those obtained with laparoscopy or with the open approach. Since comparative studies between
      laparoscopy and HALS have been already carried out, we compared open splenectomy with HALS
      for splenomegaly cases. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to compare the
      results of HALS and OS.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS

      This prospective study included 27 patients undergoing splenectomy for splenic disorders at
      the Department of General Surgery, Istanbul Medical Faculty between February 2007 and October
      2007. Patients were selected randomly according to numbers on a random table and assigned to
      one of the two different surgical procedures. Twenty-seven patients with splenomegaly and
      primary splenic tumors were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups
      according to the surgical procedure performed: open splenectomy (Group 1 :OS, n=14) and
      hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (Group 2:HALS, n=13). The study plan was reviewed and
      approved by our institutional ethical committee, and informed consent was obtained for all
      patients.

      Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n=11) were the main indication for splenectomy in this study. There
      were also rarely encountered primary splenic hemangiomas (n=2) (Table 1). Splenomegaly was
      identified clinically by palpation of the spleen below the coastal margin and/or by
      radiological examination of computerized tomography (CT) scans (15 cm or longer in
      craniocaudal diameter), with final intact splenic weight ≥ 500 g.

      The study parameters included age, sex, the greatest splenic diameter, preoperative platelet
      count, preoperative hematocrit level and postoperative diagnosis. Body Mass Index (BMI) was
      calculated as the ratio of weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). All the patients were
      evaluated with the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (10). Operative data
      included operative time as measured from first skin incision to the application of dressings,
      intraoperative blood loss, splenic weight after intact removal, conversion, pain score, and
      postoperative length of hospital stay. Complications were classified as intraoperative or
      postoperative. The pain of all patients was scored during postoperative days. The visual
      analogue scale defined by Wewers (11) was used for the evaluation of the degree of pain.

      All the patients were vaccinated against pneumococci with Pneumovax 23 (Merck &amp; Co Inc.,
      Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) two weeks before the operation. All patients received antibiotic
      prophylaxis (Sulbactam and ampicillin 1 g, intravenously). All patients received general
      anesthesia during surgery and a standardized analgesic regimen. HALS and OS were performed by
      the same surgical team. Post-operative analgesia was achieved by patient-controlled analgesia
      via a pump containing a standard narcotic analgesic solution. All patients received the same
      non-steroidal antinflammatory drug (lornoxicam 8 mg, twice a day, intravenously) and the same
      narcotic analgesic (pethidine 50 mg, twice a day, intramuscularly) on the first and second
      postoperative day.

      Surgery Open Surgery(Group 1) Patients were placed in supine position. Since all patients had
      splenomegaly, preferred incisions were left subcostal. Only three patients requiring
      synchronous cholecystectomy had upper midline laparotomy incisions (18 cm, 18 cm and 20 cm in
      length). After routine whole abdominal exploration, with the assistance of abdominal
      retractors and the first assistance, the inferior pole and medial splenogastric ligament were
      dissected first, and then the splenorenal ligament and superior pole of the splenophrenic
      ligament were dissected. The LigaSure vessel sealing system (Valleylab division of Tyco
      Healthcare, Mansfield, MA) was used for the majority of the dissection. After this, the
      splenic vascular pedicule was separated from the pancreatic tail with careful dissection. In
      splenomegaly cases, if the splenic and perisplenic anatomy was appropriate, the ideal
      ligation of the splenic hilum was outside the abdomen (Figure 1). The splenic artery and
      splenic vein were ligated with silk (00) and sectioned. In the cases of massive splenomegaly,
      the main truncus of the splenic artery was ligated before the dissection to minimize blood
      loss and to allow the return of blood inside the spleen back to the circulation.

      Figure 1- Splenic hilum ligation outside of the abdominal cavity

      After the removal of the spleen, hemostasis was rechecked, and an aspirative drain was
      routinely placed. The abdominal wall was closed with loop polydioxanone (no: 1) in two layers
      with running sutures.

      HALS procedure(Group 2) Patients were placed in a semilateral position with the left side
      elevated 30˚. The surgeon stood on the patients' right side with the camera operator. First,
      a hand port incision was made in the upper midline (Figure 2). The incision measured 7-8 cm
      (depending on the size of the surgeon's glove) in all cases. Then, the hand-assisted device
      Omniport (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Co. Wicklow, Ireland) was installed.

      Figure 2- Omniport placed through an 8 cm upper midline incision in the HALS technique

      The surgeon's left (non-dominant) hand was placed into the abdominal cavity through the
      device. The 10-mm 30˚ laparoscope was placed at the inferior or superior crease of the
      umbilicus depending on the spleen size and location. The 10-mm main operating port was in the
      midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus. Carbon dioxide was insufflated continuously
      with 13 mmHg for constant pneumoperitoneum. An intraabdominal exploration for accessory
      spleen was the first step. LigaSure was used as above. With the assistance of the
      intraabdominal hand, the inferior pole and medial splenogastric ligament were dissected
      first, and then the splenorenal ligament and superior pole of the splenophrenic ligament were
      dissected. Then, the splenic vascular pedicule was separated from the pancreatic tail by
      finger dissection. The splenic artery and splenic vein were either ligated with LigaSure or
      silk (00) and sectioned or dissected with an endo vascular stapler (Endo-GIA).

      In the cases of massive splenomegaly, the splenic artery was ligated before the dissection to
      gain enough operative space; this was also the case for LS. Finally, the spleen was placed
      into a retrieval bag and extracted intact via the hand port incision. Routinely, a suction
      drain was placed in the splenic fossa.

      Statistical analysis Data are reported as the mean ± SD. The analysis was performed with the
      statistical package SPSS 10.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Differences between variables were
      compared with nonparametric Mann Whitney-U and Student's t and chi-square tests. Spearman
      correlation analysis was performed for all patients. Results were considered statistically
      significant when the two-tailed p value was less than 0.05.

      DISCUSSION

      In 1991, Delaitre et al. attempted the first laparoscopic LS (12). Since then, the
      laparoscopic approach for splenectomy has gained wide acceptance and has been shown by
      several groups to be a technically successful, safe, and effective procedure. LS is now
      considered the standard approach to removing a normal-sized spleen for patients without other
      contraindications. In cases of splenomegaly, LS is also feasible in experienced hands, but,
      because the larger-sized spleen makes the operative space narrow, the exposure is limited,
      and manipulations are difficult, the LS procedure becomes more technically challenging. The
      hypervascularization and dense adhesions around the spleen hamper the surgeon's performance
      as well. Moreover, once the dissection is completed, the extraction of a giant spleen with a
      solely laparoscopic approach by placing it into a retrieval bag followed by morcellation can
      be difficult, and it can add considerable time to the procedure.

      Some studies have suggested that LS for splenomegaly was associated with longer operation
      times, more blood loss, and higher intraoperative and postoperative complication rates than
      LS for normal-sized spleens (13). In addition, in some cases of splenomegaly, conversion is
      inevitable because of a requirement for an intact specimen for pathologic examination or
      because of serious hypervascularization and dense adhesion as the result of massive size (14,
      15). Targarona et al. (14) indicated that the conversion rate was correlated with the spleen
      weight: for spleens weighing 400 - 1000 g, it was 0, but it rose to 25% for weights &gt; 1000 g
      and to 75% for weights &gt; 3000 g. In their LS group, conversions to laparoscopy-assisted
      splenectomy occurred in four patients (25%), including one case (spleen weight of 1600 g) for
      which pathologic examination determined a sarcoma and three cases of complicated procedures
      due to spleen weight &gt; 3000 g (16). The median splenic weight in our HALS group was 800
      (480-2110)g; we did not have any conversion to OS.
