      This study will examine the long-term outcome of brain injuries, the effects of treatment on
      outcome and the effects of brain injury on people s behavior and abilities.

      Men and women between 18 and 75 years of age who served in combat in the Iraq war may be
      eligible for this study. It will compare test results in those who sustained a traumatic
      penetrating or blast-related brain injury during combat with those who did not.

      Participants undergo the following procedures over a 5-day period of testing that lasts about
      6 hours a day:

        -  Medical history and physical examination.

        -  Blood test for genetic analysis.

        -  Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the electrical activity of the brain.

        -  MRI or CT scans of the brain to look at the structure and blood flow of the brain.

        -  Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor blood flow in the front part of
           the brain blood by measuring changes in near-infrared light.

        -  Neuropsychological testing, including questionnaires, pen-and-paper or computerized
           tests, and performance of simple actions to measure brain function, language, memory and
           other cognitive abilities..

      The Warfighter Head Injury Study (WHIS) is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research study
      of head-injured warfighters to be conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in
      Bethesda, Maryland. The goals of the WHIS include providing clinicians and scientists with
      new insights into the short term recovery of function following traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive and social functions, and to identify
      better predictors of short term outcome (including cognitive, neurological, and genetic
      factors). With the assistance of the Department of Veterans Affairs/Veterans Health
      Administration (VA/VHA), we propose to contact all Iraqi-Afghan (IA) warfighters with
      penetrating head injury (PHI), a cohort of blast injured warfighters, and a group of matched
      (for time in service, combat exposure, age, gender, and preinjury Armed Services Vocational
      Aptitude Battery [ASVAB] scores) healthy warfighter controls as well as healthy volunteers
      with different blast exposures (i.e.: explosives experts, artillery operators, etc ) but no
      documentation of brain injury. We will inquire about their willingness to participate in a
      comprehensive, multidisciplinary outpatient evaluation conducted at the NIH. In addition to
      IA warfighters, we also plan to enroll Vietnam warfighters who were included in the W. F.
      Caveness Vietnam Head Injury Study (VHIS) Registry, in order to conduct detailed comparisons
      between groups. These cohorts represent a unique opportunity for study; they were healthy and
      employed before injury, preinjury intelligence testing is available, and the VA/VHA permits
      long-term follow-up. We have previously investigated Vietnam warfighters with PHI and the
      published results of those studies have changed the management and evaluation of head-injured
      warfighters, and contributed to knowledge of brain function and the long-term effects of head
      injury. Furthermore, based on the knowledge acquired in our previous research with Vietnam
      warfighters and our current interests in the functions of the human PFC, cognitive
      neuroplasticity in the young brain, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic
      epilepsy (PTE), caregiver stress, and genetic-plasticity relationships, we are proposing a
      series of new cognitive neuroscience experiments and battery of standardized
      neuropsychological testing to be conducted during the WHIS. In this effort, the experimental
      testing will be complemented with structural imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or
      computed tomography [CT]), diffusion tensor and perfusion imaging, electroencephalogram
      (EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and molecular genetics evaluations. This
      combination of unique patients, cutting edge cognitive neuroscience experiments and state of
      the art techniques will lead to new scientific knowledge and improved clinical management of
      warfighters with TBI.

      <textblock>
        TBI PATIENTS:

        We will study up to 320 head-injured IA warfighters (200 PHI and 120 blast injuries), most
        of whom have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),
        and up to 500 who have been included in the VHIS Registry. PHI makes up about 20% of the
        total TBI from OIF and OEF.

        We will ask all WHIS patients to travel to the NIH with their primary caregiver to serve as
        their Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) (see Section X for more information on the DPA);
        Caregivers will be asked to complete questionnaires and will execute a separate consent
        (see Caregiver Consent Form).

        Inclusion of active duty military personnel is not essential to this study and can be
        completed without them, if necessary.

        INCLUSION:

          -  Both sexes will be included, however we expect the cohort to be overwhelmingly (&gt;90%)
             male,

          -  Age range18-75;

          -  At least 6 months post-head injury; or

          -  Those patients who have previously participated in the VHIS.

        EXCLUSION:

        -Any medical condition that, in the judgment of investigators, would make participation
        detrimental to the patient (e.g.: severe clinical depression, unstable heart disease).

        CONTROLS:

        We will recruit 50 of the VHIS controls, 200 healthy IA warfighter control subjects, with
        no history of neurologic or serious psychiatric disorder or any other medical condition
        that would pose a risk from participation (e.g., unstable heart disease) and 120 healthy
        volunteers with different exposures but no documentation of brain injury. An example of
        this latter group would include someone who might be employed as a teacher of the proper
        use of explosive devices (i.e. a trainer from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms)
        and functions well in that position except for an occasional complaint. We will recruit up
        to a total of 370 normal volunteers.

        We will ask all WHIS controls to travel to the NIH with a companion, some one deemed close
        to them in terms of relationship (i.e.spouse, child, etc.), to serve as control
        participants for the caregivers of warfighters. Companions will be asked to complete
        questionnaires and will execute a separate consent (see Caregiver/Companion Consent Form).

        INCLUSION:

          -  Control subjects will be healthy IA warfighter volunteers who are matched to
             head-injured IA warfighters for time in service, combat exposure, age, gender and
             preinjury ASVAB scores. All IA warfighter control participants must provide copies of
             their ASVAB induction testing scores, if applicable; or

          -  Individuals who have had different blast exposures (e.g., explosives expert) but no
             documentation of brain injury; or

          -  Those warfighter controls who have previously participated in the VHIS.

        EXCLUSION:

          -  Neurological or psychiatric conditions as mentioned above;

          -  History of drug abuse; or

          -  Unable to travel independently.

        CAREGIVERS/COMPANIONS:

        We will enroll caregivers and companions (i.e.: family members, domestic partners, etc.) of
        WHIS Warfighter participants in order to learn more about the potential burden and related
        issues experienced by this group.

        INCLUSION:

          -  Provides care to a Warfighter or,

          -  Chosen by a control participant as a close companion; and

          -  Their Warfighter provides informed consent and agrees to participate in the WHIS
             project.

        EXCLUSION:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent; or

          -  No working knowledge of the English language.
