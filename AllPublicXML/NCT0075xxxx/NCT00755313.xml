      RATIONALE: Gathering information over time from laboratory tests, imaging scans, and
      assessment tests may help doctors learn more about the side effects of chemotherapy and plan
      the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effects of chemotherapy on the brain in women
      with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To prospectively evaluate the acute (1 month after chemotherapy) and relatively
           long-term (18 months after chemotherapy) effects of standard-dose chemotherapy and/or
           hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibition on brain function using positron emission
           tomography (PET) and the glucose metabolism tracer fludeoxyglucose F 18 in women with
           newly diagnosed, early stage breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the acute and relatively long-term effects of chemotherapy and/or hormonal
           therapy on MRI measurements of hippocampal volume, cortical grey matter volume, white
           matter signal hyperintensities, ventricular volume, and whole brain volume in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the acute and relatively long-term effects of chemotherapy and/or hormonal
           therapy with aromatase inhibition on cognitive function in these patients.

        -  To explore the characteristics of these patients that renders them more vulnerable to
           chemotherapy and/or estrogen suppression-induced cognitive decline.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to planned adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy and
      hormonal therapy vs hormonal therapy vs chemotherapy vs no therapy) and the hormone receptor
      status (positive vs negative).

      Patients (groups A-C) undergo bioavailable estradiol measurements, PET scans, and MRI scans
      at baseline and 1 and 18 months after treatment. Patients also undergo cognitive,
      neuropsychological, sociodemographic, and quality of life assessments using a battery of
      study tests and questionnaires at baseline and at 1, 9, and 18 months after treatment. Group
      D participants (controls) undergo the same testing at equivalent intervals.
