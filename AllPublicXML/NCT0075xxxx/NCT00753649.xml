      This study will evaluate GSK Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine given as a three-dose
      primary vaccination course at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, in terms of safety and immunogenicity
      in different population of infants residing in Canada.

    <time_frame>One month after (POST) Dose 3.</time_frame>
    <description>A seroprotected subject was a subject with anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 milli-International Units ler milliliter (mIU/mL). A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Some of the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the new assay, CLIA.</description>
