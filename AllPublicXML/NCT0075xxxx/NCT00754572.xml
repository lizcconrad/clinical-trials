    <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant's activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring was as follows with respect to performance of participant's everyday activities: 0 =without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3= unable to perform these actions at all. Minimum score was 0, maximum score was 3. A positive change from baseline represents an improvement (reduced level of impairment).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count (DAS28) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 calculated from the number of SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, the ESR (mm/hour) and participant's global assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). DAS28 (less than or equal to ) ≤3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 (greater than) &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response by Categorical DAS28 Responses According to The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR Response) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28- based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline and the level of disease activity reached. Good response: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &lt; 3.2; moderate response: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;1.2 with DAS28 &lt;5.1; No response: change from baseline &lt; 0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AUC of DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC was computed using the trapezoidal rule, considering baseline value as 0, through NCSS software. For each participant, AUC for DAS28 units was calculated. Each individual AUC DAS28 value was divided by 52 to have the conversion of AUC DAS28 in unit weeks to AUC DAS28 in unit years, as 1 week is approximately 1/52 years. The set of individual AUC DAS28 was computed as summary statistics.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue as Assessed Using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-Fatigue) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participant's fatigue. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Remission (DAS28 Less Than [&lt;] 2.6) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 calculated from the SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, the ESR (mm/hour) and participant's global assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). DAS28 (less than or equal to ) ≤3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 (greater than) &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and DAS28&lt;2.6 = remission</description>

    <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, and mental health. Total of 3 variables were analyzed (2 composite subscales and vitality score). The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning).</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant's activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring was as follows with respect to performance of participant's everyday activities: 0 =without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3= unable to perform these actions at all. Minimum score was 0, maximum score was 3. A positive change from baseline represents an improvement (reduced level of impairment).</description>

          <title>HAQ-DI at Baseline and Week 24</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant's activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring was as follows with respect to performance of participant's everyday activities: 0 =without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3= unable to perform these actions at all. Minimum score was 0, maximum score was 3. A positive change from baseline represents an improvement (reduced level of impairment).</description>

Each individual AUC DAS28 value was divided by 52 to have the conversion of AUC DAS28 in unit weeks to AUC DAS28 in unit years, as 1 week is approximately 1/52 years.

        <title>Fatigue as Assessed Using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-Fatigue) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participant's fatigue. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>
