  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-related infection, namely exit site infection and peritonitis, is the commonest
      complication of peritoneal dialysis. This complication causes significant morbidity and
      mortality in patients requiring peritoneal dialysis. Topical application of mupirocin 2%
      cream was first proven to be effective in reduction of staphylococcus-related catheter
      infection in 1990s. Subsequent randomized trial published in 2005 showed that gentamicin
      cream was superior to mupirocin 2% cream in reducing both Gram's positive and Gram's negative
      related catheter infection. However, a retrospective report published in 2007 puts the use of
      prophylactic antibiotic cream into a question. It reported an emergency of non-tuberculous
      mycobacterial infection in a dialysis center in Hong Kong after practising prophylactic
      application of gentamicin cream at the catheter exit site. The following prospective,
      randomized and open-label study aims to find out an optimal regimen of topical antibiotic
      prophylaxis in patients requiring peritoneal dialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical antibiotics therapy is a well-recognized prophylactic therapy towards the catheter
      exit site infection in peritoneal dialysis patient. Previous data has shown the superiority
      of gentamicin cream over the mupirocin cream in this aspect. However, the efficacy of the
      combination therapy using gentamicin cream alternating with mupirocin cream has not been
      tested. There is a potention benefit of reducing drug resistant strain in the combination
      group theoretically.
