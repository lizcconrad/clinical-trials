      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rasagiline is effective in the treatment of
      apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of rasagiline in patients
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) and apathy. Secondary objectives are 1) to evaluate the
      affective and cognitive response to rasagiline and their correlates to apathy and 2) to
      investigate the metabolic and neurophysiologic correlates of the behavioural, cognitive and
      emotional, aspects of apathy in PD. This will be an exploratory, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, parallel-group study. 40 PD patients with apathy and without dementia
      will be recruited. Rasagiline 1 mg or matching placebo will be administered once daily in
      conjunction with the subjects' usual oral antiparkinsonian medications for up to 12 weeks.
      Patients will be evaluated at screening (-7 days) and baseline (0), as well as at weeks 4, 8,
      and 12. A perfusion SPECT will be performed at baseline and at week 12. The study will be
      conducted at the Movement Disorders Unit of the Neurology Department at Sant Pau Hospital
      (Barcelona, Spain).

             doses of L-Dopa and/or dopamine agonists and showing a non-zero score on the item 4
             (motivation/initiative) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dementia associated to PD according to DSM IV criteria. History of primary psychiatric
             illness or Axis I diagnoses according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV

          -  Patients complaining of acute mood or cognitive fluctuations in response to
             dopaminergic medication
