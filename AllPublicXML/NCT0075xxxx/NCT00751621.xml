    <measure>Total Serum IgG Trough Levels</measure>

    <measure>Annualized Rate of Clinically Documented Serious Bacterial Infections (SBIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized rate was based on the total number of SBIs and the total number of subject study days for all subjects in the specified analysis population and adjusted to 365 days.
Potential SBIs included bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia and septicemia, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial meningitis, and visceral abscess. If an adverse event (AE) was identified as a potential SBI, the AE was adjudicated by the Medical Monitor and Investigator to determine if the event fulfilled the predefined criteria for SBIs.</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (Short Form 36 Health Survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at the last available post-baseline observation for each subject (up to 42 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item questionnaire that measures generic health concepts that are relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. The questions are grouped into eight domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>

    <measure>Clinically Relevant Changes in Vital Signs From Baseline to the Completion Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (data either from Infusion 40 or the completion visit of study ZLB06_001CR), and at completion (up to 42 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of subjects with clinically relevant changes in vital signs from baseline to the completion visit. Vital signs included heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinically Significant Abnormal Changes in Routine Laboratory Parameters Between Baseline and the Completion Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (data either from Infusion 40 or the completion visit of study ZLB06_001CR), and at completion (up to 42 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of subjects with clinically significant abnormal changes in routine laboratory parameters between baseline and the completion visit. Routine laboratory parameters included haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate, Severity and Relatedness of Any Adverse Events (AEs) Per Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of AEs was the number of AEs over the number of infusions administered. Mild AE: Did not interfere with routine activities; Moderate AE: Interfered somewhat with routine activities; Severe AE: Impossible to perform routine activities. At least possibly related AEs included possibly related AEs, probably related AEs, and related AEs.</description>

        <description>The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item questionnaire that measures generic health concepts that are relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. The questions are grouped into eight domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>
