  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of single-agent D4064A
      administered by IV infusion to patients with recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian
      cancer (EOC), primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), and fallopian tube cancer (FTC) who have
      previously received a platinum-containing regimen. The study will enroll up to 56 patients at
      up to six investigative sites in the United States.
