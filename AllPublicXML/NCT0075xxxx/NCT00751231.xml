  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, clopidogrel-controlled study
      of IV and oral PRT060128 compared to clopidogrel in patients undergoing non-urgent (including
      elective) PCI. After diagnostic angiography, patients scheduled for non-urgent PCI will be
      randomized to clopidogrel or to one of three dose levels of PRT060128.

  <detailed_description>

      Each patient randomized in this trial will participate for approximately 12-24 weeks,
      including a Screening period of up to 2 weeks, the acute peri-procedural phase, and a 60-120
      day chronic treatment phase. The chronic phase includes daily in-hospital assessments until
      24 Hours or Discharge (whichever comes first), a telephone follow-up on Day 7-10
      post-Discharge, outpatient follow-up visits on Days 30 and 60-67, [Day 90 and Day 120 (if
      treated for 120 days)] and a telephone follow-up 7 days following the last dose of study
      drug.
