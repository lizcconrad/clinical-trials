  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effect the combination of fulvestrant
      (Faslodex) and dasatinib (Sprycel) has on advanced breast cancer compared to fulvestrant
      alone.

    <time_frame>Date of randomization to date of initial disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to January 2014 (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint evaluated the progression free survival (PFS) of participants amongst the total evaluable population. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to either the date the subject was first recorded as having PD (even if the subject went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the subject died due to any causes before progression. Participants with no recorded post-baseline tumor assessment had PFS censored at the day of randomization. Participants lost to follow-up were censored at the last date of contact. Participants that had not progressed or died had PFS censored at the date of last follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Median Time of Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization to date of initial disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to January 2014 (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time in months from randomization to either the date the subject was first recorded as having PD (even if the subject went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the subject died due to any causes before progression. Progression=At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing no disease progression or death from any cause at 6 months after randomization. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to either the date the subject was first recorded as having PD (even if the subject went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the subject died due to any causes before progression. Progression=At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Kaplan Meier assessments were used to estimate the percentages.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit for At Least 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization to date of initial disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to January 2014 (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the percentage of participants that had Stable Disease (SD), complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) for greater than or equal to 6 months if there was no evidence of progression at or before assessment performed on or after Study Day 161. CR= Disappearance of all target lesions. No new lesions. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD= Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Physical examination, radiological assessment, and bone scans (if applicable) were used to assess outcome.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR) , Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Disease Progression (PD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization to date of initial disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to January 2014 (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Table represents the best response achieved over this time frame. CR = Disappearance of all target lesions. No new lesions. PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization to date of initial disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to January 2014 (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response rate (ORR) = number of participants with measurable lesions by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) having a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by number of randomized participants. RECIST 1.1 response criteria applies. To be recorded as best response, CR or PR had to be confirmed at ≥ 4 weeks interval. An unconfirmed CR was recorded as PR.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, Death, and Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization to date of initial disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first), up to January 2014 (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) defined: any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. Serious adverse event (SAE) defined: a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study started September 2008 and completed January 2014; 9 participants chose to remain on active treatment after the study completed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>100 participants were enrolled and 100 participants were randomized (50 to each arm). 99 were treated (50 with fulvestrant + dasatinib and 49 with single-agent fulvestrant). Reason for non-treatment is that there was 1 withdrawal by participant.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months</title>
        <description>PFS rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing no disease progression or death from any cause at 6 months after randomization. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to either the date the subject was first recorded as having PD (even if the subject went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the subject died due to any causes before progression. Progression=At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Kaplan Meier assessments were used to estimate the percentages.</description>

These participants are all inclusive and not limited to Fulvestrant or Fulvestrant and Dasatinib treatment only. The timeframe for when these events occurred were not immediately available and may have been caused by previous exposure to Fulvestrant only (pre-crossover), therefore the events for this patient population are also reported separately.
