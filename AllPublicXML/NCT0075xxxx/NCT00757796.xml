  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies demonstrate that sleep disturbances are associated with cognitive dysfunction and
      attention deficit. However the correlation between the severity of obstructive sleep apnea
      and the degree of cognitive dysfunction was not demonstrated. Our hypothesis is that patients
      suffering from a more severe sleep apnea will demonstrate a greater degree of cognitive
      dysfunction.

      Studies demonstrate that sleep disturbances are associated with cognitive dysfunction and
      attention deficit. However the correlation between the severity of sleep disturbances and the
      degree of cognitive dysfunction was not demonstrated.We intend to study 80 patients with
      various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea. All patients will undergo executive cognitive
      tests as well as tests to assess for levels of depression, anxiety and attention.
