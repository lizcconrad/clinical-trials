      The purpose of this study was to assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of aztreonam
      for inhalation solution versus tobramycin inhalation solution in adult and pediatric patients
      with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection.

      Number of Subjects Planned: Approximately 240 randomized patients

      Target Population: CF patients &gt;= 6 years of age with stable pulmonary disease, who at study
      entry had a recent positive sputum culture for PA and had been previously treated with
      aerosolized antibiotics without demonstration of drug intolerance.

      The randomized phase of this study, used for hypotheses testing, enrolled participants from
      both the United States (US) and EU. An open-label, single-arm extension was available for
      participants in the EU who completed at least one course of AZLI or TIS during the randomized
      portion of the study. These participants were eligible to receive 3 additional cycles of AZLI
      in a 28-day, intermittent, repeating treatment regimen. Results of the extension phase will
      be available the first quarter (Q1) of 2012.

      Randomized Phase Study Design (US and EU): This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized,
      parallel group study. The study design consisted of 2 treatment arms of 28-day, intermittent,
      repeating treatment regimens: aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) or tobramycin
      inhalation solution (TIS). The total study period was 26 weeks. The study schedule included 9
      visits - Screening, Baseline, Day 14, Day 28, followed by visits every 28 days through the
      end of the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment Course 1 (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines at each visit. FEV1 percent predicted is a normalized value of FEV1 calculated using the Knudson equation and based upon participant age, gender, and height. Treatment effect on the relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 (Visit 4) was tested using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model-based method.</description>

    <description>Spirometry was performed according to ATS guidelines at each visit. FEV1 percent predicted is a normalized value of FEV1 calculated using the Knudson equation and based upon participant age, gender, and height.
Treatment effect on the average adjusted means for the actual change in FEV1 percent predicted at Visits 4, 6, and 8 (Weeks 4, 12, and 20) was tested by mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis using the ITT population analysis set.</description>

    <description>Spirometry was performed according to ATS guidelines. FEV1 percent predicted is a normalized value of FEV1 calculated using the Knudson equation and based upon participant age, gender, and height. Treatment effect on the relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 (Visit 4) was tested using an ANCOVA model-based method, using the population of participants with prior inhaled tobramycin use of &gt;= 84 days in the previous 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Time to Need for Intravenous (IV) Antipseudomonal Antibiotics for Respiratory Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 168 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>IV antipseudomonal antibiotic use for a respiratory event was determined through the adjudication of events by a sponsor-independent, blinded review committee.
Use was compiled from data recorded on the concomitant medications electronic case report form (eCRF) and compared to reported adverse events (AEs) to determine use for a respiratory event. The time to IV antipseudomonal antibiotic use was measured in days from baseline (Visit 2) to the date of first IV antipseudomonal antibiotic use or the date of study completion (last visit)/or early withdrawal if censored.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Respiratory Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 168 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint was determined through the adjudication of events by a sponsor-independent, blinded review committee. Committee members reviewed all hospitalizations and determined which were related to respiratory events.
Details of all hospitalizations, including the dates of admission and discharge, were recorded on the serious adverse event (SAE) eCRF.
Time to first respiratory hospitalization was the number of days from baseline (Visit 2) to the date of first respiratory hospitalization or the date of study completion (last visit) /or early withdrawal if censored.</description>
