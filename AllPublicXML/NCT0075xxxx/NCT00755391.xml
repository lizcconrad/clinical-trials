  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the effectiveness of individual cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) and supportive psychotherapy (SP) in reducing bulimic symptoms among adolescents.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to have an equal chance of either receiving CBT or SP.
      Participants will include both individuals with DSM-IV bulimia nervosa (BN), and patients
      with sub-threshold BN. Adolescent patients will be treated at the New York State Psychiatric
      Institute, with a target recruitment of 20 patients completing the study. Participants in
      both conditions will be assessed prior to treatment and at the end of treatment. This trial
      is intended to serve as a pilot investigation to determine the feasibility and utility of a
      larger controlled study in this population.
