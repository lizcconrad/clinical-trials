    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the oral contraceptive (OC) SH T00658ID over Ortho
      Tri-Cyclen Lo administered for 13 cycles to healthy female volunteers between 18 and 50 years
      of age who request oral contraceptive protection. Subjects on a levonorgestrel (LNG),
      norgestimate (NGM), norethindrone or norethindrone acetate containing oral contraceptive in a
      21-day regimen suffering from hormone withdrawal-associated symptoms such as pelvic pain or
      headache or both, and willing to continue OC use but to switch to SH T00658ID or Ortho
      Tri-Cyclen Lo.

    <description>Subject self-assessed pelvic pain or headache per visual analog scale (VAS) values during the menstrual/withdrawal bleeding episode and Baseline. The VAS consists of a 100 mm long straight line, with verbal anchors at either end, representing a continuum of pain intensity. Accordingly, the scale ranges from 0 mm (absence of pain) to 100 mm (unbearable pain), and the change ranges from -100 mm (best) to 100 mm (worst).</description>

    <description>CGI is used to collect information regarding the subject's total clinical experience. The assessment scale ranges from 0 to 7: (0=not assessed; 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse). The scale of 1, 2, and 3 were categorized as improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With no Increase in Rescue Medication and VAS Decrease During Cycle Days 22 to 28 From Baseline to Cycle 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22-28 from Baseline to Day 22-28 from Cycle 6 (28 days per Cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medication was standardized intake of 200 mg Ibuprofen tablets. Baseline: 7 days (Day 22) before first menstrual bleeding to Day 28. Treatment: 7 days (Day 22) before withdrawal bleeding of 6th cycle to Day 28 before the same cycle. The visual analog scale (VAS) is a subject-assessed measure of pelvic pain or headache consisting of a 100 mm long straight line, with verbal anchors at either end, representing a continuum of pain intensity. Accordingly, the scale ranges from 0 mm (absence of pain) to 100 mm (unbearable pain), and the change ranges from -100 mm (best) to 100 mm (worst).</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Cycle 6 in PGWBI Questionnaire's assessment of participant's overall sense of well-being or distress. The PGWBI includes 22 items that, apart from combining into a global overall score, are divided into 6 dimensions: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, health, and vitality. The response format used a 6-grade Likert scale and the change in the normalized PGWBI global score as well as all the sub-domains score ranges from -100 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With no Increase in Rescue Medication and VAS Decrease During Cycle Days 22 to 28 From Baseline to Cycle 6</title>
        <description>Rescue medication was standardized intake of 200 mg Ibuprofen tablets. Baseline: 7 days (Day 22) before first menstrual bleeding to Day 28. Treatment: 7 days (Day 22) before withdrawal bleeding of 6th cycle to Day 28 before the same cycle. The visual analog scale (VAS) is a subject-assessed measure of pelvic pain or headache consisting of a 100 mm long straight line, with verbal anchors at either end, representing a continuum of pain intensity. Accordingly, the scale ranges from 0 mm (absence of pain) to 100 mm (unbearable pain), and the change ranges from -100 mm (best) to 100 mm (worst).</description>
