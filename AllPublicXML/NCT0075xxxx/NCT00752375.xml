  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who present with pyelonephritis undergo many investigations, and long term care to
      prevent renal damage. The focus is primarily on preventing renal failure however along the
      way and particularly with children, other issues arise which impact their lives, as well as
      their family's lives. Parents are concerned about subjecting their children to invasive
      procedures and long term antibiotic use, particularly if they are not sure of the benefit.
      This study seeks to provide information on the impact of investigation and long term
      antibiotic treatment in reference to long term health and quality of life in children who
      present with febrile urinary tract infections in the absence of anatomic abnormalities.
