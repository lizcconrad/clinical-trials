      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3)
      substitution on the posttransplant outcome (glomerular filtration rate as well as serum
      creatinine levels, number of acute rejection episodes, number of infections and C-reactive
      protein levels within the first year after transplantation) in vitamin D deficient kidney
      transplant recipients.

      Apart from its classical actions in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D acts as a potent
      immunomodulatory agent. As such, vitamin D is thought to have beneficial effects in the
      transplant setting, especially in kidney transplant recipients considering the fact that
      approximately 40% of all kidney transplant recipients are vitamin D deficient.

      Therefore, the objective is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      focusing on the impact of Cholecalciferol substitution in vitamin D deficient kidney
      transplant recipients on graft function (glomerular filtration rate as well as serum
      creatinine levels), incidence of acute rejection episodes, frequency and severity (CRP
      levels) of posttransplant infections within the first year after kidney transplantation.

      Moreover, the impact of Vitamin D3 on renal osteodystrophy will be analyzed by means of bone
      mineral density. DXA measurements will be performed during the first four weeks after kidney
      transplantation, after 5, and after 12 months posttransplant.

      Kidney transplant recipients found to have vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D &lt; 50 nmol/l) will be included and will be randomized to receive either oral Vitamin D3
      therapy or placebo. Vitamin D3 will be administered at a daily dose of 6800IU over a time
      period of one year.

      All in all, 200 subjects will be included in the VITA-D study.
