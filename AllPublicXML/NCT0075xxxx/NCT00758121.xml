      The objective of the study is to determine if there is any relationship between respiratory
      rate and Heart Failure events.

      The purpose of the CORRELATE-HF study is to collect RRT data in heart failure patients to
      gain a better understanding of how respiratory rate changes in relation to all cause clinical
      events as well as other diagnostic features, including but not limited to, activity level,
      heart rate, and lead impedance.

    Inappropriate therapy associated with certain right ventricular (RV) lead complications may
    occur more frequently if the Respiratory Sensor is programmed On
