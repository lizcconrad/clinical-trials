  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposal is to evaluate the ability of ultrasound to predict and
      routinely (weekly) monitor changes in the body composition of healthy preterm infants in the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in response to nutritional intake. The investigators
      hypothesize that ultrasound is an accurate method to routinely monitor the quality of weight
      gain and assess the adequacy of nutritional provision for premature infants in the neonatal
      intensive care unit.

      The investigators will address the hypothesis in the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Validate ultrasound as a method to measure whole body fat mass and fat free
      mass in healthy, premature infants. Body composition will be assessed using ultrasound
      measurements and the validated method of air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Stable
      isotope dilution techniques will be used in a subset of our population as a secondary source
      of validation.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine whether ultrasound measurements can detect clinically relevant
      (weekly) changes in body composition in healthy premature infants. Ultrasound will be used to
      obtain serial (weekly) measurements of muscle and adipose tissue thickness (triceps, abdomen,
      quadriceps) until discharge in healthy, premature infants.
