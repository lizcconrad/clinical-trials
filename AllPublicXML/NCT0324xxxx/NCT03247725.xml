      The present investigation aims at exploring the effect of including a pain app called Pain
      Monitor for chronic pain patients' daily monitoring. Three conditions will be set:

        1. usual treatment (waiting list)

        2. usual treatment + app (without alarms)

        3. usual treatment + app (with alarms)

      Chronic pain is defined as one that lasts for at least three to six months, provided that
      this time is greater than the normal healing period of an injury. This pathology has become
      an important public health problem due to its high prevalence. In particular, it is estimated
      that it affects 20-30% of the adult population around the world. Medical interventions are
      the first-line treatment in recent clinical practice guidelines. Unfortunately, the
      effectiveness of medical interventions is only modest. Treatments significantly reduce pain
      on average, but the effect tends to be small . In addition, the drugs are not effective for a
      large percentage of patients.

      What these and other research suggest is that focusing only on large sample studies and the
      use of average change scores calls into question the usefulness of current patient-centered
      treatments. As noted by Dr. Turk, when data are averaged, various pain syndromes, drugs,
      surgical procedures, and studies in different countries are often included, which may mask
      the efficacy results of different treatments with Different samples. Single case methodology
      could be one of the ways to overcome these limitations. The single case investigation is a
      type of experimental study that offers experimental control within a single case.

      Some studies have already demonstrated the usefulness of these designs in chronic pain. In
      fact, the benefits of using this methodology as opposed to large sample studies were
      discussed recently during the 10th Congress of the European Pain Federation. These benefits
      include the need for a reduced number of participants, the ability to follow clinical
      evolution in real time and continuously, the amount of data provided, and applicability when
      using a control group is impractical or unethical.

      The investigators conducting the present investigation recently conducted a study at the Pain
      Unit of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital to explore the effectiveness of current medical
      treatments. According to previous investigations, the treatment effect was only small (d =
      0.32) and only a percentage of the patients (18.1%) had a clinically significant reduction of
      pain (ie a reduction greater than 30% ).

      From these results and the literature reviewed, a single case design could be an alternative
      method for research in the Pain Unit. However, the implementation of this type of methodology
      can be very costly due to the continuous evaluation of the evolution of the patient. In this
      sense, several studies have already shown that mobile applications (app) can effectively
      control the evolution of a wide range of pathologies in health settings . In fact, a recent
      controlled clinical study found that ecological records performed with mobile app had greater
      reliability than paper-and-pencil records.

      Rosser and Eccleston conducted a comprehensive review of existing apps for pain and the
      conclusion was that there was little evidence to support the use of current apps.
      Specifically, these authors showed that most apps did not specify whether their content was
      validated, did not include psychological components and none had been applied in a clinical
      study. In light of these results, Dr. Carlos Suso Ribera and Dr. Ribera Canudas contacted the
      research team Labpsitec of Jaume I University, who were developing an application for pain
      called &quot;Pain Monitor&quot;. Dr. Carlos Suso Ribera and Dr. Ribera Canudas of the Pain Unit
      collaborated with Dr. Azucena García Palacios and Dr. Diana Castilla López of the Universitat
      Jaume I in the final development of the application of pain, Following the guidelines of
      Rosser and Eccleston.

      App content validity and usability was tested in a previous study at the pain unit of the
      Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Suso-Ribera et al., in preparation). Thus, the study objective is to
      test if the introduction of this tool in the day-to-day work of the pain unit improves pain
      management of chronic pain patients. To do this, it is necessary to compare the evolution of
      patients who follow the usual treatment at the pain unit (without app) with a group of
      patients who do use the Pain Monitor app. In addition, the present study investigators have
      created a new utility that allows alarms to be generated by healthcare professionals in the
      presence of an undesired event, such as an adverse effect of the medication or a lack of
      response to medical treatment. Before determining that both the use of the app and this new
      utility (alarms) are beneficial for patient care, it is necessary to perform a clinical trial
      comparing the 3 conditions mentioned above:

        1. usual treatment (waiting list)

        2. usual treatment + app (without alarms)

        3. usual treatment + app (with alarms) Therefore, this is a clinical trial without drugs.
           This is not an observational study since the physicians of patients in the app + alarms
           condition will be asked to react to an alarm (i.e., if the patient has nausea for 3
           consecutive days) by calling the patient and changing the treatment telematically, if
           necessary, so that the patient can collect the prescription at his primary care center.

      If the condition app with alarms results in a better treatment of chronic pain patients,
      participants of the other two conditions will be offered the possibility to use the app with
      alarms at the end of the study.

      The study will be conducted at the Pain Unit of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital. All study
      procedures have been approved by the ethical committee of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital.
