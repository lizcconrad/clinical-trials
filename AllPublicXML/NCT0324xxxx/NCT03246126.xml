    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an investigational device called the
      ValiantTM Visceral Manifold Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System for the repair of
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), which is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta (major
      artery leading away from your heart) that originates in your chest and extends to your
      abdomen and also includes the branch arteries that supply blood to the liver, spleen,
      intestine, kidneys and other organs in your abdomen. The word &quot;investigational&quot; means the
      device is still being tested and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for sale in the United States.

      The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to assess the use of the thoracic
      bifurcation and the visceral manifold to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients
      having appropriate anatomy. The primary intent of the study is to assess safety (i.e. freedom
      from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days) and preliminary effectiveness (i.e., treatment
      success and technical success) of the device (i.e., the proportion of treatment group
      subjects that achieve and maintain treatment success at one year). Additionally, the study
      will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow-up interval.

    <description>The Visceral Manifold System is comprised of the Thoracic Bifurcation and Visceral Manifold to treat a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm or TAAA. The experimental procedure to implant the stent graft will be done in an operating room and will last anywhere from four to eight hours, but may take longer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient may be entered into the study if the patient has at least one of the
             following:

          -  An aneurysm with a maximum diameter of &gt; 5.5 cm or 2 times the normal diameter just
             proximal to the aneurysm using orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular to the centerline)
             measurements

          -  Aneurysm with a history of growth &gt; 0.5 cm in 6 months

          -  Saccular aneurysm deemed at significant risk for rupture

          -  Symptomatic aneurysm greater than 4.5 cm

          -  Axillary or brachial and iliac or femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible
             with vascular access techniques, devices or accessories, with or without use of a
             surgical conduit

          -  Proximal landing zone for the thoracic bifurcation stent graft that has:

          -  ≥ 2.5 cm of nonaneurysmal aortic segment including previously placed graft material
             (neck) distal to the left subclavian artery (LSA) diameter in the range of 26-42 mm

          -  Adequate distance from the celiac artery, in order to accommodate cannulation from the
             antegrade access point when considering the total deployed length of the thoracic
             bifurcation and visceral manifold

          -  Minimum branch vessel diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm

          -  Iliac artery or aortic distal fixation site, including both native tissue and
             previously placed graft, greater than or equal to 15 mm in length and diameter in the
             range of 8 - 25 mm
