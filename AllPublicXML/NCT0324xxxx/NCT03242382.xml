  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-randomized, open, single cohort, phase II, multicenter national clinical trial. 19 sites
      in Spain.

      Palbociclib will be administered orally at a dose of 125 mg once a day for 21 consecutive
      days followed by 7 rest days to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity,
      non-compliance, withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision

      The main goal is to determine progression-free survival rate (PFSR) according to RECIST 1.1
      at 6 months
