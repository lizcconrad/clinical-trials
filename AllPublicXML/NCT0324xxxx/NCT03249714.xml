  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will provide efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics data for
      ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks compared with placebo for 24 weeks in
      patients from Japan and the other countries and also provide the extended efficacy, safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics data.

      This study has 2 parts: A controlled Core and an open-label Extension.

        -  Core part: A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group,
           multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability and PK of ofatumumab
           in patients with relapsing MS.

        -  Extension part: The Core part is followed by an Extension part in which all patients
           receive open-label ofatumumab. In the Extension part, patients are treated for at least
           24 weeks and no longer than 48 weeks.

      Approximately 60 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ofatumumab or placebo in the
      Core part; half of the study patients will be from Japan and the other half from the other
      countries.
