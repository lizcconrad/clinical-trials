      The purpose of this non-randomized, non-controlled, acute, single-arm research study is to
      evaluate the feasibility to obtain a stable position of a ring of stimulation electrodes on
      the interatrial septum. The possibility to terminate atrial arrythmias will also be
      evaluated.

      The evidence of treating AF by pacing is limited, although these algorithms are of interest,
      since they appear to be safe and usually add little additional cost.

      Using a computer model, a new dual-stage septal pacing has been developed.The proposed septal
      pacing algorithm could suppress AF reentries in a more robust way than classical single site
      rapid pacing. The feasibility of pacing both atria simultaneously from a single lead placed
      in the interatrial septum has been previously demonstrated clinically. The septal pacing
      concept has also been successfully tested in a computer model of AF and in a pig model .
      Experimental studies are now needed to determine whether similar termination mechanisms and
      efficacies can be observed in humans.

      The purpose of this non-randomized, non-controlled, acute, single-arm research study is to
      evaluate the feasibility to obtain a stable position of a ring of stimulation electrodes on
      the interatrial septum

    <intervention_model_description>Approximately 15 subjects with AF indicated for ablation of the pulmonary vein will be enrolled in the study. Participants will attend the Baseline visit and the Procedure visit. The baseline visit can be on the same day as the ablation procedure. Since it is an acute study, no follow-up visit will occur. The research procedure will be performed during an already scheduled ablation procedure. Subjects will be enrolled over a period of approximately 18 months</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Pacing Site Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To assess Pacing Site Stability, the number of interatrial septal pacing electrodes which are successfully placed in a stable position, will be counted. A stable position in this study is defined as a location where the pacing threshold will be &lt; 10 mA at a pacing pulse width of 1 msec. Stable pacing further requires that no ventricular capture will be induced during atrial stimulation at twice the atrial capture threshold.</description>

    <measure>Localized Atrial Capture</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To assess Localized Atrial Capture the following endpoints will be considered: The number of AF episodes in which local capture is recorded during atrial septal stimulation in at least one of the electrode positions;the number of electrodes for which local capture is determined using various pacing schemes;the spatial extend of capture (assessed from the atrial electrograms recorded from the multipolar right atrial catheter and the multipolar coronary sinus catheter) to obtain local atrial capture obtained with septal pacing of AF, will be assessed off-line after the study procedure;</description>

    <description>After pulmonary vein isolation, during the routine waiting time of half an hour to confirm efficacy of the ablation, the study procedure will be performed.Septal catheter, already in place in right atrium, will be positioned on the interatrial septum, via transeptal puncture.If the patient will not be in sinus rhythm, he/she will be externally cardioverted. During sinus rhythm pacing thresholds and impedances on all septal catheter electrodes will be determined. Next, atrial fibrillation will be induced by rapid atrial pacing.AF cycle length will be determined in the left atrial appendage, during 1 minute of atrial fibrillation using ablation catheter electrodes.Subsequently a pacing scheme will be applied and capture on decapolar recording catheters, already in place for the standard ablation procedure will be assessed as well as AF termination.</description>
