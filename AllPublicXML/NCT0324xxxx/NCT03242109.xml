  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease and malignancies account for more than 70% of all causes of mortality
      and morbidity in Italy. There is a subtle balance between genetic determinants and lifestyle,
      that often defines the line between health and sickness. So far studies aiming at identifying
      risk factors have mainly come from Northern Europe and the USA. It was to understand this
      balance between genetics and environmental determinants better, and to tailor appropriate
      preventive strategies for Italian and other Southern European populations, that the Moli-sani
      study was launched, transforming a small Italian region into a large scientific laboratory:
      the &quot;Molise lab&quot;.

      Each participant received a thorough medical check-up at no cost to either him/her or the
      national health service, resulting in thousands of hours of free public health care. With a
      completely computerized system, Moli-sani is a &quot;paperless&quot; study, in which researchers and
      participants communicate using recently developed technologies such as mobile phone text
      messages (SMS). The biological data bank (the &quot;MoliBank&quot;) is one of the largest in Europe.
      Paying particular attention towards innovation and new technologies, the Moli-sani study has
      placed itself at the cutting edge of a new paradigm crossing research and prevention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cohort of the Moli-sani study has recruited 24,325 persons, aged &gt;35 years, resident in
      the Molise region.The latter covers an area of 4,438 Km2, including 136 towns. Participants
      are recruited from city-hall registries by a multistage sampling. Firstly townships were
      sampled in three major areas of Molise region, starting from the main cities (Campobasso,
      Termoli, Isernia) by cluster sampling, then, within each township, participants are selected
      by simple random sampling, using electronically generated numbers.Exclusion criteria are
      pregnancy at the time of recruitment, disturbances in understanding or willingness, current
      poly-traumas or coma, refusal to sign the Informed Consent form. All subjects identified are
      sent a letter inviting them to participate in the project, followed a few days later by a
      phone call. The recruitment started in the area of Campobasso, then it moved to the areas of
      Termoli.

        Moli-sani is a population-based cohort study that recruited, between March 2005 and April
        2010, 24,325 men and women at random from individuals aged 35 years or older resident in
        the Molise region, to investigate genetic and environmental risk factors for
        cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and tumour diseases.
