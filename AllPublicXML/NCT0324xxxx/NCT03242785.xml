    <textblock>
      The ADAMPA study is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an intervention based on self-monitoring and self-titration of medication in
      poorly controlled hypertensive patients 40 years and older. The total duration of the study
      is 3 years, with 6 months of enrolment and 1 year of follow-up to measure the primary
      endpoint (Difference in mean systolic blood pressure, in mmHg, between the intervention and
      control groups).

      ADAMPA study. Objectives: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of an intervention that
      includes educational components, self-monitoring of blood pressure and self-titration of
      antihypertensive medication in the improvement of control of hypertension compared to usual
      care in a poorly controlled population of hypertensive patients.

      Design: Pragmatic, controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial with two parallel arms.

      Disease related to the study: Hypertension.

      Main outcome measure: Difference in mean systolic blood pressure, in mmHg. At 12 months of
      follow-up between the intervention and control groups, determined at physicians' practice
      with a validated automatic electronic sphygmomanometer

      Study population: Patients assigned to the Valencia Clinic-La Malvarrosa Health Department.
      Total number of patients to be randomized: 458 (229 per arm).

      Duration of intervention: 12 months (also, a pragmatic extension with passive follow-up is
      planned for 24 months, collecting a reduced set of outcome variables, as secondary variables)

      Calendar and expected completion date: The trial will take place over 3 years (6 months of
      recruitment, 12 months of follow-up for the main analysis of results, 12 months of pragmatic
      follow-up at 24 months, and finally 6 months for reporting results). Estimated Completion
      Date: 2020.

    <description>The intervention of the ADAMPA trial is not pharmacological but an intervention that modifies usual clinical practice. The intervention of self-monitoring and self-titration of the medication is composed of 3 elements:
Education of the patient: information and training on hypertension, its risks, management, the benefits of an adequate control and the generic measures for an optimal control.
Training for self-monitoring: Patients will be trained to perform the self-measurement of blood pressure correctly (and recording their values in the sheet enabled for this purpose)
Training for self-titration: patients will be instructed on the target BP numbers, individualized for each patient, on the mode of action against specific figures, including self-adjustment of drug treatment.</description>
