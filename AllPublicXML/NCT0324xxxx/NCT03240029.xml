  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few data about the evaluation of consequences of past life with cancer on life quality of
      children in school reintegration are available in literature. Nevertheless, some of these
      studies show that the reintegration impairs life quality of these children (school
      difficulties, conflictual relations with peers…). The hypothesis is that children with past
      life with cancer have more chances to have school integration difficulties with a consequent
      life quality degradation compared to healthy children.

      The main objective of this project is to study the relation between the satisfaction of
      school reintegration of children in cancer remission and the evolution of life quality in the
      medium term (after getting back to school). More exactly, it is the question if the
      satisfaction of school reintegration influences life goals and priorities of these children.

      The secondary objective is to study the role of psychological status of these children
      (anxiety, depressive symptoms) on satisfaction-life quality relation.

      A group of children with cancer history sent to ordinary school is compared to a control
      group of children sent to school in the same conditions (sex and age matched). Data are
      collected with questionnaires some months to several years after school reintegration and
      same questionnaires 1 year later.

      If the study hypothesis is confirmed, this study will show the necessity of a long term
      follow up of children in cancer remission and not only medical care, but also psychological
      and social care, in order to support a better school reintegration.
