  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HELLP syndrome is a life-threatening obstetric complication usually considered to be a
      variant or complication of pre-eclampsia. And may occasionally be confused with other
      diseases complicating pregnancy such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy, gastroenteritis,
      hepatitis, appendicitis, gallbladder disease, immune thrombocytopenia, lupus flare,
      antiphospholipid syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,
      and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The distinction between thrombotic thrombocytopenic
      purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome and severe preeclampsia is important for therapeutic and
      prognostic reasons. However, the clinical and histological features are so similar that
      establishing the correct diagnosis is often difficult; furthermore, these disorders may occur
      concurrently.

      When TTP/HUS does occur during pregnancy, they often are confused initially with obstetric
      diagnoses such as severe preeclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets
      (HELLP) syndrome; acute fatty liver of pregnancy; eclampsia, and antiphospholipid antibody
      syndrome. This might be related to the fact that the disease entity is rare and often is
      unexpected. Nevertheless, a delay in diagnosis of TTP/HUS may result in life-threatening
      maternal and fetal consequences. Aim of the current study was to compare the quantitative
      assessment of schistocytes in peripheral blood smear between women initially diagnosed as
      HELLP syndrome who showed no spontaneous resolution within 48 hrs after delivery and those
      who showed spontaneous resolution within 48 hrs after delivery which may help in decreasing
      the maternal mortality rate .

        A total of 100 women with an initial diagnosis of HELLP syndrome were recruited in the
        study.

        Blood sample taken within 12hrs peripartum and patients followed up 48hrs after delivery
        and subdivided in to 2 groups according to improvement or deterioration after 48hrs after
        delivery .
