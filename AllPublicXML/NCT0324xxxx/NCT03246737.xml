    <textblock>
      Multiple cardiovascular adaptations happen during pregnancy. When gestational hypertensive
      disorders (GHD) occurs, these adaptations are abnormal. Approximately 5 - 8 % of all pregnant
      women develop GHD.

      GHD is an pregnancy complication which is characterized by an elevated blood pressure (≥
      140/90 mm Hg) and sometimes the appearance of proteinuria (≥3 g/ 24 hours) after twenty weeks
      of pregnancy. When this remains uncured, GHD can have severe complications for both mother
      and child. For this reason, a close follow-up of women with a high risk for developing this
      condition is recommended. This to detect and threat GHD early.

      Patients can be included when they are at least 10 weeks pregnant. Every pregnant women
      receives two devices to control daily here parameters in her home environment: a blood
      pressure monitor and an activity tracker. The women will be asked to perform two blood
      pressure measurements a day and to wear the activity tracker day and night. This data will be
      send by Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to the investigator in the hospital. Also will the women be asked
      to measure once a week her weight and send this to the hospital.

      Name of the device Measurement Protocol Blood pressure monitor Blood pressure, heart rate
      Twice a day (morning and evening) Activity tracker Activity- and sleep pattern Day and night
      Weight scale (not remote) Weight Once a week (morning)

      The investigator controls daily the incoming measurements and consults the responsible
      gyneacologist when events (= abnormal blood pressure or weight measurement) occurs. Depending
      on the decisions of the gyneacologist, following actions can be performed:

        -  Further observations

        -  Extra monitor

        -  Adjustments to the medication scheme

        -  Performing an 24 hours urine collection

        -  Admission to the prenatal observation ward When results are missing, the investigator
           contacts the women to ask of this measurement is due to personal or technical causes.

      The purpose of this study part is to detect early signs of PE.

      When patients gave birth, the data about the delivery (duration of labour, complications,
      mode of delivery, date of delivery, complications, parameters of the mother, specialties) and
      the neonate (gestational age, date and hour of birth, Apgar score, birth weight, length,
      complications and admission to the neonatal intensive care) will be collected. These data
      will be compared to the data of women who were admitted to the hospital for GHD, but who
      doesn't receive remote monitoring devices.
