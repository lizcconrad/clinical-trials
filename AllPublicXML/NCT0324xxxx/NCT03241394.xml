  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by macrophage
      infiltration in adipose tissue that induces insulin resistance and the appearance of
      metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of the study was the investigation of whether circulating
      monocyte subsets are differentially regulated in MS.

        In the present study healthy lean volunteers and obese subjects were recruited. The obese
        patients attended the Endocrinology outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of
        Ioannina in Greece. The obese patients were either with metabolic syndrome (MS) or without
        MS.
