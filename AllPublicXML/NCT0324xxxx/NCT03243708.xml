  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious source of hospital morbidity and mortality.
      Chemoprophylaxis with heparin has been shown to reduce the occurrence of VTE, but it
      increases the risk of bleeding and it is uncomfortable to receive. For that reason, VTE
      prophylaxis should be reserved for patients at moderate to high risk of VTE and low risk of
      bleeding. However, identifying patients at low risk for VTE can be difficult, because most
      patients have at least one risk factor for VTE and there are no validated risk prediction
      tools for use in US hospitals. Instead, many hospitals have opted for a one-size-fits-all
      approach with near-universal prophylaxis, putting many patients at unnecessary risk of
      bleeding. However, to provide care that is truly patient-centered, US physicians face several
      challenges. First, there is no accepted risk calculator that they can use to estimate an
      individual patient's risk. Second, risk calculators are not readily available at the point of
      care. As a result, prophylaxis rates have remained stubbornly low in some institutions, while
      in others the rate of prophylaxis is high, but the rate of inappropriate prophylaxis is also
      high. This study uses a risk prediction tool developed at the Cleveland Clinic to assess an
      individual patient's risk of VTE. The tool is incorporated into the electronic health record
      in the form of a smart order set. In this randomized trial, we will assess the effects of the
      order set on physician behavior and patient outcomes . Examining the effectiveness of an
      electronic decision aid embedded in an EHR in routine clinical practice will test whether a
      smart order set can improve patient care by incorporating patient-specific factors into a
      complex decision process.

      Specific Aim:

      Assess the effects of a VTE risk calculator embedded in the admission order set vs. usual
      care on physician behavior and patient outcomes in a randomized trial

      Research Strategy:

      Utilizing a Step-Wedge design, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at 10
      Cleveland Clinic hospitals in efforts to assess the effects of a VTE (venous thromboembolism)
      risk calculator embedded in the admission order set vs. usual care on physician behavior and
      patient outcomes. Hospitals will be randomized to display the risk calculator to physicians
      admitting patients or to the usual order set that contains only a description of VTE risk
      factors. The risk calculator will produce a predicted risk of VTE together with a
      recommendation regarding the use of prophylaxis for an individual patient. Physicians will be
      free to ignore the calculator or override its results if they so choose.
