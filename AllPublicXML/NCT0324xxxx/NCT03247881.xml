      The objectives of this study are 1) to determine if consumption of mixed nuts influences food
      intake and choice, and 2) to determine how personality traits affect food choice, including
      mood, stress, tendency to seek approval, tendency toward food cravings, and approach to food
      intake control.

    <textblock>
      The condition of being overweight or obese has skyrocketed in recent decades, bringing with
      it many secondary health problems. Therefore, it is important to seek strategies to promote
      weight loss and to assist in weight maintenance after weight loss. Different diet
      compositions may have different effects on satiety and thus affect food choice. A pilot study
      will be conducted to determine if mixed nuts affect food selection and intake. Questionnaires
      will also be administered to determine if personality characteristics are also influencing
      food choice.
