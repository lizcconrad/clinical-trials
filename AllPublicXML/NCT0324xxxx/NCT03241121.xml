      SwissChronoFood - Study of eating patterns with a smartphone app and the metabolic effects of
      time restricted feeding in metabolic syndrome

      The purpose of this study is to assess eating patterns among teenagers and adults with a new
      method, going beyond the pen-and-paper food diaries, and to investigate whether time
      restricted feeding leads to weight loss, improvement in lipid and glucose metabolism in
      individuals with metabolic syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) is increasing worldwide, due to the progression
      of its different components (central obesity, elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose
      tolerance and dyslipidemia), as well as the often associated liver steatosis. One way to
      tackle the obesity epidemic is to intervene early at the onset in childhood and teenage years
      - before cardio-metabolic complications have occurred. However, lifestyle programs targeting
      this age group had limited success in the current obesogenic environment. In particular,
      weight loss is a key factor in controlling all MS components, yet it is difficult to maintain
      over time.

      Time restricted feeding (TRF) is an approach that emphasizes energy intake limited to certain
      windows of time within the 24-hour cycle without restrictions on calories or macronutrients.
      This has emerged as an appealing approach to reduce body weight while improving lipid profile
      and glucose metabolism. However, TRF has been mostly studied in animals and long-term
      prospective data on its efficacy and mechanisms in humans is lacking.

      Prior to the intervention, the investigators will assess the eating patterns of participants
      with an innovative smartphone application ('app') which is less intrusive and more reliable
      than food diaries/questionnaires to assess eating behavior and patterns.

      In this project, the investigators will assess eating patterns among teenagers and adults,
      and investigate whether a controlled TRF intervention leads to beneficial changes in MS.
      Study Part 1 uses an epidemiological approach to establish baseline daily eating behavior,
      physical activity patterns and sleeping habits of teenagers and adults over 4 weeks using the
      smartphone app. Those individuals meeting international criteria for MS and who have eaten
      for &gt;14 hours per 24-hour cycle will be recruited for Study Part 2. In Part 2, participants
      will be assigned to TRF or active control groups, and followed in this pragmatic randomized
      controlled trial for 6 months to assess the change in their weight and MS components, as well
      as liver fat deposits. Study Part 3 will investigate the underlying mechanisms of improved
      metabolic profile with TRF.
