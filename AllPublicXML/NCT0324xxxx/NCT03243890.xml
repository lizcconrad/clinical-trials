  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is a common heart valve disease and due to the growing elderly population the
      prevalence is increasing. The disease is progressive with increasing calcification of the
      valve cusps. A few attempts with medical preventive treatment have failed, thus presently the
      only effective treatment of aortic stenosis is surgery. This study will examine the effect of
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation on progression of aortic valve calcification (AVC). The
      investigators hypothesize that MK-7 supplementation will slow down the calcification process.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized 1:1 after stratiﬁcation for site, AVC score (300-599 or ≥600) and statin-use. Each site will be provided with sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes containing randomly generated treatment allocations. Four different types of envelopes are provided; 1) AVC 300-599, no statin-use; 2) AVC 300-599, statin-use; 3) AVC ≥600, no statin-use; and 4) AVC ≥600, statin-use.</intervention_model_description>
