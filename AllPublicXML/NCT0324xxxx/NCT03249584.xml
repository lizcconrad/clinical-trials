      This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Medtronic OsteoCool™ RF Ablation System.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OsteoCool™ RF Ablation system has 510k regulatory clearance in the United States,
      Conformité Européene (CE) mark in Europe, and Health Canada Licence in Canada. The goal of
      this study is to collect real-world outcomes among a cohort of patients in the US, EUR and
      CAN with metastatic malignant lesions in a vertebral body, painful metastatic lesions
      involving bone (in the US, patients with metastatic lesions involving the bone must have
      failed or were not candidates for standard therapy), and in EUR and CAN, benign bone tumors
      such as osteoid osteoma who receive treatment with the OsteoCool™ RF Ablation system.
      Additionally, the study will collect device, procedure and/or therapy related adverse events
      and device deficiencies. Lastly, subject outcomes (such as pain relief, quality of life, and
      function) will be evaluated using validated assessment measures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Candidate for OsteoCool RF ablation per the labeled indication applicable in their
             respective country/region

          2. Metastatic lesions targeted for treatment must be located in the thoracic and/or
             lumbar vertebral body(ies), periacetabulum, iliac crest, and/or sacrum OR benign bone
             tumors (Europe and Canada only) - no restrictions on location of lesion

          3. Report worst pain score ≥4/10 at the target treatment site within the past 24 hours

          4. Localized pain resulting from no more than two sites total of metastatic disease in
             the bone and/or benign bone tumors (Benign Bone Tumors are restricted to Europe and
             Canada only)

          5. Have Karnofsky score ≥40 at enrollment (not applicable for subjects with benign bone
             tumors)

          6. Willing and able to provide a signed and dated informed consent, comply with the study
             plan, follow up visits and phone calls

          7. At least 18 years old at the time of informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Implanted with heart pacemaker or other implanted electronic device

          2. Use of OsteoCool in vertebral body levels C1-C7

          3. Multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, or primary malignant lesions in the index
             vertebra or bone

          4. Active or incompletely treated local infection at the planned treatment site(s) and/or
             systemic infection

          8. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant during the study duration

          9. Concurrent participation in another clinical study that may add additional safety
             risks and/or confound study results*

         10. Any condition that would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with study
             instructions or might confound the study interpretation

               -  Subjects in concurrent studies can only be enrolled with permission from
