    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of nivolumab and find out what affects, if
      any, nivolumab has on people and their risk of uterine cancer. The investigators also want to
      find out what effects, good or bad, nivolumab has on the patient and their cancer.

             chemoradiotherapy.

          -  Tumor is confirmed to be one of the following: 1. MSI-high, or 2. MMR-deficient, or 3.
             Hypermutated defined as ≥20 somatic mutations in the tumor by MSK-IMPACT

          -  One or more prior lines of cytotoxic treatment for advanced disease (prior hormonal
             therapy is not considered to count as prior lines of therapy)

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance of ≥ 40mL/min by Cockroft-Gault
             formula

          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome who can have
             total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL

          -  Able to sign voluntary written informed consent

          -  Female, 18 years of age or older

          -  Available archival tumor tissue or patient is willing to undergo new biopsy

          -  Premenopausal women of child bearing potential must have a normal urine or serum
             beta-HCG prior to enrollment, and must agree to use effective contraception during
             treatment with nivolumab and for at least 5 months following the last dose of
             nivolumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease eligible for potentially curative treatment with standard chemotherapy,
             surgical resection, or chemoradiotherapy.

             external trigger.

          -  Serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection which would impair the
             ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy or whose control would be
             jeopardized by protocol therapy

          -  History of bowel obstruction, refractory ascites, or bowel perforation due to advanced
             disease within the past 3 months from start of study treatment.

             defined as &gt;10 mg daily prednisone or its equivalent); or who require other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Prior history of malignancy or a concurrent malignancy, with the exception of
             cutaneous basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, superficial bladder cancer,
             or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix, prostate, or breast, unless a complete
             remission was achieved at least 3 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy
             is required or anticipated to be required during the study period

          -  Breastfeeding women, pregnant women

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated

             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
