    <textblock>
      Aim of the retrospective study was to evaluate the influence of the labour on the clinical
      course of the parturients with MS in selected 6 month follow-up interval and to evaluate to
      possible influence of the different anesthesia/analgesia types on the course of MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of anesthesia in multiple sclerosis (MS) progression remains unclear in spite of few
      foreign studies. The most frequently afflicted patients by MS are women of childbearing age
      and influence of anesthesia or obstetric epidural analgesia has only not been investigated in
      Czech Republic. The study aims to retrospectively compare the further course of the disease
      of MS in patients who labor between 2004 and 2013 in University Hospital Brno either by
      caesarean section or vaginally with epidural analgesia , with patients who gave birth
      spontaneously without anesthesia.The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the
      labour on the clinical course of MS and further evaluate the possible influence of the type
      of anesthesia/analgesia in the peripartal period on the MS progression.

    <description>Relapse occurence from labour to 3 months, after delivery was recorded. A relapse was defined as the appearance or worsening of symptoms of neurologic dysfunction lasting more than 24 hours, new lesions on MRI or need of reinforcement in treatment. For disease state after delivery we used dichotomic approach: relapse (at least one) or no relapses.</description>
