  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CCM therapy in heart failure
      patients with baseline EF≥50% (HFpEF) who have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or
      III symptoms despite appropriate medication.

      The terminology of the HF classification HFpEF is based on the 2016 European Society of
      Cardiology (ESC) Heart Failure Guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical study of CCM in addition to optimal medical therapy (OMT) over a 24
      week period. The primary endpoint shall be a mean change in KCCQ score. To further improve
      the accuracy and objectivity of measurements, assessments of peak VO2 (oxygen uptake) will
      also be performed. Tests can be performed using upright and semi-supine bicycle ergometer or
      using treadmill. In sites where more than one option is available, bicycle ergometer is the
      preferred option. Treadmill is only allowed in case no bicycle is available at the site. Each
      subject shall be consistently tested using the same method throughout the study.

      This pilot study will collect efficacy and safety data in heart failure patients having NYHA
      class II and III symptoms despite appropriate medication with baseline ejection fraction
      equal or greater than 50% (HFpEF populations).
