  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is well established, and can improve clinical
      outcomes of patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) who are inoperable or have high
      surgical risk. Although the rates of periprocedural bleeding events are lower in TAVI
      compared to those in surgical aortic valve replacement, those in TAVI still remains high. In
      addition, current guideline recommended the dual antiplatelet (DAPT), clopidogrel plus
      aspirin, for a 3- to 6-month period after TAVI, however no evidences supports this approach.
      The antithrombotic regimen in patients undergoing TAVI is needed to be established.

      To establish the antithrombotic regimen in patients undergoing TAVI,

        1. the investigators assess the changes in platelet thrombus formation and white thrombus
           formation in patients undergoing TAVI measured by Total Thrombus Formation Analysis
           System (T-TAS).

        2. the investigators analyze plasma microRNAs, and shear stress by using computational
           fluid dynamics (CFD) to clarify the mechanistic factors regarding those changes.
