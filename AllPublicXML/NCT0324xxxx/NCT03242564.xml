  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether red light therapy using LED 650nm red light
      for body contouring of the waist, hips and thighs is as effective as red light therapy using
      Laser 635nm red light.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Red light laser therapy using 635nm red light laser technology has previously been shown to
      cause lipolysis in subcutaneous fat as a non-surgical method to promote weight loss and body
      contouring. This study hypothesizes that red LED light therapy using 650nm red light LED
      (light emitting diode) technology produces similar results to the laser device (red LASER
      635nm) when preformed using a specified treatment protocol.

      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the Vevazz therapy program achieves the results after a
      single 28 minute treatment. The predicate 635nm LED device (Photonica Professional by Ward
      Photonics) achieves its results after one 32 minute therapy program.

      The Vevazz therapy program uses the Vevazz LED device for fat removal using LED red light
      therapy. This multi-site study reviews results from 66 randomly selected patients after a
      single treatment using the Vevazz LED device.
