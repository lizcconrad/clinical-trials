  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in smart phone-based photography (both quality and image transmission) offer the
      potential to greatly improve access to pediatric dermatologists. However, the accuracy of
      diagnoses reliant on parent-provided photographs has been neither measured nor compared to
      diagnoses based on in-person examinations. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was
      to assess the concordance between diagnoses based on photographs taken by parents (or legal
      guardians) and those based on in-person examinations. A secondary aim was to assess the
      effect of photography instructions on improving this concordance.

      Each patient/parent dyad will be randomized into one of two approximately equally sized
      groups; half of the subjects will be provided with an instruction sheet on how best to take
      photographs of skin conditions with their mobile devices (study group) and half will not be
      provided this instruction sheet (control group). Photographs will be evaluated for image
      quality and to provide a diagnosis (See attached forms including Photograph Quality Rating
      Scale).

    <intervention_model_description>Patient/parent dyads visiting a pediatric dermatology clinic were invited to participate. After consent, patient/parent dyads were randomly assigned to photography instruction versus no instruction. In both arms, parents photographed their child's skin condition (via smart phone) and provided medical history. Images were uploaded securely to the child's electronic health record for independent diagnosis by a dermatologist not involved in the patient's care.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>The effect of photography instructions on average image quality, as evaluated using a photograph quality rating scale (PQRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The PQRS quantifies photograph quality based on five criteria: clarity, perspective, darkness, brightness, and color. Each criterion is rated on an integer scale from 0 to 2, yielding a total score ranging from 0 (lowest quality) to 10 (highest quality).</description>

    <description>Cohen's kappa is a measure of inter-rater agreement that takes into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be a new patient/parent dyad arrived at the main pediatric dermatology clinic

          2. Patient must be under the age of 18.

          3. Consenting parent or guardian must be present and able to speak English to
             participate.

          4. Patients are either already enrolled in MyCHOP (MyChart) or are willing to enroll
             during the encounter.

          5. Parent or legal guardian has a mobile phone with the capability to download the free
             MyChart app.

          6. Parents have a data plan that allows them to download the MyChart app (if not already
             downloaded) and upload pictures, and are willing to accept any potential data charges
             incurred with these activities.

          7. Patient has active skin lesion or rash that can be photographed during the clinic
             visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is over the age of 18.

          2. Parent or guardian is not present or not able to speak English.

          3. Parent or guardian is not able to enroll in MyCHOP (MyChart).

          4. Parent or guardian does not have a mobile phone capable of downloading the MyChart
             app.

          5. Photographs are not able to be taken (phone battery dies, phone/app does not work,
             patient is not cooperative, participant does not have time).

          6. If there are no active skin lesions to photograph the patient/parent will not be
             enrolled (e.g. hives that are inactive, hyperhidrosis [excessive sweating], itching
             without a rash, resolved skin lesions [e.g. warts, molluscum]).

          7. Patients presenting for a general full body skin exam will be excluded, as this would
             require full body photography, which is too time consuming. (Note: this does not
             include evaluation of one individual mole [nevus], which can be included in the
             study).
