  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess a mindfulness and compassion group intervention for
      pregnant women and their partners (8 weeks) for the prevention, reduction and treatment of
      stress, negative affect and depression in pregnancy and breastfeeding. This group
      intervention will also be compared with a Treatment as usual (TAU) group consisting in a
      childbirth education class taught by the Health Center midwife. The principal hypothesis is
      that the mindfulness and compassion intervention will be more effective than TAU.

      The aim of this study is to assess a mindfulness and compassion group intervention for
      pregnant women and their partners (8 weeks) for the prevention, reduction and treatment of
      stress, negative affect and depression in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

      There will be two groups:

        1. A face to face mindfulness and compassion intervention for pregnant women in their
           second trimester of pregnancy and their partners in group format (8 weeks) based in the
           Mindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting program from Nancy Bardacke. This group will
           also receive in their third trimester of pregnancy the childbirth education classes
           taught by midwives (6-8 weeks) that every pregnant woman normally attends to in the
           National Health Care System in Spain (TAU).

        2. A control group that will receive only the childbirth education class by midwives (TAU)
           group consisting in a childbirth education class taught by the Health Center midwife at
           the third trimester of pregnancy.

      Each group will be composed of 60 participants with a total sample of 120. The principal
      hypothesis is that the mindfulness and compassion intervention will be more effective than
      TAU in the decrease of stress, negative affect and depression and in the increase of positive
      affect during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

      The differences between the intervention and control group will be analyzed. Finally, a
      qualitative study will be conducted.
