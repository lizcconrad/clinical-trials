  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized 6-month intervention study comparing
      cognitive functioning in individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis assigned to
      either a physical activity or an active water-intake control group. Individuals will complete
      pre-, mid- and post-assessments of cognitive, physical, and behavioral functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to increase physical activity through aerobic exercise are some of the only
      known treatment options to improve domains of cognition such as executive function. While
      increased physical activity is associated with preserved cortical functioning during
      exogenous executive functioning tasks in older adults, little is known about the relationship
      between physical activity and executive functioning in multiple sclerosis. Thus, the
      investigators propose to conduct a randomized 6-month accelerometry-based intervention
      designed to increase overall physical activity in sedentary relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis with known cognitive challenges. The overall objective is to determine how a
      6-month activity tracking intervention impacts the behavioral, neural and mechanistic
      associations between physical activity and cognitive functioning. All individuals who contact
      the Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory (CNL) with interest in this study will undergo a
      phone/online screening assessing inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those participants meeting I/E
      criteria will be invited to the lab for 2 pre-assessment sessions, one session at midpoint,
      and 2 post-assessment sessions at the completion of the 6 month intervention. Participants
      will also be asked to complete a number of online questionnaires following the first
      assessment session. The two pre-assessments will involve a through measure of cognitive
      functioning, both through the use of neuropsychological batteries and neuroimaging, and
      inflammatory markers through collection of a blood sample. Following the pre-assessment
      sessions, conducted by blind personnel, participants will be randomized to one of the two
      groups. Participants will be asked to self-monitor their assigned health behavior with the
      aid of a behavioral tracker (accelerometer or smart water bottle). Via a mobile application
      designed by the laboratory, participants will receive daily and weekly summaries of their
      health behavior progress, and motivational materials to encourage goal attainment. The
      6-month intervention will involve minimal contact from study coordinators. Participants who
      do not adhere to study goals will be contacted by a study coordinator via phone who will use
      motivational interviewing to promote behavior change. Following the 6-month intervention the
      2 assessment sessions will be repeated to obtain post-intervention data for comparison.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Performance on Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform the entire Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS) before, during (at midpoint), and after the intervention. The battery is comprised of seven different tasks aimed at measuring executive functioning, working memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, verbal memory and visuospatial memory/judgement. Investigators hypothesize changes in cognitive performance, specifically in the domains of working memory and processing speed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Functional Architecture of the MS Brain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after the intervention, participants will undergo a brain imaging scan using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) technology. Participants will complete several tasks in the scanner to assess working memory and processing speed specifically. The N-back task, Oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and resting state fMRI scan will be completed in the scanner. Participants in the physical activity group will show increased cortical recruitment of the middle frontal gyrus during the working memory and processing speed tasks, resulting in improved behavioral performance. Furthermore, investigators hypothesize that increased connectivity within the resting-state networks, specifically the Fronto-Executive Network (FE) and the Default-Mode Network (DMN) will mediate the behavioral improvement and altered cortical recruitment following the 6-month tracking intervention.</description>
