      The main purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of a non-invasive wearable
      technology in the form of a wristband. This wristband (Loop Band) uses optical sensors and
      spectrometry to measure and estimate vitals as well as a full blood gas panel; comparable to
      the standard method of an invasive arterial line and pressure transducer. The investigators
      aim to show equivalence of clinical physiologic outcome measurements with the Loop Band
      relative to current methods (i.e. arterial lines, etc.). In addition, this study aims to
      validate this wearable technology as a potential alternative to invasive measurements, to
      reduce complications, and improve accuracy in regards to patient monitoring.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has capacity to consent for the study.

          -  Anesthetic plan for an arterial line for vital sign monitoring during their surgical
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active Atrial Fibrillation

          -  Active C-difficile

          -  Amputation of the arm at the wrist or above

          -  The Investigator and/or Clinical Research Nurse will conduct a visual inspection for
             attributes that may diminish device accuracy. These include but are not limited to:
             tattoos over the radial artery, burns or heavy scarring over the radial artery,
             fragile skin, any skin diseases affecting the wrist or arm, Physician discretion-any
             condition deemed inappropriate that will preclude use of the device.
