  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case-control study on SAA patients treated with HSCT, order to further
      discuss and assess the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of HFD-HSCT which performed with
      reduced-intensity fludarabine-based conditioning regimen.Our findings would indicate that SAA
      patients who lack MSD benefited most if HFD-HSCT was performed with reduced-intensity
      fludarabine-based conditioning regimen, and our improved outcomes with HFD-HSCT may lead to a
      salvaged therapy and an expanded direct role for SAA in the future.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>In the first months after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first of three consecutive days in which the neutrophil counts (ANC) exceeded 0.50 × 109/L, and platelet engraftment was defined as the first of five consecutive days in which the platelet count exceeded 20 × 109/L without transfusion. GF was classified as follows: (1) primary non-engraftment (failure to reach a neutrophil count of 0.5×109/L after transplant); (2) rejection (decrease in blood counts to &lt; 0.5×109/L neutrophils, after achieving a neutrophil count of 0.5×109/L); (3) late graft failure (decrease of blood counts after day 100 to &lt; 1.0×109/L neutrophils and &lt; 30×109/L platelets).</description>

    <description>Conditioning regimens: (A) Patients had SAA and PNH, or heavy transfusion (RBC≥25U), or failed rabbit ATG therapy, and received 0.8 mg/kg/6h busulfan (days -7 to -6), 30mg/m2/day fludarabine (days -5 to -2), 25 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide (days -5 to -2) and 2.5 mg/kg/day r-ATG (days -5 to -2). (B) The other patients with SAA or VSAA received same procedure but without busulfan;
Allogeneic HSC infusion: Doner BM cells were harvested to achieve a target mononuclear cell count (MNC) of 2-4 × 108 per kilogram of recipient weight. The target MNC from PB was 4-6× 108 per kilogram of recipient weight;
Prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD: GVHD prophylaxis consisted of intravenous CSP 2-3 mg/kg/day in divided doses beginning on the day before transplantation (day -5) and the target concentration was adjusted to 150-250 ng/ml. The oral MMF dose was 20 mg/kg/day from day −1 and was tapered off after 1 months if no aGVHD was observed.</description>
