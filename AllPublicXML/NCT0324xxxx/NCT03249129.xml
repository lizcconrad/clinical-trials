  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to detect the presence of autoantibodies and autoantigens in
      cerebrospinal fluid early (&lt;48 hours) following spinal cord trauma.

      The study also aims to define the central or peripheral origin of autoantibodies by looking
      for their simultaneous presence at the blood level and to evaluate the prognostic value of
      the presence of autoantibodies within the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as on the initial
      clinical severity than on the recovery potential.
