    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained physical, cognitive,
      emotional, and behavioral deficits in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and the general public. However,
      the underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood, and there are few effective
      treatments for post-concussive symptoms (PCS). In addition, there are substantial overlaps
      between PCS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in mTBI. IASIS is among a
      class of passive neurofeedback treatments that combine low-intensity pulses for transcranial
      electrical stimulation (LIP-tES) with electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. LIP-tES
      techniques have shown promising results in alleviating PCS individuals with TBI. However, the
      neural mechanisms underlying the effects of LIP-tES treatment in TBI are unknown, owing to
      the dearth of neuroimaging investigations of this therapeutic intervention. Conventional
      neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT have limited sensitivity in detecting
      physiological abnormalities caused by mTBI, or in assessing the efficacy of mTBI treatments.
      In acute and chronic phases, CT and MRI are typically negative even in mTBI patients with
      persistent PCS. In contrast, evidence is mounting in support of resting-state
      magnetoencephalography (rs-MEG) slow-wave source imaging (delta-band, 1-4 Hz) as a marker for
      neuronal abnormalities in mTBI. The primary goal of the present application is to use rs-MEG
      to identify the neural underpinnings of behavioral changes associated with IASIS treatment in
      Veterans with mTBI. Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, the investigators will
      study changes in abnormal MEG slow-waves before and after IASIS treatment (relative to a
      'sham' treatment group) in Veterans with mTBI. In addition, the investigators will examine
      treatment-related changes in PCS, PTSD symptoms, neuropsychological test performances, and
      their association with changes in MEG slow-waves. The investigators for the first time will
      address a fundamental question about the mechanism of slow-waves in brain injury, namely
      whether slow-wave generation in wakefulness is merely a negative consequence of neuronal
      injury or if it is a signature of ongoing neuronal rearrangement and healing that occurs at
      the site of the injury. Specific Aim 1 will detect the loci of injury in Veterans with mTBI
      and assess the mechanisms underlying functional neuroimaging changes related to IASIS
      treatment using rs-MEG slow-wave source imaging. The investigators hypothesize that MEG
      slow-wave source imaging will show significantly higher sensitivity than conventional MRI in
      identifying the loci of injury on a single-subject basis. The investigators also hypothesize
      that in wakefulness, slow-wave generation is a signature of ongoing neural rearrangement /
      healing, rather than a negative consequence of neuronal injury. Furthermore, the
      investigators hypothesize IASIS will ultimately reduce abnormal MEG slow-wave generation in
      mTBI by the end of the treatment course, owing to the accomplishment of neural rearrangement
      / healing. Specific Aim 2 will examine treatment-related changes in PCS and PTSD symptoms in
      Veterans with mTBI. The investigators hypothesize that compared with the sham group, mTBI
      Veterans in the IASIS treatment group will show significantly greater decreases in PCS and
      PTSD symptoms between baseline and post-treatment assessments. Specific Aim 3 will study the
      relationship among IASIS treatment-related changes in rs-MEG slow-wave imaging, PCS, and
      neuropsychological measures in Veterans with mTBI. The investigators hypothesize that Reduced
      MEG slow-wave generation will correlate with reduced total PCS score, individual PCS scores
      (e.g., sleep disturbance, post-traumatic headache, photophobia, and memory problem symptoms),
      and improved neuropsychological exam scores between post-IASIS and baseline exams. The
      success of the proposed research will for the first time confirm that facilitation of
      slow-wave generation in wakefulness leads to significant therapeutic benefits in mTBI,
      including an ultimate reduction of abnormal slow-waves accompanied by an improvement in PCS
      and cognitive functioning.

      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained physical, cognitive,
      emotional, and behavioral deficits in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans and the general public. However,
      the underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood, and there are few effective
      treatments for post-concussive symptoms (PCS). In addition, there are substantial overlaps
      between PCS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in mTBI. Furthermore, a
      substantial number of studies have shown higher (nearly double) rates of comorbid PTSD in
      individuals with mTBI, observed in military and civilian settings. IASIS is among a class of
      passive neurofeedback treatments that combine low-intensity pulses for transcranial
      electrical stimulation (LIP-tES) with electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. LIP-tES
      techniques have shown promising results in alleviating PCS in individuals with TBI. However,
      the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of LIP-tES treatment in TBI are unknown, owing
      to the dearth of neuroimaging investigations of this therapeutic intervention. Conventional
      neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT have limited sensitivity in detecting
      physiological abnormalities caused by mTBI, or in assessing the efficacy of mTBI treatments.
      In acute and chronic phases, CT and MRI are typically negative even in mTBI patients with
      persistent PCS. In contrast, evidence is mounting in support of resting-state
      magnetoencephalography (rs-MEG) slow-wave source imaging as a non-invasive imaging marker for
      neuronal abnormalities in mTBI. Using region of interest (ROI) and voxel-wise approaches, the
      investigators demonstrated that MEG slowwave source imaging detects abnormal slow-waves
      (delta-band, 1-4 Hz) with ~85% sensitivity in chronic and sub-acute mTBI patients with
      persistent PCS. The primary goal of the present application is to use rs- MEG to identify the
      neural underpinnings of behavioral changes associated with IASIS treatment in Veterans with
      mTBI. Using a double-blind placebo controlled design, the investigators will study changes in
      abnormal MEG slowwaves before and after IASIS treatment (relative to a 'sham' treatment
      group) in Veterans with mTBI. In addition, the investigators will examine treatment-related
      changes in PCS, PTSD symptoms, neuropsychological test performances, and their association
      with changes in MEG slow-waves. Pre-treatment baseline and posttreatment rs-MEG exams,
      symptoms assessments, and neuropsychological tests will be performed. The investigators for
      the first time will address a fundamental question about the mechanism of slow-waves in brain
      injury, namely whether slow-wave generation in wakefulness is merely a negative consequence
      of neuronal injury or if it is a signature of ongoing neuronal rearrangement and healing that
      occurs at the site of the injury.

      Specific Aim 1: To detect the loci of injury in Veterans with mTBI and assess the mechanisms
      underlying functional neuroimaging changes related to IASIS treatment using rs-MEG slow-wave
      source imaging. The investigators' voxel-wise rs-MEG source-imaging technique will be used to
      identify abnormal slow-wave generation (delta band) in the baseline and post-treatment MEG
      exams to assess treatment-related changes on a single-subject basis. Healthy control (HC)
      Veterans, matched for combat exposure, will be used to establish an MEG normative database.
      Test-retest reliability of MEG slow-wave source imaging for mTBI will also be examined.

      Hypothesis 1: Veterans with mTBI will generate abnormal MEG slow-waves during the baseline
      MEG exam. Voxel-wise MEG slow-wave source imaging will show significantly higher sensitivity
      than conventional MRI in identifying the loci of injury on a single-subject basis. The
      test-retest reliability of MEG slow-wave source imaging is expected to be high, with
      intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.75 between two sequential MEG exams.

      Hypothesis 2: In wakefulness, slow-wave generation is a signature of ongoing neural
      rearrangement/ healing, rather than a negative consequence of neuronal injury. IASIS
      treatment will enhance neural rearrangement/healing by initially potentiating slow-wave
      generation immediately after each treatment session.

      Hypothesis 3: IASIS will ultimately reduce abnormal MEG slow-wave generation in mTBI by the
      end of the treatment course, owing to the accomplishment of neural rearrangement / healing.
      In Veterans with mTBI who finish IASIS treatment, but not in the sham group, MEG source
      imaging will show a significant decrease in abnormal slow-waves at post-treatment exam. Such
      significant decreases will also be evident in both the voxel-wise and overall abnormal MEG
      slow-wave measures.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine treatment-related changes in PCS and PTSD symptoms in Veterans
      with mTBI. PCS and PTSD symptoms will be assessed at the baseline and post-treatment
      follow-up visits.

      Hypothesis 4: Compared with the sham group, mTBI Veterans in the IASIS treatment group will
      show significantly greater decreases in PCS symptoms between baseline and post-treatment
      assessments.

      Hypothesis 5: Compared with the sham group, mTBI Veterans in the IASIS treatment group will
      also show significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptoms between baseline and
      post-treatment assessments.

      Specific Aim 3: To study the relationship among IASIS treatment-related changes in rs-MEG
      slow-wave imaging, PCS, and neuropsychological measures in Veterans with mTBI. The
      investigators will correlate changes between baseline and post-IASIS abnormal rs-MEG
      slow-wave generation (i.e., total abnormal rs-MEG slow-wave and voxel-wise source imaging
      measures) with changes in PCS and neuropsychological tests performance.

      Hypothesis 6: Reduced MEG slow-wave generation will correlate with reduced total PCS score,
      individual PCS scores (e.g., sleep disturbance, post-traumatic headache, photophobia, and
      memory problem symptoms), and improved neuropsychological exam scores between post-IASIS and
      baseline exams.

    <intervention_model_description>After consent, Visit 1 (V1) for all three groups will include baseline NP and MHA. Then, baseline rs- MEG and MRI will be performed in V2 for all groups. At V3 the mTBI Veterans in IASIS and sham groups will undergo a pre-session MEG, the first IASIS/Sham treatment Session (S1), and a post-session MEG. Next, the mTBI Veterans continue their IASIS/Sham treatments S2-6 in V4-8. During the mid-treatment V9, another pair of pre- and post-MEG exams and NP will be performed. The mTBI Veterans will continue treatments S8-11 in V10-13. During the final treatment V14, the third pair of pre- and post-MEG exams will be performed. One week after the Veterans finish their final IASIS/Sham treatment S12, a one-week follow-up MEG and NP will be conducted during V15. A subset of IASIS group will be tested one month after the final treatment for a follow-up MEG V16. Veterans initially in the mTBI-sham group will also be offered the real IASIS treatment, but no MEG or behavioral data will be collected.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Sham treatment, double-blind design: During the sham treatment, we will prep and preplace the electrodes for common reference, A-, B-, plus the set of electrodes on the scalp of the participant following the 10-20 EEG configuration for A+ and A-, just like the procedure for real IASIS treatment. However, no LIP-tES pulses will be sent from the system during sham treatment, based a code entered to the system. A staff member (SRA #1) will assign a mTBI Veteran to either the mTBI-IASIS or the mTBSham group, with an attached code from an existing code bank. Then, the IASIS treatment operator (SRA #2) who is blind to the group assignment will enter the code to the IASIS system during treatments. Based on the code, the system automatically loads the protocol for either IASIS or Sham treatment. Only at the end of the study (after V16), the group assignment is revealed. Therefore, both the participant and IASIS treatment operator (SRA #2) are blind to the group assignment during the study.</masking_description>

    <description>The Clinician- Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) for DSM-5. The CAPS-5 is a standard semi-structured interview used to assess PTSD diagnosis and severity. As part of as a structured interview, the primary traumatic event is elicited and will be used as the basis of assessing PTSD symptoms. The CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the DSM-5 PTSD symptoms that are assessed with this 30 item questionnaire. PTSD diagnostic status will be assessed using the past month version of the CAPS-5. The CAPS-5 has the advantages of categorical (diagnostic) or dimensional scoring of PTSD plus items for assessing social and occupational functioning, dissociation, and the validity of the items. A total severity score of 33 or higher indicates full threshold PTSD. The CAPS-5 past week version quantitative data will be given prior to treatment and at follow-up (Visit 15) and used for evaluation of treatment (IASIS or sham) and for correlation with MEG data.</description>

    <description>The EEG interface device is the J&amp;J Engineering I-330 C2, provided specifically for IASIS. The EEG sampling frequency is 256 Hz on each of 2 EEG acquisition channels. The feedback LIP-tES is delivered via the 4 EEG leads (A+, A-, B+, B-), with respect to the Common Neck Reference (isolated). During each session, 2 electrodes (A- and B-) are attached to the participant's left and right mastoids, while the remaining two electrodes (A+ and B+) are moved to various locations on the scalp to record EEG signals. All four (A+, A-, B+, B-) electrodes are involved in applying weak electric current pulses back to the brain (the feedback process). The feedback signal consists two types of narrow pulse trains, both with 150 mV in amplitude: A Type 1 pulse is 25 ms in duration and contains carrier waves at ~50 KHz. The repetition rate of Type 1 pulse train is fixed at 3.6 Hz; A Type 2 pulse is 120 ns in duration and contains carrier waves at ~100 MHz.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion of Veterans for the mTBI groups:

          -  All symptomatic mTBI patients will be evaluated in a clinical interview to document
             the nature of the injuries and ongoing PCS.

          -  The diagnosis of mTBI patients is based on standard VA/DOD diagnostic criteria.

          -  Inclusion in the mTBI patient group requires a TBI that meets the following criteria:

               -  a loss of consciousness (LOC) &lt; 30 minutes or transient confusion,

               -  ADHD

               -  or other chronic neurovascular diseases such as hypertension and diabetes

          -  substance or alcohol use disorders according to DSM-5 [87] criteria within the six
             months prior to the study

          -  history of metabolic or other diseases known to affect the central nervous system (see
             [88] for similar criteria)

          -  Metal objects (e.g., shrapnel or metal fragments) that fail MRI screening, or
             extensive metal dental hardware, e.g.,:

               -  braces and large metal dentures

                    -  fillings are acceptable

               -  other metal objects in the head

               -  neck, or face areas that cause non-removable artifacts in the MEG data

          -  Potential subjects will be administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to
             evaluate level of depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation

               -  any participant who reports a &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; on the BDI-II: item 9 (suicidal thoughts
                  or wishes) will also be excluded.

               -  However, depression following mTBI or traumatic event of PTSD is common [89]:
                  therefore, in two mTBI groups, the investigators will include and match patients
                  with depression symptoms reported after their injury/event, and will co-vary
                  BDI-II score in data analyses.
