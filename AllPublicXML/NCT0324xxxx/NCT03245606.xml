  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the accuracy of transient elastography taking into account
      liver steatosis determined by MRI, to liver biopsy for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis ≥F2 in
      patient with NAFLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is induced by an abnormal build up of fat in the
      liver. It can induce liver damage, namely fibrosis, which leads to cirrhosis and an increased
      risk of liver cancer. The diagnosis of liver fibrosis is thus critical to identify patients
      at risk.

      Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. However this invasive
      test is expensive and has a significant morbidity.

      To avoid this others non invasive test have been developed to assess steatosis and fibrosis
      of the liver :

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging can quantify liver steatosis accurately.

        -  Transient elastography (Fibroscan®) is approved for the diagnosis of fibrosis in chronic
           hepatitis C. However results in NAFLD were disappointing. Further, steatosis by
           heightening liver elasticity is thought to be the cause of these poor results.

        -  Several biological tests or score are also approved in chronic hepatitis C, but not in
           NAFLD.

      The hypothesis driving this study is that by accounting for liver steatosis through the mean
      of MRI, we could more accurately interpret transient elastography value to accurately
      diagnose the severity of liver fibrosis.
