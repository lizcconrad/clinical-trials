      1. The accuracy of the sensors (Flash vs Enlite glucose monitoring) will be evaluated with
           a standardized breakfast test. Patients receive a standardized breakfast. The usual
           insulin bolus will be administered at breakfast. After breakfast, a venous blood sample
           is taken for 2 hours every 15 minutes to determine the blood sugar. At the same time,
           the glucose value shown by the sensors will be noted. A comparison of the blood glucose
           value with the data recorded by the sensor can evaluate the accuracy of the sensor and
           also estimate the lag-time between the sensor glucose and the venous glucose.

        2. Patient satisfaction will be evaluated using a questionnaire that will be completed
           after the Enlite sensor has been worn for 1 month.

        3. The development of skin reactions will be checked by a short questionnaire, supplemented
           with a picture of possible skin phenomena.

        4. The data recorded by the FreeStyle sensor (average glucose,% above target,% within
           target,% under target, amount of hypoglycemia) in the month prior to sensor switching
           will be compared to the same data recorded by the Enlite sensor during the first month
           of use.
