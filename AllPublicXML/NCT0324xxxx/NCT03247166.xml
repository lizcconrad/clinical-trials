  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TOPS™ SP System is intended to provide stabilization in skeletally mature patients. The
      system is designed to afford motion of the spine segment without fusion. The pur0pose of this
      prospective clinical study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of the TOPS™ System,
      when used following decompression, in the treatment of lower back and sciatic pain.
