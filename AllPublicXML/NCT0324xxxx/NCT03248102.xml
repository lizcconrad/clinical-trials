  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. Despite access to
      current diagnostic modalities, diagnosis may be challenging since the child may have
      difficulty in articulating symptoms. Additionally there is a high frequency of atypical
      presentation and rapid progression. Delayed diagnosis in children is reported as being up to
      60%. Delayed diagnosis &gt;48hr increases the perforation rate from 21% to 71%. Around 20% of
      children presenting with appendicitis have perforated by the time they come to surgery.

      Appendix perforation is associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased cost. Once
      perforated, major complication rates increase from 1.2% to 6.4%, median bed stay increases
      from 2 to 6 days and hospitalisation costs are estimated at US $33,348.

      Conversely, a false positive diagnosis leads to unnecessary surgery in 12%. It has been
      suggested that only 35% of surgical referrals with possible appendicitis actually need
      surgery thus impacting on resource use.

      A reliable test, especially if painless, would be very useful. If positive the child could
      undergo early appendicectomy in expectation of a reduction in the perforation rate (and,
      therefore, reduction in hospital stay). If negative the child could be discharged home
      safely. No adequate biomarker has been identified.

      Technology already exists to detect changes in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in gases. VOC
      analysis is already used commercially to identify disease processes in animals and crops.
      Although VOC has been previously used to detect human diseases, it has never been used to
      look for changes in the composition of breath in appendicitis.

      The investigators hypothesise that the composition of VOC's in children with appendicitis
      will differ from those without. The investigators anticipate these differences will be of
      diagnostic and prognostic value in clinical practice. The feasibility of collecting breath
      samples from children with possible appendicitis to allow VOC testing has not been examined.
