  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SM04690-DDD-01 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study. SM04690 Injectable Suspension
      will be administered via a single intradiscal injection to subjects with degenerative disc
      disease (DDD) under fluoroscopic guidance. Groups of 6 subjects will be enrolled in
      successive cohorts. Subjects will participate in a 6 month follow-up period. Clinic visits
      will be Screening, Treatment Visit Day 1, and Follow-up Visit Days 2, 15, 28, 60, 90, 135,
      and 180.
