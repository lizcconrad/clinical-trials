    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single center (with multiple long-term YCFs) treatment trial of the
      CDC-recommended azithromycin regimen (1 gm PO once) for chlamydia in males. This study is
      designed primarily to determine the frequency of chlamydia treatment failure following
      azithromycin in males who do versus do not have urethral symptoms of urethral discharge
      and/or dysuria. Anticipated enrollment is 446 males, between the age of 12 to 21 years old,
      with subject participation duration of 28 days and study duration of 4 years. The primary
      objective of the study is to assess the microbiological efficacy of azithromycin in
      uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infection in males with versus without urethral symptoms
      in YCFs.

      The proposed study is a single center (with multiple long-term YCFs) treatment trial of the
      CDC-recommended azithromycin regimen (1 gm PO once) for chlamydia in males residing in
      long-term gender-segregated YCFs. This study is designed primarily to determine the frequency
      of chlamydia treatment failure following azithromycin in males who do versus do not have
      urethral symptoms of urethral discharge and/or dysuria. Males age 12 to 21 years in good
      health (based on vital signs and provider's clinical evaluation documented in medical
      records) who are residing in long-term gender-segregated (not co-ed) YCFs (usual stay &gt; 3
      weeks) and who are identified as chlamydia-infected comprise the study population. The
      anticipated enrollment is 446 males with subject participation duration of 28 days and study
      duration of 4 years. The primary objective of the study is to assess the microbiological
      efficacy of azithromycin in uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infection in males with
      versus without urethral symptoms in YCFs; in essence, this study will assess the frequency of
      chlamydia treatment failure to azithromycin at the Day 28 follow-up visit (Visit 2) in males
      with urethral symptoms compared to males without urethral symptoms. The secondary objective
      is to evaluate the association of laboratory findings (enrollment chlamydia load and OmpA
      genotype) and other participant characteristics (demographics, sexual behaviors, etc.) to
      chlamydia treatment failure in males after azithromycin treatment.
