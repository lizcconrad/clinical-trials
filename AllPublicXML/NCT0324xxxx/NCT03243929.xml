  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Translation of District Sun Safe Policies to Schools study was to test
      whether schools need assistance to facilitate the implementation of school district
      board-approved sun safety policies by individual elementary schools. The intervention is
      expected to produce a change in practices at the school level and to improve the sun safety
      behavior of children attending the intervention schools compared to control schools. A group
      of 40 school districts in Southern California that adopted board policy 5141.7 for sun safety
      provided 118 schools that were randomized to a intervention condition or to an attention
      control condition. The primary outcome is change in school-level sun safety practices based
      on 10 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categories for policy change (i.e.,
      sunscreen use, UV protective clothing, hats, student education, teacher education, provision
      of shade, scheduling to avoid peak UV exposure, parent outreach, resource allocation for sun
      safety, and an accountability system). This primary outcome was assessed by a survey of the
      principal and one teacher at each school (N=118 principals and 113 teachers at pretest).
      Parents (N=1770 at pretest) of children attending the schools completed a self-report measure
      assessing the secondary outcomes of change in individual-level sun safety behavior of their
      elementary school aged children and number of communications received from the school
      regarding sun safety. Assessment of principals, teachers and parents occurred at pretest,
      just prior to randomization, and at a posttest 20-months after the pretest. One Parent
      Teacher Association (PTA) representative per school was contacted to assess PTA involvement
      in intervention activities related to sun safety.

      The primary hypothesis was stated for the effectiveness of the intervention condition at
      increasing school-level sun safety practices consistent with the sun safety policies of the
      school districts and read, H1: At follow-up, a greater percentage of schools in the
      intervention condition will implement at least one component of the school district sun
      safety policy compared to schools randomized to the attention-control condition.

    <description>All participants in the Translation of District Sun Safe Policies to Schools arm received 1) initial coaching meeting that guided principals through an evaluation of current sun safety practices, the selection of goals for the implementation of sun safety practices, and guidance on the use of intervention materials to support implementation of sun safety practices in the school, 2) follow-up communications from coaches including email, telephone, and virtual meetings, 3) access to media and online resources to support implementation of sun safety practices, 4) mini-grants to support changes in school sun safety practices.</description>

This attention-control treatment will equalize schools on awareness of recommendations to implement school sun safety.</description>

    <description>Translation of District Sun Safe Policies to Schools intervention was guided by Diffusion of Innovation Theory. Principals and other staff in intervention schools received 1) initial coaching meeting that guided principals through an evaluation of current sun safety practices, the selection of goals for the implementation of sun safety practices, and guidance on the use of intervention materials to support implementation of sun safety practices in the school, 2) follow-up communications from coaches including email, telephone, and virtual meetings, 3) access to media and online resources to support implementation of sun safety practices, 4) mini-grants to support changes in school sun safety practices. These components promoted implementation of the 10 policy components recommended by CDC.</description>
