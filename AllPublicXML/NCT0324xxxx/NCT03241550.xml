  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of
      multiple doses of intravenous (IV) isavuconazonium sulfate administered daily in pediatric
      patients. The PK data will be utilized to establish a pediatric population PK model of
      isavuconazole, the active moiety of isavuconazonium sulfate.
