    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial evaluates the safety and feasibility of administering NY-ESO-1
      TCR (T cell receptor)engineered peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and peripheral
      blood stem cells (PBSC) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen to treat patients with
      cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The conditioning chemotherapy makes room
      in the patient?s bone marrow for new blood cells (PBMC) and blood-forming cells (stem cells)
      to grow. Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC and stem cells after the conditioning chemotherapy is
      intended to replace the immune system with new immune cells that have been redirected to
      attack and kill the cancer cells and thereby improve immune system function against cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety of administering the combination of autologous peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) following a reduced
      intensity conditioning regimen, both of which have been genetically modified to express
      NY-ESO-1 TCR.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the combination of TCR transduced autologous
      PBMC and CD34+ PBSC to patients.

      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBMC and the progeny of TCR
      transduced PBSC in serial peripheral blood samples.

      III. Objective response rate (ORR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET
      tracer 9-4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butylguanine ([18F]FHBG) with the goal of determining
      whether the adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBSC home to bone marrow,
      differentiate into T cells and expand in secondary lymphoid organs and tumor deposits.

      OUTLINE:

      G-CSF AND PLERIXAFOR MOBILIZED LEUKAPHERESIS: Between 6 months and 3 weeks before infusion of
      cells, patients undergo G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization of CD34+ peripheral blood stem
      cells. Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on mobilization days 1-8 and plerixafor SC
      on mobilization days 4-7, during mobilization, patients will undergo mobilized leukapheresis
      to obtain PBSC. Patients also undergo an unmobilized leukapheresis on day -5 before infusion
      of cells in order to obtain PBMC.

      CHEMOTHERAPY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -3 to -2.

      Patients receive LV-NYESO TCR/sr39TK PBSC IV on day 0, and after approximately 24 hours,
      patients receive RV-NYESO TCR PBMC IV on day 1. Beginning on day 2, patients receive
      aldesleukin (interleukin-2 (IL) or IL-2) SC twice daily (BID) for up to 7 days. Patients
      undergo blood collection for safety and immune monitoring on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60,
      90, and 120. Patients receive the PET tracer 18F-FHBG IV, and after 1 hour, undergo
      PET/computed tomography (CT) on days 25 and 120.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 5 years, and annually for 15 years.

             starting the conditioning chemotherapy; the definition of effective contraception will
             be based on the judgment of the study investigators

          -  Since IL-2 is administered following cell infusion:

               -  Patients will be excluded if they have a history of clinically significant
                  electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, symptoms of cardiac ischemia with evidence
                  of ischemia on a cardiac stress test (stress thallium, stress multigated
                  acquisition [MUGA], dobutamine echocardiogram or other stress test)

               -  Similarly, patients with a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;
                  45% will be excluded.

               -  Patients with ECG results of any conduction delays (PR interval &gt; 200 ms,
                  corrected QT [QTC] &gt; 480 ms), sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 50 beats
                  per minute), sinus tachycardia (heart rate &gt;120 beats per minute) will be
                  evaluated by a cardiologist prior to starting the trial; patients with any
                  arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, excessive ectopy
                  (defined as &gt; 20 premature ventricular contractions [PVCs] per minute),
                  ventricular tachycardia or 3rd degree heart block will be excluded from the study
                  unless cleared by a cardiologist

               -  Patients with pulmonary function test abnormalities as evidenced by a (forced
                  expiratory volume 1 [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC ] &lt; 70% of predicted for
                  normality will be excluded

          -  Bone marrow involvement based on PET/CT scan at screening

          -  Active or recent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or cytomegalovirus (CMV) based
             on symptoms with positive swab culture and/or positive IgM (immunoglobulin M)
             screening

          -  Liver metastases with no other metastatic sites
