  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are innovative agents that provide very potent LDL
      reduction when administered on top of statins. PCSK9 antibodies prevent LDL receptor
      degradation and enhance circulatory LDL cholesterol clearance. High LDL is a major risk
      factor for PAD and therefore lipid-lowering therapy constitutes another important therapeutic
      intervention for patients with PAD. Evolocumab is a common PCSK-9 inhibitor that has been
      shown to reduce plasma LDL.

      In this study sixty subjects will be treated with high dose statins for 8 weeks followed by 8
      weeks of high dose statin + evolocumab (420mg/4 wk) therapy. The laboratory assessments will
      be performed at the screening (baseline), after 8 weeks of high-dose statin therapy, and 24
      hr and 8 weeks after high dose statin + evolocumab therapy
