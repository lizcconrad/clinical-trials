      This study is to Assess hypercalciuria between J1 of the cure and 1 J1 6 of the cure of
      adjuvant chemotherapy in patients receiving conventional adjuvant chemotherapy of breast
      cancer.

      In view of the absence of data published on the changes of the vitamin and calcium metabolism
      in patients of a breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy combined with corticosteroids
      in antiemetic aiming and a basal calcium vitamin deficiency. A non randomized study
      evaluating the percentage of change in the vitamin and calcium balance and the occurrence of
      a hypercalciuria between initiation and the end of the adjuvant chemotherapy seems necessary,
      both from the scientific point of view, but also to estimate the usefulness of these markers
      in clinical practice track.
