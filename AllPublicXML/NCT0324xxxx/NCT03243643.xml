  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of C-met Kinase Inhibitor
      HS-10241 single agent or combined with Apatinib in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours that
      are not eligible for conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of HS-10241 will be
      escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of HS-10241 single agent and in combination with Apatinib in advanced cancer patients. At the
      same time, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of HS-10241 or combined
      with Apatinb will be observed in advanced cancer patients. To determine the recommended
      dosage regimen for phase II.
