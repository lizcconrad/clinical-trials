      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of a novel therapeutic approach to
      promote functional recovery and spasticity in chronic SCI. The tsDCS effect on
      neuro-physiological measures such as H reflex and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) wiil
      be evaluated in subjects with SCI. This incremental, design will allow the establishment of
      strong electrophysiological data prior to rapid clinical translation of the findings about
      this promising, early-stage technique.

      The central hypothesis is twofold: 1) active tsDCS will lead to a change in Hmax/M max ratio
      than sham tsDCS, in a polarity dependent manner; and 2) active tsDCS will lead to a change in
      SSEP amplitude and latency, in a polarity dependent manner.

    <time_frame>10 minutes before intervention, 10 minutes after intervention ( for each intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately before application of tsDCS and after application of tsDCS Hmax and Mmax will be obtained from soleus muscle by stimulation of tibial nerve. The H-reflex is a compound muscle action potential elicited by low-threshold electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the mixed nerve with subsequent monosynaptic excitation of alpha motoneurons. Changes in the excitability of the reflex pathway are estimated by measuring the amplitude of the reflex. M wave is a compound muscle action potential produced by direct supra-maximal stimulation of motor axons.changes in the ratio of maximal H-reflex amplitude and maximal M-wave amplitude (Hmax/Mmax) provide a rough estimate of modulation in spinal excitability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in SSEPs</measure>
    <time_frame>30 to 40 minutes before intervention, 30 to 40 minutes after intervention ( for each intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>SSEPs measurements to evaluate effects of tsDCS on ascending somatosensory pathways.A somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) is the electrical activity response measured at the skin's surface along ascending sensory pathway following controlled peripheral nerve stimulation. For recording posterior tibial nerve SSEPs, the nerve is stimulated at the ankle, with the cathode midway between the Achilles tendon and the medial malleolus and the anode 3 cm distal to the cathode. Nerve stimulation should consist of a 0.1-0.2 ms duration square wave pulse at 3-5 Hertz (Hz). These pulses will be delivered by constant voltage stimulator applied transcutaneously over the targeted nerve. The stimulation intensity would exceed the motor threshold for eliciting a muscle twitch. Electromyogram (EMG)/ Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) measuring system will be used to measure SSEPs. Procedure will follow per clinical protocol.</description>
