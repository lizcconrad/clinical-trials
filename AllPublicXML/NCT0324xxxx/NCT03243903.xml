      In this study, QS-M needle-free injector and needle-insulin pen were used as a drug carrier
      to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetic patients.The efficacy and safety of QS-M
      needle-free injector and needle-insulin pen were evaluated and compared.This is a
      needle-insulin pen as control group, using a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open,
      parallel grouping study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QS-M needle-free injector as a
      drug carrier in the control of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by
      non-inferiority study，using needle-insulin pen as the comparison. This is a prospective,
      multicenter, randomized, open and parallel grouping study. QS-M needle-free injector produced
      by Beijing QS medical technology co., Ltd.is used as the insulin carrier in the experimental
      group. While needle-insulin pen is used as the insulin carrier in the control group. In this
      study, we investigated whether the changes of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) at the 16th
      week in the experimental group respected to the baseline is non-inferiority compared with
      that in control group. A total of 420 cases were included in this study. The experimental
      group and the control group were assigned by 1:1 ratio.

      The duration of each participant was designed for the screening period: 0-2 weeks; treatment
      adjustment period: 4 weeks; treatment observation period: 12 weeks. Therefore, the expected
      duration of each participant is 18 weeks.

      All patients were unable to change the type of insulin and the number of injections during
      the study period. In this study, the treatment regimen was adjusted according to the results
      of the determination of prescription blood glucose. According to clinical experience, the
      adjustment of blood glucose fluctuations in the possibility of a larger, so the study of the
      adjustment phase follow-up frequency is greater than the treatment period.

      Explanation of Visits and Timing of Assessments:

      Baseline assessment was performed for all subjects during the screening period. On the first
      day of treatment, the first week after treatment (± 2 days), the second week (± 2 days), the
      4th week (± 5 days), the 6th week (± 5 days), the 8th week (± 5 days),the 12th week (± 5
      days), the 16th week (± 5 days) for visit.The 3th week (± 2 days), the 5th week (± 5 days),
      the 7th week (± 5 days), the 10th week (± 5 days), the 14th week (± 5 days), for telephone
      interviews.
