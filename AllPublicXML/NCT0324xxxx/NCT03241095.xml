  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if osteopathic manipulative treatment (OTM)
      improves the golf swing of the participants. Study participants will be randomized into three
      groups, we will stratify by age and gender to make them as uniform as possible. One group
      will receive no intervention other than a 10-minute break between the pre and post
      measurements. A second group will receive a sham intervention where the doctor will pretend
      to give the participant OTM. The third group will receive real OTM.

      Participants will perform a sample of 10 golf swings pre and post intervention which will be
      measured by a golf simulator. They will also complete a brief health history and pre/post
      self-evaluation of their swing.

    <description>The participant will perform 10 swings into a golf simulator using a 5 iron. The simulator will record the information for each swing. Measurements include: Club head speed (Mph), Ball speed (Mph), Launch angle (Deg), Azimuth (Deg), Side spin (Rpm), Back spin (Rpm), Total spin (Rpm), Descent angle (Deg), Carry (Yds),Total distance (Yds), Offline (Yds), Peak height (Yds). We will be looking at the 'Carry' variable, before and after the intervention.</description>
