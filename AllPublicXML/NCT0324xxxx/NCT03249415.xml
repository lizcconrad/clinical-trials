  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility, which affected 48.5 million couples worldwide in 2010 alone, has many causes;
      some causes result from issues related to the endometrium. Unfortunately, no cure exists for
      medical conditions resulting in the destruction of the endometrium, or for non-functional
      uterus. Thus, safe and effective therapies are needed to treat these diseases and to
      establish fertility in affected women. These novel techniques refer to the use and
      application of regenerative/paracrine factors to regenerate the endometrium in patients with
      Asherman's Syndrome (AS) and Endometrial Atrophy (EA).These new therapies based on the
      injection of the identified regenerative/paracrine factors and the platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
      from whole blood in an immunodeficient mouse model with AS/EA, evaluating their contribution
      and/or effect in the endometrial repair by functional proofs.

      The objective is to know the effect of these regenerative factors obtained from Platelet-Rich
      Plasma in an immunodeficient murine model with AS/EA Blood from patients with Asherman's
      Syndrome (AS) and Endometrial Atrophy (EA) will be collected, maintained under anticoagulant
      solution and after several centrifugations PRP will be obtained. Demonstration of a
      functional endometrium will be proved determining pregnancy and implantation rates as well as
      the number of live pups/pregnant female in our mice model. Also, the uterus histology will be
      analysed in treated and untreated mice
