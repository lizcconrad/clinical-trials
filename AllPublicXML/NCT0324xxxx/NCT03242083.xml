  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of deep visual acuity loss. Because
      of progressive deterioration of the macula, patients with AMD complain about progressive
      visual problems that can impair their quality of life in the physical, mental and social
      domains. The principal objective principal of this study is to describe the evolution of
      quality of life between the diagnosis of secondary atrophic AMD and at 18 months after
      confirmation of diagnosis.
