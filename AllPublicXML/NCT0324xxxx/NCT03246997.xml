  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project Powerfood is a pilot program aimed at addressing food insecurity and food access in
      primary care through the implementation of a food prescription program in collaboration with
      a number of community partners. The objectives of this project are:

        1. Implement screening for food insecurity in adult and pediatric primary care practices at
           Mount Sinai.

        2. Provide fresh fruit and vegetable &quot;prescriptions&quot; to be redeemed for farm shares from
           local partner, the Corbin Hill Food Project. Prescriptions will provide 50% off of a
           fruit and vegetable box. Participants will have the option to purchase 2 boxes per month
           for 6 months.

        3. Pilot prescriptions with 50 adult patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and 50 obese
           children who are food insecure and/or receive SNAP and/or WIC benefits.
           Examine/evaluate:

             1. Feasibility of program in a busy primary care practice

             2. Outcomes before and after the intervention (at baseline, 6 and 12 months),
                including diet, diabetes control, and body mass index (BMI)

             3. Outcomes in a comparison group (that will receive the food prescriptions beginning
                at 6 months)
