  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the first marketing authorization in the world in November 2010 granted by US FDA,
      Halaven has been approved for clinical use in more than 40 countries worldwide, including
      many Asian countries, e.g. Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, South
      Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. According to two large global phase III study reports
      of Halaven, very few Asian patients participated in these studies. In a phase II study of
      Halaven with metastatic breast cancer, the clinical efficacy and toxicity were reported only
      in 80 Japanese patients. Halaven has been granted its marketing authorization in Singapore
      since February 2011. However, most of other Asian countries including India have had the
      approval and launched from middle year of 2013 or in early 2014. Limited information of
      Halaven using in Asian patients are available except several case experience exchange
      presented by individual medical centers or as personal experience in the past. Some clinical
      concerns related to Halaven use are raised by clinicians during their clinical practice, such
      as how Halaven works on Asian patients, which type of patient obtains better clinical benefit
      from Halaven, and what are the main treatment related toxicities in Asian which may differ
      from Westerners due to potential ethnic diversity. Further understanding of Halaven related
      clinical benefit and toxicity in Asian patients through collecting clinical experience among
      Asian countries becomes necessary and may provide better information to anticipate these
      concerns.

      The proposed &quot;Halaven Patient Registry&quot; (called the &quot;Registry&quot;) will be a patient
      population-based registry to collect therapeutic related information from patients with
      metastatic breast cancer who were treated with Halaven that was given as a clinical decision
      by patient's treating physician based on clinical status of a patient and proper indication
      of Halaven and to gain a better understanding of the use of Halaven in such Asian patients.
