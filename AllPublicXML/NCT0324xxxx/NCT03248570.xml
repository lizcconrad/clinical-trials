      This is a multicenter phase 2 open label study of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic
      castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with or without DNA damage repair defects.

      All subjects will receive pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study is objective response
      rate (ORR) according to immune-mediated response criteria (irRC).
