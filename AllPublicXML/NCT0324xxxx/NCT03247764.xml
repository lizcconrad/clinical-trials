  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of comorbid depression in patients with epilepsy is as high as 30-50%. The
      depressive symptoms severely affect seizure severity and quality of life in patients with
      epilepsy. The aim of this study is to register the diagnosis and treatment for depression in
      patients with epilepsy from the East China, determining the incidence rate of comorbid
      depression in patients with epilepsy and the choices for the antidepressant treatment. At the
      same time, neuroimaging data such as brain MRI and blood sample will be collected to analyze
      some biomarkers for the comorbidity of epilepsy and depression.
