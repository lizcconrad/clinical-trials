  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single arm Phase I feasibility study is to investigate the tolerability of
      cannabis with concurrent chemoradiation in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A
      strain of cannabis provided by The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) that has a high
      concentration of cannabidiol (CBD) and a low concentration of THC (relative to average street
      cannabis) will be tested in order to maximize clinical efficacy while minimizing intoxicating
      side effects in this medically-ill population.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and the effects of cannabis with
      high concentrations of CBD in patients receiving chemoradiation for GBM. This is not a
      therapeutic study for the treatment of glioblastoma. Patients will first complete a cannabis
      sampling session to assess for initial marijuana tolerability. Proceeding this, patients will
      complete 3-5 outpatient smoking sessions per week over a 6 week period. During each session,
      patients will be given 90 minutes to smoke 0.5 to 2 cannabis cigarettes. Outcome measures
      will include measures of pain, mood, nausea, quality of life, and the both the potentially
      positive and negative subjective effects of cannabis. Food intake, opioid use, and compliance
      to cannabis treatment will be investigated. It is hypothesized that concurrent use of
      cannabis with chemoradiation in the treatment of patients with GBM will be feasible, well
      tolerated and may decrease radiation-induced toxicities.

    <description>Number of cannabis-related adverse events
A 44-item computerized subjective-effects questionnaire visual analog scale (VAS), comprising a series of 100-mm lines labeled 'not at all' (0 mm) at one end and 'extremely' at the other end, will be completed at baseline, after the 90 minutes of cannabis availability and at the end of the session. The VAS included mood, physical symptom, and drug effect descriptors; participants will be instructed to rate the extent to which each descriptor applied to them at that moment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Radiation Induced Toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All patients receiving radiation treatments are routinely seen by the radiation oncologist once a week for a status check. The RTOG cooperative group common toxicity criteria will be used to assess for neurological toxicities including paresthesia, weakness, somnolence or agitation, incoordination, headache, hearing deficit, tremor, speech deficit, and ataxia.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to provide to us the number of opioid medications they took over the 6-week treatment course. The amount of opioids used will be converted to oral morphine equivalents and tallied for each day.</description>
