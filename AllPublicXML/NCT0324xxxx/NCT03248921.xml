  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify measures of obesity, functional capacity, and
      specific biomarkers that may be predictive of obesity and post-operative outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Increasing levels of obesity worldwide have led to a rise in the prevalence of
      obesity-related complications including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers etc. Health
      care providers believe that obesity has a negative effect on patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery, with overweight and obese patients being more likely to experience adverse
      post-operative outcomes. The body mass index (BMI) is the single most used measure for
      determining obesity classification in clinical practice, without accounting for a patient's
      level of cardiopulmonary fitness or muscle mass.

      Study Design: Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years undergoing elective cardiac
      surgery will be consented to participate in this prospective observational trial. Patients
      are invited to participate in measures of obesity, functional capacity and exercise capacity
      assessments, quality of life questionnaires, and blood and tissue sampling for biomarker
      analysis.

      Endpoints: Measures other than BMI that could be predictive of short-term and long-term
      post-operative outcomes. Outcomes of interest include: prolonged length of ventilation,
      hospital length of stay and all-cause mortality.

      Summary: The results of this trial will potentially identify an improved definition of
      fitness capacity for obese cardiac surgical patients and biomarkers alone or in combination
      that could identify the potential for adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. This study will help clinicians better segregate and treat patients pre-operatively
      based on fitness levels and associated biomarkers.

      (subcutaneous adipose tissue; epicardial adipose tissue; pericardial adipose tissue;
      peri-aortic adipose tissue); atrial appendage tissue sample; and 8-10mL blood sample (plasma

        All patients scheduled to undergo elective, first-time cardiac surgery will be considered
        for eligibility to participate in the study. As well, a patient whose BMI is less than 18.5
        kg/m2 and classified as underweight by the World Health Organization will be excluded. Only
        those patients who are classified as being normal weight range or overweight and/or obese
        may be considered for eligibility to participate as defined by the study objectives
        regarding post-operative cardiac surgery outcomes in obese patients. Patients in the normal
        weight range classification will be included as a baseline control participant cohort.
        Finally, patients over the age of 75 will be excluded so as to eliminate the role that
        advanced age may play in affecting functional capacity.
