        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily provided a written consent to participate in this clinical study after
             receiving an explanation of this study

          2. Elderly aged 70 years or older

          3. At the screening visit (Visit 1), Blood pressure: Mean blood pressure measured 3 times
             on the selected arm is as below.

               -  For treatment-naïve patients who have not taken drugs for hypertension within the
                  last 3 months from the screening visit: Mean siSBP ≥ 140mmHg

               -  For patients with essential hypertension who are taking drugs for hypertension:
                  Mean siSBP ≥ 130mmHg

          4. At the baseline visit (Visit 2), Blood pressure: Patients with mild to moderate
             essential hypertension whose mean siSBP measured 3 times on the selected arm is ≥140
             mmHg Patients with treatment compliance of ≥70% during the placebo run-in period

             screening, it is based on the blood pressures measured from both arms, and the patient
             is excluded if the result from any of the arms falls within the criteria.)

          2. Patients with siSBP ≥ 20 mmHg and siDBP ≥ 10 mmHg in the difference between blood
             pressures in the selected arm at the screening visit (Visit 1)

             pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, etc.)

          4. Orthostatic hypotension with symptoms

          5. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

             past

          8. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the
             investigational product and its similar compound Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors,
             ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and sulfonamides, Yellow 5 (Sunset Yellow FCF),
             etc.

          9. Patients undergoing hemapheresis using an adsorber with a dextran sulfate cellulose
