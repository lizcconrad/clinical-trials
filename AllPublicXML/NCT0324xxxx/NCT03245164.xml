    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effects of group exercises under physiotherapist control and
      basketball program on body composition and motor skills of obese children. 45 obese children
      aged 10 years were randomly included to the physiotherapy (n=15), basketball (n:15), and
      control group (n:15). The children were assessed before and after 12-week study duration.
      Body Mass Index (BMI), the percentage of body fat, and circumference values of the children
      were recorded. Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Brief Form (BOTMP-BF) was used
      to determine motor skills of children.

      The roles of active physiotherapy programs and sport programs on the management of the
      problems arising from childhood obesity should be determined. Although the effects of
      exercise and various sport branches on decrease obesity and obesity related problems, the
      effects of group exercises managed by physiotherapists and team sports on body composition
      and motor skills of obese children are not clear so health professionals may have
      difficulties while suggesting better physical activity for this population.

      Thus, body composition and motor skills of the included children were recorded at the
      beginning. They were then grouped into three in order to compare the effects of group
      exercises and basketball. Children in the control group did not participate in any of them.
      Intervention lasted 12 weeks so they were then taken to the assessments at the end of this
      duration.

    <description>The BOTMP-BF test was used to determine the motor skills of the children. It is a popularly used test to specify the level of motor skills of children. Touching nose with index fingers as eyes closed and pivoting thumbs and index fingers were scored for bilateral coordination. Walking forward heel-to-toe on a line for balance, push-up numbers for strength,and number of one-legged side hop in a given duration for speed-agility were scored. Filling in a star, drawing a line through a path, and copying shapes were scored to determine fine motor integration. Stringing blocks in a given time duration was scored for manual dexterity. Catching a Tossed-ball with one hand and dribbling a ball with alternative hands were scored for upper limb coordination. Scoring is explained in the booklet of BOTMP-BF. A total score of this test was acquired.</description>

    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared (kg/m2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Fat</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body fat was determined by skinfold measurements (in milimeters). Lange Skinfold caliper (Cambridge Scientific Industries, Cambridge, MD) was used to determine the percentage of body fat. Triceps, biceps, chest, sucscapula, abdominal, and suprailiac regions were measured. All measurements were taken only from the right side of their body. During these measurements, all children remained standing. Slaughter's equation was used to calculate the percentage of body fat.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circumferences</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Arm, waist, chest, and hip circumferences were measured using an inelastic tape while the children were standing and breathing normally. Right arm was taken as a reference for circumference. Values were recorded in centimeters.</description>

The parents of children who had 95.&gt; percentiles of BMI values were then invited to the study and the participants who accepted the invitation were assessed. They were then evaluated and randomly assigned to three groups. The number for each group was determined by power analysis.</ipd_description>
