  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators compared the hormonal and metabolic effects of three
      meal loads very popular among Italian eating habits, both in the resting- and exercising
      state. Given the lack of time is considered a common barrier to exercise adherence, we wanted
      to identify a low dose of exercise capable to produce health benefits in the post-absorptive
      status elicited by three commonly consumed meal-models in Mediterranean countries. To this
      end, healthy young volunteers firstly underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and
      three meal tolerance tests. Secondly, in an extra set of experiments, subjects cycled at low
      intensity for the last 20 minutes of the same glucose/meal tolerance test. Glycemia,
      insulinemia, ghrelinemia, lipidemia, and satiety were measured throughout OGTT and each
      test-meal load.

      The investigators evaluated postprandial responses (glucose, insulin, ghrelin, free fatty
      acids (FFA)) elicited by three diverse test-meal loads followed by a 20-min bout of
      low-intensity aerobic exercise were investigated. All subjects underwent a 50-g OGTT (A) and
      3 test-meal loads: milk and cereals (B1); milk, apple and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake
      (B2); milk, bread, apple and hazelnut chocolate cream (B3). In the exercise trial,
      participants cycled for 20 minutes at 40% VO2max, 100 minutes after load ingestion.

    <description>All subjects received a standard 75-g OGTT to assess eligibility for the study. The 19 subjects matching the inclusion criteria completed 2 experimental trials: resting and exercise. During the resting trial, all subjects underwent an OGTT (50-g: A) and 3 meal tolerance tests [one for each breakfast tested: B1 = milk (125ml) and cereals (30g); B2 = milk (220ml), apple (200g) and chocolate cream-filled sponge cake (30g); B3 = milk (125ml), apple (150g), bread (50g) and hazelnut chocolate cream (15g)]. In the exercise trial, 100 minutes after the glucose/meal ingestion, participants cycled for 20 min at 40% of maximum oxygen uptake.</description>
