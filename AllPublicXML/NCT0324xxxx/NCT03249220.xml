      Clinical pilot study to evaluate a new multi-parameter neuromonitoring device that allows the
      measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), brain
      temperature monitoring and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage in brain-injured
      patients.

    <description>Patients will be treated according to standard care in place at the investigation site, when intra-ventricular drainage is needed. Patients will receive the new multifunctional device (CBMS Probe) instead of the single function device generally used. Drainage will be performed by routine standards. Temperature, intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow will be recorded. Treatment decision will be made by the neurointensive care specialist based on standard care.</description>
