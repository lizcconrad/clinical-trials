  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this pilot study, we are hoping to test the feasibility of a larger study in the future
      and to learn whether positive airway pressure therapy reduces the recurrence risk of atrial
      fibrillation after successful catheter ablation procedure among patients with atrial
      fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea. The results from this study will help us refine the
      design for a future larger study, and will ultimately improve care of patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep-related breathing disorder in which breathing stops for
      short periods during sleep, is a common condition in patients with atrial fibrillation.
      Studies have shown that up to 75% of atrial fibrillation patients undergoing catheter
      ablation procedure have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk
      of atrial fibrillation recurrence after successful catheter ablation by 40%. However, whether
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure (PAP, the current most
      effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea that uses a machine to help breathe more
      easily) reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence is not fully understood. The
      purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine whether positive airway pressure therapy
      reduces atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation in patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.
