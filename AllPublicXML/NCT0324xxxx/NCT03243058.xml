      Randomized, controlled, double blinded, multicenter, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate
      the safety of low-dose IL-2 and to test whether low-dose IL-2 can prevent further loss of
      beta-cell function in patients with established T1D, or even potentially improve ß-cell
      function in such individuals, when IL-2 is given for one year (primary outcome). Equally
      important, the study will carefully examine various effects of low-dose IL-2 on the immune
      system in patients with T1D, including effects on Treg and other cell subsets, and
      disease-specific autoimmune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled, double blinded, multicenter, phase I/II clinical trial
      to evaluate the safety of low-dose IL-2 and to test whether low-dose IL-2 can prevent further
      loss of beta-cell function in patients with established T1D, or even potentially improve
      ß-cell function in such individuals, when IL-2 is given for one year (primary outcome).
      Equally important, the study will carefully examine various effects of low-dose IL-2 on the
      immune system in patients with T1D, including effects on Treg and other cell subsets, and
      disease-specific autoimmune responses.

      Patients to be included in this study are those diagnosed with T1D who would have had T1D
      from 4 months to 1 year at the time of randomization, who have current or past demonstration
      of autoimmunity (using autoantibodies), and maintain preserved beta-cell function, defined as
      a MMTT stimulated C-peptide &gt;0.2 nmol/L. This population is chosen because it will extend the
      scope of therapy beyond the immediate time following diagnosis, when most previous studies of
      immunotherapy in T1D have been conducted, and impact the field if a therapeutic benefit can
      be shown when the disease is more established.

      Potential participants will have a screening visit to review overall health, measure diabetes
      T1D-associated autoantibodies and perform a MMTT, which will also serve as the baseline MMTT.
      Eligible subjects will be invited to participate in the intervention trial and randomized to
      treatment with Proleukin® or placebo. Fifty-four patients will be enrolled, aged 12-21 years,
      both genders, and randomized to treatment or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Participation for each
      subject will last approximately 2 years. The 18 patients randomized to the control arm will
      receive placebo for two years. At the end of the first year, the 36 patients randomized to
      the treatment arm will be randomized 1:1 to continued treatment or placebo. Thus, among the
      36 patients who received treatment during the first year, 18 patients will continue therapy
      and 18 patients will switch to placebo until the end of the study. This study design allows
      examining safety and efficacy at one year (primary outcome), and further evaluates these
      parameters after the therapy has stopped or it is continued up to the end of 2 years
      (secondary outcome).

      The clinical investigator(s) will evaluate beta-cell function by examining C-peptide response
      during a MMTT, and using glucose and C-peptide data obtained during the MMTTs investigator(s)
      will determine beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion
      using the Mari model (99). It is documented that ß-cells in T1D are &quot;blind&quot; to glucose, by
      showing reduced ß-cell sensitivity to glucose using the Mari model in relatives at risk of
      T1D (100). The extent, to which this may account for reduced ß-cell function, and whether
      this is to any degree reversible, is unknown. Thus, clinical investigator(s) will
      characterize ß-cell function in response to low-dose IL-2 by measuring insulin secretion
      during a 4-hour MMTT, and using the Mari model to calculate ß-cell sensitivity to glucose and
      insulin sensitivity/resistance.

      In other trials with low-dose IL-2, risks have been minimal compared to the well-known side
      effects of high dose IL-2. Risks of low-dose IL-2 include some potential side effects, such
      as pain or skin reactions at the injection site, with potential discomfort, redness,
      swelling, or even a scab at the injection site; flu-like symptoms, nausea, and diarrhea.
      Unexpected risks are always possible.
