  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is an immune-modulated malignancy and immune checkpoint modulators which inhibit
      PD-1 function (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) have demonstrated clinical efficacy as treatment for
      patients with stage IV melanoma. Pembrolizumab across a range of doses in phase I
      investigation has demonstrated clinical efficacy with RR approximately 27%. By better
      understanding how NK cell function and exhaustion interplays with PD1 function and activity,
      potentially more efficacious combination therapies can be developed. The pharmacodynamic
      studies to be performed as part of this trial will provide such information.

          -  Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 and be able to be followed over time by
             Immune related response criteria (irRC) for treatment decisions.

          -  Have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should
             be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference

             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose

             exclusionary.

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment within 4 weeks prior
             to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. - Note: Subjects
             with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the
             study.

          -  Note: If subject received major surgery, the subject must have recovered adequately
             from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
             therapy.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             the subjects are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four
             weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are
             not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does
             not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical
             stability.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  If pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.
