  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a severe disabling problem within society, affecting 25-30% of the United
      States population.. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has the potential to
      provide a treatment option that is safe, scientifically-supported, low-cost, and
      easy-to-administer method to effectively reduce symptoms in patients suffering from chronic
      pain. The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using tACS to treat patients
      with chronic pain, and to collect pilot efficacy as well as EEG and EKG biomarker data for
      optimizing the design of subsequent large-scale studies. The treatment rationale is to
      renormalize the presumed pathological structure of alpha oscillations in the prefrontal
      cortex (PFC) of patients with chronic pain.

    <intervention_model_description>Each participant will receive sham stimulation and 10Hz tACS stimulation at two separate sessions. The order will be randomized (ie, half the participants will receive sham stimulation at the first session and 10Hz tACS stimulation at the second session, and the other half will receive 10Hz tACS stimulation at the first session and sham stimulation at the second session).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study, meaning that neither the participant nor the experimenter knows what kind of stimulation the participant is receiving. An unblinded monitor (separate from the staff that interacts with the participant) is responsible for creating the stimulation codes that run each session and for ensuring that these codes worked correctly.</masking_description>
