  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is for a pilot study comparing volumes of 18F-DOPA-PET avidity with contrast
      enhancement and T2 FLAIR on MRI. Investigators then plan to compare patterns of failure with
      target volumes, pre-treatment MRI changes and pre-treatment 18F-DOPA-PET.
