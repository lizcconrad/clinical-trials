  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether Cartiva is an effective treatment for individuals with
      osteoarthritis of the CMC joint in the hand compared to LRTI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter study with one treatment arm. Comparisons will be made to
      a performance target defined by subtracting a non-inferiority margin of 0.05 from an expected
      standard of care success rate of 0.55. The active treatment arm will receive a Cartiva® SCI
      for CMC.

      A total of 74 subjects will be enrolled into the pivotal study.

      Follow up visits will occur at the following time points after the surgical procedure: 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 4 year and 5 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥22 years of age;

          -  Refractory to conservative non-operative standard of care treatment for first CMC OA
             lasting for at least 6 months that requires surgical intervention;

          -  Eaton classification stage II or III OA of the first CMC joint based on X-rays taken
             within 6 months of the Operative date and evidence of first CMC joint OA based on
             subjective review of associated clinical symptoms;

          -  Preoperative VAS Pain score of ≥ 40 in the treated hand;

          -  Preoperative 11 question QuickDASH score of ≥ 20;

          -  History of or current diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis;

          -  Any significant bone loss, avascular necrosis, or cyst &gt; 8mm of the supporting bone

             quality or quantity of bone resulting from cancer, congenital dislocation, or
             osteoporosis), systemic and metabolic disorders leading to progressive deterioration

             interfere with healing; patients with clinically significant renal, hepatic, cardiac,
             endocrine, hematologic, autoimmune or any systemic disease or systemic infection which
             may make interpretation of the results difficult; patients who have undergone systemic
             administration within 30 days prior to implantation of any type of corticosteroid in
             the thumb, antineoplastic, immunostimulating or immunosuppressive agents;

          -  Have participated in any other investigational or invasive clinical trial within the
