      This study is being done to determine if wearable text-to-speech (TTS) and visual pattern
      recognition (VPR) technology can be used to extend the capabilities of the Argus II to allow
      patients to read and recognize faces and objects.

      The Argus II retinal prosthesis can restore rudimentary forms of vision to patients with bare
      light-perception vision. Using the prosthesis, patients can identify obstacles, handles,
      switches, eating utensils and demonstrate improved navigation when used in conjunction with
      other ambulation-assist tools. Current limits in the resolution of the device prevent useful
      reading or face recognition. The FDA has approved the Argus II as a humanitarian device.

      Present-day wearable text-to-speech converters are also capable of object and face
      recognition. Such systems have been developed to assist with these tasks in patients with
      severe low-vision. ORCAM is a commercially-available eyeglass-mounted visual pattern
      recognition system capable of converting photographs of text to speech. It is comprised of a
      camera, a small belt-worn computer, pattern recognition software and a small audio
      transducer. ORCAM can acquire the image of a sheet of paper and read the text to the user
      through a small speaker adjacent to the ear. In addition, ORCAM can be trained to recognize
      faces and speak the name of the individual to the user. ORCAM can also be used to recognize
      everyday products after being programmed.

      The Orcam device will be mounted onto the Argus II eyeglasses. The subject will be asked to
      use the Orcam device with and without the Argus II. After a half-day interactive training
      session with the Orcam device, the investigators will interview the subject with a
      questionnaire. The investigators will then contact the subject every two weeks via a
      telephone call for two months (4 phone interviews). The investigators will then ask the
      subject to return to Mayo Clinic to demonstrate their ability to use the Argus II and Orcam
      together and separately. These sessions will be videotaped.
