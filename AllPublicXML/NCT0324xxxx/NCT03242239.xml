      The purpose of this study is to compare ALT02 (Trastuzumab biosimilar) and Herceptin®
      (US-licensed Trastuzumab and EU-licensed Trastuzumab) in healthy male subjects about the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects

          -  Have a body weight over 50.0 kg and a body mass index over than 18.5 and less than
             30.0 kg/m², inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality or abnormal laboratory test results found
             during medical screening or positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV found
             during medical screening.

          -  Positive urine drug screen or alcohol breath test at screening.

          -  History of allergic reactions to trastuzumab, benzyl alcohol, murine proteins, or
             other related drugs.

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the Qualified Investigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.

          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities or vital sign
             abnormalities (systolic blood pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mmHg, diastolic blood
             pressure lower than 50 or over 90 mmHg, or heart rate less than 50 or over 100 bpm) at
             screening.

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening or regular use
             of alcohol within six months prior to the screening visit (more than fourteen units of
             alcohol per week [1 unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL of 40% alcohol]).

          -  History of significant drug abuse within one year prior to screening or use of soft
             drugs (such as marijuana) within 3 months prior to the screening visit or hard drugs
             (such as cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP], and crack) within 1 year prior to screening.

          -  Use of trastuzumab or another monoclonal antibody for a medical condition or in the
             context of another clinical trial.

          -  Participation in a clinical research study involving the administration of an
             investigational or marketed drug or device within 30 days prior to dosing,
             administration of a biological product in the context of a clinical research study
             within 90 days prior to dosing, or concomitant participation in an investigational
             study involving no drug or device administration.

          -  Use of medication other than topical products without significant systemic absorption:

               1. prescription medication within 14 days prior to dose administration;

               2. over-the-counter products including natural health products (e.g. food
                  supplements and herbal supplements) within 7 days prior to dosing, with the
                  exception of the occasional use of acetaminophen (up to 2 g daily);

               3. a depot injection or an implant of any drug within 3 months prior to dose
                  administration.

          -  Donation of plasma within 7 days prior to dosing. Donation or loss of blood (excluding
             volume drawn at screening) of 50 mL to 499 mL of blood within 30 days, or more than
             499 mL within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;128 g/L and hematocrit &lt;0.37 L/L at screening.
