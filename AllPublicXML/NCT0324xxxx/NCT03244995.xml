      Objectives:

      Objective 1: Examine the feasibility of the couple-based mind-body (CBMB) program in patients
      with high grade glioma (HGG) and their partners.

      Objective 2: Establish the initial efficacy of the CBMB program in patients and their
      partners regarding spiritual (primary), psychological and physical quality of life (QOL)
      (secondary) outcomes relative to a waitlist control (WLC) group.

      Partner:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,
      race/ethnicity, marital status and how long you have been married, and your job and education
      history) will be collected at your first visit.

      After your first visit, you and your partner will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of
      dice) 1 of 2 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the
      same, or worse than the other.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take part in the couple-based mind-body program.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will not take part in the couple-based mind-body program.
           After the study has been completed, you and your partner will be offered the opportunity
           to take part in the couple-based mind-body program. This will be offered outside of this
           study (but will continue to be offered at no cost to you).

      You have about an equal chance (50/50) of being assigned to each group.

      Group 1 only - Couple-Based Mind-Body Sessions:

      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in up to 4-5 sessions (based on your preference)
      over the course of 6 weeks. Each session will last about 60 minutes and will be guided by an
      instructor. You and your caregiver should attend each session together as partners. Your
      first session will be done face-to-face in person or it can be done through a video
      conference (Facetime/Zoom), depending on your availability. After your first session, all
      sessions will be done through video conferences.

      If you do not have a computer or iPad, you will be loaned an iPad while you are on study so
      you can complete the sessions. You will complete an iPad agreement form and return the iPad
      on the date that is noted in the agreement. If the iPad is lost, damaged, or stolen, you
      should tell the study staff right away. You may be asked to file a police report, if it is
      stolen. You will not be responsible for the cost of replacing the iPad. You will not be able
      to keep the iPad after the study is over.

      During the sessions, you will be asked to do deep-breathing and meditation exercises. The
      sessions are designed for beginners and should not be difficult. You will sit in a chair
      while you do the exercises. You can move through the exercises at your own pace. The
      instructor will be available to answer any questions you may have about the sessions.

      The sessions will be audio recorded. This is so the researchers can keep track of the quality
      of the sessions. Only the study staff will be able to review these recordings. The audio
      recordings are digital and will be destroyed about 7 years after the end of the study. If you
      do not allow the sessions to be audio recorded, you cannot take part in this study.

      At your first session, you will be given CDs and instructions for practicing meditation at
      home. You will be asked to practice at home 1 time a day for 5-15 minutes either with your
      partner or alone on the days you do not have a session with the instructor.

      You will also be asked to complete an intentional activity each day. For example, the study
      staff will ask you and your partner what form of affection you prefer and you should both try
      and purposefully display that act of affection during the week. So, if you like to hold
      hands, you should try and hold your partner's hand intentionally/more often.

      During each week, you will also complete a questionnaire on your feelings about the sessions.
      You will be asked to list what you liked or disliked, what you found most and least useful,
      and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be asked about how often you practice
      meditation outside of class and if you think you are benefitting from the couple-based
      mind-body program. It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. Your answers
      to the questions will not be shared with the patient.

      You will receive 2 phone calls each week (over about a 6 week period) from the instructor
      while you are taking part in the sessions. During the phone call, the instructor will make
      sure you and your partner are able to successfully use the meditation and exercises learned
      in class on your own and in the context of everyday situations to help manage symptoms that
      you may have. Each phone call should last about 15 minutes.

      Groups 1 and 2 - Questionnaires:

      Group 1 and 2 participants will complete these questionnaires. If you are in Group 2, the
      study staff will tell you when to complete these questionnaires as the timing will match up
      to the sessions of the Group 1 participants.

      You will complete about 12 questionnaires before the first session, after the last session
      (usually 6 weeks later) and three months after you complete the study. The questionnaires ask
      about your health, your mood, sleeping habits, relationship, health care, work productivity,
      and quality of life. It should take about 55 minutes to complete these questionnaires and can
      be completed online or on paper and returned in person or by mail.

      You will also complete an additional questionnaire at your first visit, at the end of the
      program, and about 3 months after the end of the program. The questionnaire is designed to
      test your cognitive abilities (tests to check your memory and thinking abilities, for
      example). The questionnaire will take about 15 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the last
      questionnaires.

      Patient:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,
      race/ethnicity, marital status and how long you have been married, and your job and education
      history) will be collected at your first visit. Additional medical information will be
      collected from your medical record, such as your current and/or past nicotine use.

      After your first visit, you and your partner will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of
      dice) 1 of 2 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the
      same, or worse than the other.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take part in the couple-based mind-body program.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will not take part in the couple-based mind-body program.
