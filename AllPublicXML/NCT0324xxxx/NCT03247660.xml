    <textblock>
      Objective: To find out the effectiveness of pelvic-perineal physiotherapy in prevention and
      treatment of postpartum pelvic floor dysfunction caused by vaginal delivery. Design:
      Randomized, controlled and single blinded clinical trial. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of these groups: Experimental group: pelvic-perineal physical therapy plus
      hypopressive exercises plus training in lifestyle advice; Experimental group II: hypopressive
      exercises plus training in lifestyle advice; Control group: just training in lifestyle
      advice. In the 3 groups several physical therapy assessments will be undertaken: 1st before
      intervention, 2nd immediately after completing intervention; 3th, 4th, 5th and 6th after 3,
      6, 12 and 24 months. Study subjects: Postnatal women (6 and 8 weeks after vaginal delivery),
      primiparous, whose vaginal delivery has occurred in the &quot;PrÍncipe de Asturias&quot; Hospital,
      which have not been already treated for pelvic floor dysfunction, and after reading,
      understanding and freely signing an informed consent form. Sample size: 240 subjects will be
      included (80 subjects per group). Allowing for 15% of drop-outs and taking into account that
      17% of women in the intervention group may develop pelvic floor dysfunction (urinary
      incontinence) versus 40% in the control group, with an alpha risk of 0.05, a beta risk of 0.1
      in a bilateral contrast using the arcsine approximation. Data analysis: A descriptive
      analysis will be done of all variables. A confidence level of 95% (p &lt;0,05) will be
      established for all the cases. Effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing between the two
      groups of the change in outcome variables between visits.

    <description>It will be assessed by the PFIQ-7 Spanish version. The PFIQ-7 consists of 3 scales of 7 questions each taken from the Urinary Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire. The 3 scales are scored from 0 (least impact) to 100 (greatest impact) and an overall summary score (0 to 300).</description>

    <description>It will be assessed by PFDI-20 that is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress caused by pelvic floor symptoms. The PFDI-20 includes 20 questions and 3 scales. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The sum of the scores of these 3 scales serves as the overall summary score of the PFDI-20 and ranges from 0 - 300 and the higher the score, the worse quality of life. The 3 scales include questions taken from the following widely used outcome measures: Urinary Distress Inventory - 6 questions, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory - 6 questions, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory - 8 questions collecting data about UI, POP and colorectal and anal symptoms.</description>

    <description>A directly pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training protocol will be applied. Participants will performed PFM exercises in the way proposed by the PERFECT scheme. Biofeedback exercises will be also performed in lithotomy position. If the evolution of the women will allow it, the last two treatment biofeedback sessions will be conducted in standing position, to train PFM in more challenging and functional situation. In this group participants will be also trained hypopressive breathing and will perform five hypopressive exercises: two postures in supine, one on four-kneeling, and two in standing position. Educational strategy will also be applied. The intervention will last 8 weeks, 2 sessions per week. Each session will last 40/50 minutes.</description>

    <description>The educational strategy will consist of instruction of printed materials and dimensional anatomical models about the anatomy of the pelvic floor and the physiology of the pelvic organs. It will be recommended to avoid risk factors, such as gaining weight, weight lifting, high impact sports, constipation, smoking, or drinking too much caffeine. They will also instruct in toilet habits, and will be taught to use the knack maneuver before and during increases of intra-abdominal pressure. The intervention will last 8 weeks, 1 session per week. Each session will last 40/50 minutes.</description>
