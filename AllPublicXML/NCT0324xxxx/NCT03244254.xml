      A prospective, longitudinal study meant to compare blood levels of I-FABP in pediatric celiac
      patients during diagnosis to levels under gluten free diet, it's correlation with traditional
      serology testing and questionnaire regarding patient responsiveness to the gluten free diet,
      and in comparison to a control group.

    <textblock>
      I-FABP is a reliable marker for intestinal damage and has been proved to respond more swiftly
      than traditional serology to enterocyte injury in celiac patients who do not a gluten free
      diet. In this study a pediatric population of celiac patients will be tested for I-FABP
      levels during initial endoscopic diagnosis and during one year of follow up. Their levels
      will be compared to a control group of pediatric patients undergoing endoscopy for reasons
      other than suspicion of celiac disease. During the period of follow up, the test group will
      undergo repeat testing for I-FABP levels, as well as the traditional follow up testing for
      serology in celiac patients and a questionnaire regarding. The results will be analyzed in
      the hope of finding a way to use I-FABP as a more direct, accurate marker of disease
      activity, and of correlations between it's level and the patient's Marsh score at diagnosis.
