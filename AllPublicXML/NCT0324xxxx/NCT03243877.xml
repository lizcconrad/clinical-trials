  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POC Medical Systems has developed a Point of Care system for the screening of breast cancer
      in the general population. Via a proprietary algorithm, the MammoAlert™ is expected to
      determine breast cancer's risk level for a subject by identifying the presence in plasma of
      known biomarkers. The present study aims to determine the Sensitivity and Specificity of the
      test in plasma samples of subjects of whom the status vis-à-vis breast cancer is known.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2400 subjects will be screened for breast cancer in seven enrolling sites across the country
      to ensure diverse ethnicity.

      &quot;Positive&quot; subjects should be confirmed breast cancer positive by Mammography and/or biopsy.
      Breast cancer positive samples will be compared to the control group of samples obtained from
      women attending clinics for non-cancerous related pathology.

      Both Positive and Negative Predictive Values will be evaluated to determine accuracy and
      sensitivity of the screening test.

      Subjects whose known cancer positive or negative status do not match the test report will be
      followed up as appropriate, on case by case basis to identify false positive and false
      negative results.

    <time_frame>Screening performance will be calculated at 4-months</time_frame>
    <description>Screening performance: comprises the sensitivity and specificity of MammoAlert™. It represents the performance of the diagnostic test and is therefore independent of the prevalence of the disease in the studied sample of patients.</description>

    <measure>Predictive values &amp; likelihood ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>Predictive values &amp; likelihood ratios will be calculated at 4-months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive predictive value: the probability that a subject has the disease given that the test result is positive will be estimated by: TP/(TP+FP).
Negative predictive value: the probability that a subject does not have the disease given that the result of the test is negative will be estimated by TN/(TN+FN).
Likelihood ratio (LR): the likelihood that a given test result would be expected in a patient with the target disorder compared to the likelihood that that same result would be expected in a patient without the target disorder.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of test</measure>
    <time_frame>Accuracy of test will be calculated at 4-months</time_frame>
    <description>The probability that the test result reflects the true disease state will be estimated as the proportion of cases for which the test result is correct: (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to give informed consent. Written informed consent by the patient/patient's
             legally acceptable representative (LAR) for donating blood sample

          2. Documented absence of cancer (other than Breast Cancer)

          3. Documented (Mammography and/or Biopsy) diagnosis of Breast Cancer (IDC/ILC/DCIS ), any
             stage

          4. Blood sample taken before any treatment for Breast Cancer was administered to the
             subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other malignancy besides breast cancer in the 5 years prior to obtaining the sample.

          2. Therapies for breast cancer that have been administered within 1 year of obtaining the
             sample

          3. Any condition (including psychiatric), which in the Investigator's opinion, places the
