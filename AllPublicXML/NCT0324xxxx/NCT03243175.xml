      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate a substantial benefit from oral anticoagulant
      drugs for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation
      (AF). However, these RCTs excluded patients with prior intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).
      Therefore, guidelines are unable to recommend whether oral anticoagulant drugs, in particular
      non-vitamin K antagonist (called direct OAC) - can be used for patients with AF after an
      intracerebral haemorrhage.

      Roughly 30% of adults with ICH have AF but in 2017 it remains unclear whether they should
      start oral anticoagulant drugs, be treated with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) or avoid
      anticoagulation and LAAC.

      Open label randomised controlled multicentre clinical trial with masked outcome assessment
      (PROBE design) comparing 3 strategies (1:1:1): anticoagulation with a Direct OAC (Apixaban
      5mgx2/day) vs avoid anticoagulation with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) compared to
      usual care (avoid anticoagulation).

      Primary outcome: the net clinical benefit (composite outcome of major ischaemic and
      haemorrhagic events) during a follow-up of 24 months (adjudication committee masked to the
      randomisation arm

      The results of A3ICH will help the clinician to decide which strategy is the most effective
      in terms of benefit/risk ratio to prevent the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients
      with a history of ICH and AF. A3ICH will address this increasingly common dilemma and could
      affect clinical practice.

      Data from A3ICH will contribute to an international individual patient data meta-analysis.
