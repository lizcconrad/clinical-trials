  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to: 1) develop an educational tool known as the
      Patient Reported Outcome Measure informed Decision Aid (PROM-DA) that will describe the
      options for patients considering total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery, and help them imagine
      what to expect if they choose either option; 2) assess the extent that the PROM-DA improves
      patients decision quality; 3) determine the feasibility of a larger trial to test the PROM-DA
      in multiple sites and more patients.
