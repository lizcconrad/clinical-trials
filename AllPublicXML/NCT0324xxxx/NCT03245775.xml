  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine the relative effectiveness in child BMI z-scores at 3, 6, and
      12-months post baseline of iChoose+ versus Family Connections. Secondary aims are to
      determine (1) ongoing reach, fidelity, and implementation costs, (2) community capacity for
      implementation and sustainability, (3) relative impact on family eating/physical activity and
      parental weight, and (4) relative adherence and potential dose response relationships.

      In partnership with the Community Advisory Board and Parent Advisory Team, with a goal to
      improve the magnitude of weight reductions and increase the likelihood of iChoose
      sustainability in the community, the investigators propose to test iChoose+ that will (1)
      extend iChoose to a 6-month program, followed by 12 bi-weekly maintenance telephone calls,
      congruent with the 12-month Bright Bodies program duration, (2) formalize a Parent Health
      Advisory model of previous iChoose families to serve as a 'peer support safety net' for new
      program participants, and (3) deliver support calls using interactive voice response (IVR)
      automation to reduce the burden on community stakeholder implementation. When reflecting on
      and interpreting the outcomes of the previous planning grant, the Community Advisory Board
      and Parent Advisory Team also identified the need to use a study design that allowed all
      participants the opportunity to benefit and, with this in mind, to test alternative
      family-based childhood obesity program options that improve reach within the broad Dan River
      Region population of minority, low-income, and geographically dispersed families. Thus, the
      Community Advisory Board and Parent Advisory Team returned to a potential option for delivery
      that was considered earlier in the planning grant process and was rated highly for
      scalability— Family Connections, an adaptation of Golan's Home Environmental Change model
      that focuses exclusively on parents as the agents of change. When compared to iChoose+ (12
      bi-weekly sessions &amp; 24 IVR calls/12 months), Family Connections has fewer sessions and fewer
      IVR support calls over a shorter period of time (2 in-person sessions spaced one week apart &amp;
      10 IVR calls/6 months), delivers intervention to parents only, and promotes physical
      activity, but does not include structured exercise sessions. Still, in previous studies
      Family Connections led to significant reductions in child weight status, though smaller in
      magnitude than Bright Bodies, that were sustained 6-month post intervention completion.
      Committed to the goal of allowing all participating families an opportunity to benefit from
      study participation and the need for a sustainable family-based childhood obesity option, the
      Community Advisory Board and Parent Advisory Team propose a comparative effectiveness trial
      where eligible families will be randomly assigned to: (1) iChoose+ (n=87) or to (2) Family
      Connections (n=87). Given the need to optimize program enrollment, participation, and
      retention in each program, both iChoose+ and Family Connections will include Parent Health
      Advisor support63-68 as refined by the Parent Advisory Team. The primary aim is to determine
      the relative changes in child BMI z-scores at 6 months post baseline of iChoose+ versus
      Family Connections, though additional assessments will occur at 3 and 12 months post
      baseline. Secondary aims include (1) determine ongoing reach, fidelity, and costs of
      implementation, (2) assess community capacity to implement and sustain childhood obesity
      programs, (3) determine impact on family eating and physical activity and parental weight by
      intervention, and (4) assess the adherence by intervention and potential dose response
      relationships. The primary study hypotheses are: (a) children in both conditions will reduce
      BMI-z scores significantly, when compared to baseline at 3, 6 and 12 months, but iChoose+
      reductions will be significantly larger than Family Connections, (b) reach—the sample will be
      representative of the eligible regional population on demographic and behavioral factors, (c)
      implementation—the intervention components will be delivered with high fidelity in both
      conditions, but costs will be lower for Family Connections, (d) maintenance—a sustainability
      action plan will be completed to include strategies for continued delivery of iChoose+ and/or
      Family Connections (outcome dependent), (e) parent weight, parent/child behaviors, &amp; tertiary
      outcomes that follow the same patterns as BMI z-scores, and (f), community capacity for
      implementing and sustaining a locally relevant FBCO treatment and maintenance program will
      remain high over time.
