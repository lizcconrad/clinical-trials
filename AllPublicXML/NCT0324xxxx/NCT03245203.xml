      Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectum excision (TME) has
      become the standard therapy for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) to
      reduce the local recurrence rate, however, no improvement of distant metastasis rate was
      observed, and the incidence of postoperative local recurrence and distant metastasis can
      reach more than 25%. It is still a challenge for us to improve the RO resection rate of
      locally advanced rectal cancer and reduce the incidence of local recurrence and distant
      metastasis.

      Objective: compared with the postoperative adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has
      shown better compliance of LARC patients, and may be more effective in reducing the incidence
      of local recurrence and distant metastasis. This study used the anti-angiogenesis drugs
      beacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with LARC for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and
      investigated the short-term efficacy to provide objective basis for the selection of
      neoadjuvant therapy.

      Methods: 70 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma clinical staging in Stage II or Stage III
      were included for neoadjuvant therapy followed by TME, of which 35 underwent neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy, and other 35 underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy+beacizumab.

LARC was reevaluated and operated after 4~8 weeks.</description>
