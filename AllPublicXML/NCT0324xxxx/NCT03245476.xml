  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims, by means of a randomized control trial, to investigate which treatment
      method (corticoid injection + physiotherapy with a focus on manual therapy and home-exercises
      versus corticosteroid injection + physiotherapy with focus on education and supported home
      exercises) gives better results on clinically relevant outcomes (range of glenohumeral
      motion, psychological factors, pain, shoulder function, quality of life) and on parameters
      derived from arthroscopic glenohumeral investigation by means of MRI.

      Furthermore, associations between (1) the results on the MRI investigation, (2) the range of
      glenohumeral motion, (3) shoulder function and pain, and (4) psychological factors will be
      assessed at different time-points (before and at 6-12-18 and 52 weeks after the first
      injection).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  50 % loss of passive GH external rotation motion, together with motion losses greater
             than 25% in at least two other GH movements, as compared to the unaffected side

          -  the pain accompanying the motion losses has to be present for at least one month.
