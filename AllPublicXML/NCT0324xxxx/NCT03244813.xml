  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims to compare the effects of a standard care plan to one using adapted physical
      activity in patients with Parkinson Disease. Using actigraphy as an evaluation measure will
      allow the collection of quantitative and objective data related to activity in contrast to
      questionnaires which are more subjective and dependent on self-representation. In addition,
      the evaluation of the caregiver's actigraphy and hardship (Zarit scale) will provide
      interesting data from this population.

          -  The patient cannot walk

          -  Muscular tremor preventing the actigraphy measurement. Outside normal range values for
