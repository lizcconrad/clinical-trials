  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy and
      some patients who relapse following CD19 directed therapy relapse with CD19 negative
      leukemia. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T-cells obtained directly
      from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR) to CD22, a different protein from CD19, expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell
      in patients with CD22+ leukemia. The CAR enables the T-cell to recognize and kill the
      leukemic cell through the recognition of CD22, a protein expressed on the surface of the
      leukemic cell in patients with CD22+ leukemia. This is a Phase 1 study designed to determine
      the safety and feasibility of the CAR+ T - cells and the feasibility of making enough to
      treat patients with CD22+ leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ≥1 ≤26 years of age

        Disease status:

          -  If post-allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplant (HCT): confirmed CD22+ leukemia
             recurrence, defined as ≥0.01% disease

          -  If Relapse/Refractory status with no history of allogeneic HCT, one of:

               -  2nd or grater marrow relapse, with or without extramedullary disease

               -  1st marrow relapse at end of 1st month of re-induction with ≥0.01% blasts by
                  morphology and/or MPF

               -  Primary Refractory, defined as &gt;5% blasts by multi-parameter flow after ≥2
                  separate induction regimens

               -  Subject has indication for HCT but is ineligible, inclusive of persistent minimal
                  residual disease

          -  Asymptomatic from CNS involvement, if present, and in the opinion of the PI with a
             reasonable expectation that disease burden can be controlled in the interval between
             enrollment and T-cell infusion. Subjects with significant neurologic deterioration
             will not be eligible for T-cell infusion until stabilized.

          -  Free from active GVHD and off immunosuppressive GVHD therapy for 4 weeks.

          -  Lansky or Karnofsky performance score of ≥50

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;8 weeks

          -  Recovered from acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and
             radiotherapy

          -  ≥7 days post last chemotherapy administration (excluding intrathecal or maintenance
             chemotherapy)

          -  adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requiring systemic corticosteroids (exclusive of physiologic replacement dosing)
             within 7 days of enrollment

          -  Previously received genetically modified cell therapy that is still detectable, or
             virotherapy

          -  Active clinically significant CNS dysfunction

          -  Active malignancy other than CD22+ leukemia

          -  Active severe infection

          -  Concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would prevent
             the patient from undergoing protocol specified therapy
