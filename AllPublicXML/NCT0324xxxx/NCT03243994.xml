      Aim: To investigate whether patients with pulmonary hypertension have reduced absorption
      capacity compared to COPD patients without cor pulmonale potentially due to venous
      obstruction in the portal vein system.

      The presence of cor pulmonale was determined by echocardiography. The concentration of
      D-xylose and zinc were measured in peripheral blood one, two and three hours after ingestion
      and used as markers of absorption. Furthermore, urine was collected for five hours to
      determine the amount of excreted D-xylose.

      Background: Cor pulmonale is a common complication to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD), and may result in increased pressure in the inferior caval vein and stasis of the
      liver. The chronic pulmonary hypertension may lead to stasis in the veins from the small
      intestine and thereby compromise absorption of nutrients.

      Aim: To investigate whether patients with pulmonary hypertension have reduced absorption
      capacity compared to COPD patients without cor pulmonale.

      Methods: Absorption of D-xylose (25 g) and zinc (132 mg), administered as a single dose, was
      tested in 14 COPD patients, seven with and seven without cor pulmonale. The presence of cor
      pulmonale was determined by echocardiography. The concentration of D-xylose and zinc were
      measured in peripheral blood one, two and three hours after ingestion and used as markers of
      absorption. Furthermore, urine was collected for five hours to determine the amount of
      excreted D-xylose.
