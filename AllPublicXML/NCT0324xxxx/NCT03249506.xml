    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the event rate of the composite
      endpoint of all-cause mortality (ACM) or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) for
      participants with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease
      among new users of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) as compared with new
      users of non-SGLT2i anti-hyperglycemic agent (AHA).

    <time_frame>approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Composite of ACM and hospitalization of HF will be assessed in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ACM is defined as any record of death regardless of the cause of death and is identified through a master death file within the military health system (MHS) that compiles, processes, and validates all death records from the following data sources: inpatient hospitalization discharge dispositions from military and civilian hospitals, ambulatory and outpatient encounter records with recorded death disposition, casualty death feed related to active duty service member combat related deaths, survivor self-report, and an established, recurring social security death index (SSDI) feed from the social security administration. Hospitalization for HF will be defined as any inpatient hospitalization record, inclusive of both military and civilian hospitals, with an international classification of disease-9th or 10th edition (ICD-9/10) in the primary diagnosis field.</description>

    <description>This is a retrospective cohort study identifying participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease using the Military Health System (MHS) over a 3-year period. Cohort 1 included participants with incident exposure of one or more non-sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) anti-hyperglycemic agent (AHA) therapy during the study period with no prior or subsequent SGLT2i exposure throughout the study period. New users are defined as participants whose first exposure to any non-metformin AHA medication occurs greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 365 days after their start of observation in the database with no prior exposure to any medication within the same AHA medication class in the prior 365 days.</description>

New users are defined as participants whose first exposure to SGLT2i medication occurs &gt;= 365 days after their start of observation in the database with no prior exposure to the same AHA medication class in the prior 365 days.</description>
