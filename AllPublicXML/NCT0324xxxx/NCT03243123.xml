  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study aimed at evaluating the acute effects induced by a single session
      of robot-assisted passive hand mobilization on local perfusion and upper limb function in
      post-stroke hemiparetic patients. Twenty-three participants with subacute or chronic stroke
      received 20 min passive mobilization of the paretic hand with robotic assistance. After the
      intervention, significant improvements were found in forearm perfusion, muscle tone
      significantly decreased and subjects reported decreased upper limb heaviness, stiffness and
      pain. This study supports novel evidence that hand robotic assistance promotes local forearm
      circulation, may help in the management of spasticity and acutely alleviates reported
      symptoms of heaviness, stiffness and pain in subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis.

    <description>The intervention was performed using the Gloreha (Idrogenet, Italy) robotic system. The system consists of a soft exoskeleton similar to a glove. Passive hand joints mobilization is provided by a hydraulic system. Each patient underwent a session of 20 min passive mobilization of the paretic hand.</description>
