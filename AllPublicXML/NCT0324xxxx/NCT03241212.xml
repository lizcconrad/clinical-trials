  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial assessing diabetes knowledge (using a Mercy-What
      I Know About Diabetes Test (MWIKAD) validated survey) and self-care practices (using a
      validated Self-management of Type 1 Diabetes-Adolescence (SMOD-A) survey) at baseline, 3
      months and 6 months. The intervention group will receive a minimum of 78 text messages
      related to diabetes over the course of 26 weeks from study enrollment. Subjects are invited
      to respond to some text messages which will be in the form of a multiple-choice question and
      if they do, they will receive an additional text message in response to their answer.

    <description>At baseline enrollment: participants will be asked to fill out a demographic survey, the MWIKAD survey and the SMOD-A survey. HbA1c, frequency of Blood Glucose (BG) checks and percent of glucose values above, within and below the target range will be extracted from chart review.
Surveys (with the exception of demographics) and chart extraction will be repeated at 3 months and 6 months post enrollment.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the same surveys on the same timeline as above. The texting group will be asked to provide their cell phone number to the texting software.
From baseline appointment to 26 weeks post enrollment, participants will receive a text message every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Some text messages will be informational only, others will ask the participant for a response to a multiple-choice question with immediate feedback on the answer chosen.</description>
