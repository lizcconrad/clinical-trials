  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study attempts to understand the association between maternal weight and child weight.
      Intended participants are both obese and lean women looking to get pregnant in the near
      future. Obese participants will be randomized to either a structured very low calorie diet or
      standard-of-care pre-natal dietary counseling. Lean participants will receive
      standard-of-care pre-natal dietary counseling. From pre-pregnancy through one-year after
      delivery, both mom and child will participate in tests looking at how their bodies process
      and store energy. Our hypothesis is that we affect the maternal-child weight association by
      changing the mother's pre-pregnancy metabolic make up.
