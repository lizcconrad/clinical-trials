    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the effect of isolytic and static
      stretching training in individuals having subacromial impingement syndrome with glenohumeral
      internal rotation deficit. Isolytic group will receive isolytic stretching in modified cross
      body stretching position and standard physiotherapy program. Static group will receive static
      stretching in modified cross body stretching position and standard physiotherapy program.
      Control group will receive only standard physiotherapy program.

      The effectiveness of static stretching on various parameters such as range of motion or pain
      is studied and proved in literature. Static stretching in cross body position was also found
      helpful for improving shoulder range of motion with some disadvantages. In modified cross
      body position, the patient is positioned in a more advantageous way for him/her. Usually this
      stretching is done as active-assistive static stretching with the physiotherapist. Proof is
      still needed for the effectiveness of active-assistive static stretching in modified cross
      body position. Furthermore, there is no research about the effect of isolytic stretching
      which is relatively new technique compare to static stretches in subacromial impingement
      syndrome. In isolytic stretching, when the patient contracts the agonist muscle group with
      20% muscle force active-assistive streching in agonist muscle group by the physiotherapist at
      the same time is done for 2-4 seconds. A fast isolytic stretching is applied in order to
      break the fibrous tissue. Our purpose is to investigate and compare the effect of isolytic
      and static stretching training in individuals having subacromial impingement syndrome with
      glenohumeral internal rotation deficit . Stretching groups will receive either isolytic or
      static stretching in modified cross body stretching position and standard physiotherapy
      program. There is a control group. Control group will receive only standard physiotherapy
      program. Standard physiotherapy program includes TENS, hotpack, posture and strengthening
      training program. Treatment program will last four times a week (4-4-4-3) for four weeks, 15
      sessions in total.
