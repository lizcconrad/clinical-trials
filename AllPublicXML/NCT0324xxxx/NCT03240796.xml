    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators give participants who had a lens implantation before a
      secondary intraocular lens implantation in the purpose of reduce complications of surgeries
      for dense cataract , and report a prospective, non-randomized controlled study aiming at
      comparison of minimal invasive lens surgery and traditional cataract surgery for treating
      congenital cataracts

      A Prospective,randomized controlled study of eyes with dense nucleus were enrolled. Patients
      were assigned to two groups: Group I: the participants had a intraocular lens implantation,
      while in Group II, the participants had a traditional cataract surgery. Investigators give
      two groups a secondary intraocular lens implantation. Investigators compare the visual
      acuity, incidence of high intraocular pressure, incidence of visual axis opacification,
      uveitis and iris/pupil abnormality between two groups after the first and the second surgery,
      aiming at comparison of minimal invasive lens surgery and traditional cataract surgery for
      treating congenital cataracts
