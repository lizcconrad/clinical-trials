  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multi-arm, international, phase Ib, 3 x 3 dose-escalation study with
      an initial phase I followed by an expansion phase. The primary objective of the phase Ib is
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) of various combinations of pembrolizumab, pralatrexate and
      decitabine.

    <textblock>
      The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are rare subtypes of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with
      unique clinicopathologic features and very unfavorable prognosis. Recently it has been
      demonstrated that PTCLs are characterized by recurrent mutations in epigenetic operators and
      escape from immune surveillance.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-programmed death (PD)-L1, or
             anti-PD-L2 agent.

             RNA [qualitative] is detected).
