  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether an individualized determination of energy
      requirements using indirect calorimetry instead of a formula-based approach leads to an
      optimized nutritional support and as a consequence to an optimized nutritional status of the
      critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients measured by the phase angle.
