  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Korea, VMP is most commonly used as frontline treatment in patients with newly diagnosed
      MM who were ineligible for high-dose therapy. Recently National Insurance began to reimburse
      the second-line LD when the bortezomib-containing treatment failed to salvage the patients.
      Patients who have relapsed MM after exposure to the above agents and have progressive disease
      have a short life expectancy. Third-line therapy is needed for retrieving the patients
      hereafter. And substantial proportion of patients will attain an advanced age. To examine if
      time to disease progression is maintained and tolerability is improved with lower
      dexamethasone dose, the dose of dexamethasone is reduced when at least a minimal response is
      achieved after 3 months of treatment with the initial dose. Three months later (6 months
      after the initial treatment), the response remains in stable disease, 2nd dose reduction
      (dexamethasone 10mg or prednisone 50mg) will be carried out.
