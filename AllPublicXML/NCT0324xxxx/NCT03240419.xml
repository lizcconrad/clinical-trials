  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of a randomized control trial in which the effects of
      probiotic supplementation throughout pregnancy on maternal insulin sensitivity and
      inflammation, as well offspring gene expression and body composition are examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal obesity leads to increased insulin resistance and inflammation which have been shown
      to induce fetal adaptations and greater risk of obesity in the offspring. Probiotic
      supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in normal
      weight women. However, little is known on the effects of probiotic supplementation throughout
      pregnancy on maternal insulin sensitivity and inflammation as well as offspring gene
      expression and body composition. Long term nutritional supplementation, however, is
      associated with increased participant burden as well as lower compliance and retention rates.
      Thus, this study will assess the feasibility of a long term probiotic supplementation study
      in obese pregnant women. Acceptance and compliance with daily capsules throughout pregnancy
      and study procedures will be assessed.

    <description>Each probiotic capsule contains 180 mg of a standardized white to light beige fine powder consisting of freeze-dried cultures. Specifically, Bifidobacterium BB-12® and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG® (50%:50%). This product has a minimum potency of 6.5 billion (6.5E+9) CFU (ColonyForming Units) per capsule. Other ingredients in the powder are: microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. Participants in this group will take one daily capsule orally starting at the time of recruitment (gestation week 12) and until delivery.</description>
