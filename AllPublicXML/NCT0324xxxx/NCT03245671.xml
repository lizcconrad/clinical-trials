  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis affects a large number
      of individuals, and there is a general lack of consensus in the medical community in terms of
      effective treatments for this problem. By assessing the relative efficacy of transforaminal
      epidural injections of particulate and nonparticulate steroids, this study attempts to
      further define the appropriate conservative management of painful unilateral radiculopathies
      due to unilateral lumbar foraminal stenosis. Patients will be randomized to receive a
      transforaminal epidural injection of either a particulate (Kenalog) or nonparticulate
      (Decadron) steroid. Outcomes will be assessed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months
      following the injection.

          -  Pain symptoms for at least 1 month's duration

          -  Patients deemed appropriate for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections by
             treating spine specialist

          -  Targeted injection level for L4 or L5

             compression secondary to unilateral lumbosacral foraminal or subarticular stenosis
             consistent with clinical history and findings

          -  Lumbar foraminal stenosis severity of grades 1, 2, and 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with multiple symptomatic levels

          -  Patients who are deemed not appropriate to undergo lumbar transforaminal epidural
             steroid injections (e.g., allergy to local anesthetics, radiographic dye contrast,
             patients with high bleeding tendency, pregnancy)

          -  Patients who are unable to answer the questionnaires and perform follow-up visits

             greater trochanteric pain syndrome, knee pain, peripheral vascular disease, or
             peripheral neuropathy) that may confuse clinical picture and impact patients' rating
             and perception of their low back and radicular symptoms

          -  Patients with other spinal pathologies confirmed on imaging that may explain patient's
             pain

          -  Patients who have additional severe foraminal stenosis inferior to the symptomatic
             level (e.g., symptomatic L4 foraminal stenosis with severe L5 foraminal stenosis) will
             not have those levels injected
