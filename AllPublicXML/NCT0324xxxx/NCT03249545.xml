  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC) ablation is performed in certain indications. Generally
      acutely abolition of PVC at the time of ablation accepted as successful ablation. However in
      some patients this effect occurs lately. In this study investigators sought late effect of
      ablation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On tissue level ablation lesion deepens and enlarges by time following the procedure. Based
      on this, investigators aimed to seek patients who has no acute success but late success. This
      phenomenon occurs in some patients. Investigators investigate the characteristics of those
      patients on both procedural and clinical aspects. Investigators enroll patients applied
      during prespecified dates
