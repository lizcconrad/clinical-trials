      This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase III study in approximately 100 sites in the United
      States (US) over seven cycles of use in women aged 18 to 35 years who are at risk of
      pregnancy.

      Through assessments including pelvic examination, laboratory procedures, and medical and
      gynecological history, subjects will be screened for eligibility in order to enroll
      approximately 1350 subjects into the study. After a screening period of up to 60 days,
      enrolled women will receive study drug. Each woman will participate in the study until after
      she has completed treatment during seven study cycles. Women who have individual cycles that
      do not meet the criteria for an evaluable cycle will not have those cycles replaced by
      subsequent cycles in order to provide a total of seven evaluable cycles.

             of the study (with the exception of emergency contraception [EC] in the event a
             subject engages in vaginal intercourse but believes that the study drug was not used
             properly or she is at risk for pregnancy for any other reason).

          9. Be capable of using the study drug properly and agree to comply with all study

             the clinical site at the next study visit.

         10. Be willing to keep a daily electronic diary (eDiary) to record coital information,
             study drug use information, use of concomitant medications including other vaginal
             products and other contraceptives, menses, and sign and symptom data for the subject
             or as reported to her by her partner.

         11. Agree not to participate in any other clinical studies during the course of the study.
