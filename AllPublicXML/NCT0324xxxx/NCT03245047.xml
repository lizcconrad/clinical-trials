  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of malnutrition among the elderly in Asia is high. The objective of this
      randomized, parallel, placebo controlled, double-blind study is to evaluate the effects of
      consuming an adult ONS plus dietary counseling (intervention group) for 180 days on
      nutritional status and unexpected hospital (re)admission, compared with a placebo supplement
      plus dietary counseling (control group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will involve 800 elderly who are at risk of undernutrition
      (MUST score ≥ 1). Participants will be screened for eligibility. Recruitment will be at the
      polyclinic and in the inpatient ward prior to their discharge from the hospital. Participants
      will be randomized to intervention group vs. control group at the baseline visit at the
      clinical trial research unit where baseline measurements and baseline survey using the study
      specific questionnaires will be performed. Participants will be followed up prospectively at
      Day 30, Day 90, Day 180 (exit visit), and Day 360 (post-intervention follow-up visit).
      Repeated measures will be performed at the pre-defined time points. Intention-to-treat
      analysis comparing intervention group vs. control group will be performed to study the effect
      of ONS on primary composite outcome consisting of (i) change in body weight from baseline to
      Day 180 or (ii) unexpected admission to the hospital over 180-day intervention period. The
      effect of ONS on nutritional status will be examined by comparing the biochemical and
      anthropometric measurements of intervention group vs. control group at Day 180. Other
      outcomes such as changes in functional assessment, nutritional knowledge levels, and quality
      of life will also be examined. There will be a follow up visit at Day 360.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel design, multi-center study. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: oral nutritional supplement with dietary counseling group or placebo supplement with dietary counseling group. Randomization will be stratified by MUST malnutrition status (medium risk or high risk) and site of recruitment. All participants, including both recently discharged patients from the hospital or elderly recruited from the polyclinics.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study is double-blinded, i.e., during the study, neither the investigator(s), study and appropriate Abbott Nutrition staff, nor participants will be informed of the identity of any of the study products. Study center personnel will not analyze the contents of the study products or in any way seek to learn the identity of the study products. The investigator should ensure that if it becomes necessary, blinding is broken only in accordance with the protocol.</masking_description>
