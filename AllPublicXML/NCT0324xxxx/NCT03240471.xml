  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fracture (DRF) is a common fracture of which the incidence appears to be
      increasing worldwide. On average, a total of 17% of all diagnosed fractures are DRF's.

      In the Dutch guideline for DRF the treatment advice for DRF, without reduction, is treatment
      with plaster cast or brace for one-three weeks. Despite the advice in the guideline and
      despite several studies from the 90's showing that plaster cast treatment of a stable DRF for
      one week is safe, the usual length of plaster cast treatment for stable DRF is four-six
      weeks. In addition, recent studies have also shown that a long period of immobilization can
      lead to more post traumatic pain by increasing disuse and kinesiophobia.

      This evidence suggests that the usual duration (4-6 weeks) of plaster cast treatment for DRF
      is unnecessary.

      The aim of this feasibility study is to define whether one week of plaster cast treatment is
      possible and can lead to better functional results, with at least the same patient
      satisfaction and complications. In addition, this feasibility study will be used to define
      the sample size of the future RCT.
