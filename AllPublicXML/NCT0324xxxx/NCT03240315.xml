  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3 year longitudinal study to establish a personalized prediction and prevention
      system for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseï¼ˆAECOPD). Data will be
      collected which contained with clinical, pathophysiology, etiology and immunology information
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) patients and analyzed by data mining combined
      with Internet technology.
