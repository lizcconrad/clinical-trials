  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiemetic therapies have improved in recent years, but chemotherapy-induced nausea and
      vomiting (CINV) are still common and are among the most distressing side effects of
      chemotherapy. Aprepitant is commercially available in Canada as capsules. An oral liquid
      aprepitant formulation would be ideal for oral administration to patients unable to swallow
      capsules.
