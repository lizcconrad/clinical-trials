  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than 100,000 Canadians and results in symptoms
      affecting both motor and cognitive (thinking and memory) functions. Parkinson's disease with
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) frequently results in development of dementia for which few
      treatment options exist. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is used to alter activity in
      the outer regions of the brain and has been shown in previous studies to increase cognitive
      performance in patients with different disorders. This study will investigate the
      effectiveness of TMS as a clinical treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with
      Parkinson's disease. 64 male and female participants between the ages of 50 and 90 will
      attend eight study visits over a period of 63 to 66 days. This study is a double-blind
      randomized clinical trial meaning the participant will be assigned by chance to either the
      TMS-treatment group or the Sham-treatment group. Additionally, a combination of memory and
      thinking tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to see if there are
      structural and functional changes within the brain. Genotyping and blood analysis before and
      after treatment for different biomarkers will also be performed and these data will be
      compared to the TMS data. Initially, this research will increase knowledge about the effects
      of TMS on various brain regions. Ultimately, we will be able to determine if TMS can be used
      as a complementary therapy for PD to improve cognitive performance and to reduce progression
      into dementia.
