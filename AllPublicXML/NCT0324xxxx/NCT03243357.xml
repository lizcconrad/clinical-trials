  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the wide variety of mechanized endodontic instrumentation systems, the ideal would
      be that the choose of this system based on the anatomical characteristics of the canal and
      the biological precepts. In teeth with lesions, contaminated dentin should be removed.
      However, in many systems, the manufacturer's approach disregards the fact that in wider root
      canal, instruments used in the apical third small diameter (less than 0.40 mm) may not touch
      the walls at the final apical. Therefore, the establishment of the initial apical file (LAI),
      the first instrument that measures the resistance of the walls in working length, could be a
      criterion in the choice of which system to use, and how many files work within the root
      canals after LAI determination. However, there is a lack of studies that demonstrate that LAI
      determination affects the degree of cleaning achieved, as well as the impact that LAI-based
      instrumentation may have on microcracks formation, canal transportation, postoperative pain
      and quality of obturation.In this way, the investigators propose a study in vivo performed,
      in patients from 8 to 18 years of age, therefore in large root canals. The protocol
      recommended by the manufacturer will be compared by means of a prospective randomized
      clinical trial, with the addition of the XP Endo finisher and with the protocol based on the
      initial apical file evaluating postoperative pain, exacerbation between the sessions, the
      quality of the obturation and periapical radiolucency repair. Considering that currently
      performing endodontic treatments using mechanized instruments is taught in undergraduate
      courses throughout the country, studies of this nature help the execution of a endodontics
      more critical and effective.

      Infected root canal treatments will be performed in two sessions with a TF Adaptive system
      (Protocol recommended by manufacturer (Group Control) vs. Protocol based on the initial
      apical file vs. XP Endo Finisher). The root canals will be completed after 14 days. Patients
      will record postoperative pain during the follow-up period (7 days) using a Visual analogue
      scale (VAS) and the change in periapical radiolucency will be assessed by periapical index
      (PAI) scores.
