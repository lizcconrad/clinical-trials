    <textblock>
      This clinical research study investigates IMA201 which is composed of special immune cells (T
      cells, also called T lymphocytes) being genetically modified by introduction of a
      tumor-antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR) to fight against cancer. Patients that choose to
      take part in this study have advanced cancer where there is no (further) standard treatment
      for their cancer available OR current treatments are not tolerated.

      The main purpose of this clinical research study is to confirm the safety of IMA201 and to
      define the highest safe dose of IMA201 cells to give to patients. The study will also
      investigate what the specific side effects of this treatment are, and to see whether this
      therapy shows clinical activity in patients with their advanced cancer.

      SCREENING: First, the patient will have 2 sets of screening tests to determine eligibility:
      HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening and Main screening. After both screenings are
      completed and if the patient is eligible, blood will be taken for the manufacture of IMA201.

      The HLA screening test will be done by an investigational device. Patients must have the
      HLA-A*02:01 subtype to continue to the Main screening of the study. The Main screening will
      include medical tests and exams, including a tumor biopsy that will be tested for specific
      biomarkers by an investigational device called IMA201_Detect. Patients must be positive for
      at least one of the study's biomarkers to continue onto the leukapheresis part of the study.

      Manufacturing phase: From the patient's blood collected at the leukapheresis, the
      investigators will make the IMA201 TCR-engineered T cells. In order to insert the new gene
      into the patient's T-cells, investigators will use a gene transfer technology. This will be
      done with a lentiviral vector derived from a virus. The vector was made specifically for this
      study and will carry the TCR genes into the T cells.

      TREATMENT: In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators found that giving
      chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in
      the body. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion. The
      chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion in this study will be a combination of cyclophosphamide
      and fludarabine which would be given in the days before the IMA201 T cell infusion. Two days
      after the last chemotherapy dose, the patient will be admitted to the hospital the night
      before the IMA201 infusion. The IMA201 treatment will be given at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

      After IMA201 infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given twice daily for a period of time.

      Since this study involves gene therapy, patients will be monitored throughout the study and
      for up to a total of 15 years.
