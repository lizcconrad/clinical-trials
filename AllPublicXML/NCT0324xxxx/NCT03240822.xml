  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-year, non-randomized, single center, patient self-controlled, clinical trial
      (though enrolled subjects will be followed for life as are all transplant patients) for
      patients seeking allotransplantation of the male external genitalia (MEG), or penile tissue,
      as a feasible reconstructive strategy for the treatment of devastating and irreversible
      injuries to the genitalia. In addition to receiving penile allotransplantation and
      post-operative monitoring and support, enrolled patients will receive an innovative and
      clinically proven immunomodulatory protocol that combines lymphocyte depletion of the
      recipient with donor bone marrow cell infusion. Patients will be treated with lymphocyte
      depleting induction therapy, donor bone marrow cell infusion and tacrolimus. After the first
      year, maintenance immunosuppression will be modified gradually and cautiously (tapered dose
      reduction or spaced frequency dosing of tacrolimus) in selected patients based on a critical
      evaluation of clinical and immunologic outcomes. Outcomes will include but not be limited to
      functional metrics (sensation, erection, voiding), psychosocial (body integrity, adaptation
      to transplant) and health related quality of life (HRQOL) measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial treatment with an antibody targeting recipient immune cells followed by triple-drug
      maintenance therapy represents the current standard in clinical VCA. Our protocol is
      different from the existing conventional drug treatments used in MEG allotransplantation in
      that it combines donor bone marrow infusion with an immunosuppression sparing protocol. The
      primary goal of this pilot clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of using allogeneic
      penile tissue to repair/replace irreversibly damaged external genitalia. Enrolled and
      transplanted subjects will be followed for their lifetime as a transplant patient.
