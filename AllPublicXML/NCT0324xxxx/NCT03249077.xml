  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preparation for the roll out of the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2018,
      Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), a large, integrated health care system, plans to pilot
      the implementation of DPP starting in April 2017. Patients 40 and older at high risk for
      diabetes will be offered DPP online or DPP in-person. A pragmatic, rigorous, quantitative and
      qualitative evaluation will be conducted to compare patients enrolled in DPP (either online
      or in-person) to those not enrolled to better inform future implementation efforts of DPP
      within and outside of KPNW.

    <textblock>
      High rates of obesity and prediabetes among older adults pose a substantial personal and
      societal burden. Among U.S. adults age 60 and older, 35% have obesity and 50% have
      prediabetes, placing them at substantial risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain
      types of cancer, and impaired mobility, as well as significantly elevated health care costs.
      Implementation of a practical and effective diabetes prevention program at the population
      level could have major public health benefits and could also save costs.

      DPP intervention was effective in reducing weight and risk for diabetes among older adults.
      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial conclusively demonstrated that
      participation in an intensive behavioral lifestyle intervention consisting of nutrition,
      physical activity, and behavioral counseling was more effective in reducing the incidence of
      type 2 diabetes and producing clinically significant weight loss than were metformin or
      placebo. Participants on average lost 6.8 kg and more than one-third lost 7% or more of their
      initial weight at one year follow-up. DPP was particularly effective among participants age
      60 and older, in which there was a 71% reduction in the incidence of diabetes compared to 58%
      in the larger sample (mean age of 51).

      Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will cover DPP for Medicare beneficiaries. CMS
      funded YMCA of the USA to test whether DPP could be successfully delivered by non-physician,
      community-based organizations to Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with prediabetes. Among the
      5,696 Medicare beneficiaries who attended four or more sessions, there was a mean weight loss
      of 5.27 kg (~5% loss of initial weight) at one year and an estimated savings of $2,650 for
      each beneficiary enrolled in the pilot over a 15-month period. In addition, a recent study
      demonstrated that DPP delivered using an online program was also effective for Medicare
      beneficiaries, who lost, on average, 7.3% of their initial weight over 26 weeks.

      Based on these findings, Medicare plans to cover DPP delivered in clinical and non-clinical
      settings, including remotely (by web or phone) beginning in 2018. Medicare will reimburse
      organizations that implement the Medicare DPP program, a 12-month program that uses the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approved National Diabetes Prevention
      Program curriculum and consists of 16 core sessions delivered over 16-26 weeks and the option
      of monthly core maintenance sessions over 6 months if the Medicare beneficiary achieves and
      maintains a minimum 5% weight loss of their initial weight.

      Feasibility of implementing DPP on a large scale is still unclear. The YMCA and DPP online
      studies document the success of community-based DPP programs once people are enrolled.
      However, attracting individuals to the DPP and similar lifestyle change interventions remains
      a significant challenge. The scalability of both in-person and online programs is also less
      certain, particularly in the context of a large health care system hoping to offer Medicare
      DPP to potentially tens of thousands of patients. Reach in the YMCA demonstration project
      appeared quite high (82.9%); however, this was calculated as the number of participants
      attending four or more sessions divided by the number of participants who attended at least
      one session. Therefore, only the total number of individuals initially engaged was accounted
      for and not the total number at risk for diabetes in the population. Although effective and
      possibly easy to scale up, the reach of an online DPP program in an older adult population is
      also unknown. Since there was no randomization in the demonstration projects, there is
      potential bias in the weight outcomes and retention rates reported. Furthermore, participant
      motivation for enrolling or continuing participation was not assessed in the previous
      projects and the proposed payment model for Medicare DPP has not been vetted by health care
      systems, both of which could have significant implications for the expansion and
      sustainability of Medicare DPP.

    <description>In the DPP enrolled arm, patients will be offered the opportunity to enroll in DPP online or DPP in-person. Once patients receive the recruitment letter via the electronic health record patient portal, they will be able to sign-up for the DPP online program using a web link or sign-up for the DPP in-person by contacting a staff member in KPNW Health Engagement and Wellness Services who will assist the patient in enrolling. The DPP online program is a CDC-certified translation of the DPP lifestyle intervention delivered in an online small group format of 10-15 participants. DPP in-person participants will attend group sessions of ~20 participants in size at KPNW clinics. The group facilitator will use the CDC National DPP curriculum.</description>

    <description>KPNW offers services to members with prediabetes to reduce their risk of progression to diabetes. Services include a one-time diabetes prevention class, group weight loss classes, and individual nutrition counseling. The Health Engagement and Wellness Services department offers individual phone and in-person counseling (generally one contact), small group programs, and virtual small group webinars. Thus, the not enrolled (usual care) arm is an ideal comparator to determine the effectiveness of DPP beyond services already provided.</description>
