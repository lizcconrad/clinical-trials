  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat breast cancer, one of the most common
      cancers. It causes two side effects very often - hair-loss and numbness. Until recently,
      there have been no known ways to prevent or treat either side effect. Recently, cooling of
      the scalp to prevent hair loss caused by paclitaxel was approved. Our team is developing a
      method to prevent numbness caused by paclitaxel by using a device that cools the arms and the
      legs, while applying mild pressure, and this technique is called cryocompression. As scalp
      cooling use in day-to-day cancer care increases, future studies involving cryocompression to
      treat neuropathy must take this into account, lest patients be denied or are required to
      trade-off one treatment for the other. However, there is concern of causing a reduction in
      core body temperature, which would not be safe or a general intolerance to this treatment.
      Both scalp cooling and limb cryocompression individually have not shown to cause this, but
      simultaneous use has not been studied previously. Clinical safety studies, in healthy
      subjects and cancer patients would need to be conducted to prove this theory, which is being
      proposed by currently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is a key chemotherapeutic agent used in the management of common cancers, such as
      breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) due to paclitaxel is a
      common dose-limiting toxicity with no effective prevention or treatment. Limb cryocompression
      is currently being developed as a method to reduce CIPN. Another common toxicity of
      paclitaxel is chemotherapy induced alopecia (CIA), for which scalp-cooling is currently an
      approved therapy to reduce the incidence of this adverse effect. As scalp cooling use in
      day-to-day clinical practice increases, future studies involving hypothermia to treat
      neuropathy must factor this into the treatment algorithm, lest patients be denied or are
      required to trade-off one treatment for the other. However, there is concern of causing core
      hypothermia and/or general intolerance to concomitant therapy. Both scalp-cooling and
      cryocompression individually have not shown to cause this, but simultaneous use has not been
      studied previously. Clinical safety studies, in healthy subjects and cancer patients would
      need to be conducted first, before larger efficacy studies are performed. We propose that we
      can deliver scalp-cooling and limb cryocompression with a single treatment modality to
      prevent two toxicities of paclitaxel - CIA and CIPN. This study will consist of two parts: A)
      Healthy subjects: To assess safety and tolerability of scalp and limb cryocompression, as
      well as to determine the optimal temperature and pressure to be used, that will contribute to
      the cryocompression protocol. The occurrence of core hypothermia or intolerance will be
      closely monitored B) Cancer patients: Once the optimal cryocompression protocol is
      established in healthy patients, a group of cancer patients will undergo concomitant limb
      cryocompression and scalp cooling over multiple cycles of chemotherapy to establish safety
      and tolerability of repeated therapy. Early clinical efficacy signal data will also be
      collected, to prepare for the subsequent larger randomized efficacy study.
