      from unwanted bad habits, socialization, protection from chronic diseases, and providing an
      active aging period. At the same time it increases the quality of life throughout
      life.Especially in individuals who work in sitting position, the risk of physical activity
      decrease due to intensive working hours, time constraint, social insufficiency is even more
      risk.Therefore, it is aimed to compare sleep quality, job satisfaction, quality of life,
      occupational burnout levels among individuals who do or do not do exercise.
