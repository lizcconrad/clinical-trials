      This phase III trial will establish whether IL-1Ra, with sub-cutaneous (SC) administration
      twice daily for up to 21 days post aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), improves
      clinical outcome as measured by ordinal shift in mRS at 6 months.

      Patients with SAH transferred to a neurosurgical centre will be identified and approached for
      study participation. Following consent, patients will be randomised to receive either IL-1Ra
      or placebo for a maximum of 21 days from onset of symptoms. Patients who are found to be
      non-aneurysmal following randomisation will be withdrawn from the study treatment. Blood
      samples for plasma IL-6 will be obtained prior to randomisation and at day 3-5 post
      randomisation for IL-6 &amp; IL-1 measurement. Safety will be measured at 30 days post
      randomisation and outcome assessed at 6 months post randomisation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with CT positive spontaneous SAH admitted to a participating neurosurgical
             centre where written informed consent can be obtained and study drug can be
             administered within 72 hours of ictus.

          2. No concomitant health problems that, in the opinion of the PI or designee, would
             interfere with participation, administration of study drug or assessment of outcomes
             including safety.

          3. Willing and able to give informed consent or consent available from a patient
             representative for trial inclusion including agreement in principle to receive study
             drug and undergo all study assessments.

          4. Male or female aged 18 years or above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unconfirmed or uncertain diagnosis of spontaneous SAH.

          2. Known active tuberculosis or active hepatitis.

          3. Known active malignancy.

          4. Neutropenia (ANC &lt;1.5 x 109/L ).

          5. Abnormal renal function (creatinine clearance or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate
             (eGFR) &lt; 30 ml/minute) documented in the last 3 months prior to this SAH.

          6. Live vaccinations within the last 10 days of this SAH.

          7. Previous or concurrent treatment with IL-1Ra known at the time of trial entry or
             previous participation in this trial.

             listed in the drug SmPC

          9. Known to have participated in a clinical trial of an investigational agent or device
             in the previous 30 days or 5 half-lives of enrolment (whichever is longer) of ictus,
             or for the period determined by the protocol of the trial / study the patient has
             taken part in.

             patient is not pregnant

         11. Clinically significant serious concurrent medical condition, pre morbid illnesses, or
             concurrent serious infection, at the PI's (or designee's) discretion, which could
             affect the safety or tolerability of the intervention.

         12. Known allergy to IL-1Ra or any of the excipients listed in the drug SmPC
