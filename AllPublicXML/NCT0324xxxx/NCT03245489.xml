    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if anti-platelet therapy combined with anti-PD-1
      immunotherapy can cause a more favorable immunologic response thatn with immunotherapy alone
      in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

    <measure>Effect of Pembro + antiplatelet on major cellular parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immunologic response profile will be measured by changes in major cellular parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pheotyped by flow cytometry for MDSCs, T and B cell activation markers and polyclonal IFNy-production by CD4 and CD8 response after P/I stimulation) in pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab + antiplatelet therapy. Markers will be measured at baseline, end of the first regimen and end of the second regimen. Changes in cellular parameters from the previous timepoint will be evaluated using a repeated measures ANOVA model. Cellular parameters will be evaluated in aggregate to report the immunologic response.</description>

    <measure>Effect of Pembro + antiplatelets on immunologic markers</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immunologic markers will be measured in patients who have been treated with two cycles of pembrolizumab alone and who are pembrolizumab naive. Markers will be evaluated by looking at phyenotyping by flow cytometry and changes of 65-panel systemic cytokines and chemokine levels. Markers will be measured at baseline, end of the first regimen and end of the second regimen. Changes to markers will be reported in aggregate to show the overall immunologic effect of the combination of pembrolizumab + Anti-platelets in patients.</description>

          4. Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          5. Subject has measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Tumor lesions situated in

             demonstrated in such lesions.

          6. Subject has an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2

          7. Subject has estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months.
