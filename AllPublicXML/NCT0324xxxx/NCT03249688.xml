  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the multifactorial etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), multimodal interventions
      targeting several risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously are most likely to be
      effective for preventing dementia. Multimodal lifestyle interventions have so far been tested
      in at-risk older adults from the general population, but not in patients with prodromal AD.

      The main aim of the MIND-ADmini pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of a multimodal
      lifestyle intervention among individuals with prodromal AD.

      This 6-month pilot trial is planned to include 150 participants randomized into 3 arms:

        1. Control (regular health advice)

        2. Multidomain lifestyle intervention (nutritional guidance, exercise, cognitive training
           and monitoring and management of vascular and metabolic risk factors)

        3. Multidomain lifestyle intervention + medical food. The multidomain lifestyle
           intervention is adapted from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent
           Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER, NCT01041989). The medical food product
           includes the specific multi-nutrient combination Fortasyn Connect (containing the
           omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), uridine
           monophosphate, choline, vitamins B12, B6, C, E, and folic acid, phospholipids, and
           selenium). The rationale for combining a multidomain lifestyle intervention with medical
           food is evidence indicating synergistic effects between different intervention
           components (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids and physical activity). Nutrient deficiencies have
           been described in AD, and medical food may be needed in addition to dietary guidance for
           optimal effect. The use of Fortasyn Connect alone in prodromal AD has been investigated
           in another clinical trial (www.lipididiet.eu), and thus this arm is not included in
           MIND-ADmini.

      The 6-month MIND-ADmini pilot trial will be conducted in Sweden, Finland, Germany and France.
      An additional 6-month optional extension of the pilot trial will also be considered.

      Primary outcome is feasibility of the multimodal intervention. Secondary outcomes include
      adherence to intervention components (intervention arms), and adherence to healthy lifestyle
      changes (all arms). Detailed cognitive assessments (Neuropsychological Test Battery, NTB) and
      functional assessments (Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR; and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative
      Study-Activities of Daily Living, ADCS-ADL) will also be conducted at baseline and 6-month
      visit for the purpose of obtaining reliable estimates of change over time for power
      calculations for a future larger multimodal intervention trial (MIND-ADmaxi).

        Fluency ≤ 16 (60 sec.)

          -  Evidence for underlying AD pathology within 1 year prior to screening by either:

               1. CSF beta amyloid 1-42/1-40x10 ratio&lt;1 and/or elevated T-tau and/or elevated
                  phospho-tau and/or low beta amyloid 42 based on local lab cut-offs OR

               2. MRI evidence for medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA score 1 or higher) OR

               3. Abnormal FDG PET and/or PiB PET compatible with AD type change

                  B) Potential for lifestyle improvement, defined according to a Lifestyle Index.

                  Lifestyle index. Participants with a score of 3 or above are included in the
                  study.

                  The lifestyle index identifies individuals who do not already have very healthy
                  lifestyles, and thus have a margin for improving their lifestyle based on the
                  MIND-AD intervention. The score is calculated by adding 1 point for each of the
                  following factors:

          -  Physical activity less than 2.5 hours a week (defined as physical activity intensive
             enough to lead to sweating and some breathlessness)

          -  Diet - less than 5 portions of fruits and vegetables per day

          -  Diet - less than 2 portions of fish per week

          -  Hypertension (diagnosed by physician or current antihypertensive treatment or

          -  SBP&gt;140mmHg or DBP&gt;90 mmHg)

          -  Diabetes (type 1 or 2 diagnosed by physician; or current diabetes medication; or
             recorded elevated fasting blood glucose or HbA1C as per local guidelines within the
             past 6 months)

          -  Ongoing symptoms of sleep problems, depressive symptoms or psychological stress
             symptoms for at least 1 month, judged by the clinician as having some impact on
             everyday life

        C) Age 60-80 D) MMSE ≥ 24 E) Availability of a responsible study partner. F) Written
        informed consent from participant as well as study partner G) Putative prescription
        cognitive enhancers (e.g. ginkgo, cholinesterase inhibitors) and statins are not excluded
        but the dosage should be stable prior to randomization. Doses should be kept stable during
        the study if possible.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Dementia according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
             Edition (DSM-IV)

             white matter changes (Fazekas scale for white matter lesions classification of 2 or
             below) and up to 1-2 lacunar infarcts which are judged to be clinically insignificant
             are allowed

          -  Severe loss of vision or communicative ability

          -  Conditions preventing cooperation as judged by the study physician
