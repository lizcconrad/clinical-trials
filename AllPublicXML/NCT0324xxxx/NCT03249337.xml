  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In brief, the objective of this study is to investigate whether the drug Glanatec ® which is
      approved in Japan for glaucoma and ocular hypertension, can be used in patients with Fuchs
      endothelial dystrophy who have had a descemet stripping procedure without endothelial
      keratoplasty. While some limited data exists as a proof of concept in in vitro or animal
      studies, and Glanatec® has been successfully used in a recently published case series for
      this indication, there is insufficient data to show that this drug can be effectively used
      for corneal cell clearing while maintaining patient safety.

      The goal of the study is to provide sufficient proof of concept for the use of this drug in
      patients with FED whose only treatment alternative is to undergo corneal transplant.
