  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at measuring the activity of natural killer (NK) cells using the in
      vitro diagnostic device NK Vue in subjects being screened for prostate cancer using prostate
      biopsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NK Vue diagnostic test for natural killer cell activity uses the principle of stimulation
      of whole blood with a proprietary cytokine followed by the quantitative detection of
      interferon-gamma using an immunoassay. NK Vue is intended to be used for the monitoring of
      the immune status of individuals. Measurement of NK cell activity could be a useful tool for
      assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or diseases where NK cell
      activity has been shown to be affected.

    <measure>The ability of NK cell activity to predict prostate cancer (yes/no) on biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>NK cell activity is measured up to 8 weeks prior to biopsy and prior to starting any antibiotic treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Test performance of NK Vue will be assessed by logistic regression, both unadjusted and adjusted for the effects of at least PSA, age, digital rectal examination, and family history</description>

    <measure>The ability of NK cell activity to predict tumor grade (Gleason 2-6 vs. no cancer; Gleason 7-10 vs. no cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>NK cell activity is measured up to 8 weeks prior to biopsy and prior to starting any antibiotic treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Test performance of NK Vue will be assessed by multinomial logistic regression, using the following known predictors of prostate cancer: age, ethnicity, PSA history, family history of prostate cancer, prostate volume, digital rectal examination findings, and number of prior biopsies.</description>

    <time_frame>NK cell activity is measured up to 8 weeks prior to biopsy and prior to starting any antibiotic treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the detection of prostate cancer, will be calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis (at a cut-off of 4 ng/mL for PSA and at a cut-off of 200 pg/mL for NK Vue). Other cut-offs may be used to perform additional statistical analyses for test performance.</description>

    <measure>Impact of combination of NK Vue and PSA on the test performance of PSA</measure>
    <time_frame>NK cell activity is measured up to 8 weeks prior to biopsy and prior to starting any antibiotic treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the detection of prostate cancer, will be calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis under combined conditions.</description>

             rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, Lupus or any connective tissue
             condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect the immune response
