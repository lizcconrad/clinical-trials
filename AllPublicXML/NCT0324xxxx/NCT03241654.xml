    <textblock>
      In mechanically ventilated patients during supine position, alveolar collapse usually
      distributes in dependent lung region. High positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been
      applied to improve the homogeneous distribution of ventilation by increasing the end
      expiratory lung ventilation (EELV) and alveolar recruitment. However, for patients who
      increasing PEEP in some extent still existed poor aeration in the dependent region, further
      elevating PEEP seems to be unreasonable that perhaps lead to overdistension. Decreasing
      trigger sensitivity might further evoke inspiratory efforts to improve the ventilation for
      this type of patients.The Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was applied in monitoring the
      regional ventilation distribution at the bedside.
