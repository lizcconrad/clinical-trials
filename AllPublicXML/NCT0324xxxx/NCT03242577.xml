  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, exploratory comparative pilot study to identify the most appropriate
      method for microbial consortia sampling from the skin.

      Ten subjects are expected to complete the study at one investigative site in the United
      States.

      The study will consist of 2 visits, Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Sampling). At Visit 1,
      subjects will be consented and have their eligibility reviewed. Visit 1 and Visit 2 may be
      combined into one visit. Visit 1 will involve the informed consent process, screening, and
      enrollment. Visit 2 will involve sampling of eight (8) test sites on the back with three (3)
      different sampling methods: swabbing (2 sites/method), cup scrub (2 sites/method), and tape
      stripping (4 sites/method). All samples will be returned to Kimberly Clark then sent to a
      laboratory for analysis.
