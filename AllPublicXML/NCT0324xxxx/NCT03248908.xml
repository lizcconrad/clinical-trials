  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this double blinded randomized controlled study, the pupillary dilation reflex is used for
      as a nociceptive indicator for opioid administration during elective surgery under general
      anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An infrared camera of the video pupillometer measures the pupillary dilation reflex (PDR) in
      response of a nociceptive stimulus. This autonomic reflex, parasympathetic mediated in
      sedated patients, can be generated by various pain stimuli (built in standardized protocol,
      surgical incision, â€¦) The PDR is a robust reflex, even in patients under general anesthesia,
      and provides a potential evaluation of the autonomous circuit within the nociceptive
      evaluation based on pupil dilation upon A-delta and C fibers in both electrical or mechanic
      stimulation. This double blind randomized controlled trial involving American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-III patients undergoing elective surgery under
      general anesthesia are recruited. Enrolled patients are randomized in four groups: (1)
      remifentanil administration depending on PDR results, (2) remifentanil administration
      depending on decision attending anesthesiologist, (3) sufentanil administration depending on
      PDR results, (4) sufentanil administration depending on decision attending anesthesiologist.
