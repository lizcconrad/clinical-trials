      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a transcranial
      magnetic stimulation device for treatment-resistant depression. In this open label study, all
      participants will receive accelerated theta-burst stimulation.

    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technology as therapy
      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      very successful in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the
      duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently,
      researchers have aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment
      times with some preliminary success. This study intends to further modify the parameters to
      create a more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in neuroimaging biomarkers.

    <description>All participants will receive 1800 stimuli of iTBS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) to the left DLPFC per session. The L-DLPFC will be targeted utilizing the Localite neuronavigation system. Stimulation intensity will be standardized at 80% of resting motor threshold adjust to the skull to cortical surface distance.
Sessions will be delivered using the MagPRo stimulator, with 3-pulse 50Hz bursts given every 200ms (at 5Hz). In the intermittent TBS, a 2s train of bursts will be given every 10s for a total of 570s (1800 pulses).</description>
