  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether fasting and post-prandial glucagon secretion is
      suppressed by gliclazide in patients with HNF1-/4-alpha MODY. Participants will undergo an
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after omitting their gliclazide medication for
      3 days.
