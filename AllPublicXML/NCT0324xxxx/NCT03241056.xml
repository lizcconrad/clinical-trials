  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small (N = 24) pilot study developed a new and brief cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)
      module for checking symptoms (CBT-C) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). CBT-C targets
      maladaptive beliefs about memory and results show that it is effective at significantly
      decreasing checking symptoms as compared to a waitlist control. The objectives of the current
      investigation are to further investigate CBT-C by (1) replicating the pilot results in a
      larger sample; (2) using an active control condition (treatment as usual) as the comparison
      condition (3) including a 6-month follow-up, and (4) determining whether the association
      between maladaptive beliefs about memory at pre-treatment assessment are related to degree of
      checking symptom reduction following CBT-C. The findings of the study will have theoretical
      significance in adding to our understanding of the maladaptive belief domains relevant to the
      development and maintenance of OCD and supporting the cognitive model of compulsive checking.
      The relevant clinical significance is the further development of an intervention that could
      improve outcomes in treatment of persons with OCD. The key practical outcome of the research
      would be to add a stepped care offering to patients with OCD.

    <description>The novel intervention is a manualized 2-session cognitive behavioural therapy. Agenda elements, including psycho-education, discussion prompts, and homework exercises are standardized across participants. In session 1, participants are taught about the cognitive theory of checking, the research support behind this theory, and how it may apply to their own checking behavior. A homework exercise is introduced and practiced to test out this theory. In session 2, the homework results are reviewed. Further education is shared on the nature of memory and the relationship to checking, and a discussion regarding how this applies to the participant's checking then takes place. A second homework exercise is introduced to test this theory.</description>

    <description>Treatment as Usual (TAU) during patients' time on our waitlist in our clinic will depend on at what point they have been recruited. It may consist of a 2-session group psychoeducational intervention on anxiety, any medications prescribed by their referring physicians, and/or independent therapy/counseling they may be seeking on the side. TAU for community participants will include any treatments they are currently seeking. Information about participation in such interventions will be collected during the course of the study (at each assessment visit) in order to accurately characterize participants' TAU in the current study.</description>
