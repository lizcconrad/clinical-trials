    <textblock>
      Study is an interventional clinical trial. Pregnant women (aged 25-40 years) diagnosed with
      GDM (by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks' gestation) will be recruited
      conveniently from Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic at the Jordan University Hospital and
      National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics, Amman, Jordan. A sample of 180
      pregnant women with GDM (60 women who do not use insulin and hypoglycemia medications, 60
      women who are treated with metformin, 60 women who are treated with insulin), who will meet
      the inclusion criteria and will be agreed to participate will be centrally randomized to
      follow carbohydrate counting dietary intervention, carbohydrate counting and DASH dietary
      intervention, and control dietary intervention.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the effect of carbohydrate counting,
      carbohydrate counting and DASH diet dietary interventions and a general dietary intervention
      on glycemic control, maternal and neonatal outcomes among Jordanian pregnant women with GDM.
      Eligibility criteria to be enrolled in the study will be being Jordanian pregnant women with
      GDM at 24 -28 gestational weeks, aged between 25 to 40 with no-personal history of type 1 or
      2 diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose, or chronic diseases and singleton gestation. DASH
      diet; and the third group will follow the diet prescribed by the hospital for GDM. The
      duration of intervention will extend from 24-28 gestational weeks until delivery, which will
      be usually 12-14 weeks later. The glycemic controls outcomes are testing fasting blood
      glucose, HbA1C, insulin and fructosamine at baseline and at end of intervention for three
      dietary interventions. While maternal outcomes are total maternal weight gain (kg), need for
      emergency caesarean section, the presence or absence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and
      preeclampsia. The new born birth weight, length and head circumference, the presence or
      absence of hypoglycemia and shoulder dystocia are the newborn outcomes.

    <description>Carbohydrate counting diet will be prepared according to Kulkarni, (2005). Tailored diet plans according to patient's food preference, physical activity level and appropriate insulin: Carbohydrates ratio will be prescribed for each participants. Diets were based on each participants's recommended intakes of energy, protein (15-25%), fat (30-40%) and carbohydrate (40-50%) (Thomas and Gutierrez, 2005; Kleinwechter et al., 2014). Energy requirement will be determined in the participants' pre-pregnancy weight with adding the extra requirement (450 kcal) due to pregnancy. The carbohydrate counts will be distributed into three main meals and 3 snacks.</description>

    <description>The recommended intakes of energy, protein (15-25%), fat (30-40%) and carbohydrate (40-50%) will be similar to that in carbohydrate counting diet which mentioned above. DASH diet food choices will be inserted in the diet of the participants assigned for the combined diet of DASH and carbohydrate counting. The emphasis will be more on the fruits and vegetables group (&gt;8 servings/day), whole grains (at least half of the amount of the total servings of cereals; 6-8 servings/day), fat free dairy products (2-3 servings/day), lean meat and plant proteins (0-2 servings/day) and nuts (5-7 servings/week). From the fat group olive oil will represent the main type of fat (20-25% of total fat %). Adequate intake of sodium (2000mg) will be applied into participants' diet.</description>
