    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the amount and timing of when certain Fermentable
      Oligo-Di-Monosaccharides and Polyols (FODMAPs), specifically fructose, can be safely
      reintroduced into the diet of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients that have successfully
      completed a low-FODMAP elimination diet. The FODMAP diet is an effective treatment for IBS;
      however it is unclear how patients can successfully reintroduce and liberalize fructose into
      their diet. The low FODMAP diet is thought to reduce IBS symptoms by decreasing water content
      and gas production in the bowel and also possibly by altering gut bacteria. Although use of
      the FODMAP elimination diet can initially successfully treat IBS symptoms for up to 50-75% of
      patients, the reintroduction diet is difficult for patients to complete and maintain for long
      periods of time because current methods for reintroduction of FODMAPs are imprecise leading
      to frequent recurrent symptoms. As a result, patients often continue the low FODMAP
      elimination diet for additional months because they have difficulties knowing how to add back
      Protocol ID:IRB#16-000934 UCLA IRB Approved Approval Date: 2/22/2017 Through: 9/20/2017
      Committee: Medical IRB 1 FODMAPs into their diet. There are no studies to date to help guide
      patients with FODMAP reintroduction. For example, in the case of reintroducing fructose,
      patients currently are currently instructed to add back honey into their diet over a 3-day
      period using honey in 1- 3tsp doses (equivalent roughly to 2.86-8.6 grams of fructose).
      However, honey is a sweetener made of both fructose and glucose and it is unclear whether
      recurrent IBS symptoms are related to the concentration of fructose or the concentration of
      fructose that is in relative excess to glucose. These types of confounding problems make it
      difficult to generalize dietary reintroduction. The three study groups (i.e. fructose,
      glucose, fructose/glucose) in this study are designed to determine if and how fructose leads
      to recurrent IBS symptoms during the reintroduction diet. The fructose group will help to
      determine whether an absolute amount of fructose will lead to IBS symptoms. Based on the
      principals of the diet, we hypothesize IBS patients have lower thresholds for fructose
      tolerance.

      The glucose group will serve as a control since glucose is not a FODMAP and as a result is
      not expected to lead to recurrent symptoms. The glucose/fructose mixture group is a cross
      comparison group that will determine whether the relative excess fructose concentration is an
      important cause of IBS symptoms. Fructose absorption in the gut is dependent on glucose
      intake as fructose is transported with glucose from inside the gut into the body. Current
      studies suggest that fructose intolerance in healthy controls is highly dependent on the
      ratio of excess fructose to glucose.

      The fructose/glucose treatment group is designed to investigate this potential relationship.

    <description>Food may be linked to changes in motility, visceral sensation, gut microbiome, intestinal permeability, immune activation and brain-gut axis. This study will focus on fructose, which is one of the main components of FODMAP (Fermentable oligosaccharides, dissacharides, mono-saccharides and polyols) foods. Fructose is a common part of the Western diet and can be consumed as a free monosaccharide, part of sucrose, or in polymers referred to as fructans. FODMAP foods are thought to induce gastrointestinal symptoms including gas, bloating, abdominal pain or discomfort, and loose stools by increasing small bowel water content and increasing gas production by fermentation of foods by gut bacteria. Studies including a recent controlled clinical trial demonstrated that a low FODMAP diet can be an effective nutritional therapy.</description>
