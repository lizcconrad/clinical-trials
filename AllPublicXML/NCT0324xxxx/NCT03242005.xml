          -  Currently using a body-worn patch insulin infusion pump, e.g. Omnipod or V-Go

          -  Currently using the Medtronic Model 670G pump and associated CGM

          -  Current or past participation in previous BD Study DBC-16SCARL21

          -  History of bleeding disorder or easy bruising.

          -  Currently taking anti-platelet therapy or anticoagulants (use of up to 81 mg per day
             of aspirin is permitted).

          -  Known blood borne infections.

          -  History of recurrent dermatological condition or skin disorder (e.g. psoriasis,
             eczema, pre-existing dermatitis).

          -  Skin abnormalities, anomalies or conditions (e.g. sunburn, tattoos, extensive
             scarring, lipohypertrophy) located at or very close to the intended insertion site.

          -  Physical condition that restricts dexterity and may limit ability to perform study
             procedures (i.e. severe neuropathy or arthritis of the hands; self-reported)

          -  Currently participating in any other clinical investigation that conflicts with this
             study

          -  Employed by, or currently serving as a contractor or consultant to BD, Medtronic or
             study site
