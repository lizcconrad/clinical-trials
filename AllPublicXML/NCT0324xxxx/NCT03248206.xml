  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research work, the concept of strengthening technique of proprioceptive neuromuscular
      facilitation (PNF) incorporated with tendon gliding exercise (TGE) will be used to improve
      neuromuscular function of upper extremity of patients with diabetes mellitus. The first
      specific aim of the study is to examine the effects of home-based PNF exercise on the motor,
      sensation and functional performance parameters of upper extremity of the patients with
      diabetes mellitus. In addition, whether adding a tendon gliding exercise (TGE) to the
      home-based PNF exercises can provide better treatment effects for the patients with diabetes
      mellitus will also been investigated in this study. One of the hypothesis of this study is
      the prescribing home-based PNF exercise program has a positive treatment effect on
      neuromuscular function of the upper extremity of patients with diabetes mellitus. And,the
      other is home-based PNF in conjunction with TGE provides better benefits for neuromuscular
      function of the upper extremity of patients with diabetes mellitus.
