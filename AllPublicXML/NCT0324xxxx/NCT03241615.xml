  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between dysphagia symptom severity
      and quality of life of the patients with neurogenic dysphagia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dysphagia related quality of life and perceived dysphagia symptom severity by patients
      will be used as a complementary information on oropharyngeal dysphagia. Thus, the aim of the
      study is to investigate the relationship between dysphagia symptom severity and quality of
      life of the patients with neurogenic dysphagia.
