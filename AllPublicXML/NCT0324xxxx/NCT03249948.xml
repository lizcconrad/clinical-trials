  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in resuscitation efforts, there are some patients who remain in
      refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Double
      sequential external defibrillation (DSED) and vector change defibrillation have been proposed
      as a viable option for patients in refractory VF. This pilot cluster randomized trial will
      compare (1) continued resuscitation using standard defibrillation; (2) resuscitation
      involving DSED; or (3) resuscitation involving vector change defibrillation, in patients
      presenting with refractory VF during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The results of this
      pilot study will provide critical data for planning a larger, adequately powered multi-site
      randomized controlled trial to clinically evaluate DSED and vector change defibrillation
      compared to standard therapy for patients in refractory VF.

    <textblock>
      Double sequential external defibrillation (DSED) and vector change defibrillation have been
      proposed as viable options for patients in refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, currently there is insufficient evidence to support
      a widespread implementation of this therapy. As such, a well-designed randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) employing a standardized approach to alternative defibrillation strategies early
      in the treatment of refractory VF is required to determine whether these treatments may
      impact clinical outcomes. This pilot cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the
      regions of Peel, Halton and the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada over a one year period of
      time. All adult (≥ 18 years) patients presenting in refractory VF (defined as patients
      presenting in VF and remaining in VF after three consecutive standard defibrillation attempts
      each separated by 2 minutes of CPR) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac
      etiology will be assigned to be treated by one of three strategies: (1) continued
      resuscitation using standard defibrillation; (2) resuscitation involving DSED (two
      defibrillators, one using anterior-posterior pad placement and the second using anterior-
      anterior pad placement delivering two rapid sequential shocks for all subsequent
      defibrillation attempts, ± antiarrythmic use and epinephrine as per current provincial
      standard); or (3) resuscitation involving vector change (change of defibrillation pads from
      anterior-anterior to an anterior-posterior pad position) defibrillation. The cluster units
      will be defined by emergency medical service (EMS) agency and each cluster will crossover at
      three times during the trial so that each agency will spend 4 months in each arm of the
      study. Outcomes of interest will include return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC),
      termination of VF after the first interventional shock, termination of VF inclusive of all
      interventional shocks, and number of defibrillation attempts to obtain ROSC. The primary
      objectives of the pilot study are to determine the feasibility and required sample size of a
      full-scale RCT in this population.
