    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the best method to detect colorectal cancer and colonic polyps. Studies showed
      that adenoma detection rate positive correlation with good bowel preparation which makes
      bowel preparation an important issue. Hence, investigators conduct a clinical trial about
      adding another laxative agent to morning single dose low-volume PEG. To see if this new
      regimen could have non-inferior efficacy and lower life/sleep impact compared with standard
      regimen.

      Colorectal cancer incidence rate has increased in recently years, and colorectal cancer has
      come to the top of cancer incidence ranking of Taiwan. Colonoscopy is the best method to
      detect colorectal cancer and colonic polyps. Studies showed that adenoma detection rate
      positive correlation with good bowel preparation. That makes bowel preparation an important
      issue. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) is widely used for bowel preparation for it efficacy and
      safety. However, there are many different adjunctive, dose, timing of administration in PEG
      preparation. Some may decrease patient tolerability due to large fluid volume, and some may
      influence patient's life and sleep quality when performing bowel preparation. Here,
      investigators conduct a clinical trial about adding another laxative agent to morning single
      dose low-volume PEG. To see if this new regimen could have non-inferior efficacy and lower
      life/sleep impact compared with standard regimen.
