  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to quantitatively assess the sucking and feeding activity of
      infants at high risk of neurological impairment (preterm infants and term infants with
      hypoxic ischemic injury) during oral sucking and feeding and correlate it with their
      underlying neurological impairment for the early diagnosis of brain injury.

    <textblock>
      This research will address the current lack of objective tools for the reliable assessment of
      oral sucking and feeding in clinical practice, and the insufficient evidence that relates
      early measures of abnormal sucking activity with the underlying neurological impairment.

      The study includes three groups of infants: (i) group A consisting of preterm infants
      (gestational age of &lt;37 weeks), (ii) group B consisting of term infants admitted to the
      Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) for therapeutic
      hypothermia who are at risk of developing hypoxic ischemic injury (HIE); have concerns for
      neonatal stroke, and have seizures of unknown etiology and (iii) group C consisting of
      healthy term infants in the community and term infants admitted to the NICU who had an
      initial uncomplicated postnatal course that will serve as the control group. In group A,
      infants will be further classified as not having a brain lesion in their anatomical MRI scan
      (group A1) or having a brain lesion in their MRI (group A2).

      This is a non-interventional study on infants at high-risk for neurological impairment. The
      sucking data for groups A, B and C (if inpatient) will be gathered repeatedly over their stay
      at BCH, and neuroimaging data will be collected prior to their discharge. For group C,
      neuroimaging data will be gathered over the course of a single visit if recruited from the
      community.

    <description>Group A will consist of preterm infants born &lt; 37 weeks gestational age. Subjects will be further classified as not having or having a brain lesion on MRI scan. Non-nutritive and nutritive sucking will be assessed using an FDA-approved device (Nfant Feeding Solution) to measure sucking activity. In addition, EEG and EMG data will be collected while the infant is at rest during one of the first and one of the last sucking sessions using the WaveGuard (TM) EEG cap. An anatomical and resting-state fMRI/DTI scan will also be conducted to estimate structural connectivity during sleep following a sucking session and simultaneous resting-state MEG/EEG data will be recorded from the infant during sleep with the BabyMEG.</description>

    <description>Term infants recruited from the community will be observed during a single visit to BCH. If inpatient, recordings will be taken for the duration of the hospital stay. Non-nutritive and nutritive sucking will be assessed using an FDA-approved device (Nfant Feeding Solution) to measure sucking activity.

    <description>The study will record the sucking activity of the hospitalized infants over time, from their first oral sucking session including non-nutritive and nutritive sucking, until discharge, using an FDA-approved device that equips a typical bottle and nipple commonly used in the NICU with a non-invasive sensor to measure sucking activity. Each infant's nutritive and non-nutritive sucking patterns will be measured, and will comprise the 'sucking session' conducted with the bottle sensor.</description>
