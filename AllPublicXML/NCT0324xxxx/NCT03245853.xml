    <textblock>
      Subjects with a diagnosis of progressive keratoconus will be evaluated for suitability as a
      candidate for Corneal Crosslinking (CXL). Subjects that as candidates for CXL will be asked
      to participate in this study and will undergo the required screening procedures to determine
      study eligibility. Informed consent will be obtained from each subject before performance of
      any required any required study procedures that are not part of the investigator's routine
      examination. All Subjects will be evaluated at screening/baseline, Day 0 (treatment day),
      then 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after treatment. Pentacam measurements and
      measurements of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity will be obtained and baseline and at
      appropriate times after the epithelium-on CXL procedure. Safety monitoring throughout the
      study will include observations at appropriate times for adverse events, clinically
      significant findings on ophthalmic examination, and slit-lamp examination.

      The primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline over time in maximum keratometry
      (K-Max). Addition analyses for efficacy will include uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and
      best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

    <description>Photrexa (riboflavin 5'-phosphate ophthalmic solution) 0.146%, is a yellow sterile buffered solution containing 1.46 mg/mL riboflavin 5'-phosphate, The pH of the solution is approximately 7.1 and the osmolarity is 157-177 mOsm/kg. Each 1 mL of the solution contains 1.53 mg of riboflavin 5'-phosphate sodium (equivilant to 1.20 mg [0.12%] riboflavin). Riboflavin 5'-phosphate sodium USP is a mixture of the sodium salts of riboflavin, riboflavin monophosphates, and riboflavin diphosphates. The inactive ingredients are dibasic sodium phosphate, monbasic sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, and water for injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  12 to 40 years of age, having a diagnosis of keratoconus, signed written informed
             consent, willingness and ability to comply with schedule for follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye(s) to be treated
             that may predispose the eye for future complications (herpes simplex/zoster, recurrent
             corneal erosion syndrome, corneal melt, corneal dystrophy, etc.) Pregnancy, intent to
             become pregnant, or lactation during study. Corneal pachymetry &lt;350 microns at the
             thinnest point measured by Pentacam in the eye(s) to be treated.

        Nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent steady gaze. Other systemic condition
        that in the investigator's opinion would not allow the patient to be a good candidate for
        the study.
