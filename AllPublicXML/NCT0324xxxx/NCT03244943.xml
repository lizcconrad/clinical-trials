  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: This study evaluated the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on the
      cytokine profile and the correlation to clinical parameters of patients undergoing
      chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      Materials and methods: 40 patients were allocated: Chronic periodontitis patients (PC) (n=20)
      and breast cancer with chronic periodontitis patients (CAN/PC) (n=20). The clinical
      parameters: probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival
      index (GI) and levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β, IL-17, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in
      gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were evaluated at baseline, 45 and 180 days after therapy.

      The NSPT, which consisted of subgingival debridement - scaling and root planning (SRP) under
      local anesthesia. On average, the treatment of the entire oral cavity was completed within
      four sessions (sessions of 50 minutes). The SRP was performed by one experienced periodontist
      (KRVV) using Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy MFG. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), ultra-sonic devices
      (Bob-Cat, Dentsply/Cavitron, Long Island City, NY, USA) and, if necessary, with
      multilaminated drills.
