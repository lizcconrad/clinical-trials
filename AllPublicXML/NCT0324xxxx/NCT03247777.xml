  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amateur female golfers were randomized to either a functional weight lifting group or a
      traditional weight lift group. Testing, consisting of performance measures and golf measures,
      was performed at baseline and after 10 weeks of weight lifting.

    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial to compare the effects of 10 weeks of two different types of
      training in recreationally active female golfers was performed. Participants were recruited
      through postings at local country clubs and public golf courses, as well as through emails to
      state and local women's golf associations. Following written informed consent approved by the
      university's institutional review board, participants completed a medical and golf history
      questionnaire. Golf-specific information gathered via the history form included self-reported
      number of years playing golf, handicap, frequency of play, frequency of practice. Baseline
      testing followed, consisting of measurement of height and weight using a stadiometer, bone
      density and body composition using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 7-iron and driver
      club speed and total ball distance using a golf simulator (High Definition Golf, Interactive
      Sports Technologies, Vaughan, Ontario), and physical performance tests. Participants were
      then randomly assigned, using a random number generator, to either a traditional resistance
      training group (TRAD) or a golf-specific resistance training group (GSRT). Resistance
      training was conducted 3 days per week for 10 weeks. Each training session was directly
      supervised by at least one of the researchers, such that correct technique and appropriate
      resistance could be monitored. Following the 10 weeks of training, participants repeated the
      testing procedures under similar conditions as baseline testing.
