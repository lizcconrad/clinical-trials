  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will vary the proportions of high- and low-energy-dense
      foods served to preschool children at all meals and snacks during three 5-day periods. In the
      three experimental conditions, the same foods will be served; only the amounts and
      proportions of foods will be varied. In the Baseline condition, typical proportions of
      age-appropriate foods will be served. In the Addition condition, the portion sizes of
      low-energy-dense foods will be increased, and in the Substitution condition, the portions of
      low-energy-dense foods will be increased by replacing an equivalent amount of foods higher in
      energy density. The primary aim is to determine the effect on children's energy intake of
      varying the proportion of low- and high-energy-dense foods served, either by addition or
      substitution, over 5 days. It is hypothesized that children will consume less energy when
      they are served meals in which low-energy-dense foods are substituted for foods higher in
      energy density over 5 days and that children will consume more energy when served meals to
      which low-energy-dense foods are added. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that daily
      energy intake in the three conditions will begin to converge across the 5-day period.
