  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial will be conducted in high schools in North Carolina and New York
      City to determine the impact of a school-based, positive youth development program on both
      sexual behaviors associated with teen pregnancy and education outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the Peer Group
      Connection program's impact on sexual behaviors associated with teen pregnancy, as well as
      education outcomes. Peer Group Connection (PGC) is a school-based, group peer mentoring
      program for ninth grade students that is designed to facilitate the transition into high
      school and improve non-cognitive abilities, student engagement, and educational outcomes. The
      study enrolls students from high schools that serve large populations of economically
      disadvantaged and minority students in communities with high teenage birth rates. In North
      Carolina, the study is being implemented in schools serving rural populations, and in New
      York City, schools serving largely Hispanic and other minority populations are targeted.

      As part of the PGC program, ninth-grade participants attend weekly group outreach sessions
      led by older peer leaders. Outreach sessions occur during regularly scheduled classes
      (participants are pulled from their classes to attend). They include hands-on activities,
      simulations, and discussions intended to build group cohesion and to improve the
      decision-making skills of group members. A minimum of 18, 45-minute outreach sessions are
      expected to be offered to PGC participants during the course of their ninth-grade year.
      Although PGC is not explicitly a sexual health/teen pregnancy prevention program, the belief
      is that by engaging ninth grade students in school, building connectedness among peers, and
      building students' decision-making and goal-setting skills, PGC will encourage students to
      make healthier decisions, including reducing sexual risk-taking and increasing protective
      behaviors.

      The comparison condition consists of normally scheduled classes or activities (e.g., Physical
      Education/Health class, elective class, or homeroom period) that comparison group
      participants are assigned to during the period that PGC outreaches occur. Comparison group
      participants will therefore receive more time in the regularly scheduled class than will the
      treatment group, but there will be no alternative program or additional activities offered to
      the participants assigned to the comparison group.

      The study is an individual randomized controlled trial in which eligible, consenting ninth
      grade participants are randomly assigned by the evaluator to intervention (PGC) or control
      (business as usual) groups at a 1:1 ratio. Primary outcomes will be assessed using
      questionnaire data gathered at three time points: baseline, occurring during the fall of
      participants' 9th grade year (prior to the provision of any PGC programming), and follow-up
      during the fall of their 10th and 11th grade years. Primary outcomes of interest include
      sexual initiation, frequency of any type of sex, and number of sexual partners.

    <description>Faculty advisors at each participating high school are trained to run the program and teach a daily leadership course to peer leaders. Eleventh and twelfth-grade peer leaders who participate in the daily leadership development class facilitate outreach sessions with their assigned group of ninth graders. PGC can be offered in either a half-year (semester) or full-year format. In either format, a minimum of 18, 45-minute outreach sessions are expected to be offered to PGC participants during the course of their ninth-grade year. Outreaches are created to facilitate the transition to high school and encourage students to attend school, set goals for themselves, and make healthy decisions.</description>

    <ipd_description>A dataset will be prepared at the conclusion of the study, which includes de-identified individual-level data on all study participants who contributed self-report data. Respondents will be represented only by a research ID number. Included in the dataset will be self-report data collected across all survey administrations (including demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and theoretical antecedents to those behaviors) and select information on program participation (e.g., which program sessions were attended). Basic data cleaning steps will be taken in order to ensure data are unidentifiable and to increase usability.</ipd_description>
