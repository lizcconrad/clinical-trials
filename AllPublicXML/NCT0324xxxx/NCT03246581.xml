  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects will be enrolled and will receive doses of a test inhalation product and a
      reference inhalation product for 28 days according to a crossover design. Plasma tiotropium
      levels will be measured predose and over 24 hours postdose on days 1 and 28.
