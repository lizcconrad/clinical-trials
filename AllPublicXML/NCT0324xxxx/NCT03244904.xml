      Participants will be consented into the study after they are found to meet the study
      inclusion criteria. The clinical staff will schedule a tissue biopsy and a blood draw for the
      participant to give NGS(Next-generation Sequencing).One is according to the germline mutation
      data to screen susceptible gene in SCLC(Small Cell Lung Cancer); two is to explore the
      extensive consistency detection of blood and tissues in patients with SCLC gene mutation
      information; three is to conduct dynamic monitoring of blood ctDNA(circulating tumor DNA) in
      patients with SCLC during treatment, by changing the types of mutations / abundance (for
      example: the clonal evolution of typical samples analysis) and change of tumor load, ,
      investigating the patients treatment effect , for the significant change of mutations, to
      study whether it can be used as molecular marker; four is to analyze of the molecular typing
      of SCLC, according to the clinical and pathological features of patients.
