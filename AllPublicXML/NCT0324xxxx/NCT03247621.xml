  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the investigators propose a randomised controlled trail to explore the
      effects of environmental factors and the use of technology on eating behaviours. The
      investigators have planned two studies to investigate these effects, one on high school
      students from Raffles Institution, and the other on the university population in the National
      University of Singapore.

      Participants will be told a cover story that the study explores technological distraction on
      taste, and asked to complete a taste-evaluation taste of common snacks. One group
      (intervention group) will be asked to use their personal smartphones to engage in their
      pre-existing Whatsapp chats while doing the taste test. For the two control conditions, one
      group will be tasked with reading a neutral article on their personal smartphones while they
      complete the taste test, while the other group will be asked to complete the taste test
      without any use of smartphones.
