      The study was carried out on thirty patients who underwent video-assisted thoracic
      surgery.Paravertebral space was identified by loss of resistance technique under
      video-assisted inside thoracic space before chest close.Initiated dose of 0.3ml/kg of
      bupivacaine 0.125%+fentanyl 2 mcg/ml was administered then continued patient-controlled
      analgesia with background rate 3ml/h, bolus dose 2ml, lockout interval 10 minutes.
      Postoperative pain was accessed by Visual Analogue Scale at rest and on coughing; monitor the
      heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO2, arterial blood gas and spirometry in
      three postoperative consecutive days.

    <intervention_model_description>30 patients, with American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to III risk undergoing elective VATS, aged 32-72 years, scheduled for lung resection surgery , were enrolled in this randomised observer blinded prospective clinical study. Patients who refused to participate, less than 18 years of age, ASA physical status 3 or more, allergy to any of the study drugs, patients having any contraindication for paravertebral block, kyphoscoliosis, presence of acute herpes zoster, chronic pain syndrome, chronic analgesic use and psychiatric disease were excluded from this study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>General anesthesia was induced with 2.0 mg/kg of propofol, 2.0 mg/kg of fentanyl, and 1.0 mg kg/1 of rocuronium and maintained with continuous infusion 6-12mg/kg/h of propofol,injected 2.0 mg/kg of fentanyl and 0.15 mg/ kg of rocuronium every 30 minutes . All patients were intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube for one-lung ventilation.The VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery) was performed.</description>

    <description>At the end of the surgery, the upper edge of the spinous process of the thoracic vertebral body was recognized. With an epidural needle (Tuohy 22 G; Braun, Melsungen, Germany), the injection point was punctured 2 cm lateral to the midline. The paravertebral space was entered by advancing the Tuohy needle over the superior border of the transverse process. Once in the right place, the PVC was placed through the needle, checking the tip remained placed when removing the needle. The advance of the needle and the entering of the catheter into the paravertebral space were verified all the time by the surgeon using the camera. The PVC (Paravertebral Catheter ) was inserted at this point preversed at this area.</description>
