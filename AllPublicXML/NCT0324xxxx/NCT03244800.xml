      A Phase 2 study with two cohorts of differing doses designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MEDI0382 in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
      Approximately 63 subjects will be enrolled across two cohorts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of different doses of MEDI0382
      administered as multiple SC doses to subjects with T2DM. Approximately 63 subjects will be
      enrolled across two cohorts.

      For cohort 1, sufficient subjects will be invited to participate in the study such that a
      maximum of 39 subjects will complete dosing. Subjects in cohort 1 will be randomised using a
      ratio of 2:1 to one of 2 treatment arms to receive either MEDI0382 or placebo. A maximum of
      26 will complete dosing in the active arm and 13 will complete dosing in the placebo arm.

      For cohort 2, sufficient subjects will be invited to participate in the study such that a
      maximum of 24 subjects will complete dosing. Subjects in cohort 2 will be randomised using a
      ratio of 3:1 to receive either MEDI0382 or placebo. A maximum of 18 will complete dosing in
      the active arm and 6 will complete dosing in the placebo arm.

          2. Provision of signed and dated written informed consent

          3. BMI between 27 and 40 kg/m2

          4. HbA1c range of 6.5% to 8.5%

          5. Diagnosed with T2DM with glucose control managed with metformin monotherapy where no
             significant dose change (increase or decrease ≥ 500 mg/day) has occurred in the 3
             months prior to screening

          6. Subjects prescribed oral dual therapy with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor,
             sulphonylurea, glitinide, or a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in addition
             to metformin at screening may be eligible to enter the study following a 4-week
             washout period

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and randomisation, and must not be lactating

          8. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilised male
             partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception from screening
             and must agree to continue using such precautions through to the end of the study. It
             is strongly recommended for the male partner of a female subject to also use male
             condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after this
             point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the
             rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of, or any existing condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with evaluation of the investigational product, put the subject at risk,
             influence the subject's ability to participate or affect the interpretation of the
             results of the study and/or any subject unable or unwilling to follow study procedures

          2. Concurrent participation in another study of any kind and repeat randomisation in this
             study is prohibited

          3. Severe allergy/hypersensitivity to any of the proposed study treatments

          4. Symptoms of acutely decompensated blood glucose control (eg, thirst, polyuria, weight
             loss), a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, or if the
             subject has been treated with daily SC insulin within 90 days prior to screening

          5. Significant inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, or other severe disease or
             surgery affecting the upper GI tract (including weight-reducing surgery and
             procedures) which may affect gastric emptying or could affect the interpretation of
             safety and tolerability data

          6. Significant hepatic disease (except for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or non-alcoholic
             fatty liver disease without portal hypertension or cirrhosis) and/or subjects with any
             of the following results at screening:

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Systolic BP &gt; 160 mm Hg

               -  Diastolic BP ≥ 95 mm Hg after 10 minutes of seated rest and confirmed by repeated
                  measurement at screening.

          9. Unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke
             within 3 months prior to screening, or subjects who have undergone percutaneous
             coronary intervention or a coronary artery bypass graft within the past 6 months or
             who are due to undergo these procedures at the time of screening

         10. Severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV)

         11. Basal calcitonin level &gt; 50 ng/L at screening or history/family history of medullary
             thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia

         12. Haemoglobinopathy, haemolytic anemia, or chronic anaemia (haemoglobin concentration &lt;
             11.5 g/dL [115 g/L] for males, &lt; 10.5 g/dL [105 g/L] for females) at screening or any
             other condition known to interfere with interpretation of HbA1c measurement

         13. History of neoplastic disease within 5 years prior to screening, except for adequately
             treated basal cell, squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ cervical cancer

         14. Any positive results for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C
             antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody

         15. History of substance dependence, alcohol abuse, or excessive alcohol intake (defined
             as an average weekly intake of &gt; 21 alcoholic drinks for men or &gt; 10 alcoholic drinks
             for women) within 3 years prior to screening, and/or a positive screen for drugs of
             abuse or alcohol at screening or on admission to the study unit. Subjects who use
             tricyclic antidepressants or benzodiazepines for an established clinical indication
             may be permitted to enter the study based upon the judgement of the investigator.

         16. Involvement of any AstraZeneca, MedImmune, contract research organization, or study
             site employee or their close relatives

         17. History of acute or chronic pancreatitis or other diseases of the pancreas
