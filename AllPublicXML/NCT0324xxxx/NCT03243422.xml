      The ACHIEVE study will be a randomized controlled trial nested within the Atherosclerosis
      Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. 850 70-84 year-old cognitively normal older adults with
      hearing loss will be randomized 1:1 to the hearing intervention (hearing needs assessment,
      fitting of hearing devices, education/counseling) or successful aging intervention
      (individual sessions with a health educator covering healthy aging topics). Post baseline,
      participants will be followed semi-annually for 3 years.

    <description>The Successful Aging intervention will follow the protocol and materials developed for the 10 Keys™ to Healthy Aging program by the Center for Aging and Population Health Prevention Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh1. This interactive, dynamic program informs older adults about risk factors for diseases. Participants will meet individually with a health educator certified to administer the program every 2-3 weeks for a total of 4 visits over 8-10 weeks, and the session content will focus on a &quot;Key&quot;. Each session will also include a 5-10 minute active upper body extremity stretching program as used in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. Participants will return for booster sessions semi-annually beginning at 6 months post-randomization.</description>

    <description>The hearing intervention consists of fitting with hearing aids and other hearing assistive technologies plus four 1-hour comprehensive, individualized hearing rehabilitation sessions spaced over the 2-3 months post-randomization designed to provide all of the active components of the intervention. Hearing aids are instructed to be worn on a daily basis for study duration. Audiologic outcomes (e.g., hearing aid data logging, real ear measures, speech in noise, etc.) to verify the best-practices hearing intervention are gathered during study intervention visits and semi-annually beginning at 6 months post-randomization.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 70-84 years. Individuals aged 70-84 at the time of randomization are eligible for
             participation. This age range will allow recruitment of participants who are at risk
             for cognitive decline but who may also be expected to survive for the duration of the
             trial. This age range is estimated to allow for potential participation of 61% of
             participants currently enrolled in the ARIC study.

          -  Community-dwelling.

          -  Fluent English-speaker.

          -  Residency. Participants must plan to reside in the local area for the study duration.

          -  Audiometric hearing impairment. Participants must have adult-onset hearing impairment
             with a four-frequency pure tone average (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) in the better-hearing ear
             of ≥ 30 decibels (dB) and &lt;70 dB. This level of hearing impairment is the level at
             which individuals would be most likely to benefit from the use of conventional
             amplification devices such as hearing aids.

          -  Word Recognition in Quiet score ≥60% in the better ear. A word recognition in quiet
             score &lt;60% suggests hearing impairment that is too severe to benefit from conventional
             amplification devices such as hearing aids.

          -  Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≥ 23 for individuals with high-school degree or
             less; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≥ 25 for individuals with some college or
             more; Participants must be at risk for cognitive decline in the range quantified well
             by neurocognitive testing, and so must be free from more substantial cognitive
             impairment at baseline.

          -  Willingness to participate be randomized and adhere to the protocol. Participants must
             be willing and able to consent to participate in the study, be willing to be
             randomized to either the Hearing intervention or to the Successful Aging intervention,
             and be willing to commit to adhere to the study protocol for the duration of the trial
             (3 years of a randomly assigned intervention).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Self-reported disability in ≥ 2 or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL)

          -  Any self-reported hearing aid use in the past year. Trial participants will be
             randomized to hearing intervention or successful aging intervention and, therefore,
             participants cannot be currently already receiving treatment for their hearing loss.

          -  ARIC participants only: Diagnosis of adjudicated dementia based on a previous ARIC
             visit or participant required a proxy to assist with completing informed consent and
             responding to questions at ARIC Visit 6 or 7.

          -  Vision impairment (worse than 20/63 on Minnesota (MN) Near Vision Card). Participants
             who cannot see (with correction) well enough to complete the neurocognitive assessment
             are excluded.

          -  Medical contraindication to use of hearing aids (e.g., draining ear). Because hearing
             aids will be the primary device used in the hearing intervention, participants with
             medical contraindications to hearing aid use are excluded.

          -  Conductive hearing impairment as determined by a difference in air audiometry and bone
             audiometry (&quot;air-bone gap&quot;) greater than 15 dB in 2 or more contiguous frequencies in
             both ears. Because the impact of a conductive (versus a sensorineural) hearing loss on
             cognitive functioning may potentially differ and programming for hearing aids differs
             for conductive hearing loss, participants with permanent conductive hearing loss are
             excluded from the trial. Participants with an air-bone gap due to fluid in the ears or
             other resolvable medical issue may be enrolled in the trial following successful
             medical resolution of the cause of the air-bone gap.

          -  Unwilling to wear hearing aids on a regular (i.e., daily or near daily) basis
