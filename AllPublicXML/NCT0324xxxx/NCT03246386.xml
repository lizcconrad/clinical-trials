  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although posaconazole is approved for the prophylaxes and treatment of invasive fungal
      infections, specific dosing guidelines for posaconazole in (morbidly) obese patients are not
      specified. There is clear evidence indicating that heavier patients are receiving a
      sub-optimal dose if the current guidelines are used. Specifically in the setting of augmented
      prevalence of species with intermediate susceptible to posaconazole, adequate dosing is
      needed at start of treatment.

      Therefore it seems prudent to conduct a trial in a cohort of obese patients who receive
      posaconazole (300mg or 400mg) and define the pharmacokinetics. These will then be compared to
      the pharmacokinetics in a normal-weight group receiving 300mg posaconazole.

      Obese patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 undergoing endoscopic gastric bypass surgery will
      receive a 300 mg or 400mg dose of posaconazole. A PK curve will be determined after
      administration at t=0.45, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and (if feasible) 48 hours post
      infusion. Blood samples (4 mL) on PK days will be taken to obtain at least 2.0 mL of plasma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects BMI:

               -  obese groups: subject must have a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 at the time of inclusion,

               -  non-obese group: subject must have a BMI ≥18.5 and &lt; 25kg/m2 at the time of
                  inclusion.

          2. Subject is at least 18 of age on the day of screening and not older than 65 years of
             age on the day of dosing;

          3. If a woman, is neither pregnant nor able to become pregnant and is not nursing an
             infant;

          4. Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent before screening evaluations.

             For the non-obese subjects the following additional inclusion criteria applies:

          5. Subject is in good age-appropriate health condition as established by medical history,
             physical examination, electrocardiography, results of biochemistry, hematology and
             urinalysis testing within 6 weeks prior to study drug administration. Results of
             biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis testing should be within the laboratory's
             reference ranges (see Appendix A). If laboratory results are not within the reference
             ranges, the subject is included based on the investigator's judgment that the observed
             deviations are not clinically relevant. This should be clearly recorded;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented history of sensitivity to medicinal products or excipients similar to those
             found in the posaconazole preparation;

          2. History of, or known abuse of drugs, alcohol or solvents (up until a maximum of three
             months before study drug administration);

          3. Use of medication that has known relevant interaction with study drug as determined by
             the investigator up to 1 weeks prior to study drug administration.

          4. Donation of blood or plasma to a blood bank or in a clinical study (except a screening
             visit) within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration;

          5. Blood transfusion within 8 weeks prior to study drug administration;
