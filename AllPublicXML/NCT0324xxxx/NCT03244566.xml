  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer around the world, with more than 450000
      new cases per year. Esophagectomy with radical lymphadenectomy (2-field lymphadenectomy) is
      the mainstay of treatment in many countries for patients with esophageal cancer. To improve
      the survival, 3-field lymphadenectomy combined with cervical lymphadenectomy was starTed in
      1980s. More potential positive lymph nodes were found during more extended lymphadenectomy,
      offering more accurate TNM staging, affecting consequent treatment.
      Howeverï¼Œ3-field-lymphadenectomy was associated with increased surgical morbidity and
      mortality. Positron emission tomography (PET) is used for detecting distant metastases and
      lymphatic involvement. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of PET in predicting
      cervical lymph metastases of patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and
      to determine if we can use PET to guide future cervical lymphadenectomy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with histologically proven squamous cell esophageal cancer Patients with
        resectable cT1-T3/N0-N1 mid or distal third (inferior to carina and 3cm superior to cardia
        ) operable esophageal lesion. Staging investigations including esophagogastroscopy, chest
        and abdominal CT scan, barium swallow and s Karnofsky performance status greater than or
        equal to 80% Pulmonary and cardiac function must be acceptable for surgery according to
        institutional standards.

        Acceptable hepatic, renal and bone marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with low performance status(Karnofsky score &lt;80%) Past history of malignancy Stage
        investigations indicating unresectable advanced disease(T4 or M1a,M1b) Patients with any
        other serious underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to
        receive or comply with protocol treatment Patients medically unfit for surgical resection
        Patients with pulmonary reserve inadequate to undergo thoracotomy and extensive mediastinal
        lymphadenectomy.

        Patients with a significant history of unstable cardiovascular disease that in the opinion
        of the treating physician should preclude the patient from protocol treatment.

        Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or uncontrolled infection, including HIV or interstitial
        pneumonia or interstitial fibrosis.

        Significant psychiatric illness that would interfere with patient compliance Patients with
        severe hepatic cirrhosis or with serious renal disease unacceptable for surgery Patients
        considered of salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy Patients after neoadjuvant
        chemoradiotherapy Patients above the age of 80 years Patients unreliable for follow up
