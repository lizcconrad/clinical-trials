  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial includes a blood stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor
      to treat blood cancer. The treatment also includes chemotherapy drugs, but in lower doses
      than conventional (standard) stem cell transplants. The researchers will compare two
      different drug combinations used to reduce the risk of a common but serious complication
      called &quot;graft versus host disease&quot; (GVHD) following the transplant. Two drugs, cyclosporine
      (CSP) and sirolimus (SIR), will be combined with either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). This part of the transplant procedure is the main
      research focus of the study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)-free and relapse-free survival (CRFS)
      after transplant between the 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare rates of acute (grades II-IV and III-IV) and moderate and severe chronic GVHD
      (based on National Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus criteria), relapse, non-relapse
      mortality, progression or relapse-free survival, and overall survival between the 2 regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) at day 0.
      Patients with an HLA-matched unrelated donor receive mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) on
      days 0 to 40, cyclosporine PO every 12 hours twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 then tapered
      to day 150, and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to day 150 then tapered to day 180.
      Patients with an HLA-mismatched donor receive mycophenolate mofetil PO on days 0-100 then
      tapered to day 150, cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 150 then tapered to day 180, and
      sirolimus PO QD on days -3 to 180 then tapered to day 365.

      ARM II: Patients undergo HCT at day 0. Patients with an HLA-matched unrelated donor receive
      cyclosporine PO BID on days 5-96 then tapered to day 150, sirolimus PO QD on days 5-150 then
      tapered to day 180, and cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days 3 and 4. Patients with an
      HLA-mismatched donor receive cyclosporine PO BID on days 5-150 then tapered to day 180,
      sirolimus PO QD on days 5-180 then tapered to day 365, and cyclophosphamide IV on days 3 and
      4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and every year
      thereafter.

          -  CLL-must have either 1) failed to meet National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group
             criteria for complete or partial response after therapy with a regimen containing
             fludarabine (FLU) (or another nucleoside analog, e.g. cladribine [2-CDA], pentostatin)
             or experience disease relapse within 12 months after completing therapy with a regimen
             containing FLU (or another nucleoside analog); 2) failed FLU-cyclophosphamide
             (CY)-rituximab (FCR) combination chemotherapy at any time point; or 3) have &quot;17p
             deletion&quot; cytogenetic abnormality; patients should have received induction
             chemotherapy but could be transplanted in 1st CR; or 4) patients with a diagnosis of
             CLL (or small lymphocytic lymphoma) or diagnosis of CLL that progresses to
             prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), or T-cell CLL or PLL; 5) patients failing to achieve a
             response to ibrutinib as first-line therapy; 6) patients not responding to ibrutinib,
             idelalisib, or venetoclax as salvage therapy or intolerant of these agents as salvage
             therapy due to side effects; all CLL patients must have received prior
             myelosuppressive chemotherapy

          -  Hodgkin lymphoma - must have received and failed frontline therapy

          -  Multiple myeloma - must have received prior chemotherapy; consolidation of
             chemotherapy by autografting prior to nonmyeloablative HCT is permitted

          -  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant

          -  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) - must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of
             transplant

          -  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) - patients in CP1 must have failed or be intolerant of
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); patients beyond CP1 will be accepted if they have &lt;
             5% marrow blasts at time of transplant

          -  Myelodysplasia (MDS)/myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
             (CMML) - patients must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant

          -  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia - must have failed 2 courses of therapy

          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: FHCRC matching allowed will be grades 1.0 to 2.1;
             unrelated donors who are prospectively:

               -  Matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing;

               -  Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by
                  high resolution typing

          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is
             identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this
             determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the
             recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match
             is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens
             for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or
             B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded
             if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an
             HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches
             should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic
             crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion

          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele
             in the graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient
             is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Only granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
             mobilized PBSC will be permitted as a HSC source on this protocol

          -  HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated volunteer donors who are mismatched with the
             recipient within one of the following limitations:

               -  Mismatch for one HLA class I antigen with or without an additional mismatch for
                  one HLA-class I allele, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ, OR

               -  Mismatched for two HLA class I alleles, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ

               -  HLA class I HLA-A, -B, -C allele matched donors allowing for any one or two DRB1
                  and/or DQB1 antigen/allele mismatch

          -  HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: HLA-matching must be based on results of high
             resolution typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, - DRB1, and -DQ

          -  HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class
             I locus or II locus, the donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must
             match the patient (i.e., patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is heterozygous
             A*01:01, A*02:01); this mismatch will be considered a one-antigen mismatch for
             rejection only

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with rapidly progressive intermediate or high grade NHL

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who have not
             received induction chemotherapy

          -  Patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) who have not received
             myelosuppressive chemotherapy i.e. induction chemotherapy and will receive
             conditioning Regimen C (fludarabine and total body irradiation [TBI]) will be
             excluded; patients with RAEB who have not received myelosuppressive chemotherapy but
             who will receive conditioning Regimen A or B are eligible for this study as long as
             other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met

          -  CNS involvement with disease refractory to intrathecal chemotherapy

          -  Presence of circulating blasts (in the blood) detected by standard pathology for
             patients with AML, ALL or CML

          -  Presence of &gt;= 5% circulating leukemic blasts (in the blood) detected by standard
             pathology for patients with MDS/MPS/CMML

          -  Liver function abnormalities: Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver
             disease would be evaluated for the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in
             terms of liver function, and the degree of portal hypertension; patients will be
             excluded if they are found to have fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver

          -  The addition of cytotoxic agents for &quot;cytoreduction&quot; with the exception of tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib), cytokine therapy, hydroxyurea, low dose
             cytarabine, chlorambucil, or Rituxan will not be allowed within three weeks of the
             initiation of conditioning

          -  DONOR: Donor (or centers) who will exclusively donate marrow

          -  DONOR: Donors who are HIV-positive and/or, medical conditions that would result in
             increased risk for G-CSF mobilization and harvest of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)

          -  DONOR: Patients who are homozygous at the mismatched HLA class I or II locus, the
             donor is excluded if homozygous at the mismatched locus (i.e., patient is homozygous A
             *01:01 and donor is homozygous A *02:01); this type of mismatch is considered a
             two-antigen mismatch and is not allowed
