  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop, implement, and evaluate a novel Colorectal (CRC)
      screening patient navigator program for patients with Mental Health (MH) and /or Substance
      Use Disorder (SUD) receiving care at Massachusetts General Hospital Charlestown. The study
      will involve randomly assigning eligible patients to early intervention or usual care/delayed
      intervention groups. The investigators believe this random assignment is ethical because
      Patient Navigation (PN) is an extremely limited resource, and all patients identified as
      eligible could not be contacted by the navigators in a short period of time. Thus the
      investigators will randomly assign access to PN during the study period, and then allow all
      patients to be navigated and screened after the study period is over. As a result, all
      eligible patients will be referred for PN, but the timing of the referral will be randomly
      assigned.

    <description>PN will contact patients during their visits to health cancer or over the phone. During this initial contact, the PN will educate patients about CRC, screening and explore their barriers to screening. The PN will coordinate scheduling of CRC screening and remind patients about the tests. PN will explain preparation for colonoscopy and whenever feasible, accompany patient to obtain the test. Further interventions may include: reminding the patient about the test, helping with translation, insurance issues, transportation, and overcoming any other system barriers as needed.</description>
