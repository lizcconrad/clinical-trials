      Summary intended for the lay public

        -  Background of study: approximately a quarter of the patients who are diagnosed with
           colorectal cancer and metastases have their metastases in the peritoneum, the so called
           peritoneal metastases. The vast majority of these patients cannot be cured by surgery,
           frequently due to too many peritoneal metastases. These incurable patients have a very
           short life expectancy. Nowadays, they are treated with chemotherapy through the veins.
           However, chemotherapy through the veins appears to be relatively ineffective against
           peritoneal metastases, probably because it does not reach the peritoneal metastases very
           well. Chemotherapy through the veins may also cause side effects that are sometimes
           severe. Recently, doctors developed PIPAC: a short laparoscopic operation during which
           chemotherapy is sprayed in the abdomen for 30 minutes, directly against the peritoneal
           metastases. As a result, PIPAC may be more effective against peritoneal metastases than
           chemotherapy through the veins. It may also have less side effects, because the
           chemotherapy mainly stays in the abdomen, not in the veins. PIPAC indeed shows promising
           results in the first European patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer
           who have been treated with this operation.

        -  Aim of study: to investigate whether PIPAC is a safe, feasible, tolerable, and
           potentially effective treatment for patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal
           cancer.

        -  Participants: patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer, without
           metastases elsewhere (e.g. liver, lung), who cannot be cured by surgery due to too many
           peritoneal metastases.

        -  Treatment: instead of chemotherapy through the veins, participants receive PIPAC. PIPAC
           is a laparoscopic operation under general anesthesia. The entire operation takes about
           90 minutes. After the operation, patients stay in the hospital for at least one night.
           PIPAC is repeated every 6 weeks. The aim is to perform 3 PIPACs. If the peritoneal
           metastases respond well to PIPAC, participants may undergo more than 3 PIPACs.
           Participants may also undergo less than 3 PIPACs: for example if the peritoneal
           metastases do not respond PIPAC, if laparoscopy is unsafe for the patient, or if the
           surgeons cannot perform PIPAC due to adhesions in the abdomen. In case no further PIPACs
           can be performed, participants receive chemotherapy through the veins.

        -  Other appointments: four weeks after each PIPAC, participants visit the hospital for a
           CT-scan and an appointment at the oncological outpatient clinic to evaluate whether a
           next PIPAC can be performed. If not, participants receive chemotherapy through the
           veins. After the last PIPAC, patients visit the oncological outpatient clinic every 3
           months to evaluate how the cancer responds to the treatment.

        -  Potential risks for participants: PIPAC may cause side-effects. The most frequent
           potential side-effects are pain, nausea, fever, wound infection, diarrhea, obstipation,
           and minor damages to the kidney, liver, and bone marrow. These side-effects are mostly
           very mild. Moreover, the risk of side-effects of PIPAC is thought to be lower than the
           risk of side-effects of chemotherapy through the veins. Severe side-effects of PIPAC are
           extremely rare. The most important are a bowel perforation or a bleeding during PIPAC.
           So far, these severe side-effects have not been observed during PIPAC in patients with
           peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer.

        -  Potential benefits for participants: PIPAC may potentially be similarly or even more
           effective against peritoneal metastases than chemotherapy through the veins, with a
           potential lower risk of side-effects. There may be a small chance (+/- 10%) that the
           peritoneal metastases become so small that they can be cured by surgery. However, these
           potential benefits are uncertain. The cancer may deteriorate at any moment during
           treatment with PIPAC.

        -  Hypothesis of study: the investigators expect that PIPAC is a safe, feasible, and
           tolerable treatment for patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer, with a
           potentially similar or higher efficacy against peritoneal metastases of colorectal
           cancer compared to chemotherapy through the veins.

      Summary of the study protocol

        -  Background and rationale: approximately a quarter of the patients with synchronous
           metastatic colorectal cancer have metastases that are located in the peritoneum.
           Approximately half of these patients have peritoneal and other sites of metastases,
           whereas the other half has 'isolated' colorectal peritoneal metastases. The majority of
           the patients with isolated colorectal peritoneal metastases do not qualify for curative
           intent surgery, frequently due to extensive intraperitoneal disease. In these incurable
           patients, the toxicity and relative inefficacy of palliative systemic therapy have
           encouraged the development of intraperitoneal palliative therapies with a potentially
           similar or higher locoregional efficacy and a lower side-effect profile. Repeated
           laparoscopic Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) is such an
           innovative therapy that has revealed encouraging preliminary toxicity and efficacy
           outcomes in patients with end-stage peritoneal metastases of various origins. Based on
           this preliminary evidence, oxaliplatin should be the preferred cytotoxic agent for
           repeated laparoscopic PIPAC for colorectal peritoneal metastases. Additionally, an
           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin may potentiate the efficacy of
           intraperitoneal oxaliplatin. Although repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin is
           increasingly used in several European countries, sound scientific data on its safety,
           feasibility, tolerability, and oncological efficacy remain scarce. Therefore, this study
           investigates the safety, feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary oncological efficacy
           of upfront repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin (92 mg/m2) and simultaneous
           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (400/20 mg/m2) for isolated unresectable
           colorectal peritoneal metastases.

        -  Study hypothesis: upfront repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous
           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin is a safe, feasible, and tolerable treatment
           for patients with isolated unresectable colorectal peritoneal metastases, with a
           potentially higher preliminary oncological efficacy compared to standard palliative
           systemic therapy.

        -  Study design: prospective, single arm, single center phase I/II study.

        -  Study population: adults with a good performance status (WHO 0-1) and asymptomatic
           peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer without radiological evidence of systemic
           metastases, who do not qualify for curative intent surgery due to extensive
           intraperitoneal disease. See section 'Eligibility' below for detailed information on
           inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        -  Intervention: instead of standard palliative systemic therapy, patients receive upfront
           laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin (92 mg/m2) and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (400/20 mg/m2), intentionally repeated with an interval of six
           weeks until macroscopic intraperitoneal disease progression or laparoscopic non-access.
           Four weeks after each PIPAC-procedure, patients are radiologically and biochemically
           evaluated at the oncological outpatient clinic, after which the decision to perform a
           further PIPAC is made between the treating physicians. In case of intraperitoneal
           disease progression or unfitness for laparoscopy, patients intentionally receive
           standard palliative systemic therapy, while further PIPAC-procedures are cancelled. In
           case of systemic disease progression with intraperitoneal disease response or stable
           disease, patients intentionally receive standard palliative systemic therapy, while
           further PIPAC-procedures are intentionally continued until intraperitoneal disease
           progression, unfitness for laparoscopy, or laparoscopic non-access. See section 'Arms
           and interventions' below for detailed information on the intervention.

        -  Primary objective: the primary objective is to determine the morbidity of upfront
           repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. See section 'Outcome measures' below for detailed information
           on the primary outcome measure belonging to this objective.

        -  Secondary objectives: to determine the environmental safety of laparoscopic PIPAC with
           oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine
           the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin in plasma, urine, and saliva of the patient after
           (repeated) laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin; to determine intraoperative
           characteristics of (repeated) laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin; to determine the

           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the readmission rate after
           (repeated) laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the number of interventions in each patient; to

           simultaneous intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the histological
           tumour response during repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous
           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the macroscopic
           intraperitoneal tumour response during repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and
           simultaneous intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine tumour markers
           during repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the peritoneal progression-free survival during
           repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the systemic progression-free survival during
           repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the disease-specific survival during repeated
           laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the overall survival during repeated
           laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to determine the quality of life during repeated laparoscopic
           PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to
           determine the costs of repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin and simultaneous
           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin; to collect tissue samples, ascites, and
           blood samples for translational research purposes. See section 'Outcome measures' below
           for detailed information on the secondary and other outcome measure belonging to these
           secondary objectives.

        -  Risks and benefits: besides the (low) risks of general anaesthesia and a standard
           laparoscopy, the most important risks associated with participation are (cumulative)
           locoregional toxicity of intraperitoneal aerosolised oxaliplatin, (cumulative) systemic
           toxicity of intraperitoneal aerosolised oxaliplatin with simultaneous intravenous bolus
           5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and inefficacy of upfront repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with
           oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. However, so
           far, no severe (cumulative) locoregional toxicity of intraperitoneal aerosolised
           oxaliplatin has been observed during/after PIPAC. Furthermore, the (cumulative) systemic
           toxicity of intraperitoneal aerosolised oxaliplatin (92 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) is likely
           to be lower than the intravenous dose during standard palliative systemic therapy
           (85-130 mg/m2 every 2-3 weeks). Moreover, the (cumulative) systemic toxicity of
           intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (400/20 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) is likely to be
           lower than the intravenous dose during standard palliative systemic therapy (2800/400
           mg/m2 every 2 weeks). Finally, repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with oxaliplatin has revealed
           promising preliminary oncological efficacy outcomes in patients with end-stage
           colorectal peritoneal metastases, while palliative systemic therapy appears relatively
           uneffective in this setting. Taken together, the investigators feel the benefits of
           participation outweigh the risks, since upfront repeated laparoscopic PIPAC with
           oxaliplatin and simultaneous intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin may result in
           long-term intraperitoneal disease control with low systemic side-effects and a small
           chance of secondary curative intent surgery. Thereby, this intervention potentially
           postpones palliative systemic therapy and increases the quality of life and prognosis of
           this particular population with an extremely poor prognosis.
