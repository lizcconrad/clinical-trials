        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and colon cancer were diagnosed by histology and
             cytology, and there was a clear metastasis (TxNxM0);

          2. without any prior treatment (including surgery or radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in
             the I-III period, no distant metastasis, suitable for patients with surgical resection
             of the tumor.

          3. the age range of the patients is 18-60;

          4. systolic pressure 100-140mmHg; heart rate &gt;60bpm;

          5. the patient's survival time should be longer than 3 months;

          6. without previous cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, the atrioventricular
             block was excluded by the 24 hour dynamic electrocardiogram;

          7. ECOG score of 2 (that means the patient's bed time is less than 50%); Karnofsky score
             of 60% (that means patients have the basic activities and self-care ability);

          8. the basic biochemical examination results of patients with normal: white blood cell
             3000/ul; neutrophil 1500/ul 100000/ul; platelet count; total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN;
             AST / ALT 2.5 x ULN without liver metastasis; &lt; 5 x ULN liver metastasis; creatinine
             clearance rate of 1.5 x ULN;

          9. have the ability to understand and sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. pregnant or lactating women;

          2. patients with severe heart disease, kidney disease, metabolic disorders, bronchial
             asthma, cardiogenic shock, heart block (II-III degree atrioventricular block), or
             severe acute heart failure, sinus bradycardia.

          3. patients with epilepsy or psychotropic drugs and sedatives;

          4. patients with brain metastasis and bone marrow metastasis;

          5. participants in clinical trials of other drugs within 4 weeks;

          6. patients with a history of anaphylaxis with propranolol;

          7. patients treated with trastuzumab;

          8. patients with or reactive immunodeficiency, such as those with HIV infection;

          9. the uncontrollable situation in the group during the period (but not limited to these
             cases): according to the experimental scheme of medication, severe infection, due to
             mental illness or other social factors lead to the compliance requirements of
             patients;

         10. patients with atrioventricular block should be discontinued immediately and quit;

         11. the researchers believe there may be any increase in the risk of the subject or any
             interference with clinical trials.
