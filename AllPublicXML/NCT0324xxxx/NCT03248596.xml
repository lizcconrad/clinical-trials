  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is a better understanding of hemorrhagic events causes in patients with
      ECMO, prevent them and decrease the number of transfusion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent complication during ECMO is hemorrhage especially as a curative
      anticoagulant treatment is necessary. The primary hemostasis is also affected with a von
      Willebrand disease and thrombopathy, well known but not studied by recent tests.The
      identification of primary haemostasis deficits with these tools would allow to supply them
      and decrease the morbi-mortality related to the transfusion.
