      TRANSCEND is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled,
      noninferiority clinical trial. The trial will randomize approximately 446 subjects with
      symptomatic PAD due to stenoses of the femoral and/or popliteal arteries. Subjects meeting
      eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either the SurVeil DCB or the
      IN.PACT Admiral DCB, and followed for 60 months.

             follow-up requirements.

          -  De novo lesion(s) or non-stented restenotic lesion(s) occurring &gt;90 days after prior
             plain old balloon (POBA) angioplasty or &gt;180 days after prior DCB treatment.

          -  Target lesion location starts ≥10 mm below the common femoral bifurcation and
             terminates distally at or above the end of the P1 segment of the popliteal artery.

          -  Target vessel diameter ≥4 mm and ≤7 mm.

             estimate.

          -  Chronic total occlusions may be included only after successful, uncomplicated wire
             crossing of target lesion via an anterograde approach and without the use of
             subintimal dissection techniques.

          -  Target lesion must be ≤180 mm in length (one long lesion or multiple serial lesions)

             limiting dissection and treatable with available device matrix.

          -  Target lesion has moderate to severe calcification or was previously treated with a
             DCB for moderate to severe calcification (as defined by the PARC classification of

          -  Target lesion involves an aneurysm or is adjacent to an aneurysm (within 5 mm).

          -  Target lesion requires treatment with alternative therapy such as stenting, laser,

          -  Significant target vessel tortuosity or other parameters prohibiting access to the
             target lesion.
