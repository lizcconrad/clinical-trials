    <textblock>
      The objective of this research was to determine the incidence, predisposing and triggering
      factors of delirium following cardiac surgery and its consequences within 30 days of surgery
      and during a 12-18-month follow-up in older adult patients.

    <textblock>
      Delirium is a transient and fluctuating course syndrome of acute onset that is characterized
      by reduced level of consciousness, global cognitive dysfunction, and disorder in the
      sleep-wake cycle. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, delirium is a complication that
      affects 2-57% of the patients, reaching as high as 73% in older subjects.

      The identification of patients at high risk for delirium is important to deliver proper care
      and avoid the consequences of this complication. However, previous studies published on the
      subject have not delivered definitive results in the cardiac surgery setting. Low educational
      level has also been studied as a risk factor for delirium after surgery but never in a group
      of cardiac surgery patients that includes a significant rate of illiteracy.

      The objective of this research was to determine the incidence, predisposing and triggering
      factors of delirium following cardiac surgery and its consequences within 30 days of surgery
      and during a 12-18-month follow-up in older adult patients.
