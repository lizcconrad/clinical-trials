      A post market, non-randomized, multi-center, open-label,clinical study using survivorship to
      study the safety and efficacy of the Integra® TITAN™ Total Shoulder System 1.0 (TAS) when
      used for total shoulder arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational, multi-center, post-market study to provide data on the performance and safety
      of the TITAN™ Total Shoulder System. The study will enroll patients that underwent total
      shoulder arthroplasty with the TITAN™ Total Shoulder System per standard of care less than 5
      years ago. Available retrospective data up to the 2-year time point will be collected, per
      the study protocol, from medical record reviews. Prospective observational data will be
      collected from the time of patient enrollment during the following postoperative clinical
      visits: 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years post-surgery.
