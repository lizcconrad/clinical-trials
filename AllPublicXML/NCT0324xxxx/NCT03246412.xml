  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates if a computer-based clinical decision support tool for skin cancer may
      improve the diagnostic accuracy of general practitioners (GPs). The aim of the program is to
      help GPs increase their diagnostic accuracy, in particular regarding the selection of
      suspicious skin lesions that need biopsy or referral to specialist health care for further
      assessment. Half of the physicians in the trial will have the clinical decision support tool
      available during consultations, while the other half has no such tool available. We
      hypothesize that general practitioners using the clinical decision support tool will have a
      higher number of correct classifications of skin lesions compared to doctors without the
      tool.

      General practitioners (GPs) examine patients who attend a primary health care center. In the
      intervention group the computer-based clinical decision support tool &quot;Nevus doctor&quot; in a
      first step assists doctors in the process of selecting skin lesions that are suggestive of
      cancer. In the next step a given skin lesion is photographed using a dermatoscope attached to
      the lens of the camera. The dermatoscopic image is then processed by the computer program
      &quot;Nevus doctor&quot; and a preliminary result is presented. Finally the GP reviews the result and
      assesses the clinical significance of the output by using guidelines presented by &quot;Nevus
      doctor&quot;. The patient is subsequently referred to a dermatologist and a complete skin
      examination is performed. The assessment of the dermatologist serves as the gold standard.

    <description>Skin lesions selected by the GP are classified into three classes: 1 Not suspicious for skin cancer, 2 Somewhat suspicious for skin cancer, 3 Very suspicious for skin cancer. The reference standard is the specialist`s classification. The number of correct classifications are counted. Sensitivity and specificity scores are calculated.</description>
