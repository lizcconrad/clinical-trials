  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone associated with prednisone is used in prostate cancer. Abiraterone is a selective
      small-molecule inhibiting cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1), a key enzyme in androgen synthesis.

      CYP17A inhibition is also responsible for mineral corticosteroid related adverse events as
      hypokaliemia, fluid retention, and hypertension. Primary hyperaldosteronism is associated
      with cardiovascular toxicities such as atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure. Other
      androgen-deprivation therapies are not associated with increased mineral corticosteroid
      level.

      This study investigates reports of cardiovascular toxicities for treatment including L02 (sex
      hormones used in treatment of neoplastic diseases), and G03 (sex hormones) used in prostate
      cancer in the French pharmacovigilance database and in the EudraCT database.

      Due to its peculiar pharmacology, abiraterone is potentially associated with more
      cardiotoxicity as compared to other androgen-deprivation therapies. This study investigates
      the main characteristics of patients affected by cardiovascular side effects of which
      supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular
      tachycardia), and cardiac failure imputed to drugs classified as L02, and G03 according to
      anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification. A causality assessment according to the
      World Health Organization-The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) is systematically applied.
