      Described as the &quot;Angelina Jolie Effect&quot;, rates of prophylactic mastectomy with immediate
      implant-based reconstruction are increasing dramatically as more women with genetic
      predisposition towards breast cancer are seeking surgical prevention. Advances in surgical
      techniques allow for the creation of an aesthetically pleasing postoperative breast mound;
      however, a common complaint is the lack of sensation to the skin and nipple of the
      reconstructed breast due to injury and stretch of the sensory nerves. Numbness of the breast,
      nipple, and areola is an unnatural feeling for the patient, as well as a potential risk for
      injury or burns as the woman is unable to feel pain.

      Our laboratory has previously shown that electrical stimulation (ES) is an effective way of
      improving nerve regeneration after injury to the nerves of the upper and lower extremities.
      Proven to improve motor outcomes following carpal and cubital tunnel release and sensation
      following injury to the digital nerves, this technique is a likely mechanism of restoring
      sensation of the breast as well.

      In this study, we will follow thirty women undergoing prophylactic skin-sparing mastectomy
      with immediate implant-based reconstruction. At the time of surgery, patients will be
      randomly assigned ES to either the right or left breast. That breast will be reconstructed
      first and stimulated for one hour while the other breast is reconstructed. At the completion
      of the case, all wires will be removed. We will test sensation (tactile, temperature, 2-point
      discrimination, sharp/dull discrimination, and protective sensation) prior to surgery then
      again at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following surgery to evaluate the effects of ES on sensory
      return. Patients will be provided with a survey to assess return of erogenous sensation.

      Objective: To determine whether intraoperative electrical stimulation enhances sensory
      recovery following mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction

      Background: There is an increasing trend towards prophylactic mastectomy with immediate
      implant-based reconstruction for women with genetics predisposing to breast cancer (BRCA-1
      and -2). Novel techniques such as fat grafting and nipple creation/tattooing have
      contributing towards creating an aesthetically pleasing breast mound; however, the majority
      of women experience non-recoverable significant sensory loss secondary to damage and stretch
      of the intercostal nerves that provide sensation to the skin, areola, and nipple. Most women
      will recover minimal sensation around the perimeter of the breast, indicating a potential for
      sensory return; however, particularly the nipple usually remains numb. An insensate breast
      feels unnatural to the woman and predisposes her to injury and burns of the reconstruction,
      which can require additional surgery or cause significant scarring.

      Our laboratory has previously shown that electrical stimulation (ES) is safe and
      significantly improves postoperative outcomes in peripheral nerve injury in animal and human
      models. ES has been shown to improve return of median and ulnar nerve function following
      carpal and cubital tunnel release respectively, with improved motor outcomes. Sensory return
      following digital nerve laceration repair similarly is improved with immediate postoperative
      ES for one hour.

      Methods: Thirty patients that will be undergoing bilateral prophylactic skin-sparing
      mastectomy with immediate implant-based breast reconstruction will be identified from the
      practice of two plastic surgeons. Preoperatively, women will be undergo sensory testing to
      the 4 quadrants of both breasts and the nipples, including testing for tactile sensation,
      cool detection, 2-point discrimination, heat-pain detection threshold, and sharp-blunt
      discrimination. A custom-made survey to evaluate erogenous sensation will be completed by the
      patient, as well as the validated BREAST-Q.

      The day of surgery the patient will be randomized to right or left breast for stimulation.
      Following the mastectomy, the breast to be stimulated will be reconstructed with an implant
      first in the typical fashion. A percutaneous needle will be passed into the intercostal space
      alongside the 4th intercostal nerve, and a second needle will be inserted into the serratus
      anterior muscle . These needles will be attached to the anode and cathode respectively of our
      electrical stimulator, and the patient will receive 1 hour of intraoperative stimulation
      titrated to palpable contraction of the intercostal muscle. During this hour, the second
      breast will undergo reconstruction with no electrical stimulation. At the completion of the
      hour, the skin will be closed in the normal fashion. The laterality will be blinded to the
      patient as well as to the investigator who will perform all sensory testing.

      Postoperatively, the patient will be evaluated at 1 week, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and
      24 months with the same sensory testing as described previously. Patients will serve as their
      own internal control, and the sensation of the right vs. left breast will be compared. At the
      completion of all 2-year evaluations, the study will be unblinded and the stimulated vs.
      non-stimulated breast outcomes will be compared.

    <description>Electrical stimulation - a needle attached to an cathode polarity will be placed within the intercostal space near the 4th intercostal nerve. A second needle attached to the anode polarity will be inserted into the serratus anterior muscle. Both electrodes will then be attached to a Grass SD9 stimulator and the voltage and frequency of the stimulation will be titrated to the point where contraction of the intercostal muscles is palpable. It will be maintained at this level for one hour at which point the wires will be removed. This technique is part of the standard of care for peripheral nerve surgeries of the extremities and is proven to be safe in humans.</description>
