  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-discharge hospital utilization, i.e., readmissions within 30 days of discharge (30d
      readmissions) and emergency department (ED) visits, are a high-priority quality measure and
      target for cost reduction. Patients with diabetes are disproportionately over-represented in
      30d readmissions, especially among racial minorities and urban populations. We have developed
      and validated a tool, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRI), to predict 30d
      readmission risk among diabetes patients, which is a critical prerequisite for targeting
      limited resources for reducing readmission risk to those most in need. Currently, there are
      no proven interventions to reduce the risk of 30d readmission specifically among patients
      with diabetes. This proposal will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel,
      multifactorial intervention, the Diabetes Transition of Hospital Care Program (DiaTOHC),
      designed to reduce post-discharge hospital utilization rates in a pilot randomized controlled
      trial. The intervention will include inpatient diabetes and discharge education,
      comprehensive discharge planning and coordination of care, A1c-based adjustment of diabetes
      therapy, and post-discharge support. Hospitalized patients with diabetes identified as high
      risk for readmission based on the DERRI will be randomized to the intervention or the control
      group, which will receive usual care. Such work is highly relevant in the current era of
      soaring health care costs and national health care reform.
