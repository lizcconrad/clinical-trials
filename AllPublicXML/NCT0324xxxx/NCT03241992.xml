  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to assess the use of an electronic health records patient portal
      for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),
      have reduced quality of life, high rates of depression and anxiety, do not receive routine
      preventative health maintenance (such as vaccines) at the same rate as the general public,
      and have low adherence to medications. The investigators are seeking to understand whether an
      electronic health record patient portal (EPIC's MyChart), can be utilized to improve quality
      of life in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single site randomized control trial.

      Patients will be randomized into a control arm and intervention arm. At baseline the
      investigators will obtain demographic data, quality of life measures, and satisfaction with
      MyChart for those patients who are alrealy active portal users. The control arm will receive
      periodic messages through MyChart that are not specific to IBD. The intervention arm will
      receive more specific disease related information such as IBD educational information,
      reminders to take their medications, and reminders to get vaccinated. The intervention arm
      will also receive questionnaires that assess their mood (depression and anxiety). The
      investigators will then inform the primary gastroenterologist for those patients in whom
      mild, moderate or severe depression and anxiety is identified. At the end the study, in both
      groups investigators will measure quality of life as measured by the Short Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), a validated questionnaire for measuring health-related quality
      of life in patients with Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis. Secondary outcomes will include:
      Satisfaction with Mychart as measured by a MyChart satisfaction survey, time to referral to
      mental health provider for patients identified with mild, moderate, or severe depression, or
      anxiety (PROMIS Depression and Anxiety Questionnaires), and Vaccine uptake (using a simple
      yes/no questionnaire asking patients if they received Flu, PCV13 or PPSV23.

      The findings of this study will allow future clinicians to better understand how a patient
      portal can be utilized as a tool for the management of patients with IBD. This findings may
      lead to increased physician and patient engagement with the MyChart patient portal.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) which is a 10 item health-related quality of life (HRQoL) tool measuring physical, social, and emotional status (scores can range from 10-70, poor to good HRQoL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with MyChart</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The 14 item embedded MyChart Satisfaction Survey will be used to measure satisfaction. Responses for 12 of the questions are answered on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10=Strongly Agree, 5=Neither Agree nor Disagree, and 0=Strongly Disagree, so the higher the score for those questions the greater the satisfaction. there is also a question about the number of times myChart was used and an open-ended comments question..</description>

    <measure>Influenza vaccine uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure vaccine uptake for flu the patients will be asked if they received the flu shot in the previous year. A chart review will be done to confirm the self reported information.</description>

    <description>To measure PCV13, PPSV23 vaccine uptake for pneumococcal pneumonia the patients will be asked if they received the vaccine in the previous year. A chart review will be done to confirm the self reported information.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control arm will be enrolled in MyChart during the consent process and receive MyChart Disease Specific targeted IBD information and reminders as well as mood questionnaires. At week 2 subjects will receive reminders to get vaccinated with another reminder sent at 3 months. At month 1, subjects will receive the Promis Adult Short Form questionnaires for depression and anxiety through MyChart. If a subject is identified as having mild, moderate or a severe mood disorder a message will be sent to their gastroenterologist with a recommendation to discuss the results with the patient and to consider a referral to mental health services. Subjects will also receive educational information about IBD every 6 weeks along with reminders to take their medications.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control arm will be enrolled in MyChart during the consent process if they are not previously enrolled. Enrollment in MyChart will provide them with access to their medical record and the ability to send or receive messages with their gastroenterologist or any other providers they see at our institution. For patients with IBD it is standard practice to discuss medication adherence, vaccinations, and their mood at each appointment. Subjects will receive generic, non-IBD related messages through MyChart.</description>
