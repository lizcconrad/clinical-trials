      Objective: To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab in
      subjects with advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) Safety: To
      characterize the safety of Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab given in combination Hypothesis:
      Restore (for subjects who have failed pembrolizumab mono therapy) or enhance (for subjects
      who actively experiencing SD) sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) by appropriate and
      effective stimulation of the subject's innate and adaptive immune systems by combining
      Imprime PGG with pembrolizumab.

      The study will require documenting at least 5 objective responses among the 38 subjects
      enrolled who have failed prior pembrolizumab monotherapy and at least 17 objective responses
      among the 49 subjects enrolled who are actively experiencing stable disease following at
      least 4 cycles (but no more than 8 cycles) of pembrolizumab monotherapy.
