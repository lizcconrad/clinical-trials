      Long term functional status

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore the long term functional status of people who have had
      both a spinal fusion procedure and a total hip replacement. Studies have found that those who
      have received spinal fusion may have worse outcomes following a total hip replacement than
      those who have not received a spinal fusion. The information obtained from this study will
      allow surgeons and researchers to better understand why some who've had a spine fusion have
      more complications post total hip replacement compared to those who did not have spinal
      fusion surgery.

        Approximately 45 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) and lumbar spine
        fusion (LSF) surgery will be called by the surgeon or research team and asked if they wish
        to participate in the study. 45 patients matched for age, sex, and BMI who have only
        undergone only THA will also be called. These patient names will be retrieved from our
        preexisting prospective hip database.
