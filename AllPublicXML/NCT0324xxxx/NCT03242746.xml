    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess how the proportion of the cervical volume/length removed during
      treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) varies and whether this correlates to
      the pregnancy duration at delivery

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high peak age of the Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)patients was from 25 to 35
      years old, which is the best women of childbearing age, Standard treatment for CIN is called
      Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP),but the inappropriate conization may damage
      the cervical function leading to infertility, abortion, preterm delivery and dystocia.
      Therefore, reasonable and standard conization is very important for treating and preventing
      the complication. The International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy(IFCPC)
      advocates the length of cervical conization should be decided by the type of cervical
      transformation zone, however, the cervical lengths in female are different leading to the
      same cervical conization lengths cause the diverse influences on the cervical
      function.Therefore, individualized cervical conization therapies are very neededï¼ŒAt present,
      there are still lack of objective data about cervical morphology of women at childbearing
      age,besides the effects of cervical morphological changes caused by LEEP on pregnancy and
      childbirth has not been reported.

      Our hypothesis is that the proportion of the cervical tissue removed is likely to influence
      both cervical healing and the cervical volume following surgery and as a result the risk of
      prematurity in subsequent pregnancies. The present prospective study investigates the
      variation in the proportion of the cervix removed during excisional treatment and provides
      pilot data on pregnancy outcomes in a sample population for which the dimensions and
      proportions of the cervical tissue excised are assessed at the time of treatment.

The measurements included the length/depth, and the anteroposterior,transverse, and lateral diameters. A fluid filled volumetric cylindrical vial (tube) are subsequently used to measure the cone volume with the fluid displacement technique</description>

    <description>In the event of a pregnancy, the prenatal management and outcomes are recorded. More specifically, it is recorded whether interventions such as cervical length ultrasound, cervical cerclage, or progesterone are used. The duration of pregnancy at delivery, the birth weight, and other obstetric outcomes and complications are recorded.</description>
