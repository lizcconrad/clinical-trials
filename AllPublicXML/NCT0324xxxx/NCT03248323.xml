  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Color coded blood flow and blood perfusion techniques are applied to the endovascular
      treatment of infrapopliteal arterial occlusion,to establish a method of quantitative
      evaluation of blood flow and tissue perfusion,to improve the level of calculation of
      condition and curative effect. So as to establish a new complete evaluation system of
      infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, to guide clinical further. At the same time
      establish a digital information platform for clinical, lay the foundation for the large
      research.

    <description>We compare the change of blood flow velocity and blood perfusion volume before and after the recanalization of infrapopliteal arteries to assess the initial patency rate. While we test the ankle brachial index and toe brachial index at 3 , 6, 12 months, lower extremity arterial ultrasound at 6 mouths and computed tomographic angiography in 1 year to evaluate the patency of one year.</description>

        These new technologies are performed in the treatment of patients older than 40 years. They
        present with rest pain, intermittent claudication, ulceration or gangrenous. Some of them
        have the risk factors of CLI, as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or smoking. They
        are referred to our vascular service for CLI-infrapopliteal artery occlusion. Computed
        tomographic angiography discloses the occlusive lesion in anteriortibial, posterior tibial
        or peroneal arteries.
