    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, open, double-cycle and double-cross and
      self-reflection phase Ic clinical trial, to evaluate effect and safety of high fat diet on
      pharmacokinetics of SPH3127 tablets.

      Two panels, each consisting of ten participants (The number of single-sex subjects is not
      less than 1/3 of the total number) will be randomized to A or B groups.

      Participants who are in panel A will receive a single dose of a SPH3127 tablets 200mg when
      limosis, then fast 4h after dosing, and 72 hours later participants take the second dose of
      SPH3127 200mg after a high-fat breakfast.

      Participants who are in panel B will receive a single dose of a SPH3127 tablets 200mg after a
      high-fat breakfast, then 72 hours later participants take the second dose of SPH3127 200mg
      when limosis.
