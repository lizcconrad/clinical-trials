  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, no-control, dose-escalation Phase 1b trial in 18
      patients with chronic HBV infection to determine the safety, preliminary efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of QL-007 after administration over 28 days of multiple oral doses in a
      fasted state at the following planned dose levels: 200 mg/day (100 mg two times a day (BID)),
      400 mg/day (200 mg BID), then 600 mg once daily (QD), with 6 patients for each cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administration of the next dose level will occur only if the preceding dose was determined to
      be safe and well tolerated. The decision to proceed to the next higher dose level will be
      made by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) based upon review of efficacy and safety data
      including AEs, safety laboratory results, vital signs and ECGs. PK data for up to 12 hours
      post-dose will also be reviewed. The review will be conducted after the last subject in a
      cohort completes the Day 28 visit. The planned dose levels can be modified based on the data
      reviewed.
