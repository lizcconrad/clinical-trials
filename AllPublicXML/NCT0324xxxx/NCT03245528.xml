        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be adults ≥ 18 years of age who remain hypotensive despite fluid therapy
             and vasopressor therapy and who received or are receiving a total sum norepinephrine
             (NE) equivalent unit dose of &gt; 0.2 µg/kg/min for at least 2 hours prior to LJPC-501
             infusion.

          -  Patients must have central venous access and an arterial line present, which is

             cardiac output monitoring modality OR a concurrent CVP &gt; 8 mmHg and ScvO2 &gt; 70%.

          -  Patient or legal surrogate is willing and able to provide informed consent per local
