      Our objective is to establish pharmacological equivalence of intermittent and continuous
      infusion of cloxacillin during methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bone and
      joint infections (BJI). Twelve patients suffering MSSA BJI will receive both administration
      modalities and serum concentrations of cloxacillin will be determined after 3 days of II and
      3 days of continuous infusion in a prospective, randomized, open-label, monocentric crossover
      study design.

      Introduction Staphylococcus aureus is the main causative agent of bone and joint infections
      (BJI). More than 80% of the strains isolated in France are methicillin-susceptible (MSSA).
      During the early phase of MSSA BJI management national and international guidelines recommend
      the use of intra-venous type M penicillin with a dosage ranging from 100 to 200 mg/kg/day.
      Pharmacological properties of this class of penicillin require 4 to 6 infusions by day.
      Continuous infusion of beta-lactams is increasingly used especially in intensive care units.
      It allows an improvement of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) parameters and a
      reduction in time dedicated to infusion preparations by the nurses. However pharmacological
      data regarding such administration is required for type M penicillin.

      Design A 6-day, prospective, randomized, open-label, monocentric crossover study

      Participants Twelve adult patients with MSSA BJI

      Intervention Patients will be randomized in two groups: the first group will receive 3 days
      of cloxacillin (150 mg/kg/day) through 4 intermittent infusions/day followed by 3 days of
      cloxacillin (150 mg/kg/day) through continuous infusion (2 infusions during 12 hours). In the
      second group the infusion modalities will be inverted and continuous infusion will be
      preceded by a loading dose. Serum concentrations of cloxacillin will be determined at Day 3
      and Days 6 The area under the curve / minimal inhibitory concentration ratio will be use to
      establish the equivalence between both administration modalities.

    <description>For intermittent administration, patients will benefit from cloxacillin treatment in conventional hospitalization, in accordance with national guidelines, at a dose of 150 mg / kg per day in 4 infusions, not exceeding the maximum daily dose of 12 g / day according to.
For continuous administration the same quantity of cloxacillin 150 mg / kg per day, without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 12 g / day, will be delivered by a self-propelled syringe in twice 12 hours. Patients randomly assigned to receive continuous administration will receive a dose of cloxacillin equivalent to the dose administered 4 times daily during iterative administration using a self-pulsating syringe. For the first day of the study, this loading dose will be subtracted from the 150 mg / kg dose to be administered continuously over the remaining 23 hours of the first day of the study and never exceed 12g / day.
Pharmacological dosages will be performed on the third and sixth day in both arms</description>
