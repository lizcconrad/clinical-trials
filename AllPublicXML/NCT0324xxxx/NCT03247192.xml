      The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of whey protein
      supplementation associated with resistance training on muscle strength, body composition,
      muscle quality, cellular hydration, cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammatory and oxidative
      stress markers in trained elderly women and to evaluate whether the timing of protein intake
      provide different responses on these variables.

      This study was carried out over a period of 26 weeks divided in two phases. The first phase
      of the study was an eight-week period (weeks 3-10), during which subjects were familiarized
      to RT. This RT period was conducted to standardize training status, and to overcome strong
      neural adaptations known to occur within the first few weeks of RT. Phase 2, supplementation
      phase, the participants was randomized in three groups and started 12 weeks dedicated to
      supplementation plus RT (weeks 13-24). At the beginning and the end of each phase of the
      experiment, two weeks were allocated for evaluations (weeks 1-2, 11-12 and 25-26) consisting
      of anthropometric, body composition, one repetition maximum tests (1RM), phase angle, body
      water, blood samples and dietary intake measurements.

      Recruitment was carried out through newspaper and radio advertising, and home delivery of
      leaflets in the central area and residential neighborhoods. All participants completed health
      history and physical activity questionnaires and met the following inclusion criteria: 60
      years old or more, physically independent, free from cardiac or orthopedic dysfunction, not
      receiving hormonal replacement and/or thyroid therapy, not using equipment that would prevent
      the accomplishment of protocols and tests, and not performing any regular physical exercise
      for 6 months preceding the beginning of the study. Participants have passed a diagnostic
      graded exercise stress test with 12-lead electrocardiogram reviewed by a cardiologist and
      were released with no restrictions for participation in this investigation. Eighty-three
      Brazilian older women (≥ 60 years old), volunteered to participate in this investigation.
      After individual interviews, thirteen volunteers were excluded because they did not meet the
      inclusion criteria. Seventy participants were submitted to a standardized resistance training
      (RT) program, for eight weeks. After the assessments, the participants were randomly divided
      into three groups according relative strength (ratio of total strength obtained on 1-RM tests
      by body mass): (1) whey protein pre- and placebo post- RT (whey protein-placebo, (2) placebo
      pre- and whey protein post- RT, and (3) placebo pre- and post- RT. A blinded researcher was
      responsible for generating random numbers for participant allocation. All groups were
      submitted to the same RT program and 66 participants completed the experiment. The reasons
      for withdrawal from the study was reported as personal reasons and transportation issues.

      Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after a detailed description of
      investigation procedures was provided. This investigation was conducted according to the
      Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local University Ethics Committee (nº
      1.700.756).

      The paired t-test was used to analyze the effects (pre- vs post-) of the first phase. Two-way
      analysis of variance for repeated measures was applied for intra- and inter-group
      comparisons. When the baseline was different (ANOVA one-way), two-way analysis of covariance
      (ANCOVA) for repeated measures was applied for comparisons, with baseline scores used as
      covariates. When an F-ratio was significant, Fisher's post hoc test was employed to identify
      mean differences. The statistical power was determined to verify the statistical power of the
      analysis. For all statistical analyses, significance was accepted at P&lt;0.05.

    <description>Maximal dynamic strength was evaluated using the 1RM test assessed on chest press, knee extension, and preacher curl exercises performed in this exact order. Testing for each exercise was preceded by a warm-up set (6-10 repetitions), with approximately 50% of the estimated load used in the first attempt of the 1RM. This warm-up was also used to familiarize the subjects with the testing equipment and lifting technique. The testing procedure was initiated 2 minutes after the warm-up. The subjects were instructed to try to accomplish two repetitions with the imposed load in three attempts in both exercises. The rest period was 3 to 5 min between each attempt, and 5 min between exercises. The 1RM was recorded as the last resistance lifted in which the subject was able to complete only one single maximal execution</description>

    <measure>Change in anthropometric measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline 1; after 8 weeks (baseline2) and after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated electronic scale scale (Balmak), with subjects wearing light workout clothing and no shoes. Height was measured using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm while subjects were standing without shoes. Body mass index was calculated as the body mass in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. We also collected data on waist circumference (WC) and (HC) hip, using a flexible and inelastic tape measure. WC was obtained at the midpoint between the last rib and the iliac crest at the time of expiration and the WC was measured in the region of greater perimeter between the waist and the thigh. Two measurements were used to measure each circumference. In situations in which the difference between the measurements was greater than 0.5 cm a third measurement was performed, with the value of the median being adopted as reference. All measurements were performed by the same evaluator.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline 1; after 8 weeks (baseline2) and after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resting BP assessment was performed using automatic, oscillometric equipment (Omron - 7113). Participants attended the laboratory on three different days and, during each visit, remained seated at rest for 10 min with the cuff of the equipment in place on the right arm. Subsequently, several BP measurements were performed at one-minute intervals in order to obtain three consecutive measurements where the difference in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) readings differed by no more than 4 mmHg. The average of the three measurements for each day was averaged across the three visits.</description>

    <description>Food consumption were assessed by the 24-hour dietary recall method applied on two non-consecutive days of the week, with the aid of a photographic record taken during an interview. The homemade measurements of the nutritional values of food and supplementation were converted into grams and milliliters by the online software Virtual Nutri Plus (Keeple®, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for diet analysis. Some foods were not found in the program database and therefore items were added from food tables.</description>

    <description>Participants received a dose of 35 grams of whey protein before resistance training (RT) and a dose of 35 grams of maltodextrin (placebo) after RT.
Participants were personally supervised by physical education professionals with substantial RT experience. The sessions were performed 3 times per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with 3 sets of 08-12 repetition maximums. The RT program was a whole-body program with eight exercises, including: chest press, seated row, triceps pushdown, preacher curl, horizontal leg press, knee extension, leg curl and seated calf raise. Participants were afforded a 1 to 2 min rest interval between sets and 2 to 3 min between each exercise. The training load was consistent with the prescribed number of repetitions for the three sets of each exercise.</description>
