  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study with the combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel with
      the addition of enzalutamide in the treatment of subjects with metastatic prostate cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to assess if ADT + docetaxel + enzalutamide is well tolerated
      and demonstrates improved efficacy compared to ADT + docetaxel.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate the 12 month PSA
      complete response rate in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer treated
      with ADT, docetaxel and enzalutamide. The primary endpoint of this study will be 12-month PSA
      complete response rate, which will be assessed against a contemporary historical control rate
      for the combination of ADT and docetaxel alone in the metastatic hormone na√É-ve setting. The
      study will be conducted at all participating sites across North and South Carolina within the
      Levine Cancer Institute network. Enrollment is anticipated to be completed within 24 months.
