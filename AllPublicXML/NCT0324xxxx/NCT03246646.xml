      This project will develop and pilot test an enhanced, telephone &quot;coaching&quot; intervention to
      help family members concerned about a Veteran of the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan who needs to
      seek treatment for a substance abuse problem.

      The investigators will first develop a detailed manual for Coaching-CRAFT, which will be a
      telephone-based model of coaching that uses the web-version of an intervention already
      developed and available to the investigators. The investigators will conduct a preliminary
      nonrandomized feasibility trial of the use of Coaching-CRAFT with a sample of 50 family
      member callers recruited from VA's Coaching Into Care call center. Later in the study, the
      investigators will recruit up to 50 Veterans whose family members also participated in this
      study. Since the 'Coaching Into Care' telephone-based call center located at the Corporal
      Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center (CMCVAMC) is a national call center, study subjects
      (non-Veterans and Veterans) will be from all parts of the United States.

      Family members (spouses, siblings, or parents) of Veteran will be recruited from Coaching
      Into Care, and offered telephone-based coaching to the family member regarding their concern
      that the Veteran has a substance abuse problem and does not want to seek treatment. The
      program will involve approximately 12 telephone calls over 4-6 months. Family members will be
      assessed for their own mental health symptoms, their perception of their Veteran's mental
      health symptoms and substance use, his or her treatment, as well as their perception of
      burden on the relationship with the Veteran. These assessments will occur at study entry, 6
      months, and 12 months after study entry. Veteran's perceptions of the intervention will be
      sought at 12 months, whenever safe and practical. For Veterans who are not approached to
      participate in the study, VHA administrative data will be sought through a HIPAA Waiver to
      confirm any possible mental health and or substance abuse treatment the Veteran has received.
      Rates of initiation of treatment will be compared to QA data from the Coaching Into Care call
      center.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will be 10-15, 30-45 min. telephone sessions, every 2-3 weeks, with a target number ~12 and will last between 4 and 6 months. The Coach will introduce the ideas behind the content of each VA-CRAFT website module with the CSO, give the CSO an opportunity to view and read the content, and then discuss and individualize/ personalize the content in the next telephone conversation. The VA-CRAFT course for substance misuse has 8 modules that follow the original CRAFT intervention: 1) Introduction to CRAFT, 2) Overview of CRAFT, 3) Getting Started with CRAFT: Safety Planning, 4) Understanding substance abuse, 5) How to respond to substance abuse, 6) How to rebuild your life together, 7) How to help someone consider treatment, 8) Wrapping up. The goals include understanding triggers and long-term reinforcement of substance misuse, ignoring unhealthy behaviors and rewarding healthy behaviors, getting support, and how to help the CSO caller help the Veteran enter treatment.</intervention_model_description>
