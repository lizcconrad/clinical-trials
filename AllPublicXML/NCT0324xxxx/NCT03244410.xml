           increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet number (cooper N et al 2006)

        -  recent studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of ITP envolves multifactorial
           autoimmune mechanisms of both humoral and cellular immunity and that acute and chronic

    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by increased
      platelet destruction and decreased platelet number ( Cooper N et all 2006) platelet surface
      membrane proteins become antigenic for unknown reasons, leading to stimulation of the immune
      system, auto antibodies production and platelet destruction ( Gasbarrini A et all 2000) It is
      associated with the production of auto antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein
      complex 2b/3a and/or 1b/1x , resulting in accelerated destruction of platelets by the
      reticular endothelial system via the activity of Fcc receptor bearing phagocytic cells (
      Provan &amp; Newland et al 2002) Recent studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of ITP
      envolves multifactorial autoimmune mechanisms of both humoral and cellular immunity and that
      acute and chronic forms may represent two distinct immunopathological disorders ( Cooper N et
      al 2006) ( Gern Sheimer T 2009)

      There are many phases of the disease:

        1. Newly diagnosed ITP : for all cases at diagnosis.

        2. persistent ITP: for patients with ITP between 3 to 12 months.

        3. chronic ITP: for patients with ITP lasting more than one year ( blood journal 2009).

             -  Although lymphocytopenia is a commonly reported feature of many chronic autoimmune
                disorders, differential white cell counts at presentation have seldom been
                evaluated as predictors for development of chronic ITP ( Deel MD et al 2013) (Ahmed
                et al 2010)
