    <textblock>
      It has been proposed that the modulation of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system,
      through renal sympathetic denervation, besides reducing blood pressure, would promote an
      improvement in vascular reactivity and consequent improvement of macro and microcirculation.

      The present study aimed to investigate the influence of the renal sympathetic denervation on
      the skin microvascular function of patients presenting with resistant arterial hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial hypertension is still a serious public health problem with considerable social and
      economic impact. Arterial hypertension is the result from a complex interaction between
      environmental and genetic factors that initiate and perpetuate elevated blood pressure.
      Studies show that about 10% of patients undergoing treatment have resistant hypertension,
      defined as high blood pressure refractory to at least three antihypertensive drugs. It is
      known that the sympathetic nervous system plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of
      hypertension, contributing to metabolic and vascular changes. The sympathetic nervous system
      has also a major role in the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension. Arterial hypertension
      has also been associated with functional microcirculatory alterations as well as systemic
      microvascular endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients, confirmed by different
      microcirculatory flowmetry techniques. In this context, it has been proposed that the
      modulation of the sympathetic nervous system through renal sympathetic denervation, besides
      reducing blood pressure, would promote an improvement in vascular reactivity and consequent
      improvement of macro and microcirculation.

      The present study aimed to investigate the influence of the renal sympathetic denervation on
      the skin microvascular function of patients with resistant hypertension.
