  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, comparative, controlled, blinded study that will enroll a total
      of 70 adults that will undergo elective laparoendoscopic single-site incision gallbladder
      removal. The objective of this study is to compare Epidural versus General Anesthesia for
      postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, outcomes, and cost of post-cholecystectomy
      patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative, controlled, blinded study that will enroll a total of 70
      adult patients that require an elective cholecystectomy.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either general anesthesia (Group A) or epidural
      anesthesia (Group B) for their laparoendoscopic single site incision (LESS) gallbladder
      removal surgery (cholecystectomy). Randomization will be achieved using a computer-generated
      list. The patient will know what are they are randomized to before entering the operating
      room because an epidural will need to be placed preoperatively. Standards for basic
      anesthetic monitoring approved by the American Society of Anesthesiologists will occur
      intraoperatively.

      Postoperative evaluations will be completed by a medical professional that is blinded to the
      type of anesthesia used during the LESS surgery. Postoperative evaluations include a physical
      exam, adverse events, medication administration, vital signs and post-anesthesia recovery
      score for ambulatory patients (PARSAP) scores will be taken every 15 minutes until the
      patient has a score of at least 18.

      Patients will be followed 90 days postoperatively to collect pain scores, analgesic use,
      adverse events, and quality of life questionnaires.
