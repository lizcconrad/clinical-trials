             other toenails must be affected.

          6. Subjects must have a positive KOH microscopy for at least 1 great toenail at the
             screening visit.

          7. Subjects must be willing to complete clinical laboratory testing.

          8. Subjects must be willing to undergo alcohol and drug (e.g., benzodiazepines, cocaine,
             opioids, cannabinoids, and barbiturates) tests at the Day 1 visit.

          9. Subjects must be willing to remain at the study site for approximately 11 hours and
             undergo multiple blood draws on Day 1 and 28.

             undue risk.

          3. Subject with hypersensitivity to terbinafine or the vehicle excipients.

          4. Subjects who have been treated with systematic formulations of terbinafine in the 12
             months prior to the Day 1 visit.

          5. Subjects who have been treated with topical formulations of terbinafine in the 6
             months prior to the day 1 visit.
