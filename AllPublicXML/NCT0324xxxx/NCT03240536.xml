  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study intended to produce a reduction in ordering of inappropriate tests
      by general practitioners as determined by recommendations from the CRA's Choosing Wisely
      guidelines. This reduction of inappropriate testing is expected in referrals to the
      rheumatologists randomized to the intervention group. This study will further explore which
      recommendations from the Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA)/Canada Choosing Wisely
      campaign have the most impact on regional referring physicians to the Rheumatology clinic at
      St. Joseph's Hospital, London.

      This a randomized study in that 6 rheumatologists (30 referrals each) will be randomized to
      one of two groups: intervention or control. Referring physicians to the intervention group
      will be faxed a brief Choosing Wisely form (intervention) based upon the recommendations of
      the Canadian Rheumatology Association's (CRA) Canada Choosing Wisely campaign, while
      referring physicians from the control group will not receive the form (non intervention).
      Analysis will be based upon the results of a three question survey faxed to all referring
      physicians at year one and at year two and on future referrals from the referring physicians
      to determine if there is a reduction in the group of ordering physicians that received the
      intervention (Choosing Wisely form).

    <description>The investigators will fax a &quot;Choosing Wisely form&quot; to ordering physicians that will include information from the Canadian Rheumatology Association Canada Choosing Wisely Guidelines. Three points will be included with some additional explanation of why these are important.
The three guidelines included will be:
Don't order an ANA as a screening test in patients without specific signs or symptoms of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) or another connective tissue disorder (CTD).
Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless that are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology
Don' routinely order a shoulder ultrasound as it is likely to indicate a tear in many people over the age of 50 years and will not change the initial management.</description>
