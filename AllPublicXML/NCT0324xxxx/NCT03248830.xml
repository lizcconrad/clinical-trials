      The investigators will evaluate the accuracy of non-invasive hemoglobin monitor (Sp-Hb)
      compared to traditional laboratory hemoglobin (Lab-Hb) in children with congenital heart
      disease. The investigators will also compare the accuracy of Sp-Hb in cyanotic children to
      acyanotic children.

      Blood hemoglobin is measured daily in clinical practice. Laboratory measurement (Lab-Hb) of
      is the gold standard for assessment of blood hemoglobin. Recently, non-invasive monitors had
      been introduced. Non-invasive measurement of hemoglobin (Sp-Hb) would save time and minimize
      the risk of infection. Blood sampling in children is usually more difficult and stressful;
      moreover, it also carries the risk of iatrogenic anemia.

      Radical-7 (Masimo corporation, Irvine, CA) is a device that operates using the principle of
      co-oximetry . Radical-7 had been validated in various clinical purposes. Measurement of blood
      hemoglobin is an important application for Radical-7 device. Non-invasive hemoglobin (Sp-Hb)
      measurement has been frequently validated in adults; as well as in pediatric patients;
      however, its accuracy in children with congenital heart disease was not investigated.
      Congenital heart disease infants usually undergo major operations and frequently need
      transfusion of blood. Moreover, these patients have special circulatory physiology that might
      impact the device accuracy. It had been recently reported that the performance of co-oximetry
      in congenital heart disease children is poor in measurement of oxygen saturation specially at
      oxygen saturation under 75%; however, its accuracy in measurement of hemoglobin was not
      investigated yet. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the accuracy of Sp-Hb
      compared to traditional Lab-Hb in children with congenital heart disease. the investigators
      will also compare the accuracy of Sp-Hb in cyanotic children to acyanotic children.
