  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of sorafenib
      (out of 4 possible doses) that can be given in combination with busulfan and fludarabine
      before an allogeneic stem cell transplant and alone after the transplant. Researchers also
      want to learn if this combination can help to control acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The
      safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      use in solid tumors. Its use alone after a stem cell transplant and in combination with
      busulfan and fludarabine before a stem cell transplant is investigational. Busulfan and
      fludarabine are FDA approved and commercially available for use in stem cell transplantation.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Central Venous Catheter:

      The chemotherapy you receive, some of the other drugs in this study, and the stem cell
      transplant will be given by vein through a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile
      flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia.
      Some blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC. The CVC will remain in your body
      during treatment. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will
      be required to sign a separate consent form.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of sorafenib based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of sorafenib will
      be tested. At least 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of sorafenib is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of busulfan and fludarabine.

      Study Drug Administration:

      For a stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus
      days. The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem
      cells are called plus days.

      On Days -24 through -5, you will take sorafenib as a tablet by mouth once or twice a day.
      Your study doctor will explain how many tablets to take and when to take them. Your dose may
      change if you experience side effects.

      You will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If you receive busulfan as an outpatient, you will receive busulfan by vein over about 3
      hours on Days -20 and -13. You will be admitted to the hospital on Day -7 and will receive
      fluids by vein as part of your standard care. You will rest on Days -12 through -8.

      If you receive busulfan as an inpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -21 and
      will receive fluids by vein as part of your standard care. You will receive busulfan by vein
      over about 3 hours on Days -20 and -13. You will rest on Days -12 through -7.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing:

      About 11 samples of blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing at
      time points before and after you receive your first dose of busulfan and on Day -6. The study
      staff will tell you the blood testing schedule. PK testing measures the amount of study drug
      in the body at different time points and will help the doctor decide your dose of busulfan
      for Days -5 through -3.

      A heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed
      for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical
      reasons, you will be taken off study. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein
      over 1 hour.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

      On Days +3 and +4:

        -  You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. Cyclophosphamide is given to
           lower the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition in which
           transplanted tissue, such as stem cells, attacks the transplant recipient's body.

        -  You will receive mesna by vein over 30 minutes every 4 hours for a total of 10 mesna
           doses on Days +3 and +4. Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder
           caused by cyclophosphamide.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until you are able to take it
      by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day
      for about 50 days. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be lowered if you do not have GVHD.
      Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 90 days or
      longer, if you have a matched unrelated donor.

      Starting on Day +7, you will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day,
      until your blood cell levels are high enough. Filgrastim is given to help with the growth of
      a type of healthy white blood cells that fight infection.

      Starting between Day +30 and Day +120, you will take sorafenib as a tablet by mouth twice a
      day for up to 1 year. Each dose should be taken without food, at least 1 hour before eating a
      meal or at least 2 hours after eating. You should also take your dose of sorafenib with a cup
      (about 8 ounces) of water. Your study doctor will explain how many tablets to take and when
      to take them. Your dose may change if you experience side effects.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for up to 3 years after the transplant. You may be taken off study early
      if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine follow-up visits after the
      transplant, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have begun to receive the study drugs
      but before you receive the stem cells.

      Study Tests:

      As part of standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the
      transplant. While you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn every day
      to check for side effects, for routine tests, to check your blood counts, to check your
      kidney and liver function, and to check for infections.

      After you are sent home from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to be checked
      for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after transplant.
      During this time, you will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week. At each visit,
      blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After the first cycle, you may see
      your local doctor for follow-up tests/procedures.

      About 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:

        -  You will have a physical exam and you will be checked for symptoms of GVHD.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn to see how your body has reacted to the
           transplant.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the
           status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or other
           site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a
           large needle.
