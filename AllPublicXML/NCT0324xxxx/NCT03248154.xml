  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to analyze the different implications (such as graft loss and
      conversion of indeterminate depth burns) of biofilm infections in burn patients.
      Additionally, it also aims at comparing children's resistance to biofilm infection at wound
      site than adults'. 300 subjects from 3 different age groups will be enrolled in 3 arms.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be recruited from three different age groups: 2-18 years old, 18-49 years old,
      and ≥ 50 years old. 150 patients will be enrolled in each age group for arms 1 and 2. Arm 3
      consists of all patients enrolled in the study and involves drawing whole blood for analyzing
      cytokine response. Subjects will have at day 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 +/- 2 days (as applicable
      until graft surgery occurs).At each study visit the following will be collected: burn wound
      data [Lund-Brower Chart, TBSA burn size, date of onset, length, width, area, depth of burn
      injury (as applicable), Standard of Care (SoC) treatment for burn] will be recorded, SoC labs
      since the onset of the burn wounds will be recorded (CBC w/ diff and glucose as applicable),
      digital imaging of the burn injury(s), Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) will also be perfomed.
      Biopsies will be collected depending on the size of injury (4 from 2cm² burn size, to 10 from
      &gt;8cm² burn size). Blister fluid will be collected by draining the fluid with a needle and
      syringe.Subjects in arm 2 will receive their Standard of Care (SoC) dressing prescribed by
      their provider or will receive the study dressing, 4x4 Procellera that will be applied to a
      specific area of the burn injury.

      2 weeks after the grafting surgery, subjects will return for study visits at day 14, 21, 28
      post-grafting where the following activities will be completed - burn wound data and
      medication review, digital image of the burn injury(s), LDI imaging, HUSD imaging,
      trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement. Whole blood will be collected.

      Each subjects' medical chart will be followed for 3 months post completion of the study to
      identify patient outcomes (i.e. wound closure data, infection status/type, treatment status,
      surgical outcomes/complications - graft loss, patient death as applicable).
