      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the NVAF indication, Daiichi-Sankyo Thailand proposed this non-interventional
      study (NIS) to gain insight into the safety (bleeding, liver adverse events, all-cause
      mortality and other adverse events) of edoxaban use in non-preselected patients with NVAF.

      Edoxaban was recently approved by The Thai Food and Drug Administration (Thai FDA) (date: 2nd
      December 2016) for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF
      with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75
      years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Treatment of deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in
      adults.

      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the NVAF indication, Daiichi-Sankyo Thailand proposed this non-interventional
      study (NIS) to gain insight into the safety (bleeding, liver adverse events, all-cause
      mortality and other adverse events) of edoxaban use in non-preselected patients with NVAF.

      Real world evidence data of routine clinical practice use of edoxaban up to 2 years will be
      collected and evaluated in approximately 300 patients, treated by specialized as well as
      non-specialized physicians in hospital centres.

        Primary strategy is to include only patients with NVAF who are to be treated with edoxaban
        according to Package Information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)). To ensure
        that the physician's prescribing behaviour will not be influenced, patients may only be
        included after the treating physician has made the clinical decision to prescribe edoxaban.

        Patients must have provided written informed consent for participation in the study (ICF)
        and should not participate simultaneously in any interventional study.
