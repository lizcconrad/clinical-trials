  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals living with food insecurity are disproportionately affected by overweight and
      obesity and associated chronic health problems. There remains a lack of sustainable and
      scalable interventions targeting widespread barriers to access to healthy foods in this
      population to increase the nutritional quality of foods purchased for preparation and
      consumption at home.

      This randomized controlled proof-of-principle trial was designed to examine the feasibility
      and initial efficacy of a &quot;default option&quot; in enhancing the nutritional quality of groceries
      selected via the online shopping service of a local grocery store under conditions that mimic
      the financial constraints typical of individuals living with food insecurity.

      In behavioral economics, the &quot;default option&quot; refers to the option a consumer selects if no
      active choice is made. The notion of the default option is based on the concept of
      &quot;asymmetrical&quot; or &quot;libertarian paternalism,&quot; which seeks to subtly shift consumer behavior in
      a manner that promotes welfare, but without overtly interfering with the individual's freedom
      to choose.

      It was hypothesized that the &quot;default&quot; option effectively increases the nutritional quality
      of foods purchased online, compared to monetary incentives and psychoeducation about
      nutrition.

      Female undergraduate students (n = 60) selected food for one week using the online shopping
      service of a local grocery store with a budget corresponding to maximum weekly Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Before completing the task again, participants
      were randomized to: (1) a small monetary &quot;incentive&quot; for selecting groceries that meet
      nutritional guidelines (n = 17), (2) an &quot;educational&quot; brochure (n = 24), or (3) a &quot;default&quot;
      pre-filled online shopping cart containing a nutritionally balanced selection of groceries to
      which they could freely make changes (n = 18).

      Primary outcome measures capture the nutritional quality of groceries selected/ purchased.

    <description>The Thrifty Food Plan Calculator (TFPC) was used to quantify the nutritional quality of groceries selected by study participants. The TFPC was developed using U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition and consumption data and is designed to have users input information about the relative amount of money spent on various categories of food and provides comprehensive information on caloric, macro-, and micronutrient content of the foods selected based on participant age and gender.</description>

    <description>The &quot;default option&quot; is a behavioral economics construct that refers to the option a consumer selects if no active choice is made (e.g. opt-out 401K plans, which significantly increase enrollment, compared to active sign up).
Participants in the default condition were presented with a pre-filled online shopping cart containing a combination of groceries that meet macro- and micronutrient requirements for their gender and age, and told that they are free to delete, add, and exchange any item they wish to finalize their selections.</description>
