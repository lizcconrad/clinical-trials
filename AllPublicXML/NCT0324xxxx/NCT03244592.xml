  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to advance medication development for alcohol use disorder
      by examining the efficacy and mechanisms of action of minocycline, a neuroimmune modulator,
      as a potential treatment. This study has important clinical implications, as the available
      treatments for alcohol use disorder are only modestly effective and testing novel medications
      is a high research priority.

      The research objective of this project is to advance medication development for AUD by
      conducting a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, neuroimaging study to examine the
      effects of minocycline on neuroinflammation, alcohol cue reactivity, neurocognitive
      performance, and alcohol use. In the proposed study, non-treatment seeking individuals with a
      current DSM-5 AUD diagnosis (N = 32) will be randomized to receive either 200 mg of
      minocycline per day or placebo for 28 days and complete two laboratory sessions. The first
      laboratory session will be performed immediately before commencing the medication regimen
      (day 0) and the second will be completed after taking the medication daily for 28 days.
      Within each laboratory session, participants will complete a cue reactivity paradigm,
      neurocognitive performance tasks, and a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging session.
      Neuroinflammation will be assessed by using PET imaging with the radiotracer
      N-(2,5-dimethoxy-benzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl) acetamide, labeled with carbon-11
      ([11C]-DAA1106), which binds to the mitochondrial translocator protein, a marker of activated
      microglia in brain. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to
      measure circulating levels of proinflammatory markers and alcohol use over the four weeks of
      treatment will also be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 25 - 45

          2. Meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for an AUD [n.b., only participants with moderate or
             severe AUD will be enrolled]

          3. Drink ≥ 48 standard drinks in a 30-day period before enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently in treatment for AUD, a history of treatment in the 30 days before
             enrollment, or currently treatment seeking

          2. Current (last 12 months) DSM-V diagnosis of substance use disorder for any
             psychoactive substances other than alcohol and nicotine

          3. Lifetime DSM-V diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or any psychotic disorder

          4. Positive urine screen for narcotics, amphetamines, or sedative hypnotics

          5. Serious alcohol withdrawal symptoms as indicated by a score ≥ 10 on the Clinical
             Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised

          6. Pregnancy, nursing, or refusal to use reliable method of birth control (if female)

          7. A medical condition that may interfere with safe study participation (e.g., unstable
             cardiac, renal, or liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes)

          8. AST, ALT, or GGT ≥ 3 times upper normal limit

          9. Attempted suicide in the past 3 years and/or serious suicidal intention or plan within
             the past year

         10. Currently on prescription medication that contraindicates use of MINO

         11. Any other circumstances that, in the opinion of the investigators, compromises
             participant safety.

         12. Claustrophobia

         13. Participating in any other research study involving exposure to ionizing radiation in
             the past year will be excluded if the total cumulative exposure from the past research
             studies and the current research study would exceed the limits set by the FDA in 21
             CFR 361.1. Specifically, the total cumulated dose to the whole body, active
             blood-forming organs, lens of the eye, and gonads must remain below 5 rems, and the
             cumulated dose to all other organs must remain below 15 rems. Potential participants
             who have had exposure to ionizing radiation in the past year will not be allowed to
             participate if we are unable to obtain proper documentation quantifying the amount of
             past exposure.

         14. Presence of a metal device in the body (e.g., pacemaker, infusion pump, aneurysm clip,
             metal prosthesis or plate): Those devices could either interfere with the acquisition
             of the MRI scan of the brain or for whom the MRI scan would pose a potential risk. If
             participants have a non-removable device in their body, they must acquire and show a
             document exhibiting the device is MRI-compatible.
