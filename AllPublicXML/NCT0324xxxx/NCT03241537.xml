  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In local advanced prostate cancer patients with clinically positive metastatic regional lymph
      node, the optimal treatment is still unanswered. For these patients, radiotherapy combined
      with hormonal therapy or hormonal therapy alone are recommended. Recently, the reports from
      NCCB and SEER data showed that radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy have better
      survivals than hormonal therapy alone.

      This randomized phase III trial compare hormonal therapy alone with combined hormone with
      radiotherapy in clinically pelvic lymph node metastatic prostate cancer.
