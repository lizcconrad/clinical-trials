  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is a devastating condition, affecting 1.6-5/100,000
      children/year. Although their outcome is different, children with stroke do not recover
      better than adults, with at least 2/3 suffering long term sequels such as developmental
      (motor, global intellectual, language...) and behavioral disabilities, epilepsy, and low
      adaptative and academic skills...

      Stenotic cerebral arteriopathy is identified as AIS etiology in 60-80% of previously healthy
      children and the course of this arteriopathy is the strongest predictor of recurrent events.
      30-40% of these children have a focal unilateral cerebral arteriopathy (FCA). Childhood FCA
      is suspected to be an inflammatory vessel wall pathology triggered by varicella and other
      (viral) infections. As recurrences occur for the great majority in the first 6 months after
      the index event, aspirin 5 mg/kg/day is recommended for at least 18 months to 2 years.

      As there is a rational for using immunomodulatory drugs at the acute stage of FCA,
      immunotherapies are currently used by neuropaediatricians in AIS, mainly as steroids for
      children with stenosing arteriopathies. However, due to weak evidences, the literature cannot
      either encourage or discourage this practice.

      The long term course of children with FCA is only approach to date by retrospective studies
      and controversies about outcome remain (for example, the recurrence risk on antithrombotic
      treatment varies notably from quasi zero to 25%). And finally, it is shown in childhood
      stroke, as well as in the global field of longstanding impairment, that parental and medical
      points of view do not match consistently. Longitudinal studies are needed to deserve this
      familial approach.
