      This is a single-center, pilot study that will evaluate the effectiveness of the AHA science
      based CarePlans and the Ambio Health technology in improving the risk adjusted 30 day
      readmissions rate, patient compliance, and biometrics. The study will also be used to assess
      the feasibility of similar heart failure transition programs in the future.

      A key strategy of the Affordable Care Act is the Accountable Care Organization, designed to
      improve the quality of care, promote population health and reduce costs by making healthcare
      providers more accountable for health outcomes. With the increasing pressure to
      simultaneously improve care and reduce the overall cost of care, there is increasing need for
      better care coordination, especially for patients that are high risk for readmissions and
      poor health outcomes, to stay connected with their healthcare provider outside of the
      healthcare setting. Connected Heart Health is the American Heart Association's ACO
      (Accountable Care Organization) strategy for post-acute care. This includes evidence based
      CarePlans for heart failure, cardiac rehabilitation, and coronary artery disease. These
      CarePlans are brought to life with technology enabled by Ambio Health, which allows patients
      and doctors to be connected anytime and anywhere, encouraging the adoption of self-management
      skills, healthy living, and evidence based practice, resulting in fewer cardiovascular events
      and readmissions, and lower costs.

      Ambio Health is an end-to-end remote patient monitoring system which includes a weight scale,
      blood pressure meter and blood glucose meter with wireless transmission of biometric readings
      through a home gateway to a web-based care management application that provides population
      health remote patient monitoring and engagement with automated delivery of the CarePlans.

      Ambio Health will be introduced as a viable method for remote monitoring of heart failure
      patients, with an emphasis on reducing readmission rates and promoting self-management
      skills. This program is intended to implement the AHA's Connected Heart Health CarePlan and
      educational content for patients in conjunction with a platform designed to upload biometric
      data and provide care coordination as directed and implemented by discharging
      physicians/institutions. The intent is to design and execute a Pilot with Sinai Hospital of
      Baltimore.

    <description>Participants in the Connected Heart Health study will complete a 24 week CarePlan including education, biometric monitoring, and communication with the health care team members. Each day the participant will receive an email from Ambio Health with a daily task list that includes a variety of activities. These tasks include uploading biometrics (weight and blood pressure), completing assessment on self-management skills (nutrition, physical activity, and medication management), accessing educational content (videos, web links, interactive quizzes), participation in challenges, and communicating with the care team and care givers.</description>
