  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first administration of CCI15106 capsules for inhalation to humans.
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of single
      and repeat escalating doses of CCI15106 in healthy subjects and patients with moderate
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The intention of this study is to provide
      sufficient confidence in the safety of the molecule delivered by inhalation to inform
      progression to further repeat dose and proof of concept studies.

      This will be a three-part study. Part 1 will investigate single ascending doses and Part 2
      repeat ascending doses in healthy subjects. In Part 3, a single dose will be administered to
      patients with moderate COPD.

      There will be screening period of up to 30 days. The treatment period will be 3 days for
      Parts 1 and 3 and 16 days for Part 2. Follow-up will be performed within 30 days after the
      last dose.

  <why_stopped>
    The trial is terminated before investigation of repeat escalating doses as these will be
    conducted with the new formulation instead.
