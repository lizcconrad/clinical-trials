    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of endometriosis on folliculogenesis and
      oocyte quality. To do so, a metabolomic approach will be conducted in order to analyze the
      follicular fluid. This evaluation will be completed by a trancriptomic analysis from the
      cumulus cells of the oocyte.

      The normal and pathological oocyte cohort after controlled ovarian stimulation will be also
      characterized by identifying the oocyte leading to live birth.

      Endometriosis pathophysiology remains under controversy. Among the various issues raised,
      that of his involvement in an implantation failure related to an alteration of the
      endometrium is advanced by some authors. For others, infertility would be linked to an
      alteration of the oocyte quality responsible for embryonic development impairment leading to
      a lack of implantation. Several research groups have also mentioned the association of the
      two mechanisms.

      The oocyte quality evaluation is also subject to controversy. Indeed, its morphological
      approach remains the most commonly used in routine at the IVF laboratory. However, this tool
      remains limited and to date, no correlation between oocyte morphology and ART outcomes have
      been established. In this context, there is a real need to use functional approaches such as
      genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. However, the clinical validation and
      application of these functional tools have to be evaluated from a human pathology model such
      as endometriosis.
