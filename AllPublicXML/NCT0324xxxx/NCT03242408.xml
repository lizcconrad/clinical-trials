    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Serum total T below 300 ng/dL based on 2 consecutive blood samples obtained between 6
             and 10 AM, on two separate days at approximately the same time of day, following an
             appropriate washout of current androgen replacement therapy.

          2. Subjects should be diagnosed to be primary (congenital or acquired) or secondary
             hypogonadal (congenital or acquired).

          3. Na√Øve to androgen replacement or has discontinued current treatment and completed
             adequate washout of prior androgen therapy. Washout must be completed prior to
             collection of baseline serum T samples to determine study eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of significant sensitivity or allergy to androgens, or product excipients.

          2. Clinically significant findings in the pre-study examinations including abnormal
             breast examination requiring follow-up.

          3. Abnormal prostate digital rectal examination (DRE) with palpable nodule(s).

          4. Subjects with symptoms of moderate to severe benign prostatic hyperplasia.

          5. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value, in the opinion of the investigator,
             in serum chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis

          6. Positive test result for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAV-IgM), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) or human
             immunodeficiency virus antibodies (HIV Ab).

          7. History of gastric surgery, cholecystectomy, vagotomy, bowel resection or any surgical
             procedure that might interfere with gastrointestinal motility, pH or absorption.

          8. History of any clinically significant illness, infection, or surgical procedure within
             1 month prior to study drug administration.

          9. History of stroke or myocardial infarction within the past 5 years.

         10. History of or current or suspected prostate or breast cancer.

         11. History of untreated and severe obstructive sleep apnea.

         12. History of long QT syndrome (QTc &gt; 450) or unexplained sudden death in a first degree
             relative (parent, sibling, or child).
