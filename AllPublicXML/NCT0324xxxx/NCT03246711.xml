      Many pregnant muslims women fast during Ramadan Since fasting during Ramadan is one of the
      five pillars of Islam and is a central part of Muslim culture, many women may fear a loss of
      connection with their communities or would feel guilty if they did not observe Ramadan. Each
      year, about 400 million out of 1 billion Muslims do this duty. Such tasks like eating,
      drinking, and smoking are forbidden from sunrise until sunset. Fasting during pregnancy has
      been always considered as a debatable condition.

      Many women ask their obstetricians if fasting is safe for their baby or not? There have been
      many studies on metabolic changes and different aspects of human health during and after
      Ramadan .but there have been few studies on the effect of fasting on pregnancy outcome and
      there are also some controversies in the findings of different studies.

      All mothers within the age range of 20 - 35 years and in the 3rd trimester pregnancy
      (starting from 28 weeks) which is going to be calculated according to the date of the last
      menstrual period &amp; confirmed ultrasonically, normal healthy women with average body mass
      index (BMI) and Women included have no medical disorder.

      Women who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were subjected an ultrasound fetal biometry
      every 2 weeks till delivery and assess fetal weight after delivery.
