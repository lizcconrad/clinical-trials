  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current randomized controlled trial is a pilot study that will assess the effectiveness
      and feasibility of a mobile phone application intervention. The objective is to determine
      whether the use of a mobile health application for patient self-management of depression
      improves patient-provider engagement for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be a randomized, real-world effectiveness study. Patients diagnosed
      with major depressive disorder starting a new prescription for an antidepressant monotherapy
      will be eligible for participation. The study will enroll 40 patients (20 in an observational
      arm of usual care and 20 with access to a mobile health application). No intervention will
      occur in the usual care arm. The intervention in this study is a mobile health app, which
      provides patients with a way to track emotional wellbeing and depression symptoms, set up
      medication reminders, track adherence to medications, record side effects experienced, and
      take surveys/tests to assess cognitive symptoms and depression. Patient reported outcomes and
      clinical data will be collected at baseline and at study primary endpoint (18 weeks) to
      assess changes over time and between groups for: patient-provider engagement, disease
      severity, quality of life, employment productivity, cognitive function, resource utilization,
      and medication adherence. Additionally, resource utilization will be assessed at the one year
      time point. A Student's t test, if allowed for by the data distribution, will be used to
      assess between group differences in patient reported outcome scales assessing
      patient-provider engagement.
