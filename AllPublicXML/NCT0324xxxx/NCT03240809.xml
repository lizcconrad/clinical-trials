        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject's parent(s) or legally acceptable representative has provided informed
             consent, using an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board
             (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF), when the subject is legally too young to
             provide informed consent and the subject has provided written assent based on local
             regulations and/or guidelines prior to any study-specific activities/procedures being
             initiated, or when the subject has any kind of condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed
             consent.

          2. Males and females ages 6 to &lt;18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of screening

          3. Subjects must have up-to-date immunizations according to the relevant local country
             guideline. Subjects must not be scheduled to be vaccinated while on study.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at Baseline (Day 1). A female
             of childbearing potential is defined as a female who is fertile, following menarche.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received conventional systemic therapies or phototherapy for treatment of psoriasis
             within the last 4 weeks. Topical corticosteroids are allowed.

          2. Female subjects who have reached puberty and are sexually active and are unwilling to
             use acceptable methods of effective birth control for the duration of the study and
             continuing for 5 weeks after receiving the dose of study drug. Acceptable methods of
             effective birth control include sexual abstinence (males and females); double barrier
             method (male condom with spermicide in combination with one female barrier method
             [diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge)]; or hormonal birth control; or
             intra-uterine device.

          3. Female subjects who are lactating/breastfeeding or who plan to breastfeed while on
             study through 5 weeks after receiving the dose of study drug.

          4. Female subjects with a positive pregnancy test.

          5. Female subjects who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant while on study through
             5 weeks after receiving the dose of study drug.
