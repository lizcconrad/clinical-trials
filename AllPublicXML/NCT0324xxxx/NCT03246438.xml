  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a 3-arm randomized control trial assessing the effectiveness of
      sequential or active choice in CRC (colorectal cancer) screening outreach vs. colonoscopy
      outreach only, in patients between 50-74 years old, who have received care at the University
      City or Valley Forge CCA (Community Care Associates) practices, are due for screening, and
      are asymptomatic for CRC. The three arms are: Arm 1: Direct schedule colonoscopy (Control),
      Arm 2: Direct schedule colonoscopy followed by mailed FIT(Fecal Immunochemical Test)
      (Sequential Choice), and Arm 3: Choice of direct schedule colonoscopy or mailed FIT (Active
      Choice).

      This pilot study is a 3-arm randomized control trial assessing the effectiveness of
      sequential or active choice in CRC screening outreach vs. colonoscopy outreach only. The
      investigators will randomize participants to one of three study arms:

      Arm 1: Direct schedule colonoscopy (Control) Arm 2: Direct schedule colonoscopy followed by
      mailed FIT (Sequential Choice) Arm 3: Choice of direct schedule colonoscopy or mailed FIT
      (Active Choice).
