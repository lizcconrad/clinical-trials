  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that addition of pembrolizumab will enhance the efficacy of
      carboplatin and pemetrexed in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation and ALK
      (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) positive NSCLC patients who have disease progression following
      prior TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

    <description>The primary endpoint is Response Rate (RR) defined as the rate of complete and partial response. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis). Partial Response (PR): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) but does not qualify for PD. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS) time</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from registration to time of progression. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Exon 19 deletion or Exon 21 L858R or L861Q or exon 18 G719X or S7681 EGFR mutation
             positive NSCLC patients with progressive and measurable disease.

          -  Tumor tissue for PD-L1 assessment should be available unless PD-L1 assessment results
             are already available.

          -  Patients should not have received any systemic chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.
             Patients who have received neoadjuvant, adjuvant or as part of concurrent chemotherapy
             and radiation are eligible if they received the chemotherapy 12 months or more before
             the start of study therapy.

          -  ECOG PS 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status: an attempt to
             quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. The score
             ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5 is death.)

          -  Patients should have recovered to ≤ grade 1 from clinically meaningful (example
             alopecia is not considered clinically meaningful) adverse events related to prior
