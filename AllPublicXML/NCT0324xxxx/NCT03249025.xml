  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is defined as 'an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with
      actual or potential tissues damage, or described in terms of such damage&quot;. It is estimated
      that 1 in 5 Canadians experience chronic pain &quot;Chronic pain is associated with the worst
      quality of life compared with other chronic diseases such as chronic lung or heart disease&quot;.
      Many of these problems are confined to a specific anatomic structure, and can be diagnosed
      and treated by injections, physical therapy, surgery, etc. Nonetheless, other individuals
      experience a more generalized pain. This condition has also resulted I depressed mood, bad
      relations with other people, sleep disturbances and poor quality of life.

      The condition is very difficult to manage, and multiple methods have been recommended.
      Therapeutic intravenous infusion may be considered as one of these methods. Patients come for
      infusions of non-opioid medications under medical supervision and in a scheduled fashion. Two
      most commonly used mediation are lidocaine and ketamine.

      Even though it is common to use multiple medications with complementary mechanisms of action
      to treat pain a combined lidocaine-ketamine infusion has never been studied Therefore, the
      purpose of this research study is to determine whether mixture of two medications (ketamine
      and lidocaine) infused intravenously 1 time per month for 6 months results in reduction of
      pain unpleasantness.
