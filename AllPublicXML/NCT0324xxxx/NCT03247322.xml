  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TRANSAFE Rx is a 12-month, parallel two-arm, 1:1 randomized controlled clinical trial,
      involving 136 participants (68 in each arm) measuring the clinical and economic effectiveness
      of a pharmacist-led intervention, which utilizes an innovative mHealth application to improve
      medication safety and health outcomes, as compared to usual post-transplant care. The primary
      goal of the TRANSAFE Rx study is to demonstrate significant reductions in med safety issues
      leading to reduced healthcare resource utilization in kidney transplantation through a
      pharmacist-led, mHealth-enabled, intervention. This study will provide detailed and novel
      information on the incidence, etiologies and outcomes of med errors and adverse drug events
      in this high-risk population; while also demonstrating the effectiveness of this intervention
      on reducing the incidence and impact of med safety issues in kidney transplantation.
