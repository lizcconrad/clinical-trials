      Follow-up of Arthrosurface HemiCAP shoulder implants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In summary, the investigators would like to contact all patients who have had HemiCAP
      implants done at CCF with at least 2 years of follow-up after their procedure. The
      investigators will use electronic or written means to alert the patients that they will be
      contacted by our team to discuss their surgery and any related issues. Once the appropriate
      consent is obtained, the investigators will use a brief telephone interview to ask the
      patients several questions regarding any re-operations or complications the patients have had
      since the index procedure.
