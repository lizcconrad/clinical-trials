  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation through stronger informal caregiving, the
      proposed study will modify and evaluate a telehealth Transition Assistance Program (TAP) for
      informal caregivers of individuals with SCI during the transition from hospital to home. The
      TAP was previously developed for stroke caregivers and has been found to decrease caregiver
      strain and depression. In the proposed study, the TAP will be modified for SCI and
      implemented at a state-of-the-art SCI rehabilitation facility with a very high volume of SCI
      treatment and with telehealth technology already in place through which to test the
      intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCI Caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the TAP group or to a control receiving
      the standard care provided by the rehabilitation facility. The TAP begins before discharge
      and extends across six weeks. It includes three components to improve caregiver mental health
      and informal care: (1) skill development, (2) education, and (3) supportive problem solving.
      TAP caregivers will receive an SCI caregiving guidebook, a 1-hour intervention session by an
      SCI clinician before hospital discharge, and four 1-hour telehealth clinic-to-home visits at
      1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after discharge by the same clinician. Data will be collected from
      caregivers and individuals with SCI at baseline immediately before discharge and at 2 and 4
      months after discharge.
