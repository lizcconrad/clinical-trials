    <textblock>
      Specific aims of the 1-year project are to pilot test the disclosure support intervention by
      (a) evaluating acceptability and feasibility with a preliminary randomized trial among 10
      HIV+ mothers (5 in the intervention group and 5 in the treatment as usual (TAU) group) and
      (b) assessing outcomes in mothers (quality of life and mental health indicators, adherence,
      social support, and disclosure stress, efficacy, readiness, and completion). The intervention
      will be compared to treatment as usual, with baseline (0 weeks), immediate post-intervention
      (4 weeks), and 12-week follow-up (16 weeks) assessments.

    <textblock>
      HIV disclosure to children has been shown to strengthen family relations and increase
      assistance with medical care, reinforcing the parent's willingness to live. Some Chinese
      children aware of their parents HIV diagnosis do exhibit emotional and social dysfunction;
      however, adequate support from caregivers (e.g., grandparents or even their HIV+ parents) can
      improve the children's quality of life and academic performance. There is a clear need for
      practical interventions to address parental distress around HIV disclosure in China, where
      cultural norms often emphasize family identity and cohesion and underscore the need for
      family-based programs, which have been shown to be feasible and efficacious for HIV-affected
      families.

    <description>The intervention will include three components: (a) assessment; (b) decision-making and support; and (c) disclosure, planning, and action. The individualized assessment comprehensively will consider the family's history, experiences with disclosure, communication skills, coping resources, and factors likely to affect disclosure (e.g., familial, psychological, social, cultural, and medical issues). The second component of decision-making and support focused on developing communication skills and strategies, with role-play and practice outside of the sessions as necessary. Costs and benefits of disclosure were considered along with the range of disclosure options. Materials, including a pros and cons chart of disclosure and a disclosure continuum worksheet, were used to stimulate discussions of possible plans and consequences. In the third component, parents were encouraged to formulate and practice a disclosure plan for later use.</description>
