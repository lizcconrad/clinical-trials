  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies, we found that POF (A combination of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and
      Paclitaxel) regimen appears to be of good efficacy and is well tolerated in patients with
      advanced gastric cancer. Apatinib is an orally antiangiogenic agent. It was approved and
      launched in China in 2014 as a 3rd-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.
      Therefore, investigators initialize this dose escalation phase I study to explore the safety
      of combination of apatinib and POF as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer.
      Investigators will analyze the maximum tolerated dose (MDT) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      of apatinib in this study.

    <description>This study will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort. Cohort 1: apatinib 250 mg per day and POF. Cohort 2: apatinib 375 mg per day and POF. Cohort 3: apatinib 500 mg per day and POF. Cohort 4: apatinib 625 mg per day and POF. Cohort 5: apatinib 750 mg per day and POF.
A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the following events in the first 4-week period:
CTCAE Grade 4 event (except for neutropenia lasting for ≤ 5 days);
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea and vomiting that could be improved with optimal supportive care, escalation of alkaline phosphatase)
If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the dose escalation ceased. The MTD was defined as the dose having at most two out of six patients experience DLT.</description>
