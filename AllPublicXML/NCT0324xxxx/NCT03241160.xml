      The study is planned to determine the relationship between chewing performance level and
      gross motor function, and trunk postural control in cerebral palsy (CP). Chewing performance
      level will be determined by the chewing performance scale. The Gross Motor Function
      Classification System (GMFCS) will be used to determine gross motor function levels.
      Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) will be used to measure trunk control. The
      correlations between chewing performance level and gross motor function, and trunk postural
      control will be assessed. The Chi-square test will also be used to compare GMFCS levels and
      trunk control in children with and without chewing disorders.

    <description>Chewing evaluation will be performed. An experienced physical therapist who will take a scale training session will do the chewing evaluation according to the chewing performance scale.This scale classifies chewing function on an ordinal scale with five levels between 0 and 4 based on the sequence of functional movements during chewing.</description>
