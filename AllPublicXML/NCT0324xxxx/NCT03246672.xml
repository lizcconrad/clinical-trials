  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although bariatric surgery is highly effective for inducing significant weight loss and
      resolution of comorbidities, weight regain following surgery is a common problem. This pilot
      study will test the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention designed to help
      bariatric surgery patients maintain weight loss. Findings from this pilot will provide the
      foundation for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first intervention telephone call will occur one week following the baseline assessment.
      Calls will be made weekly in the first month (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4) and biweekly calls during
      months 2-4 (weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 14). The goal of this intervention is to increase adherence
      to recommendations that patients are already receiving from their bariatric team as part of
      standard of care. Thus, each call will address maintenance skill building and anticipatory
      problem solving based on the processes outlined in the investigators' conceptual model and
      operationalized in the investigators' previous weight loss maintenance protocol. Relapse
      prevention planning will help patients identify situations in which overeating is common in
      the bariatric population (e.g., loss of control eating related to emotions, disinhibition).
