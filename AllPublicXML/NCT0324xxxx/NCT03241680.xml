  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the third most frequent neoplasm in Brazilian women (estimated risk of
      15.33 cases / 100,000 women by 2014), behind breast and colorectal cancer.

      This high incidence is explained by the pre-neoplastic lesions of the cervix being probably
      related to the practice of unsafe sex and to a poor local immune response against HPV.

      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection affects people of any age, although it is more common in
      young people, probably due to increased sexual activity in that period.

      The association between high-risk HPV and anus neoplasm in men and women with
      immunodeficiency or immunosuppression has been confirmed and measures related to surveillance
      are standardized.

      In patients without immunodeficiencies, this association is still unclear, which may
      contribute to the lack of adequate standards to diagnose HPV and prevent cancer of the anus.

      The frequency of the cancer of anus previously considered low, is currently in considerable
      elevation, mainly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

      The causal relationship between this virus and cancer of the cervix and the anus is
      established. These facts have motivated the inclusion of this disease as STD, which justifies
      the necessity of adopting surveillance measures in the clinics of sexual, gynecological and
      urological diseases.

      Cancer of the anus, when diagnosed in the early stage, makes healing possible with less
      aggressive treatments, but in the advanced stage, abdominoperineal amputation is necessary.

      Concerned about possible anal cancer, some gynecologists have referred patients with genital
      HPV to search for anal infection.
