  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single arm, two-stage study of abraxane with an anti-PD1/PDL1
      (pembrolizumab) in cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced urothelial cancer.

      Each cycle last 21-days. All subjects will receive abraxane via IV on Day 1 and Day 8 of each
      cycle. Subjects will either receive pembrolizumab (IV) on Day 1 of each cycle. Subjects may
      continue to receive the study regimen until they experience disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>The Overall Response Rate (ORR) will be the percentage of patients that achieve either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.
PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response (DOR) is measured from the time that response (PR or CR) is met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented.
CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.
PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival time</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death.
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
