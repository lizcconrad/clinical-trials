  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury (cTBI) symptoms exist in individuals who experienced previous
      traumatic brain injuries. There are 80-90 thousand individuals who are clinically diagnosed
      with cTBI, with estimated costs at greater than 60 billion dollars. However, there is a lack
      of studies using comprehensive diagnostic imaging tools to better understand physiological
      ramifications of the injury that may help guide therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project will be to create a comprehensive, extensive, longitudinal
      diagnostic evaluation of cTBI patients. The evaluation uses a battery of neurocognitive
      tests, laboratory levels of specific inflammatory compounds, and functional MRI, PET, and
      quantitative EEG. Participants shall be evaluated with this overall test battery initially,
      and then at approximately 3 and 6 months to determine the time course of changes within the
      brain associated with an integrative medicine approach. Three groups of participants will be
      enrolled in the study: anti-inflammatory diet group, a group who receive N-acetyl cysteine,
      and control group. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid,
      L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement that is also available as an
      injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose.
      Laboratory studies have displayed some benefits to use of NAC. It has the potential to reduce
      markers of oxidative damage, protect against cell death, and to increase glutathione in
      blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in TBI patients.

    <description>N-acetyl Cysteine: This arm provide patients with a natural supplement, n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) which is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine, that supports antioxidants to reduce oxidative damage in the body. NAC is a common over-the-counter supplement. It is used as an injectable pharmaceutical to protect the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have suggested that NAC might have a beneficial effect in neurodegenerative disorders such as TBI. Patients in this arm will receive IV NAC once a week plus oral NAC supplement 500 mg twice per day for approximately 3 months until the follow up evaluation.</description>
