  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase II study to evaluate antitumor activity of oral cMET inhibitor INC280 in adult
      Chinese patients with EGFR wild-type, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
      received one or two prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease as
      measured by overall response rate (ORR). The study will also evaluate safety and
      pharmacokinetics of INC280.
