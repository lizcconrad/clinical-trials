  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid optimization in neurosurgical patients has an important impact on preservation of
      cerebral perfusion pressure and minimization of cerebral oedema during and after the
      craniotomy. The investigators would like to know if crystalloids or colloids are equally
      useful for goal directed therapy in this patients. The investigators will record haemodynamic
      stability, volume loading and postoperative complications and compare two groups of patients.
      One group will be optimised with crystalloids and the second with colloids. The investigators
      will compare also hospital stay and mortality in the two groups.

    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic stability and maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) are important in
      neurosurgical patients. Fluid management includes maintenance of intravascular volume,
      preservation of cerebral perfusion pressure and minimization of cerebral oedema. Fluid
      management of the neurosurgical patient has advanced from &quot;run them dry&quot; to &quot;run them
      isovolaemic, isotonic and iso-oncotic, but the induction of potential complications by
      current strategies are still unknown. Advanced techniques provide goal directed fluid therapy
      which is currently the gold standard in fluid strategy. In patients undergoing craniotomy
      diuretics, preoperative fasting, induction of general anaesthesia and intraoperative bleeding
      may lead to hypovolemia and poor cerebral perfusion. On the other hand fluid overload
      increases complications and hospital stay after surgery. It is, therefore, important that
      optimal fluid levels are achieved.

      The aim of the study was to compare intraoperative hemodynamic stability, volume loading and
      postoperative complications between group optimised with crystalloids and group optimised
      with colloids in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedure. The investigation will include
      80 patients, 40 optimised with crystalloids and 40 with colloids.

      Hemodynamic stability, volume loading, pooperative complications, hospital stay and mortality
      will be monitored during and aftre the surgery.
