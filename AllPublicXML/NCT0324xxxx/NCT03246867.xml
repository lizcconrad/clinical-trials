    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the acute effects of isolytic and
      static stretching training in individuals having subacromial impingement syndrome with
      glenohumeral internal rotation deficit. Isolytic group will receive isolytic stretching in
      modified cross body position. Static group will receive static stretching in modified cross
      body position. Stretching groups will be evaluated before and just after stretching exercise.
      Control group will receive no stretching. Control group will be evaluated for the first time
      and then will be waited until the duration of the stretching exercise program. Afterwards,
      second evaluation will be performed

      There is no information in literature about the acute effects of isolytic stretching exercise
      in individuals having subacromial impingement syndrome with glenohumeral internal rotation
      deficit. The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the acute effects of
      isolytic and static stretching training in individuals having subacromial impingement
      syndrome with glenohumeral internal rotation deficit.

      In modified cross body position, static stretching group will perform active-assistive static
      stretching by the physiotherapist whereas isolytic stretching group will perform
      active-assistive isolytic stretching. Stretching exercises will be applied five times each
      for 15 seconds. After each stretching there will be a resting period for 5 seconds. Control
      group will receive no stretching. They will be handed a brochure about the stretching
      techniques and its role in injury prevention. Isolytic and static stretching groups will be
      evaluated before and just after stretching exercise. Control group will be evaluated for the
      first time and then will be passively waited until the duration of the stretching exercise
      program (approximately 4-5 min). Afterwards, second evaluation will be performed.

    <intervention_model_description>There are 3 groups. First group will receive isolytic stretching in modified cross body position. Second group will receive static stretching in modified cross body position. The stretching exercise will be applied five times each for 15 seconds. After each stretching there will be a resting period for 5 seconds. Control group will receive no stretching. They will be handed a brochure about the stretching techniques and its role in injury prevention. Isolytic and static stretching groups will be evaluated before and just after stretching exercise.
