  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) have significantly worse outcomes than those with either ASD alone or ADHD
      alone. Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for
      young children with ASD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase
      2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically
      addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and (2) identify
      changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved outcomes in
      children with comorbid ASD and ADHD. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether a
      stimulant treatment augments efficacy of a novel, parent-delivered, behavioral intervention
      based on the Early Start Denver model (P-ESDM). Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy
      of combined intervention in improving ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine
      correlations between behavioral changes and state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and
      electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts
      attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and to potentially identify new targets for
      intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is about 1 year long (52- 60 weeks).
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication or placebo, which
      will be administered over the course of 24 weeks (weeks 0-24). The behavioral intervention
      with coaching will be provided for 12 weeks (weeks 10-22) to all participants. Between weeks
      24 to 52 participants will continue behavior intervention without coaching and will be given
      the option to pursue ADHD medication outside of the research study.

    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-3) Adaptive Behavior Composite score is derived from the standard scale scores of the three major adaptive behavior subscales (Socialization, Communication and Activities of Daily Living) of the VABS-3, which is administered as a semi-structured interview with the same caregiver over study endpoints. The composite score is a standardized measure of adaptive behavior (things people do to function in their everyday lives). The standardized mean is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. The adaptive level of domain and adaptive behavior composite scores of 130 to 140 is considered &quot;High&quot;, 115 to 129 is &quot;Moderately High&quot; , 86 to 114 is &quot;Adequate&quot;, 71 to 85 is &quot;Moderately Low&quot;, 20 to 70 is &quot;Low&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sustained Attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 10, 24 (week 0 = baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A naturalistic parent-child interaction task (PCIT) (DeVito et al. 2016) will be administered to assess sustained attention. Children and their parents are observed during a series of tasks that include play interactions with developmentally appropriate toys. Tasks are video recorded and children are reliably coded using a behavioral coding scheme by raters na√Øve to diagnostic status in terms of each of several engagement states: unengaged, onlooking, object-focused, person-focused, supported joint attention, and coordinated joint attention.</description>

    <measure>Change in ADHD symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 6,10,16, 24, 52 (week 0 = baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) will assess symptom frequency using data from clinician completed ADHD-RS and parent completed ADHD-RS (only parent-completed ADHD-RS is completed at week 52).
ADHD-RS includes 18 items, each rated on a 4 point scale (0-3);Total Score is the sum of all responses (0-54). An Inattention subscale and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale (each range 0-27) are calculated based on individual items assessing those symptoms. Higher values represent worse outcomes for the subscales and the total scale. Normative scores are available. Clinically significant scores in boy are 14 for inattention items and 17 for hyperactivity/impulsivity items. Clinically significant thresholds in girls are 12 and 14 respectively. A supportive exploratory analysis will examine change to a nonclinically significant score by week 24 (using clinician rating) and week 52 (using only parent ratings) . If subscales are used, they would be summed to compute the total score.</description>

    <description>Study drug will be administered in the morning. Treatment will be initiated at 1 tablet = 3.1 mg or 0 mg of mixed amphetamine. Doses will be flexibly titrated upward by 1 tablet = 3.1 mg or 0 mg every 2 weeks unless there are intolerable adverse effects or great improvement in ADHD symptoms to a target dose of 4 tablets = 12.4 mg or 0 mg of Adzenys- XR-ODT. The allowable dose range will range from 1.6/0 mg (1/2 tablet) to 18.6/0 mg (6 tablets). Doses may be reduced at any point during the trial (typically in 1 tablet increments) but only may be increased every two weeks in order to fully assess potential benefits and adverse events of the current dose.</description>
