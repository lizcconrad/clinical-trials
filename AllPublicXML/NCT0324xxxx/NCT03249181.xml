    <textblock>
      To evaluate dolutegravir (DTG) efficacy in women who present with untreated HIV in late
      pregnancy.

      An open-label, multi-centre randomised controlled trial of DTG vs efavirenz-based regimens
      for women commencing cART in late pregnancy. HIV positive pregnant women presenting with
      untreated HIV infection in late (â‰¥28 weeks gestation) pregnancy will be randomised 1:1 to
      receive DTG (50mg once daily) + 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or EFV
      + 2 NRTIs (SoC)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomised controlled trial of DTG versus EFV -based regimens for 250
      women commencing cART in late pregnancy, randomised 1:1 to DTG vs EFV-based cART. The purpose
      of this study is to inform treatment guidelines and for the first time specifically address
      the treatment needs of this group of women- hence the trial is powered for superiority over
      EFV. The primary endpoints is maternal VL at delivery, with secondary endpoints including
      safety and tolerability of DTG in both mother and infant, VL decline in breast milk,
      development of drug resistance, pharmacokinetics of DTG in mother-infant pairs,
      pharmacogenomics factors relating to efficacy or toxicity of DTG, and MTCT of HIV up to 72
      weeks postpartum. Two sites have been selected - Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere
      University, Kampala, Uganda and the University of Cape Town, South Africa - both have a
      strong track record of successfully delivering collaborative multidisciplinary research in
      PMTCT. Furthermore, health economics analysis to examine costs and cost-effectiveness of DTG
      in late-presenting pregnant women will be conducted

      The desired outcome of this project is to establish high quality evidence and operational
      guidance for use of DTG in late pregnancy. Late-presenting HIV-infected pregnant women are an
      important, but neglected group of vulnerable individuals in whom a randomised controlled
      intervention of HIV treatment has never previously been undertaken. This work will be done in
      relationship with WHO and the Clinton Health Access Initiative to ensure successful delivery
      of the project objectives.
