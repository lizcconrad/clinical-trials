  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 3 laboratory experiments the effect that receiving a small vs. large portion size of food
      has on later intake of that food was examined

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historical increases in the size of commercially available food products have been linked to
      the emergence of a worldwide obesity crisis. Although the acute effect portion size has on
      food intake is well established, the effect that exposure to smaller portion sizes has on
      future portion size selection is yet to be examined.We tested whether reducing a food portion
      size may 'renormalize' perceptions of what constitutes a normal amount of food to eat and
      result in people selecting and consuming smaller portions of that food in future. Across
      three experiments participants were served a large or smaller portion of food. In experiments
      1-2, twenty four hours later participants freely selected and consumed a portion of that
      food. In experiment 3, one week later participants reported on their preferred portion size
      of that food.
