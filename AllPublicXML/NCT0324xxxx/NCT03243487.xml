  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial studying adherence to positive
      airway pressure therapy in a population referred to the VA system for the treatment of sleep
      disordered breathing. The primary aim of the study is to determine if, compared to standard
      care provided at a VA Sleep Center, the deployment of a structured adherence management
      program and a web-based information program designed for participants beginning positive
      airway pressure therapy results in a greater portion of participants meeting Centers for
      Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) adherence requirements (use &gt; 4 hours for &gt;= 70% of days)
      at 90 days.

      The primary aim of the study is to determine if, compared to standard care provided at a VA
      Sleep Center, the deployment of a structured adherence management program and a web-based
      information program designed for participants beginning positive airway pressure therapy
      results in a greater portion of participants meeting CMS adherence requirements (use &gt; 4hrs
      on &gt;=70% of nights) at 90 days.

      Secondary aims:

        1. Results in higher nightly use of therapy (hours per night and % of nights with at least
           4 hours of use) at 90 days

        2. Results in participant satisfaction that is superior to current standard care

        3. Offers operational efficiencies or economic benefits to the health care facility
           (reduced staff time (sleep clinic and physician), equipment consumption, unplanned
           participant contacts or visits, and reduced overtime)

        4. Results in indirect benefits to participants (fewer clinic visits, less travel or
           in-clinic/ office visit waiting time)

    <description>Study participants will be randomly assigned to have their Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) or Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) therapy followed by a structured patient adherence management service (PAMS).
Interventions: Call to patient by sleep coach on days 3,7,14,32,45, 60, and 75 after participants begin PAP treatment. At each time frame sleep coach reviews CPAP adherence data on EncoreAnywhere (EA) a cloud based program collecting adherence data via wireless modem on CPAP units. Calls will not be made at days 7 and 14 if adherence is good. If problems are identified and cannot be handled over the telephone the problems will be escalated to VA MD or CPAP respiratory therapy (RT) providers for direct intervention. All patients are seen in sleep clinic by a VA MD sleep provider 3 months after starting treatment.</description>

This includes a telephone number that patients can call or problems and review of adherence data on EncoreAnywhere (EA) at 4 to 6 weeks after starting treatment. Patients are seen in sleep clinic by a VA MD sleep provider 3 months after starting treatment.</description>
