  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the overall rate of endoscopic clearance of complicated bile duct
      stones by Spyglass DS peroral cholangioscopy guided holmium:YAG laser/electrohydraulic
      lithotripsy versus conventional BML.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, complicated bile duct stones are removed during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) by conventional mechanical lithotripsy, which means using a
      metal wire basket to capture the stone and crush it to make it easier to remove. This is
      successful in approximately 70% of patients, with the success rate inversely correlated to
      the size of the stone. Unsuccessful stone removal would require additional endoscopic,
      percutaneous or surgical interventions. Spyglass DS peroral cholangioscope-guided holmium:YAG
      laser/electrohydraulic lithotripsy is a recent alternate method for managing complicated bile
      duct stones. Also performed during ERCP, a thin flexible camera (called Spyglass DS peroral
      cholangioscope) is inserted into the bile duct to visualize the stone which can then be
      targeted by a laser beam for fragmentation (also known as laser lithotripsy). The smaller
      pieces are then removed. Direct comparisons of these procedures' efficacy however have not
      been performed.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Spyglass DS peroral
      cholangioscope-guided holmium:YAG laser/electrohydraulic lithotripsy (the laser arm) versus
      conventional basket mechanical lithotripsy alone (the conventional arm) for fragmentation and
      clearance of complicated bile duct stones.

    <description>The 1.8Fr holmium:YAG laser fiber (Lumenis, Yokneam, Israel) will be inserted into the cholangioscope's working channel for lithotripsy under direct visualization. An EHL probe may alternatively be used depending on availability. Lithotripsy is applied until fragments of the targeted stone are no longer lumen filling, and can be dispersed easily with fluid irrigation. Fragmented stones are then removed by a combination of conventional techniques. To confirm stone clearance, the Spyglass DS cholangioscope will be re-introduced, and the bile duct will be examined for residual stones from the confluence of the right and left intrahepatic ducts to the papillary opening</description>

    <description>Biliary sphincterotomy with/without EPBD to the size of the lower bile duct with a limit of 15mm will be performed. Stones are removed by a combination of conventional BML, extraction balloon and/or baskets, without laser lithotripsy. An occlusion cholangiogram is performed to confirm stone clearance. In cases where stone clearance is incomplete, a plastic biliary stent bridging the stone will be inserted for temporary drainage until definitive management, usually within one month.</description>
