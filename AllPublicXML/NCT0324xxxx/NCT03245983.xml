  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of research is to identify and analyze the impact and role of spirituality
      (as a search for meaning and understanding of the meaning of existence) in the experience of
      cancer. For this purpose, the main objective of this study is to measure the &quot;existential&quot;
      component in the trajectory of the disease. It is a question of observing its potential
      contribution to the improvement of the quality of life of the patients and to define if this
      variable can be translated into a strategy of adjustment for the patients. This research has
      a double interest: (a) clinical interest in better managing patients' needs; (B) an interest
      in research in the field of health by combining a measure of spirituality with other
      psycho-social variables.

      The project is a prospective non-randomized mono-centric study by questionnaire and research
      interview. It is a study that seeks to identify the role of spirituality in the experience of
      illness (i.e. representations, adjustments, emotional distress) and as a determinant of the
      quality of life of subjects with cancer pathology.

      The interviews will be conducted by a psychologist to qualitatively collect the elements of
      the lived experience of the disease in connection with the spiritual elements of the &quot;quest
      for meaning&quot; type.

      The population covered by the project is in and out patients coming to the Department of
      Medical Oncology and Palliative Care at the CHU de la Timone.

      The realization of this project will allow investigators to explore the specificity of the
      existential / spiritual dimensions of patients confronted with cancer, to assess the
      patients' needs for this type of approach within the hospital, to link the existential
      component / Spiritual with psycho-social variables
