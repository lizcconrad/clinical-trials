  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether daily dosing with NYX-2925 changes markers of
      central pain processing in subjects with fibromyalgia by evaluating changes in evoked pain,
      and visual stimulation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state function
      connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (H-MRS) in fibromyalgia subjects on active drug versus placebo.

      This is a single-blind, exploratory, placebo-controlled, pilot study to assess the efficacy
      and safety of daily oral NYX-2925 in fibromyalgia subjects. The study will include a
      screening period (up to 30 days), a placebo period, an active treatment period with, and a
      follow-up period as follows:

        -  Placebo PO Every Day (QD) for 2 weeks

        -  NYX-2925 PO QD for 2 weeks (2x)

        -  Follow-up for 1 week

      Eligible subjects will receive MRIs during the screening period, during the placebo period,
      during the NYX-2925 PO QD period. Safety assessments will be conducted and adverse events
      will be collected during the study. Daily pain scores and other fibromyalgia scales will be
      collected during the study. Daily pain scores and other fibromyalgia scales will be collected
      for exploratory analysis. During the follow-up period, an optional MRI will be completed for
      consenting subjects in order to evaluate duration of effect.
