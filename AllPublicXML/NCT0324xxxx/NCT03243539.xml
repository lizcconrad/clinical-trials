  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who experience lung injury are often placed on a ventilator to help them heal;
      however, if the ventilator volume settings are too high, it can cause additional lung injury.
      It is proven that using lower ventilator volume settings improves outcomes. In patients with
      acute brain injury, it is proven that maintaining a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide
      in the arterial blood improves outcomes. Mechanical ventilator settings with higher volumes
      and higher breathing rates are sometimes required to maintain a normal partial pressure of
      carbon dioxide. These 2 goals of mechanical ventilation, using lower volumes to prevent
      additional lung injury but maintaining a normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, are both
      important for patients with acute brain injury. The investigators have designed a
      computerized ventilator protocol in iCentra that matches the current standard of care for
      mechanical ventilation of patients with acute brain injury by targeting a normal partial
      pressure of carbon dioxide with the lowest ventilator volume required.

      This is a quality improvement study with the purpose of observing and measuring the effects
      of implementation of a standard of care mechanical ventilation protocol for patients with
      acute brain injury in the iCentra electronic medical record system at Intermountain Medical
      Center. We hypothesize that implementation of a standardized neuro lung protective
      ventilation protocol will be feasible, will achieve a target normal partial pressure of
      carbon dioxide, will decrease tidal volumes toward the target 6 mL/kg predicted body weight,
      and will improve outcomes.
