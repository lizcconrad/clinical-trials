    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent
      obstruction of upper airway, leading intermittent oxygen desaturation and repetitive arousals
      during sleep, which can cause enhanced sympathetic activity, elevated levels of vasoactive
      substance concentration and vascular damage, and therefore, increase the risk of hypertension
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents the airway collapse, avoids the
      occurrence of intermittent hypoxemia and arousal, is the preferred treatment for OSAS and has
      been widely used in clinical. In theory, CPAP maintains upper airway patency and preserves
      ventilation, thereby inhibits the chain reaction over activation of the sympathetic nervous
      system and blood pressure regulating mechanism, thus CPAP treatment have adequate scientific
      basis to cause a substantial reduction arterial blood pressure, but controlled studies showed
      either no effect or only a minor decrease in arterial blood pressure by 1.4 and 2.5 mmHg
      respectively.The current, which type of combination of hypertension OSA patients can obtain
      the best antihypertensive benefit from CPAP therapy is still under debate.

      Previous studies have shown that frequent blood pressure fluctuations associated with
      respiratory events can lead to increased blood pressure levels at night and even during the
      daytime in patients with severe OSA with hypertension. Continuous monitoring of nocturnal
      blood pressure fluctuations in OSA patients, not all OSA patients exhibited significant
      apnea-related nocturnal BP surges, some patients' nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations were
      independent of respiratory events, some spontaneous contractions, without respiratory events,
      micro-arousal, and leg movement ,which can lead to transient increases in blood pressure.
      Moreover, some patients did not show significant BP fluctuation but with high baseline BP
      level. If hypothesis that nocturnal BP fluctuation was irrelevant to the respiratory events
      or no obvious BP fluctuations existence during sleep, in these case, even if apnea or
      hypopnea events were eliminated by CPAP treatment, but a low size in antihypertensive effect.
      If BP fluctuations were the closely related to respiratory events and frequent nocturnal BP
      fluctuations resulted in daytime and nocturnal hypertension, in these case, CPAP treatment
      can significant lower both daytime and nocturnal BP level. A number of previous studies have
      shown that the efficacy of CPAP in decreasing BP level was unsatisfied. The investigator
      supposes whether or not during the process of recruitment, the characteristics of blood
      pressure fluctuation of OSA patients were not considered and result in a false judgment that
      the inefficacy of CPAP treatment on lowering BP levels.

    <textblock>
      Evidences have shown that the magnitude of antihypertensive induced by CPAP were correlated
      with apnea/hypopnea index (AHI).The severe OSA patients benefit from CPAP treatment was
      greater than mild-moderate patients. But whether or not all severe OSA patients with
      hypertension obtain obvious antihypertensive effect from CPAP therapy? In this study, one
      hundred and fifty subjects with severe OSA were recruited and categorized into three groups:
      Group l: systolic blood pressure index was less than 30% of AHI; Group 2: systolic blood
      pressure index was less than 60% but more than 30%; Group 3: systolic blood pressure index is
      more than 60% of AHI. Nocturnal dynamic BP changes was monitored continuously during
      polysomnographic examination via pulse transfer time(PTT) based method. The investigator
      would compare the effect of CPAP treatment on awake and sleep BP level at the first night and
      2 weeks therapy among three groups. Moreover, whether or not the sympathetic-parasympathetic
      nerve balance and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are different in three groups
      would also be evaluated. The main purpose of study is to confirm the OSA with hypertension
      and OSA secondary hypertension are two different concepts. Basis for the clinical treatment,
      the former, CPAP might have no effect or only a minor decrease in arterial blood pressure,
      while the latter CPAP treatment might achieve significant antihypertensive effect.

      Additionally, to evaluate the sympathetic-parasympathetic nerve balance and the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in two phenotypes of diseases are different, and whether
      the decrease in blood pressure caused by CPAP treatment is related to these mechanisms
