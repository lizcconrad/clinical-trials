  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the RaindropÂ® Near Vision Inlay for the
      improvement of near vision in presbyopes treated with low dose, short duration Mitomycin C
      (MMC) during surgery and an extended low dose steroid regimen after surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgical procedure includes a low dose, short duration MMC treatment on the exposed
      stromal bed of the non-dominant eye, before the unilateral implantation of the corneal inlay.
      This treatment is at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (0.02%) applied for 10 to 30 seconds on the
      stromal bed as well as the stromal side of the corneal flap or pocket. In the third month
      after surgical procedure, one-drop a day of low dose steroid will be continued for the
      duration of the 24-month follow-up period to maintain corneal health.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients require a near reading add from +1.5 to +2.5 D in the non-dominant eye.

        Patients have a photopic pupil size of at least 3.0 mm in the non-dominant eye. Patients
        have a corneal thickness greater than or equal to 500 microns in the non-dominant eye.

        Patients have corrected distance and near visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

        Patients have distance corrected near visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in each eye.

        Patients are willing and able to sign and understand a written Informed Consent Form prior
        to any study-specific procedures.

        Patients are willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 24 months
        after the corneal inlay surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with prior ocular surgery. Patients with clinically significant dry eye (i.e.,
        significant diffuse punctate staining with fluorescein and a tear breakup time less than 8
        s) in either eye.

        Patients with a planned corneal residual bed thickness that is less than 300 microns
        (corneal thickness - (intended ablation depth + intended flap thickness)).

        Patients with macular pathology based on dilated fundus exam and/or optical coherence
        tomography (OCT) image.

        Patients who would be co-managed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is not approved
        as a ReVision Optics investigator.

        Patients with ocular pathology or disease (including pupil pathology such as fixated
        pupils) that might confound the outcome or increase the risk of adverse event.

        the risk of adverse event. Patients taking isotretinoin or amiodarone hydrochloride and any
        other medication that affects the tear film or accommodation, including but not limited to,
        mydriatic, cycloplegic and mitotic agents, tricyclic, phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, and
        first generation antihistamines.

        progressive retinal disease or subjects with a history or evidence of retinal vascular
        occlusion and/or hypercoagulability, because of the risks associated with high pressures
        during suction application.

        Patients with known history of steroid-responsive intraocular pressure increases, glaucoma,
        preoperative IOP &gt; 21 mm Hg, or are otherwise suspected of having glaucoma.

        lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromylagia), immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV), connective tissue
        disease, or clinically significant atopic syndrome such as allergies or asthma.

        Patients on chronic systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy that may
        affect wound healing.

        Patients with any type of active cancer (ophthalmic or non-ophthalmic). Patients with
        uncontrolled infections of any kind. Patients who are pregnant, lactating, of child-bearing
        potential and not practicing a medically approved method of birth control, or planning to
