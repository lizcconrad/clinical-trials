  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer pain is undertreated despite a good access to opioids in France. Although many factors
      are involved, the barriers related to the patient (and his family) are often reported .the
      reluctance of the patient or the family to take the prescribed medication is linked to
      misconceptions about the opioids , cultural barriers; or the lack of explanations provided by
      the physician. Some patients can have undiagnosed slight cognitive impairment .The situation
      is now more complicated as appear on the market the new form of opioids for the cancer
      breakthrough pain drug, adding one more opioid formulation in the prescription. The goal of
      the study is to measure the adherence to opioids in cancer out patients and the associated
      factors.
