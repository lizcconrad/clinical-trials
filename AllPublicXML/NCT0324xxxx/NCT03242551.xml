    <textblock>
      The BINC-B trial is a diagnostic and interventional study in which various function imaging
      methods as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PWI, DWI and DCE-MRI) and will be compared with common
      imaging methods (mammography and/or ultrasound) to investigate if an early response to a
      combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable or potentially operable breast cancer. For
      breast cancer patients with positive HER-2, additional Herceptin could improve the response
      further. In this study the efficacy of combined neoadjuvant therapy with or without Herceptin
      should be evaluated and the role in predicting the tumor response with different imaging
      should be estimated.

      Firstly, the investigators aim to show that the results of functional imaging including
      dynamic enhanced, diffuse weighted, and perfusion MR imaging biomarkers as well the
      ultrasonic outcome could be used to predict the response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy for
      operable and potentially operable breast cancer (luminal B, HER-2 positive and triple
      negative).

      Secondly, the investigators will study the role of peripheral blood biomarker including
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and subsets,
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and lymph cell subsets and their combinations could
      predict the response of the tumor measured with imaging.

      Thirdly, the investigators will establish a mode with these multiple imaging and serum
      biomarker panel as well as their changes during the treatment course establish to predict the
      response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
