  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate whether the
      Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD), an anti-Inflammatory diet tailored to a multi-cultural
      population, can improve cognitive functioning in a middle aged (40-65 yr) urban population in
      Bronx, New York compared to a usual diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Multicultural Healthy Diet (MHD) is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial designed
      to test the effects of an 18 month intervention on cognitive function among 326 middle-aged
      individuals (40-65 yr) who have suboptimal diets. MHD is an anti-inflammatory diet tailored
      to a multicultural population. The emphasis of the intervention is on plant-based foods and
      limited animal and high saturated fat foods with focus on anti-inflammatory foods/food
      components specific to the cultural context of the participants. The trial will employ a
      parallel group design comparing the effects of the dietary intervention (MHD) on cognitive
      status to those of the control diet or usual diet plus modules on self-care matters such as
      dealing with aches and pains of aging, obtaining a health care proxy ,etc. To show that MHD
      can be adapted to this population serum biomarkers indicative of the MHD diet pattern such as
      fatty acid profile as well as other key nutrition biomarkers will be evaluated. Other aims
      include testing whether the MHD intervention can benefit cognitive function using real-time
      ambulatory assessments. The investigators will also assess plasma markers of oxidative stress
      and inflammation. Components of the MHD diet that are associated with stable or improved
      measures of cognition will also be evaluated. The clinical site for the proposed study is at
      the Albert Einstein College of Medicine; the ambulatory cognitive assessment reading center
      is at Pennsylvania State University, State College; the statistical core is at the University
      of Pennsylvania and the laboratory for biospecimen analysis is at the University of
      Minnesota.
