  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention based on a
      psychoeducational program carried out by primary care nurses, to improve the rate of
      remission and response of depression in patients with physical chronic illness (diabetes,
      COPD, asthma and / or ischemic heart disease). Secondarily, to assess the cost-effectiveness
      of the intervention, the effectiveness to improve the control of physical pathology, the
      impact on quality of life and the feasibility of the intervention.

      Methods: a multicentre, randomized clinical trial, with two groups and 1 year follow-up
      evaluation. Economic evaluation study. We will study 504 patients (252 in each group), over
      50 years assigned to 25 primary care teams (PC) from Catalonia (urban, semi-urban and rural)
      with major depression and with at least one of the diseases: diabetes mellitus type 2,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and / or ischemic heart disease. They will be
      distributed randomly into two groups. The intervention group will participate in
      psychoeducational groups: 12 weekly 90-minute sessions led by two nurses from PC, consisting
      of health education on chronic physical illness and depressive symptoms.

      Main measurements: clinical remission of depression and / or response to intervention (Beck
      depression inventory: BDI-II). Secondary measures: improvement in control of chronic disease
      (blood test and physical parameters), drug compliance (test Morinsky-Green and number of
      packaging), quality of life (EQ-5D), medical service utilization (appointments and hospital
      admissions due to complications) and feasibility of the intervention (satisfaction and
      compliance). Evaluations will be masked and conducted at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months.
