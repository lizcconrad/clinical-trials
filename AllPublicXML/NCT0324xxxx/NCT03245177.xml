  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and in the U.K alone; there
      are 38,000 new cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) a year. The new treatment being
      tested in this study is called pembrolizumab, this is a type of immunotherapy, which works by
      stimulating the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells.

      Pembrolizumab blocks a protein on the T-cell surface (one of the cells of the immune system),
      which then triggers the cell to find and kill cancer cells. This will be given with
      radiotherapy to see if this combination is safe and effective at treating patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      Pembrolizumab has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for other cancers such as
      melanoma and lung cancer. Radiotherapy is often given as standard treatment to treat lung
      cancer, and is proven to be a safe and tolerable treatment. However, the safety of the
      combination of Pembrolizumab and thoracic radiotherapy delivered concurrently has not been
      tested yet prospectively

    <description>Pembrolizumab is given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a maximum dose of 200mg. The first dose of pembrolizumab is administered 14 days prior to the initiation of radiotherapy and every 3 weeks thereafter. Radiotherapy is given as a standard dose (60-66 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction) over 40-45 days (daily on Mon-Fri) Following completion of radiotherapy, participants will continue to receive pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 12 months of maintenance treatment.</description>
