  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the Marginal integrity of Hydroxyapatite Nanofiber
      reinforced flowable composite compared to a conventional resin-based flowable composite
      during management of initial carious lesion in adult population over a one year period.

    <textblock>
      A total of 26 volunteer patients with at least 2 non-cavitated molar teeth will be assigned
      in this study. Patients will be divided into two groups according to type of flowable
      composite (R) where groups R1 the pits and fissure will be sealed with Hydroxyapatite
      Nanofiber reinforced flowable composite while groups R2 the pits and fissure will be sealed
      with conventional resin-based flowable composite. Each restoration will be assessed after one
      week, six and twelve months Both materials will be applied according to manufacturer's
      instructions where teeth should be cleaned to remove surface stains, then select appropriate
      shade of the flowable composite, A rubber dam is the preferred method of isolation, etch and
      rinse adhesive system is applied, where acid etching will be applied for 15 seconds then
      rinse and dry followed by application of adhesive then light cure 10 seconds, then place and
      cure in 2 mm increments of the flowable composite for 20 s., gently remove oxygen inhibition
      layer after light cure with slurry of pumice or polishing paste All restorations were
      reviewed after 1 week, 6, 12 months by two investigators who were blinded to the material
      used for the restorations. All restorations were be evaluated by calibrated examiners
      following the FDI criteria

    <description>restorations will be reviewed after 12 months by two investigators who are blinded to the material used for the restorations. All restorations will be evaluated by calibrated examiners following the FDI criteria Data will be explored for normality using Kolmogrov-Smirnov test and Shapirowilk test. Comparisons between before and after treatment for normally distributed numeric variables will be done by Wilcoxon sign test. Comparisons between categorical variables will be performed using the chi square test Mcnemar test. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significance. All tests will be two tailed.</description>
