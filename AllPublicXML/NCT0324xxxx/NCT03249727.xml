  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the activity of natural killer (NK) cells using the in vitro
      diagnostic device NK Vue in high risk subjects (Quebec risk categories P3 and P4) scheduled
      for colonoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Quebec, subjects in categories P3 and P4 are scheduled for colonoscopy for one of the
      following reasons: suspicion of having an inflammatory bowel condition, rectal bleeding,
      presence of occult blood in stool, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, recent change in bowel
      habits, family history of CRC or adenomatous polyps or other hereditary colorectal diseases.
      Often, colonoscopy is not performed within the government-prescribed recommended delays,
      leading to waiting lists for the procedure. Analysis of NK cell activity may help identify
      those at risk for the presence of CRC and therefore help prioritize subjects on these waiting
      lists, help manage resources and help convince subjects to have a colonoscopy. Furthermore,
      all subjects will undergo a FIT, allowing a determination of the ability of each test alone,
      as well as a combination of NK Vue and FIT, to predict outcome on colonoscopy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects aged 40 and over who are scheduled to undergo colonoscopy at the research
             site and who are classified in category P3 or P4.

          2. Subjects who provide informed consent to participate in the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lack of understanding and/or participation due to illiteracy or inability to
             comprehend English or French

          2. Subjects in category P3 who are there due to knowledge or suspicion of an inflammatory
             bowel disease

          3. Previous history of cancer (any type) or active infection (as declared by the subject
             at the time of enrolment)

          4. Currently participating (or participated within the previous 120 days) in an
             investigational therapeutic study (in case of interference of the drug with the immune
             system)

          5. Subjects who underwent their colonoscopy and

               1. the colonoscopy preparation was judged insufficient

               2. the colonoscopy itself was judged insufficient or incomplete by the doctor

               3. the biopsy sample was lost and cancer could not be pathologically confirmed

               4. the colonoscopy detected an inflammatory bowel disease

          6. Female who is pregnant, nursing, or of child-bearing potential while not practicing
             effective contraceptive methods.
