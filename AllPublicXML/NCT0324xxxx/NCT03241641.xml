  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of CHB patients with genotypic resistance to NUCs has been problematic due to the
      lack of data from randomized trials. Recently, two randomized trials comparing the efficacy
      of TDF monotherapy versus TDF and ETV combination therapy in CHB patients with documented
      genotypic resistance to adefovir (ADV) or ETV demonstrated TDF monotherapy was not
      statistically different in viral suppression at week 48 of treatment.1,2 The extension study
      based on the above two trials merged study subjects from these trials with changing from TDF
      and ETV combination group to TDF monotherapy to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of TDF
      monotherapy for multidrug-resistant patients. At the time of merging of 192 subjects, by
      intention-to-treat analysis, 66.3% of TDF group and 68.0% of TDF-ETV group had virological
      response as determined by serum HBV DNA &lt;15 IU/mL. (in press) Three year long-term follow up
      study showed that the proportion of virologic suppression increased to 76.8% and 72.2% in
      TDF-TDF and TDF/TDF-ETV groups, respectively( P=0.46). (in press)

      TAF, a novel prodrug of tenofovir was developed to have greater stability in plasma than TDF,
      thereby enabling more efficient delivery of the active metabolite to target cells at a
      substantially lower dose. The reduced systemic exposure of tenofovir offers the potential for
      an improved safety profile compared to TDF a benefit that demonstrated in a recent clinical
      trial in patients with HIV infection. In a recent double-blind randomized phase 3
      noninferiority trial with 873 treatment naive patients who were positive for HBeAg, the
      proportion of patients receiving TAF who had HBV DNA &lt;29 IU/mL at week 48 was 64%, which was
      non-inferior to the rate of 67% in patients receiving TDF (P=0.25).3 In the safety profile,
      TAF group had significantly smaller decrease in BMD than TDF group in the hip and spine, as
      well as significantly smaller increases in serum creatinine at week 48.3 For treatment naive
      HBeAg negative patients, a recent study with 425 subjects applied the same methodology and
      showed noninferiority in efficacy of TAF compared to TDF at week 48.4 Considering
      noninferiority in efficacy and superior bone and renal safety from TAF, TAF might be
      considered preferred choice of NUC instead of TDF. However, it is still unknown whether TAF
      would show similar efficacy and safety profile in patients with multidrug-resistant CHB.

      Study objectives The objective of this study is to evaluate whether efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability (including bone and renal outcomes) were non-inferior in patients switched to a
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), compared with patients who remained on tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF).

      Study procedures This is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study to
      evaluate safety and non-inferior efficacy of switching from TDF 300 mg QD to TAF 25 mg QD for
      48 weeks in chronic hepatitis B patients who have genotypic resistance to Adefovir/Entecavir.

      174 subjects who complete the previous IN-US-174-0202/0205 studies will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio (A:B) to receive either TAF 25 mg QD or TDF 300 mg QD Case group: approximately 87
      subjects administered TAF 25 mg QD Control group: approximately 87 subjects administered TDF
      300 mg QD

      The primary analysis will occur at Week 48 with the primary efficacy endpoint being newly
      achievement and maintenance of virologic response (HBV DNA &lt;60 IU/mL at Week 48).

      The duration of maintaining both arms is 48 weeks. All subjects who complete 48 weeks of
      treatment are eligible for participation in the open label TAF 25 mg extension period for an
      additional 48 weeks (through Week 96)
