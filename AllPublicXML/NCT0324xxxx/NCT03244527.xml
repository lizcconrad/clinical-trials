  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few years, Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) supplements have gradually used on
      different groups. From training athletes, maintaining functions of healthy elders to
      preventing disabilities of people that can't do intense exercises. BCAAs are now considered
      to be able to prevent muscle atrophy and strength loss, also possible to increase strength
      and muscle mass if combined with resistance exercises. Stroke patients have difficulties with
      moving, which led to multiple disabilities, are more likely to have sarcopenia and strength
      loss. Furthermore, reducing the will of moving or walking. Recently, studies showed that
      combined BCAAs with resistance exercises can effectively increase muscle mass, thus commonly
      used on training athletes.

      Although aerobic exercises are proven to be more likely to improve walking ability of chronic
      stroke patients than traditional rehabilitation, BCAAs' effects are yet to be proven.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore if BCAAs combined with moderate intensity
      exercises can prevent muscle atrophy, loss of strength and cardiopulmonary function.

      This is a randomized control trial. Participants are randomly assigned to either experiment
      or control groups. Both group received aerobic exercise (30 min in a session, 3 days a week,
      and for 8 weeks). Experiment group received BCAA supplement immediately after the exercise
      while the control group receive sham product (vitamins). The outcome measurements (including
      muscle mass, functional measures, and quality of life) are performed before (0-wk) and after
      (8-wk) the interventions, also after interventions in 3 months and 6 months for follow up.

      Setting : inpatient rehabilitation department of Wan-Fang Hospital and Shuang-Ho Hospital
      Study population : Patients received inpatient treatment or rehabilitation for stroke in
      Wan-Fang Hospital (WFH) and Shuang-Ho Hospital (SHH).

      Study design: controlled trial with randomization Blinding : The patients were blinded by the
      real or sham bcaa supplements. The assessors who performed the outcome measurements were
      blinded to the assignment of treatment.

      Measurements : DXA(Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry),CPET(Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing),6
      minute walk test,Timed up and go,Berg balance test,Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale
      (SS-QOL).

      These measurements (including the clinical and corticomotor excitability assessments) are
      performed by one researcher who are responsible for the measurements.

      Compliance and side effect. The compliance of supplements were investigated. The attendance
      of treatments (including bcaa supplements and physical therapy sessions) and possible side
      effect/discomfort were recorded during the interventions by a researcher. He also tries to
      understand the reason of drop-out from the study.
