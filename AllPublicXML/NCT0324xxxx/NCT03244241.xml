  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia during admission is associated with increased rate of complications and longer
      hospital stays, thus insulin treatment is recommended for all diabetes patients with
      hyperglycemia. Inpatient studies of non-critically ill patients show better glycemic control
      with the use of basal-bolus insulin therapy compared to sliding scale insulin therapy, but
      increased rates of hypoglycemia. The investigators hypothesize that basal-bolus insulin
      therapy with a new ultra-long-action basal insulin can treat hyperglycemia more efficiently
      than sliding scale insulin, with few episodes of hypoglycemia.

      The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of basal-bolus
      insulin therapy using the insulin analogue, insulin degludec once daily and insulin aspart
      before meals versus standard therapy with sliding scale insulin in non-critical ill
      hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The design of the trial is an open, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms
      (treatment arm and control arm). Randomization is 1:1.
