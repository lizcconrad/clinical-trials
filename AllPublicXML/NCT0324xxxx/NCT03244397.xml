      OBJECTIVE: To find out the effectiveness of physical therapy for stages I and II pelvic organ
      prolapse. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled and single blinded clinical trial. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of these groups: Experimental group: physical therapy + training in
      lifestyle advice; Control group: just training in means of lifestyle advice. In both groups
      several physical therapy assessments will be undertaken: 1st before intervention; 2nd
      immediately after completing intervention; 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th after 3, 6, 12 and 24
      months. SUBJECTS: Women with previously untreated prolapse of stage I or II (confirmed by
      their gynaecologist using the POP-Q) in Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias Hospital, provided that there is
      no contraindication for physical therapy, and after reading, understanding and freely signing
      an informed consent form. SAMPLE SIZE: A total of 120 subjects will be included in the study
      (60 subjects in each group). DATA ANALYSIS: A descriptive analysis will be done of all the
      variables, as well as bivariate analysis in order to find all the possible relationships
      between the variables. A confidence level of 95% (p&lt;0.05) will be established for all the
      cases. Effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing between the two groups of the change in
      outcome variables between visits.

    <measure>Change of Life impact of Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD) will be assessed by the PFIQ-7 Spanish version.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 assessments to evaluate the change from baseline: at baseline, after the intervention period, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The PFIQ-7 consists of 3 scales of 7 questions each taken from the Urinary Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire. The 3 scales are scored from 0 (least impact) to 100 (greatest impact) and an overall summary score (0 to 300).</description>

    <measure>Change of Symptoms and Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed by PFDI-20 Spanish version</measure>
    <time_frame>6 assessments to evaluate the change from baseline: at baseline, after the intervention period, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>PFDI-20 that is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress (QoL) caused by pelvic floor symptoms. The PFDI-20 includes 20 questions and 3 scales. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The sum of the scores of these 3 scales serves as the overall summary score of the PFDI-20 and ranges from 0 - 300 and the higher the score, the worse QoL. The 3 scales include questions taken from the following widely used outcome measures: Urinary Distress Inventory - 6 questions, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory - 6 questions, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory - 8 questions collecting data about UI, POP and colorectal and anal symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change of Pelvic Floor Muscle (PFM) strength will be measured by manometry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 assessments to evaluate the change from baseline: at baseline, after the intervention period, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Three maximum PFM contractions will be requested and will be used the mean value. For the manometry (cm2O2), an air-filled probe will be used (&quot;Peritron&quot;, Melbourne, Australia)</description>

    <description>Three maximum PFM contractions will be requested and will be used the mean value. For the dynamometry (gr) a two-arms speculum (&quot;Pelvimeter Phenix&quot;, Montpellier, France) in mid-sagittal plane, and in close position will be utilized.</description>

    <description>The participants assigned to this group will receive 16 sessions of physical therapy. Each session will last 45/50 minutes, 2 sessions a week for 8 weeks.
A directly pelvic floor muscle(PFM) training protocol will be applied. Throw vaginal palpation and in lithotomy position, participants will perform PFM exercises per the treatment proposed by the PERFECT scheme. Biofeedback exercises will be also performed in lithotomy position. Hypopressive exercises which are also home daily from the eighth session. Plus educational strategy.</description>

    <description>Only educational strategy 1 session per week for 6 weeks (every session will last 40/45 minutes). The educational strategy will consist of instruction of printed materials and dimensional anatomical models about the anatomy of the pelvic floor and the physiology of the pelvic organs. It will be recommended to avoid risk factors, such as gaining weight, weight lifting, high impact sports, constipation, smoking, or drinking too much caffeine. They will be also instructed in toilet habits, and will be taught to use the knack maneuver before and during increases of intra-abdominal pressure.</description>
