  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women were given a vitamin A tracer, and blood was sampled to determine individual and group
      vitamin A kinetics. Data were subsequently modeled using compartmental analysis to determine
      effects of study length on model outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study in which American women were given an oral, stable isotope
      tracer of vitamin A, and blood was sampled in a staggered, serial design to determine
      individual and group vitamin A kinetics. Data were subsequently modeled using compartmental
      analysis, and study truncation analysis was performed on data to investigate the factor of
      study duration on resulting vitamin A kinetic models and outputs related to vitamin A
      metabolism.
