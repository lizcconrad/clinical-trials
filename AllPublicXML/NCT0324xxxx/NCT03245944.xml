  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are the preferred type of vascular access for dialysis, but
      many of them fail to mature. The optimal timing of intervention to salvage immature AVFs is
      unknown.The study proposes a randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical and economic
      impact of early vs late angioplasty in non-maturing AVFs.

      The study proposes a RCT to test the hypothesis that, as compared to early angioplasty of
      non-maturing AVFs, late angioplasty results in a lower proportion of AVFs being used at 6
      months, but a greater long-term AVF patency , lower requirement of subsequent interventions
      to maintain AVF patency for dialysis, and lower overall cost of access maintenance.

      The optimal timing of intervention in non-maturing AVFs remains controversial, and can only
      be definitively addressed by a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing early (6 weeks) vs
      late (3 months) angioplasty of non-maturing AVFs. The investigators will perform a
      single-center, prospective RCT. The investigators will recruit 112 patients who initiated
      hemodialysis with a CVC, then had a new AVF created after commencing dialysis, and then had a
      6-week postoperative ultrasound that revealed an immature AVF (diameter &lt; 4 mm diameter or
      blood flow &lt; 500 ml/min). These patients will be randomized to one of two groups: an early
      intervention group that will undergo a routine PTA at 6 weeks after AVF creation, or a late
      intervention group in which early PTA will be avoided and subsequently be performed only if
      the 3-month ultrasound indicates persistent AVF immaturity. These patients will be followed
      for 2 years.

    <description>Angioplasty is a minimally invasive, endovascular procedure to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins. A deflated balloon attached to a catheter (a balloon catheter) is passed over a guide-wire into the narrowed vessel and then inflated to a fixed size. The balloon forces expansion of the blood vessel and the surrounding muscular wall, allowing an improved blood flow. This is part of standard of care for immature arteriovenous fistulas. Early means pt will get the procedure at 6 weeks from time of initiation of AVFs</description>
