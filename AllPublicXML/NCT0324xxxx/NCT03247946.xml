      Does upright feeding position of 3 month old infants reduce respiratory and ear morbidity
      during the following year?

      The investigators examined the influence of teaching mothers to feed infants with their head
      in an upright position and evaluated the infant ear and respiratory morbidity during a
      one-year follow-up. Mothers of 88 infants born during 2011 were instructed by trained nurses
      at Maternal-Child-Health clinics to feed their infants with their head in upright position
      (intervention group). The control group consisted of 75 mothers of infants of similar
      socioeconomic background who fed their infant regularly without any instructions and were
      followed at another Maternal-Child-Health clinic. Feeding position was evaluated at the
      beginning and the end of the study, and morbidity data of both groups were evaluated at every
      3-month follow-up meeting. The study was part of the PhD thesis of Efrat Danino, Head Nurse
      of Pediatric Department at Hadassah Medical Organization.

    <intervention_model_description>3 month old infants were recruited from 2 Mother-Child-Health clinics and followed for 12 months. Mothers from intervention group were instructed to feed their babies (88 infants) with their head in upright position.
