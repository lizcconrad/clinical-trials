  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly are at greater risk of dietary insufficiency due to age-related increases in nutrient
      requirements concomitant with a reduction in energy requirements, decreases in appetite and
      energy intake. Currently there is a gap in knowledge of the factors that are associated with
      malnutrition in the elderly in Singapore. In addition, there is no &quot;reference&quot; database on
      anthropometric measurements and biochemical indices for elderly with a range of nutrition
      status in Singapore. Thus, the objectives of this cross-sectional study are to examine
      factors influencing nutritional status and to determine the reference values for
      anthropometric and biochemical measurements related to nutritional status for
      community-dwelling elderly in Singapore.

      This is a cross-sectional study. Measurements will be taken at baseline for elderly with
      normal nutrition (n = 400) and elderly who are at risk of under nutrition (n = 800).. These
      measurements will be used to examine factors influencing nutritional status and to create a
      &quot;reference&quot; database for anthropometric and biochemical measurements related to nutritional
      status for use in clinical practice.

        This cross-sectional study will include 400 elderly with normal nutrition (MUST score: 0)
        and 800 elderly who are at risk of undernutrition (MUST score ≥ 1). Community-dwelling
        elderly recently discharged from the hospital as well as those who recently visited
        polyclinics in Singapore will be recruited for the study.
