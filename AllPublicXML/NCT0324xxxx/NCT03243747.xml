  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preanesthetic evaluation is a clinical assessment process with purpose of increased patient
      safety. One focus is review of patient medical history to reduce perioperative morbidity and
      mortality as well as optimize the daily process in at anesthesia ambulance. The aim of that
      study is the development and implementation of a practical computer-based individualized and
      risk-adapted questionnaire for the daily routine

      The study was a step-by-step process. In the first investigation in 2013 the investigators
      included 50 patients and 81 patients in 2016. Questionnaires were identical in both testing
      stages for comparability. Practicability of a computer-based questionnaire on patient medical
      history, diagnosis as well as behavior guidelines was tested at anesthesia ambulance.
      Moreover, the investigators evaluated the user satisfaction with the help of a separate
      anonym paper-based questionnaire in 2013 as well as in 2016.
