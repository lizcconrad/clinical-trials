  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that music engages the brain bilaterally throughout cortical and
      subcortical regions, accessing extended sensorimotor, cognitive and affective networks. This
      research explores the hypothesis that use of these shared neural networks allows neurologic
      music therapy interventions targeting upper extremity motor control to promote plasticity and
      functional improvements in persons recovering from a cerebrovascular accident. The potential
      therapeutic benefits of these interventions on attentional processes and affective responding
      will also be examined.

  <detailed_description>

      More individuals are surviving and living with the effects of stroke, a trend that is
      expected to continue. Upper extremity limitations present a common, persistent challenge for
      stroke survivors, impacting quality of life. In addition, links have been found between
      physical impairment and depression, and depression and stroke-induced cognitive impairment.
      Music has been shown to exert multimodal effects on individuals and may be used as a
      mediating stimulus to promote therapeutic change. Furthermore, motor imagery may enhance the
      effectiveness of upper extremity interventions by engaging the same brain areas that are
      active in physical movement. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of
      therapeutic instrumental music performance and sensory-enhanced motor imagery on upper limb
      movement, affect and cognition following a stroke. Participants will be assessed at two
      baselines, and randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: therapeutic
      instrumental music performance, therapeutic instrumental music performance and
      sensory-enhanced motor imagery, or therapeutic instrumental music performance and motor
      imagery without sensory enhancement.
