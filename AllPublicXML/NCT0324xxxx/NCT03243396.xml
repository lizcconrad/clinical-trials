  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place in Kanduyi, a sub-county in southern Kenya, and focuses on children
      orphaned by one or two parents. Growing evidence demonstrates that orphaned children in low-
      and middle-income countries are at high risk of post-traumatic stress, but mental health
      professionals are largely unavailable in this area.

      Research suggests that some mental health treatments can be delivered effectively in low- and
      middle-income countries using a task sharing approach, in which lay counselors with little or
      no prior mental health experience are trained to provide treatment.

      Whetten and Dorsey's past studies have suggested that partnering with two government sectors,
      education and health, could be a low-cost and sustainable strategy to implement task sharing
      mental health services. By training teachers (via the education sector) and community health
      volunteers (via the health sector) to provide mental health care, a larger population could
      potentially be reached.

      Before programs are scaled-up country-wide, it's important to know not only what policies to
      implement but also their predicted implementation success and intervention effectiveness.
      This study aims to identify implementation strategies and examine whether the education
      and/or health sectors are productive partners in scaling up task sharing mental health care
      in future programs.

      Building and Sustaining Interventions for Children (BASIC): Task-sharing mental health care
      in low-resource settings builds on our 15-year history of collaborations with research
      partners in Kenya, prior NIH-funded work that identified mental health needs of orphaned
      children in low- and middle-income countries, and iterative and collaborative intervention
      adaptation and testing using a task-sharing approach, to address these needs. In BASIC, the
      investigator will test the implementation of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (TF-CBT), delivered via task-sharing, in two governmental sectors prioritized by our Kenyan
      partners as potential options for scale up— Education and Health Extension. The recent
      devolvement of the Kenyan government (leading to more local decision-making), the launch of a
      National Mental Health Policy, and our Kenyan partners' empowerment work building enthusiasm
      for TF-CBT are converging to create a local climate in which BASIC could become part of the
      county plan, if evidence-based guidance for implementation, using mostly existing resources,
      existed. The investigators test mental health treatment delivery in Education (via teacher
      delivery) and Health Extension (via community health volunteers) with the goal of identifying
      implementation practices and policies (IPPs) that explain implementation outcomes. This
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial includes 40 schools and the 40 surrounding villages
      (120 lay counselors in each) who provide TF-CBT to 1,280 youth. The investigators use a novel
      method, qualitative comparative analyses (QCA), that holds potential for substantially
      advancing the field of implementation science. QCA leverages the rigor of quantitative
      approaches and the detail of qualitative approaches, and allows for complex causality and
      equifinality (i.e., an outcome can be reached by multiple means). Study aims are: 1) Identify
      actionable IPPs that predict adoption (delivery) and fidelity (high- quality delivery) after
      10 sites in sector implement TF-CBT. Use identified IPPs to (Aim 1a) guide implementation
      planning support for subsequent sites and to (Aim 1b) generate testable hypotheses about IPPs
      as causal mechanisms; 2) Test mechanisms of implementation success in both sectors; and 3)
      Test TF-CBT effectiveness (i.e., mental health outcomes; functioning) and cost in both
      sectors. This research has important implications for implementing an evidence-based
      treatment in low-resource settings, including the US.

    <description>Eight small-group sessions, including eight children and one guardian for each child, will meet separately, with joint activities in the final three sessions. TF-CBT will be delivered via community health volunteers in the community setting, and via selected teachers in the school setting--with two lay counselors leading the child group, and one leading the guardian group. Most TF-CBT components (psychoeducation, parenting, relaxation, cognitive coping, grief specific skills) will be delivered in groups, but 2-3 individual sessions mid-group will be used for imaginal exposure (i.e., talking about/processing traumatic events).</description>
