      Double blind parallel study to measure the efficacy of a toothpaste containing
      calcium-silicate/phosphate on dentinal hypersensitivity compared to a control toothpaste
      containing fluoride
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind parallel design, with respect to the clinical assessor and subject,
      study. A minimum of 280 (140 per group), male and female subjects will be recruited to ensure
      that a minimum of 200 subjects (100 per group) complete the study. Subjects will attend the
      test site on six (6) occasions.

      Subjects will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Suitable
      subjects will be given a standard fluoride toothpaste and a toothbrush to use for the
      following four to six weeks (Run-in Phase).

      On completion of the run in phase, the subjects will have a baseline sensitivity and soft
      tissue assessments conducted and randomised to product (visit 3).

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to the test groups.

      Subjects will be given sufficient supplies of their allocated toothpaste and a toothbrush to
      use for the following 2 weeks. Instructions for use (IFUs) will be given to the subjects
      along with a toothbrushing diary and an appointment to return to the test site 2 weeks (+/-1
      day) later.

      At the Day 14 visit, subjects will have the dentinal hypersensitivity and soft tissue
      assessments repeated.

      Subjects will be given sufficient supplies of their allocated toothpaste and a toothbrush to
      use for the following 2 weeks. A fresh toothbrushing diary will be given to the subject along
      with an appointment to return to the test site 2 weeks later (Week 4 assessment). Subjects
      will be instructed to brush their teeth as per the IFU for the following 2 weeks.

      At the Day 28 visit subjects will have the dentinal hypersensitivity and soft tissue
      assessments repeated. Prior to leaving the study site, the subjects will be asked to brush
      their teeth as per the IFU. Subjects will be requested to brush their teeth at a specific
      time and return to the study site the following day.

      At the Day 29 visit, subjects will have the dentinal hypersensitivity and soft tissue
      assessments repeated. On completion of the assessments, subjects will receive their
      remuneration for the participating in the study.

    <measure>Thermo-evaporative (Schiff air blast) stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks of product use (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Air blast sensitivity assessed by directing a one-second blast of air onto the exposed buccal root surface of sensitive tooth. Sensitivity will be recorded: 0 = Tooth/Subject does not respond; 1 Tooth/subject responds but does not request discontinuation; 2 Tooth/subject responds and requests discontinuation or moves;3 Tooth/subject responds, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation. Each subject will be characterised at each visit by the average of the relevant scores for the two indicator teeth.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tactile (Yeaple Probe) stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks of product use (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The Yeaple score will be recorded in terms of quantified reproducible force (grams). After presenting the force to 10 grams, the probe tip will be passed over the exposed dentin on the buccal surface of the selected teeth, apical to the cementenamel junction. Subsequent passes will be made, each time with the applied force increased by 10 grams, until the subject indicates that he/she is experiencing discomfort, or until 20 grams (Baseline) or 60 grams (post product use) of force is reached. Each subject will be characterised at each visit by the average of the relevant scores for the two indicator teeth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks of product use (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale values of the same teeth will be also be recorded to give the outcome variable per subject at the same time of Schiff assessment. The VAS values will be assigned a numerical value in the conventional order from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extremely pain).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Thermo-evaporative (Schiff air blast) stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29, 12 hours after product use has ceased</time_frame>
    <description>Air blast sensitivity assessed by directing a one-second blast of air onto the exposed buccal root surface of sensitive tooth. Sensitivity will be recorded: 0 = Tooth/Subject does not respond; 1 Tooth/subject responds but does not request discontinuation; 2 Tooth/subject responds and requests discontinuation or moves;3 Tooth/subject responds, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation. Each subject will be characterised at each visit by the average of the relevant scores for the two indicator teeth.</description>
