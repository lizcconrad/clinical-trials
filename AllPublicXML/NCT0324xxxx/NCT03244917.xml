  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data
      analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an
      intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with
      advanced dementia (N=480; N=240/arm) living in NHs (N=24; N=12/arm). The NH is the unit of
      randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid
      contamination and because this is how it would be employed in the real-world. Analyses will
      be at the patient level.

    <textblock>
      The final stage of dementia is characterized by recurrent suspected infections. Research has
      shown these episodes are widely mismanaged, leading to adverse patient and public health
      outcomes. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed in advanced dementia, most often in the
      absence of clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the
      main risk factor for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Nursing home (NH) residents with
      advanced dementia are three times more likely to be colonized with MDROs compared to other
      residents. Moreover, as these patients are in the terminal phase of dementia, evidence
      suggests they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials. Comfort is the stated goal of
      care for 90% of advanced dementia patients, and the risks and burdens associated with work-up
      and treatment of suspected infections generally do not promote that goal, particularly when
      hospitalization is involved. Taken together, there is a clear need to improve infection
      management in advanced dementia both to provide better end-of-life care to these patients and
      reduce the public health threat of MDROs.

      This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data
      analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an

      advanced dementia (N=480; N=240/arm) living in NHs (N=24; N=12/arm). The NH is the unit of
      randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid

    <description>The study intervention is a multi-component training and education program targeting direct care providers and healthcare proxies for advanced dementia NH residents, intended to improve the management of urinary and lower respiratory tract infections in advanced dementia patients. There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education. Intervention components aimed at the provider include: Professionally led infection management training seminars, online infection management course, and infection management guidance algorithms. Additionally participating prescribing providers will be sent bimonthly infection management feedback reports. Proxy Education is completed by providing an infection management in Advanced Dementia booklet to proxies of patients with AD upon resident enrollment in study.</description>

          2. Within 60 miles of Boston

        Resident inclusion eligibility criteria

          -  Age &gt; or = to 60 years

          -  A diagnosis of dementia (any type)

          -  Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score of 7

          -  NH length of stay &gt;90 days

          -  An individual who can communicate in English has been formally or informally

          -  Not comatose GDS stage 7 features include: profound memory deficits (cannot recognize
             family), total functional dependence, speech &lt;= 5 words, incontinence, and
             non-ambulatory. GDS 7 was chosen to define advanced dementia as it has been
             successfully operationalized and validated in or prior studies, and experts agreed to
             use this definition in research studies. A 90 day minimum length of stay was chosen to
             exclude short-stay patients.

        Provider inclusion criteria

          -  Direct care provider of advanced dementia residents (a nurse, nurse practitioner,
             physician or physician assistant identified by a senior administrator as an individual
             who cares for residents with advanced dementia)

          -  Can communicate in English (because intervention materials are all in English),

          -  Over 21 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Residents with cognitive impairment due to causes other than dementia (e.g., head trauma
        and in short-term, sub-acute SNFs) will be excluded.

        Residents' whose proxies cannot communicate in English will be excluded from the study,
        because the information directed to proxies are only in English.

        Providers that do not provide direct care to residents with advanced dementia or who do not
        speak English.
