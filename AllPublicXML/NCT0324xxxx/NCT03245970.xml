      To determine if the use of impedance cardiography can identify appropriate medications for
      use in treating chronic hypertensive patients to decrease the risk of preeclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impedance cardiography helps determine whether vasoconstriction or an elevated cardiac output
      is occurring. The test is easy to perform and non invasive. The treatment for an elevated
      cardiac output in pregnancy is a beta-blocker while a vasodilator is used for
      vasoconstriction. If a beta-blocker is given to someone that vasoconstricted, this might make
      the cardiovascular parameters worse, leading to no improvement in future pregnancy issues.
      Likewise, if a vasoconstricting drug is given to someone with an elevated cardiac output, it
      could potentially make the cardiovascular parameters worse.

      All centers in the United States that choose to prescribe an antihypertensive medication for
      use in pregnancy do so by trial and error, whereas impedance cardiography can help the
      clinician choose the best medication from the start. Many pregnant patient patients have
      chronic hypertension and this population is at increased risk for superimposed preeclampsia
      and other pregnancy complications. The current recommendation for pregnancy is to NOT treat
      mild hypertension because studies have not shown any benefit. These studies, have also not
      shown any harm. Prior studies that have shown no benefit to treatment of mild hypertension in
      pregnancy may be hampered by choosing the wrong antihypertensive medication, thereby not
      improving the rate of superimposed preeclampsia and other pregnancy related complications.
