  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWID) represent the overwhelming majority of both HCV and HIV/HCV
      infected people in the United States. Though new, direct-acting HCV medications are highly
      efficacious and have the potential to end the HCV epidemic, few PWIDs ever initiate
      treatment. We seek to improve HCV treatment uptake and cure among HCV and HIV/HCV+ PWIDs by
      testing a primary care based HCV Group Evaluation and Treatment UPtake (HCV GET-UP)
      intervention. If efficacious, this innovative care intervention could provide a means to
      reduce the growing mortality from HCV, as well as decrease the current reservoir for HCV
      transmission.

      The goal of this proposal is to improve HCV (hepatitis C virus) treatment uptake among
      current and former injection drug users (IDUs) by testing an innovative, primary care based
      HCV Group Evaluation and Treatment UPtake (HCV GET-UP) intervention. IDUs make up the
      majority of the 4 million Americans chronically infected with HCV, and up to 90% of HIV+ IDUs
      are infected with HCV1,2. In the U.S., HCV is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease
      and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the most common indication for liver transplantation3,4.
      Without imminent action, mortality from HCV-related disease is projected to triple over the
      next decade,5,6 and HCV-related deaths have already surpassed deaths related to HIV.7 While
      past HCV therapies have been relatively ineffective, new oral treatment regimens with
      direct-acting antivirals are substantially more efficacious, with few side effects, and cure
      rates as high as 100% for both HCV+ and HIV/HCV+ individuals8. Importantly, successful HCV
      treatment has been associated with decreased mortality9-11. Unfortunately, there are
      significant gaps along the HCV care cascade that prevent patients from ever realizing the
      benefits of these revolutionary medications. Approximately 10% of all HCV+ patients, and even
      fewer IDUs, have ever initiated HCV treatment12-15.

      Given the ease and efficacy of the new HCV medications, we have an unprecedented opportunity
      to treat IDUs within medical settings that they are already accessing, such as primary care
      clinics. Community-based primary care clinics, such as Federally Qualified Health Centers
      (FQHCs), are abundant throughout the US and serve populations at high risk for HCV, such as
      IDUs; studies show an HCV prevalence rate of approximately 8% in FQHCs16,17, almost 5 times
      greater than the general population. Over the past year at Montefiore Medical Center, we have
      piloted onsite HCV treatment at one FQHC and treated nearly 50 patients (81% former or
      current IDUs) with direct-acting antivirals, with 93% cure rates.

      Despite high HCV cure rates for those treated in primary care at our FQHC, only a small
      minority of eligible patients has initiated treatment. Though onsite treatment reduces
      obstacles related to specialty referral, patient level barriers to HCV evaluation and
      treatment uptake still exist. IDUs in particular often have limited HCV knowledge, as well as
      low perceived vulnerability to poor HCV-related health outcomes, low self-esteem and poor
      self-efficacy, high levels of perceived stigma, and mistrust of healthcare providers.13,14,18
      These, as well as other barriers, prevent many IDUs from ever initiating HCV evaluation or
      starting the treatment uptake process. We therefore propose to test an HCV Group Evaluation
      and Treatment UPtake (HCV GET-UP) intervention to improve HCV medical evaluation and
      treatment uptake for HCV and HCV/HIV IDUs within an FQHC. Group-based interventions, often
      familiar to IDUs, provide social support and encourage behavior change, which together
      promote enhanced engagement in care. Group-based care can also allow efficient delivery of
      health-education and medical treatment. Informed by the Information-Motivation-Behavior (IMB)
      model,19,20 we hypothesize that a group-based HCV intervention, HCV GET-UP, delivered in an
      FQHC already accessed by patients, will improve HCV treatment uptake by: (1) providing HCV
      education; (2) increasing motivation by minimizing stigma, and addressing competing
      priorities and social norms; and (3) increasing self-efficacy and related behavioral skills.
      We propose the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of HCV GET-UP. We will pre-test HCV GET-UP
      by conducting two group interventions (each consisting of 4 weekly sessions; 8 participants
      in each intervention group). We will assess feasibility by examining process measures, and
      acceptability using a brief, self-administered questionnaire after each of the 4 sessions. We
      will also conduct focus groups after the entire 4-session intervention. We will then refine
      HCV GET-UP based on these findings.

      Aim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of HCV GET-UP for
      improving HCV treatment uptake in an FQHC. We will enroll 96 HCV+ or HIV/HCV+ IDUs and
      randomize them 1:1 to HCV GET-UP plus onsite treatment in primary care (intervention) versus
      onsite treatment alone (control). Our primary outcome is HCV treatment uptake, and secondary
      outcomes will include HCV medical evaluation, HCV treatment completion, and HCV cure.

      Aim 3: To determine potential moderators and mediators of the impact of HCV GET-UP on HCV
      treatment uptake, using a sequential explanatory design. First, we will perform exploratory
      quantitative analyses to determine if there are specific patient characteristics
      (demographic, clinical) that moderate the intervention effect, and if there are mediators
      (reduced stigma, peer support, increased self-efficacy) of HCV GET-UP's impact on treatment
      uptake. Second, we will perform semi-structured interviews with 20 participants randomized to
      HCV-GET UP to explore potential moderators/mediators deduced from quantitative analyses.
