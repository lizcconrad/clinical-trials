  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if anesthetic depth can be deepened non-pharmacologically
      through use of sleep masks. This study seeks to demonstrate a relationship between the depth
      of anesthesia with application of sleep masks intraoperatively and in the critical care
      setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depth of anesthesia will be monitored, both with a standard sleep mask applied and without,
      in each subject using standard electroencephalogram (EEG) readings via forehead leads and
      Masimo Sedline 4-lead EEG monitors.

      OR Subjects:

      Patients will be induced in a standard fashion using intravenous (IV) anesthetics. A
      continuous administration of propofol and inhalational anesthetics will be used for
      maintenance of anesthesia. The standard electroencephalogram (EEG) reading via forehead leads
      and Masimo Sedline 4-lead EEG machines will be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, both
      with and without the sleep mask.

      ICU Subjects:

      Patients will be induced in a standard fashion using intravenous (IV) anesthetics. A
      continuous administration of propofol will be used for maintenance of anesthesia. The
      standard electroencephalogram (EEG) reading via Masimo Sedline 4-lead EEG monitors will be
      used to track the depth of anesthesia, both with and without the sleep mask.

      All Subjects:

      In both settings,once baseline EEG readings are established (30 minutes), EEG data will be
      recorded and a sleep mask will be applied to the patient for one hour. After one hour (90
      minutes), EEG data will be recorded and the sleep mask will be removed. After another hour
      (150 minutes), EEG data will be recorded and the mask reapplied. After another hour (210
      minutes), EEG data will be recorded and the mask removed. The levels/doses of anesthetic
      agent at each time point will also be recorded.

      Subjective perception of depth of anesthesia will be obtained by means of a post-procedure
      evaluation administered to each subject.

Baseline EEG readings will be established for 30 minutes, then EEG data will be recorded and a sleep mask applied to the patient for one hour. After one hour, eye masks will be removed for an hour and reapplied after another hour. During the hour that the mask is off, 2 hours into sedation, EEG data will again be recorded.</description>
