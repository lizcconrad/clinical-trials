      The goal of this study is to assess the health literacy level of patients enrolled in the
      HOPE program, identify any gaps in their knowledge of hepatitis C, analyze the variables that
      may influence patients' knowledge, and educate patients on Hepatitis C.

      The study will compare the effectiveness of providing a pamphlet and expert education
      compared to providing a pamphlet only. The information gained in completing this study will
      help the medical community improve patient education on the disease and specifically
      understand how the medical community can best serve pregnant patients with opiate dependence
      burdened by Hepatitis C.
