  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, observational, prospective, single dynamic cohort study with before-after
      design. Treatment with 6 sessions using dry needling with DNHS® (Dry Needling for
      Hypertonicity and Spasticity) on the spastic muscles of the affected arm in patients with
      stroke. Spasticity will be assessed by Modifying Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS),
      functionality with the Fugl-Meyer scale for the upper limb, motor recovery with Brunnstrom
      Stages Scale (BSS) and upper limb spasticity pattern (ULP), pain by 10-points Numerical
      Rating Scale (NRS10) and the quality of life with the Euro QoL 5D survey.

      Once each patient has signed the informed consent document and it has been verified that the
      inclusion criteria are met, it will be assigned the same identification number (ID) that is
      related to its Clinical History (CH) by simple coding; custody of the file with the
      relationship of each ID with its CH will be the responsibility of the principal investigator.

      Patients admitted to the Guadarrama Hospital with the diagnosis of stroke and who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be treated by their usual physiotherapist, who will administer the
      standard dry needling intervention.

      Patients will receive 6 sessions of DNHS® technique with an interval of 1 week between each
      session (1st to 4th sessions) and every 15 days (5th and 6th sessions). The procedure will be
      applied according to the corresponding protocols established in the NWPs (Normalized Work
      Plans) used in the usual clinical practice in the Guadarrama Hospital.

      The DNHS® technique is specifically indicated for the treatment of spasticity. This technique
      differs from that usually used to relieve pain and deactivate myofascial trigger points
      (MTPs). The muscles to be treated are placed in a submaximum stretching position; the
      evaluation criteria when defining the needle insertion zone are based on finding an increase
      in modularity and muscle activity in the area when the muscle undergoes rapid stretching.
      Once the area to be treated is located, the needle is inserted and moves between 0.5 and 1 cm
      in / deep and fan out / surface to cause a local or global spasm reaction. Treatment ceases
      when the frequency of these responses decreases markedly or disappears. If the patient feels
      &quot;not tolerable&quot; pain (some discomfort from the dry needling is usual), you can stop the
      treatment at any time.

      Before and after each dry needling session patients will be evaluated by their usual
      physiotherapist, using the upper limb block of the Fugl-Meyer scale that assesses motor
      skills and sensitivity of the affected arm, evaluation of pain through NRS10 and assessment
      of spasticity of muscles to be treated by MMAS. Also, at the beginning, in the 4th session
      and at the end of the study, the Euro-QoL 5D-5L quality of life survey will be administered,
      with a license for use. In adition BSS and ULP will be evaluated at the begining and at the
      end of the study. In each dry needling session, the caliber of the needle used, the number of
      fast-in and fast-out of the needle and the number of the spasm reactions caused for the
      purpose of establishing the dose pattern shall be recorded for each treated muscle.
