      Background : Sickle cell patients have profound remodeling of their muscle microcirculation
      networks with signs of amyotrophy. However, the consequences of these muscle alterations on
      the functional status of muscles are unknown. In addition, whether the poor physical fitness
      of sickle cell patients can be attributed, at least partly, to an hypothetical muscle
      dysfunction has never been tested.

      Purpose : this study will compare the muscle function of legs between sickle cell patients
      (SS and SC genotypes) and healthy individuals (AA genotype) before, during and after a short
      localized muscle endurance exercise.

      Abstract : Very recently, a study reported large differences between the muscle
      microcirculation networks of sickle cell patients compared to healthy individuals with
      decreased capillary density and higher proportion of large capillaries in the former
      population. In addition, the same study showed signs of amyotrophy in sickle cell patients.
      However, the muscle function of sickle cell patients has not been investigated and one may
      suggest that muscle dysfunction could participate in the decrease of physical fitness, in
      association with the hematological and hemorheological disorders, already reported in this
      population. The hypothesis is that muscle fatigue during a short localized muscle endurance
      exercise should be higher in sickle cell patients compared to healthy individuals, due to a
      greater recruitment of glycolytic fibers and a faster decrease of muscle oxygenation during
      exercise.

    <description>Isometric muscular strength will be determined by Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) test force on dominant leg.
Muscular function will be evaluated using Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) test force and the muscle endurance ability, which will be highlighted by the degree of decline of MVC after a short localized muscle effort using the formula: ((post MVC force - pre MVC force) / pre MVC force)x100.
Muscle weakness will be determined by a loss of maximum isometric strength ≥ 20 % compared with control group.</description>
