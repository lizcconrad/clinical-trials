  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of monitoring and sharing physical
      activity outcomes (using Fitbit technology) on physical activity participation in those who
      have received an exercise prescription from their physician.

      Primary research question: Does shared physical activity outcomes from wearable technology
      with a participant's physician improve overall physical activity over 3 months compared to
      shared outcomes with a family member, unshared outcomes (normal wearable technology
      condition), and a control group (no wearable technology condition) following an exercise
      prescription from one's physician? Physical activity will be measured as minutes of moderate
      to vigorous physical activity per week.

      Hypothesis: Knowledge that physical activity outcomes will be shared with a participant's
      physician will serve as a proxy-supervision intervention and improve physical activity
      adherence in comparison to all other groups. Self- and partner shared outcomes conditions
      will be more effective than the control group.

      Background: Physical activity is associated with management and/or prevention of over 25
      chronic health conditions; however the majority of adults in North America are not active
      enough to experience these benefits. Behavioral strategies have been shown to be effective
      for increasing physical activity, and wearable fitness monitors such as Fitbits include
      components of several behavioral strategies including goal setting and feedback. While this
      technology provides a platform for implementing self-regulation techniques important for
      behavior change, direct supervision is still the most effective strategy for behavior change.
      Supervised exercise programs and personal trainers may not be accessible or affordable for
      people; this study will examine whether proxy supervision by a family member or doctor are
      more effective in changing behavior compared to self-regulation alone.

      Target Population: Sedentary adults aged 45-64 years old who have received an exercise
      prescription (to increase physical activity) from their doctor, living in Victoria,
      British-Columbia, Canada.

      Sample Size: 80 participants, 20 per group.

      Intervention: Participants will be randomized to 4 groups: 1 - Physician monitored, 2 -
      Family monitored, 3 - Self monitored, and 4 - Control. Participants from all groups will
      perform aerobic testing at baseline and 3 months, complete an online questionnaire at
      baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months, and wear an accelerometer for 1 week at baseline, 6 weeks
      and 3 months. Participants in Group 1,2,and 3 will receive a Fitbit activity tracker and wear
      it for 3 months. Weekly Fitbit reports are automatically sent to the individual participants
      in all groups. Group 1 participant Fitbit reports will also be sent to their Physician. Group
      2 participant Fitbit reports will also be sent to their partner/spouse. Group 3 participants
      will have sole access to their weekly Fitbit results. Group 4 is the control group and will
      not receive a Fitbit.
