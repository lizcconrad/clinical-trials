      This study will measure the impact of two teledermatology apps, VA Telederm and MY Telederm,
      WITH TWO SEPARATE TRIALS on access to dermatology care. The overall hypothesis is that sites
      implementing Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) teledermatology mobile apps will
      significantly augment the use of teledermatology and improve Veterans' access to skin care
      relative to control sites. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that VA Telederm will
      facilitate the implementation and adoption of teledermatology among primary care clinic
      staff, increasing use by existing programs and potentially expanding teledermatology to new
      sites while reducing patient travel to dermatology clinics. Additionally the investigators
      hypothesize that My Telederm will improve established patients' ability to follow-up with
      dermatology care remotely, while opening up dermatology clinic space for other patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Access to healthcare is currently a key priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
      The current practice of teledermatology in VA is effective but has not been uniformly
      implemented, and inefficiencies in the current workstation-based process may discourage
      teledermatology adoption by primary care clinics. VA Office of Connected Care developed a
      mobile app, VA Telederm, as a more facile and efficient option that may enhance
      teledermatology adoption among providers. Once patients establish care in a dermatology
      clinic, they often need follow-up visits to evaluate responses to treatment and to adjust
      management, neither of which necessarily requires a face-to-face visit. To address these
      issues, OCC has additionally developed the My Telederm app to allow established dermatology
      clinic patients to follow-up in person, the app may improve clinic access to in-person
      dermatology clinics. The mobile apps are thus new programs that are planned for wide-spread
      implementation in the VA. The investigators will conduct TWO SEPARATE TRIALS of database
      reviews to understand how these two apps affect features of dermatology care, specifically
      related to access to care.

      Both apps will be made available over a 2 year period in a randomized, stepped-wedge design
      to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. The VA Telederm app will be distributed
      to 36 eligible VHA facilities that currently have low teledermatology activity and thus have
      had relatively poor adoption of basic consultative teledermatology. The My Telederm app will
      be distributed to 24 facilities with dermatology clinics that currently have relatively high
      teledermatology activity and thus already have relatively mature teledermatology programs
      ready for advanced operations.

      By using health factors and stop codes unique to each app, the investigators will use the VA
      Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to measure the impact of both apps in two separate trials on
      outcomes reflecting dermatology access. At the end of the study period, the proposed research
      will result in a novel documentation of mobile teledermatology's effectiveness in enhancing
      Veteran's access to dermatology service. The results will be of significance to VA as it
      develops and implements other mobile telehealth programs, and more generally to other
      healthcare organizations planning for large-scale telehealth interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) in both trials. Each facility, the participant in the study, represents a cluster of patients who receive care at the respective VA Medical Center and associated CBOCs. The trial is a cross-sectional SW-CRT, since facilities are not measured repeatedly over the course of the study. The investigators will retrospectively measure outcomes during the 6-month baseline period. The trial will be rolled out over a 24 month period. After each (randomly selected) set of facilities switches to the intervention at each step, a 3-month implementation phase occurs, during which outcomes will not be measured in the analysis. Every 3 months, a new group of clusters will implement the apps until all are using the apps. This leads to a total of 6 cross-over points over the whole rollout period.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the VA telederm trial, teledermatology at a site constituted a minimum of 0.1% and
             less than 8.8% of all FY2016 dermatology encounters under secondary stop codes 695/696
             (teledermatology readings).

          -  In total the investigators identified 36 sites eligible for VA Telederm.

          -  Conversely, the inclusion criterion for the second trial with My Telederm was that a
             site had greater than or equal to 8.8% of all FY2016 dermatology encounters under
             secondary stop codes 695/696.

          -  This indicated considerable pre-existing experience with consultative teledermatology
             and the likely presence of dermatology reader and support personnel needed to
             implement My Telederm.

          -  The investigators identified 24 sites eligible for My Telederm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  VA medical centers with no 695/696 stop code activity in FY2016 or with zero full-time
             equivalent dermatologists were excluded since these sites likely lack the expertise,
             support, and infrastructure to feasibly adopt teledermatology during the study period.

          -  The investigators also excluded sites outside the continental U.S., sites without a
             dermatology clinic, and the 3 sites where the formative evaluation of this study will
             be performed (i.e., Providence, RI; San Francisco, CA; and Denver, CO).
