    <textblock>
      The ActiPatch is a cutaneous device which is CE marked approved for relief of pain and has
      FDA clearance as an over the counter device for the adjunctive treatment of osteoarthritis of
      the knee and plantar fasciitis. It is taped over the affected area and stimulation at a high
      frequency is reported to alleviate pain with no sensation. By randomising patients between
      application of an active device or a dummy device and assessment of disability and pain
      scores at four weeks the efficacy or otherwise can be established. Chronic low back pain is a
      major health problem and if effective this has major economic implications as the device is
      cheap and safe.

    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is a major public heath challenge for a number of reasons including
      prevalence, seriousness, vulnerable populations, the utility of population health strategies,
      and the importance of prevention at both the population and individual levels. Its incidence
      and prevalence are increasing with an aging population and the rise in obesity. When
      considering the location of chronic pain and its aetiology, back pain was the most common
      location with arthritis/osteoarthritis being the most common cause. Chronic low back back
      pain is costly to nations—not just in terms of health care expenditures and disability
      compensation but also in terms of lost school days, lost productivity and employment, reduced
      incomes, and lost potential and quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             trial.

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial
             requirements.

          -  Male or female ages 18 or above with stable chronic lower back pain

          -  Females of childbearing must be on birth control or practice abstinence during the
             study period

             o Women of childbearing age will be screened with a urine pregnancy test. Women of
             childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who
             is not permanently sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12
             consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause.

          -  ≥3 months duration of chronic low back pain

          -  a current VAS pain rating ≥5/10

          -  no radiating pain below the knee

          -  Most of the pain in the body is present in the lower back or buttock, NOT in the lower
             extremities, as determined during screening by the principal investigator. The
             investigator will verbally ask the participant if most of the pain being experienced
             is in the lower back/buttock area, and rely on the response for inclusion into the
             study.

          -  able to complete and tolerate treatment for the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participant who is pregnant.

          -  Significant renal or hepatic impairment confirmed by medical history.

          -  Prior home use of pulsed shortwave therapy.

          -  Prior history of spinal fusion or failed spinal surgery syndrome.

          -  Laminectomy, laminotomy or discectomy within 12 months of enrollment.

          -  Diagnostic or interventional injections or any low back surgeries not mentioned above,
             including radiofrequency neuroablation within 6 months of enrollment.

          -  The addition of strong opiates (hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine), pregabalin and
             gabapentin to the treatment regime during the course of the trial

          -  Current implanted cardiac demand pacemakers, defibrillators, cardiac pumps, spinal
             stimulators or other implanted electronic devices.

          -  Patients using personal home based electrical stimulation devices are excluded

          -  Patients with other concomitant illnesses (e.g., malignancy, osteoporosis) which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude successful patient participation will
             also be excluded

          -  Active psychiatric disorders will be excluded (e.g. use of antipsychotic medication,
             bipolar disorder, schizophrenia).

          -  Patients diagnosed with history of significant mood disorder will be excluded (e.g.,
             depression or anxiety with adequate control would be acceptable).

          -  Scheduled elective surgery or other procedures requiring general anaesthesia during
             the trial.

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may
             influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             trial.

          -  Participants who have participated in another research trial involving an
             investigational product in the past 12 weeks.
