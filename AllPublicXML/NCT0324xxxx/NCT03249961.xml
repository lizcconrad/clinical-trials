  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Practice is required to improve your shot in basketball or to play a musical instrument. The
      learning of these motor skills can be further enhanced by non-invasively stimulating regions
      of the brain that control movements with electrical currents. These electric currents can
      strengthen or weaken connections of the brain, which consequently affects a person's ability
      to improve their performance on a skill. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is widely
      applied in many disciplines of neuroscience research, and has potential therapeutic
      application. There are two specific types of NIBS that will be used in this research study:
      1) Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), which applies very weak electrical
      currents via two rubber electrodes on the scalp, and 2) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS), which applies magnetic pulses via a coil against the head, to stimulate regions of the
      brain. Both types of non-invasive brain stimulation (i.e., tDCS, and TMS) are well-tolerated,
      painless, and safe. The application of tDCS to brain regions that control movements,
      concurrently with practice of a skill, results in better skill performance, than practice
      alone with no tDCS. Therefore, in this study, we will be testing different types of brain
      stimulation and different amounts of practice.
