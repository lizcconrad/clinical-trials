      This study will compare Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD in terms of one-year recurrence in
      a large population (N=492). Recurrence is defined as prolapsing internal hemorrhoids at
      physical examination performed by a colorectal surgeon.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, parallel arm, non-randomized prospective data collection trial
      comparing Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD in terms of recurrence rates at one-year. All
      subjects will already be scheduled for either Ferguson or THD hemorrhoidectomy, the surgery
      is NOT part of the research. Although a randomized study would control for variation among
      surgeons, this study design provides the best patient safety since the surgeons will perform
      the technique they do most frequently. Variability in the patient population will be managed
      with a conservative sample size, which allows for a multivariate analysis of the sample
      populations if any confounding variables are noted during initial data analyses. In addition,
      the variability will be minimized with stringent and detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria in
      terms of hemorrhoidal disease. Patients will be enrolled and followed for one year.
      Participating surgeons will be credentialed and each participating surgeon will enroll up to
      ten consecutive patients.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to compare Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD in terms
      of recurrence rates at one-year. Recurrence is defined as prolapsing internal hemorrhoids at
      physical examination performed by a colorectal surgeon.

    <description>The hemorrhoids are operated in their natural position and not distorted by eversion The proctoscope is fully introduced transanally to reach the lower rectum. Under Doppler guidance, six arterial signals are found circumferentially above the dentate line. The approach to make the 'dearterialization' involves the transfixation of the rectal mucosa and submucosa to entrap the artery using a suture. Mucopexy is performed after the artery ligation with the same suture used for the dearterialization. Finally, the suture is tied to fix the mucopexy.</description>

    <description>The hemorrhoids are operated in their natural position and not distorted by eversion. A Ferguson-Hill retractor is used to expose the hemorrhoids. Dissection with scissors is directed up to the dentate line where the fibers of the sphincter muscles are exposed and only a mucosal pedicle remains attached. A Buie-Smith crushing clamp is applied to this pedicle and the hemorrhoidal mass is excised at the superior level of the clamp. The pedicle is then ligated and the crushing clamp is removed. After dissection of the intermuscular septum is complete, the margins of the wound are drawn upward into the anal canal with stitches and are secured to the pedicle by the same suture. The remainder of the wound is closed with a stitch tied at the outer extremity of the wound using the same suture.</description>
