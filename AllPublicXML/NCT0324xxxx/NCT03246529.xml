      A total of 207 subjects will be randomized into the study which will employ a double-blind
      placebo-controlled setting to assess the efficacy and safety of G-CSF + BL-8040 as compared
      to G-CSF + placebo.

      -  Part 1: This lead-in period designed to ascertain the dose of BL-8040 will enroll a
           total of up to 30 subjects to an open labeled treatment to assess the efficacy, safety,
           PK and PD parameters of treatment with G-CSF 10 µg/kg/day and BL-8040 1.25mg/kg, per
           study protocol to goal collection of ≥ 6x106 CD34+ cells/kg.

        -  Part 2: Following the successful completion of Part 1, a total of 177 subjects will be
           randomized into Part 2 of the study which will employ a double-blind placebo-controlled
           setting to assess the efficacy and safety of G-CSF + BL-8040 as compared to G-CSF +
           placebo.
