      Study Conduct:

      Patients who are eligible for enrollment will be entered into the study. Patients will
      receive ivosidenib 500 mg by mouth once daily on 28-day cycles until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, physician or subject decision to discontinue, the subject proceeds to
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the subject dies, or until the study closes. Patients who
      achieve complete remission, undergo stem cell transplant, and then relapse can come back onto
      the study after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Enrollment into the study will close
      should ivosidenib be granted marketing authorization. If the study terminates for other
      reasons, access to drug will be assessed based on the rationale for termination.

      Clinical Assessments:

      All patients will have baseline assessments performed to confirm eligibility. Thereafter,
      treatment and assessments will be per routine standard of care at the investigational site
      and documentation will be maintained at the study site in the patient chart. Should study
      drug be discontinued, it is recommended that the patient return at least 28 days after
      receiving the last dose of study drug for a safety evaluation.

      Safety assessments should be performed at intervals per institutional standard of care for
      patients taking ivosidenib. These assessments should include, but are not limited to:
      pregnancy tests, ECG, clinical lab assessments, vital signs and physical exam findings, and
      assessment of adverse events of special interest (AESIs)/serious adverse events (SAEs).
      Toxicity severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03.

             eligible with Medical Monitor approval.

          7. Have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due
                  to Gilbert's disease or leukemic involvement;

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline
                  phosphatase (ALP) ≤3.0 × ULN, unless considered due to leukemic involvement.

             • Creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min based on the Cockroft-Gault glomerular filtration
             rate (GFR) estimation: (140 -Age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female)/72 x serum
             creatinine

          9. Be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior surgery,
             radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer.

         10. Female patients with reproductive potential must agree to undergo medically supervised
             pregnancy tests prior to starting study drug. The first pregnancy test will be
             performed at screening (within 7 days prior to first study drug administration); the
             second will be performed on the day of the first study drug administration and must be
             confirmed negative prior to dosing. Patients with reproductive potential are defined
             as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy
             or tubal occlusion or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not
             menstruated at all) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Females of reproductive potential, as
             well as fertile men and their partners who are female of reproductive potential, must
             agree to use two effective forms of contraception (including at least one barrier
             form) from the time of giving informed assent/consent, during the study, and for 90
             days (both females and males) following the last dose of AG-120. Effective forms of
             contraception are defined as hormonal oral contraceptives, injectables, patches,
             intrauterine devices, intrauterine hormone-releasing systems, bilateral tubal
             ligation, condoms with spermicide, or male partner sterilization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are eligible to participate in a clinical trial or for whom potentially curative
             anticancer therapy is available.

          2. Have previously received prior treatment with a mutant-specific IDH1 inhibitor and
             progressed on therapy.

          3. Have undergone HSCT within 60 days of the first dose of ivosidenib, or patients on
             immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at the time of screening, or with clinically
             significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (The use of a stable dose of oral
             steroids post HSCT and/or topical steroids for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted with
             Medical Monitor approval.)

          4. Have received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;14 days prior to their
             first day of study drug administration. (Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to enrollment
             and after the start of ivosidenib for the control of peripheral leukemic blasts in
             patients with leukocytosis [white blood cell {WBC}] counts &gt;30,000/μL.)

          5. Have received an investigational agent &lt;14 days prior to their first day of study drug
             administration. In addition, the first dose of ivosidenib should not occur before a
             period ≥5 half-lives of the investigational agent has elapsed.

          6. Are taking known strong CYP3A4 inducers or sensitive CYP3A4 substrate medications with
             a narrow therapeutic window, unless they can be transferred to other medications
             within ≥ 5 half-lives prior to dosing or unless the medications can be properly
             monitored during the study.

          7. Are taking P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter-sensitive substrate medications with a
             narrow therapeutic window, unless they can be transferred to other medications within
             ≥5 half-lives prior to dosing or unless medications can be properly monitored during
             the study.

          8. Are pregnant or breast feeding.

          9. Have an active severe infection that requires anti-infective therapy or with an
             unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during Screening visits or on their first day of study drug
             administration (at the discretion of the Investigator, patients with tumor fever may
             be enrolled).

         10. Have known hypersensitivity to any of the components of ivosidenib.

         11. Have had New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure (Appendix
             14.2), myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and/or stroke.

             any other factor that increases the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events
             (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome).
             Patients with prolonged QTcF interval in the setting of bundle branch block may
             participate in the study.

         13. Have active hepatitis B or C. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection are allowed provided their disease is under control on anti-retroviral
             therapy and that precautions are taken to modify their HAART regimen to minimize
             ivosidenib drug interactions. Such subjects should be monitored for a change in dosage
             requirements for the concomitant HAART drug when co-administering ivosidenib.

         14. Have any other medical or psychological condition, deemed by the Investigator to be
             likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed assent/consent,
             cooperate, or participate in the study.

         15. Have immediately life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such as
             uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated
