  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta is an obstetrical complication where the placenta becomes firmly adherent to
      the uterine wall. Placenta accreta can lead to considerable maternal morbidity and mortality
      due to hemorrhage, infection, or other surgical complications such as those resulting from
      hysterectomy. Retained placenta accreta is usually a rare condition, but its prevalence is
      increasing due to the rise in the rate of deliveries by Cesarean section.

      Placenta accreta is a potentially life-threatening obstetric condition that requires a
      multidisciplinary approach to management. The incidence of placenta accreta has increased and
      seems to parallel the increasing cesarean delivery rate. Women at greatest risk of placenta
      accreta are those who have myometrial damage caused by a previous cesarean delivery with
      either an anterior or posterior placenta previa overlying the uterine scar. Diagnosis of
      placenta accreta before delivery allows multidisciplinary planning in an attempt to minimize
      potential maternal or neonatal morbidity and mortality.
