  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns the validation of a clinical test that aims to reveal &quot;first level&quot;
      emotional disorders in neurological diseases.

      In order to bring to light such disorders, it is necessary to begin by establishing reference
      values in healthy individuals. This test is based on the priming effect and time estimations.
      The test procedure has two successive phases. The first phase aims to determine the judgement
      of time inherent to each participant and then to assess whether or not this judgement varies
      during the second phase with the introduction of emotional priming. First, we set out to look
      for and to calibrate video stimuli able to activate emotions. To this end, we used a battery
      of 70 sequences developed recently by Schaefer, Nils, Sanchez and Philippot. We determined
      their degree of physiological activation by measuring the electrodermal response at the
      laboratory for the exploration of the nervous system in Dijon. These measurements also
      allowed us to define and refine our paradigm, notably by deciding at what moment the time
      estimation task should be done and by eliminating the influence of attention. We decided to
      select only seven video sequences because we noticed a reduction in the measurement effect on
      time estimations due to habituation of the subject. We also conducted pre-tests in a control
      population made up of twenty men and women aged from 20 to 60 years.

      This brought to light a warp in time estimation opposite to that we found using olfactory
      stimuli. This first finding suggests that there are two types of emotion, one which is
      anticipative and the other immediately experienced.
