  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National guidelines have recommended routine STD screening (chlamydia and gonorrhea) for
      sexually active young women under the age of 25. Despite these recommendations, many young
      women are not being screened for STDs, with some estimates that less than 50% of women
      receiving health care are screened for chlamydia. Untreated STDs can lead to important
      sequelae to women's reproductive health including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility
      and ectopic pregnancy. One of the most important barriers to widespread STD screening is
      provider failure to recognize an opportunity for STD screening. The goal of this study is to
      determine whether offering STD screening (chlamydia and gonorrhea) by a non-physician member
      of the medical practice (who receives an automated alert indicating STD screening should be
      offered) will be associated with a higher rate of STD screening in young women attending
      primary care practices compared to usual care (where a physician offers screening with no
      electronic alert). This study will be performed in UPMC-affiliated primary care practices
      (Family Practice, Internal Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics). Practices will be assigned to the
      intervention or usual care. The intervention will be an auto-task in the electronic medical
      record to the non-physician/NP/PA medical staff (medical assistants, LPNs, RNs) to offer
      chlamydia and gonorrhea screening via urine or self-collected vaginal sampling, in an opt-out
      manner, to eligible women. Practices assigned to the usual care group will not have the
      intervention. STD screening rates (# women undergoing STD screening/# eligible women) will be
      compared between the to groups (intervention practices and control practices). Results of
      this study may be important to guide national STD screening recommendations and will address
      critical barriers to widespread STD screening.
