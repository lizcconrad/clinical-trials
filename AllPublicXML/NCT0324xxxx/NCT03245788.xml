  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stanford Cancer Center is undertaking a Transformation Initiative in order to improve the
      quality of care, make it more patient-centered and coordinated across the continuum of care.
      The newest innovation is to introduce lay navigators to specified high-need patients. The
      larger goal of the project is to assess whether lay navigators can address non-clinical
      patient needs in a timely fashion and appropriately connect them with their clinical team
      when warranted. It is expected that proactive interaction with patients will decrease patient
      anxiety/stress related to their cancer and facilitate higher patient engagement and improved
      management of physical, social,and emotional health. For the pilot project, the smaller goal
      is to understand: how lay navigator time is used; the types and frequency of issues brought
      up by patients; resources that patients are given or referred to; type and frequency of mode
      of contact with patients; and patients' acceptance of navigators based on refusal. An
      electronic intake form will be used to collect this information so that data can be analyzed
      regularly and informed change can be made to the navigator program as needed

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Stanford Cancer Institute is undergoing a 5-year Transformation Initiative that began in
      2013. One of the goals of this initiative is to increase patient engagement. The underlying
      premise is that engaged patients will be more likely to attend all their visits, receive all
      their treatments, and understand ways to manage treatment side effects so that they are less
      likely to go to the emergency room (ER) or be admitted to the hospital. An approach being
      tested is to use lay navigators to help identify patient issues and then help them address
      the issues through a combination of direct supportive activities (e.g., calling clinical team
      for the patient) and activities that help the patients help themselves (helping them
      understand when side effects warrant a call to their clinical team that they make
      themselves).

      Information including patient acceptance/refusal of navigator services; number and types of
      contacts with patients (phone, in-person, email); types of issues discussed (financial,
      social, educational, physical, emotional, etc); referrals made; and time spent with patients
      for each encounter will be routinely entered by the navigators for each patient contact. The
      data entered will be evaluated regularly to closely monitor navigator activities and better
      understand cancer patient issues/needs. This information will be used to inform possible
      training needs of navigators, educational needs of patients,needs for better referral
      support,help predict navigator case-load, and other issues.

      Eligibility Criteria:

      All new biopsy positive patients that have a treatment plan or receive surgery, chemotherapy
      or radiation therapy at Stanford in any of the following cancer care programs (CCP) will be
      eligible for a navigator: breast, gynecologic oncology, head/neck, gastrointestinal,
      cutaneous (melanoma patients only), and thoracic. Because there will be more patients
      eligible than the navigators can manage, only patients with an even MRN will receive a
      navigator for the pilot. The overall purpose of the pilot is to learn which patients benefit
      most and which services navigators are able to best help with. The investigators expect the
      pilot to last 6-12 months. Mixed methods will be used to evaluate the navigators and will
      include existing patient surveys,missed appointments, unscheduled hospitalizations, ER
      visits, phone call center volume, time to treatment, increase of percentage of new patients
      receiving treatment at Stanford, interviews with patients, staff (including navigators), and
      physicians regarding their experience with and perceived value of navigators

    <time_frame>6-12 months after eligibility is determined</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of CRMs will be used as a measure to assess quality of information exchange with patients. The hypothesis is that navigated patients will have more complete information about issues such as how to access services, take care of themselves appropriately, and understand symptoms of treatment side effects, which will result in fewer CRMs being generated. CRMs are created when a patient calls into the generic Stanford call line and the person answering is not able to resolve the patient's question. An electronic message is then created which is sent to a pool of nurses specific to a CCP. Someone from the pool then resolves the patient's question.</description>

    <measure>Patient Experience/Satisfaction</measure>

    <description>Responses from apriori selected questions from the transformation evaluation surveys will be evaluated for change over time in navigated patients compared to non-navigated. These results will also be put in the context of insights gained from patient interviews related to quality of care contributed by the navigators.</description>

    <description>Each of the above 'desired services' will be categorized as 'attended', 'missed,' or 'cancelled.' Rates and percentages of missed, cancelled, unplanned hospitalizations and ER visits will be compared between navigated and non-navigated patients. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses will be conducted. Adjusted analyses will control for patient demographics, clinical characteristics and treating physician.</description>
