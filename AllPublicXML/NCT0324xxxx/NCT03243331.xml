    <intervention_model_description>Study will enroll 3 patients to the cohort 1 dose level. If 0 of 3 patients experience a DLT, the study will proceed to cohort 2. If 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled into cohort 1. If 1 of 6 patients experience a DLT, the study will proceed and 3 patients will be enrolled to the cohort 2 dose level. If 0 patients experience a DLT in cohort 2, the study will proceed to cohort 3. If 1 patient experiences a DLT at cohort 2, 3 additional patients will be enrolled into cohort 2. If the study proceeds to cohort 3, 3 patients will be enrolled at this dose level. If 0 patients experience a DLT, the study will enroll an additional 3 patients at the cohort 3 dose level to better define the safety profile. If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at cohort 3, 3 additional patients will still be enrolled into cohort 3. If 1 of 6 patients experience a DLT, the study will complete.</intervention_model_description>
