  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Profession-led psycho-education programs for people with schizophrenia are evidenced to
      improve patients' knowledge about the illness, mental state and relapse rate. Nevertheless,
      other benefits to patients, for example, their functioning and insight into illness or to be
      substantive in a longer term (&gt;12 months) are inconsistent and uncertain, especially in Asian
      populations. This single-blind multi-site randomized clinical trial was to test the effects
      of a peer-expert-led psycho-education group intervention (in addition to usual care) for
      adult patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders over a 24-month follow-up, in comparison
      to a profession-led psycho-education group or treatment-as-usual only.

      Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a peer-expert-led psycho-education
      group programme for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders over an
      24-month follow-up. The program is an integrated,psycho-education program that addresses
      patients' knowledge and self-management of schizophrenia and problem-solving skills. Methods:
      A single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 342 Chinese
      patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In each of three study sites, the
      participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list (i.e., 114 subjects
      from each study site) and after baseline measurement, be assigned to either the peer-led
      psycho-education program, profession-led psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care.
      The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their
      re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24
      months after completing the interventions. Hypothesis: The patients in the peer-led
      psycho-education program will report significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and
      re-hospitalisation rates (primary outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.g., insight into
      illness and functioning) over the 24-month follow-up, when compared with those in
      profession-led psycho-education group and/or usual care. Conclusions: The findings will
      provide evidence whether the peer-led psycho-education group program can better improve
      Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and reduce their illness relapse.
