  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand if a mobile app is useful to assist young
      adult female survivors of childhood cancer in the self-management of survivorship-related
      needs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivorship related needs include managing lingering symptoms from treatment, how to keep a
      healthy lifestyle, social and medical issues, as well as other needs. The mobile health app
      that will be used in this study is the Health Storylines TM app developed by Self Care
      Catalysts Inc. The app can be used for an unlimited amount of time over nine months, which is
      how long the study will be conducted. The use of the Health Storylines TM app in this study
      is investigational.

      Participation in this study starts with setting up a study specific profile on the app and
      entering information including email address, age, ethnicity/race, cancer diagnosis, as well
      as other optional information for the profile (example health goals or current health
      conditions). Participants will then be prompted by the app to complete three questionnaires
      about their ability to self-manage their survivorship-related needs, their perception of
      their survivorship-related illness symptoms and perceived health related quality of life.
      They will be prompted on the app to complete these questionnaires again at the 3, 6 and 9
      month intervals of using the app. It will take about 20 minutes to complete the
      questionnaires at each measurement time. The only additional information that will be
      reported from the app for the study is the amount of time and features of programs accessed
      during the study period.

    <intervention_model_description>This project is a longitudinal one-group pilot study evaluating the use of a Mobile Health (mHealth) app intervention. This study will examine: 1) the amount/type of usage, 2 ) compliance with study evaluations and 3) the association of this mHealth app use with perceived self-efficacy in managing survivorship related needs, perceived health illness and health related quality of life. The study period will be nine months, with four measurement points to assess the study's outcomes: baseline, three, six, and nine months post initiation of the mHealth app.</intervention_model_description>
