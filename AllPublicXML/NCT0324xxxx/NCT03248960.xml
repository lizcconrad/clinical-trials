  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the
      iTreat Flu A+B Test and the ellume.lab Flu A+B Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B
      as compared to viral culture.

      The secondary aims are to:

      Validate the sensitivity and specificity of the iTreat Flu A+B Test and the ellume.lab Flu
      A+B Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B as compared to Reverse Transcriptase
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

      Evaluate the correct interpretation of the iTreat Flu A+B Test by subjects with
      influenza-like symptoms.

      Evaluate the subjects' satisfaction with the convenience, comfort and ease of use of the
      iTreat Flu A+B Test.

      Evaluate the operators' satisfaction with the ease of use of the ellume.lab Flu A+B Test.

    <description>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a molecular diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of influenza viruses, both for clinical samples and isolates. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows template viral RNA to be reverse transcribed producing complementary DNA (cDNA) which can then be amplified and detected.</description>
