  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot randomized controlled clinical trial will test the hypothesis that in
      patients with ARDS, fixing ventilator settings to the conventional protective ventilatory
      strategy (VT 6 ml/kg ideal body weight and Pplat ≤ 30 cmH2O, PEEP according the PEEP/FiO2
      table), control modes of mechanical ventilation will be associated to a concentration of
      pulmonary and systemic inflammatory mediators lower than the concentration of inflammatory
      mediators observed during assisted modes of mechanical ventilation.

  <detailed_description>

      All patients will be treated according to the sedation protocols and standards of care.
      Sedation will be guaranteed by continuous infusion of Propofol 2-4 ml / Kg / h, Remifentanil
      0.05-0.1 mcg / Kg / min to obtain a RASS scale level of -5 of the RASS. Mio-resolution
      eventually obtained by a loading dose of 15 mg e.v. followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5
      mg / h of besylated Cisatracury, will be reserved for patients with P/F &lt;150.

      During a 48 hrs pre-randomization period, control mechanical ventilation will be set with a
      Tidal Volume (VT) of 6 ml / kg (for ideal weight) and a Pplat limited to 30 cm H2O;
      inspiratory flow 50-70 l / min with end-of-breath pause of 0.2-0.5 sec, ratio I: E from 1: 1
      to 1: 3, respiratory frequency of 20-35 steps to maintain 7.3 &lt;pH &lt;7.5. If the pH is &lt;7.30
      the respiratory frequency will increase up to 35 / min; If the pH is&gt; 7.5, the respiratory
      rate will be progressively reduced to the target pH range. FiO2 and The PEEP will be set
      according to the ARDSnet table (33)

      After 48 hours, the patient will be randomized through one of the following two groups:

      Control Mechanical ventilation (CMV): patient's spontaneous activity will be shut done by
      sedation and/or respiratory muscles paralysis. Volume (during volume control) or pressure
      (during pressure control), PEEP, FiO2 and respiratory rate will be regulated according the
      ARDSnet protocol (33).

      Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV): patient's spontaneous activity will maintained and
      sedation will be maintained at a level of Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale (RASS) between
      -2 and -3. The level of pressure support (including PEEP) will be limited to ≤ 30 cmH2O; the
      pressure support level will ensure a tidal volume of 6 ml / Kg ideal body weight. PEEP, FiO2
      and respiratory rate will be regulated according the ARDSnet protocol (33)
