  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to conduct a two-group randomized trial to examine the
      efficacy of cognitive-behavioral based physical therapy (CBPT) for improving knee function,
      return to sport, and quality of life outcomes in patients following ACL reconstruction
      (ACLR). The study consists of two treatment groups: telephone-based cognitive-behavioral
      based physical therapy for ACLR (CBPT-ACLR) and telephone-based Education. The central
      hypothesis is that the CBPT-ACLR participants relative to the Education group will
      demonstrate significantly greater improvement in postoperative outcomes at 12 months
      following surgery.

    <description>The CBPT-ACLR program focuses on a patient-oriented approach to improve sports function and return to sport. CBPT-ACLR sessions cover realistic expectations, relaxation strategies, problem-solving training, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral self-management (i.e., graded activity, goal setting, managing setbacks and symptom management plans). Each session builds upon the content of the previous session using an action plan and weekly homework is personally tailored based on patient goals. The program consists of one preoperative telephone session and six postoperative telephone sessions with a physical therapist trained in CBPT. Sessions are 30 minutes and the postoperative sessions occur for the first 8 weeks after surgery. Each patient randomized into the CBPT-ACLR program will receive a manual to follow along with the study therapist.</description>

    <description>The education program focuses on postoperative ACLR recovery. Sessions address benefits of physical therapy, proper biomechanics during sports and other functional activity, importance of early exercise after surgery, and ways to promote healing. Education on stress reduction, sleep hygiene, energy management, communication with health providers, and preventing future injury are also provided. The Education program is matched to the CBPT-ACLR treatment in terms of session frequency, length and contact with the study therapist. Each patient randomized into the Education program will receive a manual to follow along with the study therapist.</description>
