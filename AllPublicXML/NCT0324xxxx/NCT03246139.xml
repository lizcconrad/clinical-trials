  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific study aims will be:

        1. To investigate the short- and long-term treatment effects of action observation,
           imagery, and execution therapy (AOIE) compared with an action observation therapy (AO)
           group and a customary rehabilitation group as controls on different aspects of outcomes
           in patients with stroke.

        2. To examine the neural mechanisms and changes in cortical neural activity after the
           interventions in stroke patients.

        3. To examine the correlations between AOIE-induced brain activation changes and the
           clinical efficacy of AOIE.

        4. To identify who are the possible good responders to the therapy based on baseline motor
           function and motor imagery ability of the participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 3-year randomized controlled trial to (1) investigate the short-
      and long-term treatment efficacy of AOIE, action observation alone, versus customary
      rehabilitation on clinical outcomes of patients with subacute stroke, (2) examine the neural
      mechanisms and activation changes after the 3 interventions by using an advanced brain
      imaging technique, magnetoencephalography (MEG), (3) determine the correlations between
      neural activation changes and clinical outcomes, and (4) identify who are the good responders
      to the AOIE therapy. An estimated total of 96 patients with subacute stroke will be recruited
      in this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 interventions
      for 3 weeks (a total of 15 sessions). Clinical outcome measures will be conducted at
      baseline, immediately after treatment (3 weeks), and at 3 months follow-up. The MEG
      assessment will be conducted at baseline and immediately after treatment (3 weeks). For the
      MEG study, The investigators anticipate to enroll 12 to 15 patients in each group to complete
      neuroimaging evaluation because of the specific eligibility criteria and high costs of MEG.
      The patients can still participate in the study, receiving rehabilitation therapy and
      clinical evaluations, even if the participants will not be included in the MEG study.
