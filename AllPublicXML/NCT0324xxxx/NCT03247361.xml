  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well-known that muscle weakness and deconditioning play an important role in low
      exercise capacity of patients with HF. Interestingly, not only peripheral muscles are
      impaired, but also respiratory muscles. Studies have shown that patients with HF may have, in
      addition to decreasing maximal inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, metabolic and
      structural impairments in diaphragm fibers. Moreover, exercise capacity and weakness of
      inspiratory muscles have been associated with low quality of life and poor prognosis, which
      make the addition of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) reasonable in cardiovascular
      rehabilitation.The specifications of the loads to be imposed during IMT is the main factor
      determining the outcome. Studies of IMT have highlighted the need for a fixed inspiratory
      workload during exercise. Thus, purpose of this report was to perform a randomized clinical
      trial of the effects of addition of high-intensity vs. low-intensity IMT to combined aerobic
      and resistance Exercise in patients with heart failure.

    <description>High-intensity IMT + Aerobic/resistance exercise
IMT: Training loads will be adjusted weekly to the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). In the first 2 weeks as adaptation, the protocol will be of 2 minutes warm-up with intensity 20% of MIP. The training will have 7 peaks of intensity with 70% of MIP for 30 sec, with 30-sec of passive rest between the peaks, finishing the training with 20% of MIP for 2 min, totaling 10 min and 30 sec. From the third week the protocol will be of 2 min warm-up with intensity 30% of MIP. The training will have 7 peaks of intensity with 70% of MIP for 60 sec, with 60-second of passive rest between the peaks, finishing the training with 20% of MIP for 2 min, totaling 17 min.

    <description>Low-intensity IMT + Aerobic/resistance exercise
IMT:Training loads will be also adjusted weekly to the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). In the first two weeks as adaptation, the protocol will be of 2 minutes warm-up with intensity 20% of MIP. The training will be held with 3 sets of 15 repetitions, with 40% of MIP, finishing the training with 20% of MIP for 2 minutes. From the third week the protocol will be of 2 minutes warm-up with intensity 30% of MIP. The training will be held with 3 sets of 15 repetitions, with 60% of MIP, finishing the training with 30% of MIP for 2 minutes.

    <description>Sham IMT + Aerobic/resistance exercise
Aerobic session will consist of a 4-min of warm-up, 20 minutes of exercise, and 4 min of cool-down. Intensity will set by the formula: Training HR = (maximum HR - resting HR) × intensity % + resting HR. Patients will exercise using 30 seconds, high-intensity work phases 0.7% followed by 1-minute recovery bouts 0.5%. Resistance exercise will consist of dynamic lower and upper limb exercise. Upper limb exercises will include 3 sets of exercises for each muscle group performed with 10 repetitions each. Lower limb exercises will include 3 sets of exercises for each muscle group performed with 12 repetitions each. Resistance exercises will be performed at 12-MR.</description>
