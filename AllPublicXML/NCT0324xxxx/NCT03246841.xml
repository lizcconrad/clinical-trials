  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TUMOSPEC is a national family study designed to measure the relative and absolute risk of
      cancer for carriers of deleterious mutations to these &quot;new&quot; breast cancer (BC) susceptibility
      genes. Index cases will be enrolled consecutively from patients attending an appointment at
      one of the Unicancer centres, with no other inclusion criteria, and offered a BRCA1/2
      analysis as part of their care plan. A panel of 24 TUMOSPEC genes, chosen in advance by a
      steering committee, will be tested as the same time as the BRCA1/2 genes, at one of the usual
      BRCA1/2 analysis laboratories belonging to the same network and participating in the study.
      If a mutation is found, the index cases will be asked to invite their first and second degree
      family members and their cousins to take part in the study, regardless of whether they have
      cancer. Saliva samples will be then taken and used for a targeted analysis of the familial
      abnormality. Each participant will also complete an epidemiological questionnaire in order to
      gather information about his/her medical history and any exposure to various risk factors.
      All medical and genotype data will be centralised at the Genetic Epidemiology Research
      Platform (PIGE, INSERM). The cumulative mutation frequency for all genes is estimated at 10%.
      Penetrance will be analysed using methods designed to minimise selection bias. The expression
      spectrum of the mutations will also be described. For genes where the number of mutated
      families is too low, the data may be contributed to international consortia. The main project
      will be preceded by a two-year feasibility study, using the same inclusion criteria and
      logistic circuits. It is this pilot study to which the current funding application relates.
