  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obese Chinese and prediabetes will be recruited and divided into three age-matched
      groups including high intensity exercise, moderate intensity exercise, and non-exercise
      groups. The exercise program will consist of three sessions per week over the course of 12
      weeks, under the supervision of our in-house exercise specialists and physiologists. The
      effects of exercise on glucose and lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity and adiposity will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 Chinese men aged between 21 and 60 years old with overweight/obesity (25 kg/m2 &lt;BMI &lt; 32.5
      kg/m2) and prediabetes will be recruited.The participants will be divided into three
      age-matched groups (n=20 in each group),including high intensity exercise, moderate intensity
      exercise, and non-exercise groups. The suitability of each participant for physical exercise
      will be assessed by an in-house exercise specialist, based on parameters of blood pressure,
      strength, cardiovascular fitness, balance, flexibility. The exercise program will consist of
      three sessions per week over the course of 12 weeks, under the supervision of our in-house
      exercise specialists and physiologists. Each session will comprise of warm-up, resistance and
      aerobic training components and a cool-down. The high intensity training (aerobic combined
      with strength training) will consist of six exercises of three sets each, with each exercise
      set at an intensity of 6 to 10 repetition maximum. Intensity, volume and exercise selection
      will be varied both within the week and over the 12 week program in a periodised system
      designed to maximize muscle hypertrophy and strength gain. Exercise intensity will be at 60
      to 80% of estimated heart rate maximum. Moderate intensity training (Aerobic training) will
      be conducted on a variety of ergometers including treadmill, cycle, rowing and cross training
      machines. The non-exercise group (delayed group) will be used as placebo control, and will
      participate in the training group at the later stage.
