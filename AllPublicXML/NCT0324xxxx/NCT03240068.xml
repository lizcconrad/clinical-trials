  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 8 million individuals in the United States
      alone. This is a form of atherosclerosis in which plaques preferentially build up inside the
      arteries of the legs to limit blood flow. These patients are at high risk for heart attack
      and stroke, with at least half dying from coronary artery disease. Our understanding of the
      causes of PAD remains incomplete. The renin-angiotensin hormone system is one mechanism known
      to contribute to atherosclerosis. Pharmacologic blockade of the hormone angiotensin II is
      beneficial in forms of atherosclerosis, including peripheral arterial disease, to improve
      blood vessel damage and functional outcomes. These therapies also increase circulating levels
      of angiotensin-(1-7), a hormone that dilates blood vessels. Angiotensin-(1-7) improves blood
      vessel function and reduces inflammation to protect against atherosclerosis in animal models;
      however, there are no clinical data in patients with atherosclerosis. The overall goal of
      this project is to examine the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin-(1-7) in PAD.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to determine if acute
      intravenous Ang-(1-7) infusion can reduce systemic inflammation and improve measures of leg
      blood flow in subjects with PAD. The investigators will also measure for changes in blood
      pressure and circulating hormones in response to angiotensin-(1-7) infusion. This is an
      outpatient study that will be conducted in the Clinical Research Center at the Penn State
      Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.

      Subjects with PAD will participate in a screening visit, and if eligible, in two separate
      study visits in which they will receive intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) or saline infusion.
      Each study visit will last approximately 4 hours, with at least one week of washout between
      study visits. During study visits, subjects will be instrumented with two intravenous
      catheters (one for drug infusion and one for blood sampling), arm and finger blood pressure
      cuffs, sticky patches to measure heart rate, a belt around the stomach to measure breathing,
      an ultrasound probe on each leg to measure blood flow, a probe on the ear to measure blood
      oxygen saturation, a probe on each calf muscle to measure oxygen levels, and probes on the
      skin to measure temperature and blood flow. The investigators will obtain baseline measures
      of blood pressure and heart rate and collect blood samples to measure hormones in the blood.
      After baseline measurements, the investigators will infuse angiotensin-(1-7) or saline for 50
      minutes. Finger cuff blood pressure, leg blood flow, and calf muscle oxygen levels will be
      measured continuously during infusions. The investigators will measure blood pressure and
      heart rate and collect blood samples at the end of the infusion period.
