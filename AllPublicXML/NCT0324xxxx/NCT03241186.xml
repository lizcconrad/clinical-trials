      The trial is a single arm phase II clinical trial of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in patients
      with resected mucosal melanoma. Ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) and Nivolumab (3 mg/kg) will be
      administered day 1 of a 21-day cycle in cycles 1-4 and then nivolumab 480 mg will be
      administered day 1 of a 28-day cycle for cycles 5-15 or until disease recurrence.

      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Combination Administration

        -  Ipilimumab 1mg/kg given IV Day 1 for 3 weeks (21 days), for 4 cycles

        -  Nivolumab 3mg/kg given IV Day 1 for 3 weeks (21 days), for 4 cycles

      Nivolumab Alone Administration

        -  Nivolumab 480mg given IV Day 1 for 4 weeks (28 days), for 5-15 cycles

      Nivolumab is to be administered as an approximately 30-minute IV infusion (± 10 minutes). At
      the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.

      Ipilimumab is to be administered as an approximately 30-minute IV infusion (± 10 minutes). At
      the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline or 5%
      dextrose solution.

      When both study drugs are to be administered on the same day, separate infusion bags and
      filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. The nivolumab
      infusion must be promptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line of nivolumab before
      starting the ipilimumab infusion. The second infusion will always be ipilimumab, and will
      start at least 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusion.

      The dosing calculations should be based on the body weight from Cycle 1 Day 1. If the
      subject's weight on the day of dosing differs by &gt; 5% from the weight used to calculate the
      dose, the dose should be recalculated based on the current day of treatment weight. All doses
      should be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose modifications allowed.

             of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study or

             prescribed regimens.

          -  Immunocompromised patients and subjects known to be HIV positive and currently
             receiving antiretroviral therapy. NOTE: Subjects known to be HIV positive, but without

        pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Any radiation within 2 weeks prior to study initiation. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant
             radiation are allowed, but must be completed &gt; 2 weeks prior to registration.

             heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the
             time of informed consent until 5 months after the last dose of study drug. The two
             contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method
             plus a hormonal method. Examples include: intrauterine device (IUD), vasectomy of a
             female subject's male partner, contraceptive rod implanted into the skin, or use of
             two of the following: diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with
             cervical cap/spermicide), cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only),
             contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only), male condom or female condom (cannot be
             used together), hormonal contraceptive.*Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual
