  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study designed to determine whether telephone based interventions can prevent
      return hospital visits for elderly and frail patients with acute symptoms of heart failure.
      Specifically, the intervention will improve patients ability to monitor and address self care
      of heart failure at home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common illness in Canadian emergency
      departments (ED). The frail subset of elderly patients with ADHF is challenging to treat, use
      a large proportion of available resources, and are at higher risk for complications,
      including readmission to hospital after discharge. The investigators believe that by
      improving access to follow-up, optimizing self-care, and addressing the various cognitive and
      physical limitations of frailty, it will be possible to improve quality of life and reduce
      readmission rates for frail patients with ADHF.

    <description>For the intervention arm, a specialized heart failure nurse practitioner will contact the patient or their primary caregiver by telephone within 5 days post-discharge and send them an education packet by mail. During the telephone call, the nurse will (1) confirm the patient's scheduled follow-up appointment in cardiology, (2) provide recommendations for heart failure self-care behaviors that were found to be deficient at baseline. Patients will then be referred to a Geriatrics Assessment Team, who will provide individualized recommendations for frailty domains that were found to be deficient at baseline. The technique used to provide educational recommendations will be motivational interviewing.</description>
