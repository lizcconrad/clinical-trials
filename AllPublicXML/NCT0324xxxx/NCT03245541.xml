  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the safety and tolerability of durvalumab in
      combination with stereotactive ablative radiotherapy (SABR), a standard radiation treatment,
      for patients with pancreatic cancer.

      This phase I/II study evaluates durvalumab with radiotherapy for patients with borderline
      resectable and locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Following SOC
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, patients will receive Durvalumab 750 mg every 14 days until
      resection or progression of disease, with concurrent stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy
      (SABR) starting on day 8 at 6.6 Gy per fraction every other day x 5 fractions. Prior to
      registration, subjects will complete screening including: H&amp;P with KPS; triplicate EKGs; CT
      CAP +/- PET; standard labs with urine pregnancy test (for WOCBP), TSH, PT/PTT and INR,
      research kit, and Hep A, Hep B, Hep C, and HIV testing; and EUS with research biopsy (EUS is
      SOC with fiducial placement). Main eligibility criteria include: histopathological or
      cytological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; weight &gt; 30 kg; KPS &gt;/= 80; life
      expectancy of greater than 6 months; normal organ and marrow function; not pregnant; prior
      anti-cancer treatment, except for gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel as stipulated by protocol; must
      have resolved any &gt;/= G2 AEs related to previous treatment; no previous PD1 or PD-L1
      inhibitor; no metastatic disease; must not have frank invasion of duodenum, bowel, or
      stomach; no active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; no live
      attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry; no active infection. For the
      duration of the trial, patients will be seen every one to two weeks for AE/DLT evaluation
      (DLTs assessed during first 10 weeks of study treatment), labs, and H&amp;P. Imaging will occur
      every 2 months, unless patient is deemed resectable and imaging is no longer clinically
      indicated post-surgery. Patients will have an optional research biopsy after completion of
      treatment and will be followed indefinitely for survival follow-up.

    <description>Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and CD80 and is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer. (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throughout this document.) As durvalumab is an engineered mAb, it does not induce antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab is interference of the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80.</description>

             Male subjects must be willing to refrain from sperm donation throughout these periods.
             Female partners of a male subject must use a highly effective method of contraception
             throughout these periods.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an informed consent document

             or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease; (3) Adequately treated carcinoma in
             situ without evidence of disease

          -  Patients who have had prior anti-cancer treatment or are currently receiving
