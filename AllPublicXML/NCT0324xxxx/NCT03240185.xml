    <textblock>
      This is a quality assurance trial to evaluate the effectiveness of guided breathing exercises
      on reducing the symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease in colorectal surgery patients. All patients
      who undergo hemorrhoid surgery are educated on breathing exercises that can be used to reduce
      pain and increase relaxation. These patients will be surveyed at their post-operative visit
      regarding pain and other symptoms and at their one month post operative visit on the any
      hospitalizations and emergency room visits since their surgery.

      The effectiveness of guided breathing exercises on reducing the symptoms of hemorrhoidal
      disease in colorectal surgery patients will be assessed in this quality assurance trial.
      During the pre-operative clinic visit, patients to undergo hemorrhoid surgery are educated on
      breathing exercises that can be used to reduce pain and increase relaxation. In this year
      long study patient self-reported utilization of the breathing exercises and their level of
      pain, sleep quality, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, etc), emergency room
      visits, and hospitalizations in the month post hemorrhoid surgery will be evaluated. All
      patients will be asked to complete a brief survey at their pre-operative and one month
      post-operative visits.

    <description>The Wong-Baker faces pain score scale which displays 6 faces with scores of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, where 0=no hurt and 10=worst hurt will be used in the pre-operative and post-operative surveys to assess each patient's self reported pain level. the lower the score the more favorable/less pain.</description>

    <measure>Utilization of breathing exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>within ~30 days of surgery, at the time of post-operative clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>Response to two questions in the post-operative survey will be used to assess wehether the patient did the breathing exercises after surgery (yes or no) and if they did how man times daily did they do the breathing exercises- &lt;2, 3-5, or &gt;5.</description>
