  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate changes in objective measures of disparity vergence after
      office-based vergence/accommodative therapy (OBVAT) for convergence insufficiency (CI) in
      children 12-17 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 participants with normal binocular vision and 30 with CI will be recruited for this
      prospective study. All participants with CI will be treated with 12 weeks of office-based
      vergence/accommodative therapy. The primary outcome measure will be the average peak velocity
      for 4° symmetrical convergence steps. Other objective outcome measures of disparity vergence
      will be time to peak velocity, latency, and accuracy. Changes in clinical measures [near
      point of convergence (NPC), positive fusional vergence at near (PFV)] and symptoms will be
      evaluated.

    <description>Twelve, 60-minute, weekly visits of office-based vergence/accommodation therapy will be administered by a trained therapist combined with procedures to practice at home (15 minutes, 5 times per week). This treatment sequence is a well-accepted approach for treatment of CI and has been successfully implemented in previous studies. Fifteen minutes of home-based therapy was prescribed to be performed 5 days per week, and compliance with home-based therapy was monitored at each visit by the therapist</description>
