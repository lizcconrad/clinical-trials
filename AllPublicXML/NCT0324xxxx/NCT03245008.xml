  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to verify the superiority of 16 weeks of MT-5547 treatment to
      placebo, as evidenced by the WOMAC pain score (the efficacy outcome measure), in patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. Additional objectives of the study are to investigate
      the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of MT-5547 in long-term use.

      The blind will be maintained, including for the study sponsor, until the key code is opened
      after the data have been fixed for all subjects in Week 24. In addition, in order to
      eliminate any bias that could affect the study assessments, to the extent possible, the blind
      will be maintained with respect to the study site and the subject even after the opening of
      the study sponsor key code.
