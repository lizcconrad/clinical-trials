    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that is progressing rapidly. Hepatic
      arterial embolization chemotherapy (TACE) is a common method for the treatment of
      unresectable of hepatocellular carcinoma.But for patients with &gt; 10cm hepatocellular
      carcinoma, the intervention effect was not satisfied.The cyberknife is a kind of stereotactic
      radiotherapy which can track the movement of tumor and monitor the position deviation of
      tumor in real time.This stuy is aimed to observe the efficiency and safety of the combination
      of TACE and cyberknife in the treatment of massive hepatocellular carcinoma.
