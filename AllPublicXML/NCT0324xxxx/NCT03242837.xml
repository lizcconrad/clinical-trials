    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of a resilience training on psychobiological factors which
      are related to stress and resilience in young healthy male cadets. Half of participants will
      join in the resilience training, while the other half take part in a control-training
      (diversity management training).

    <textblock>
      The resilience training (Army Resilience Training / ART) is a stress prevention program based
      on well established methods from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Positive Psychology
      adapted for the needs of Swiss Armed Forces. ART is designed for healthy subjects to learn
      how to get over strain.

      Diversity management training (DMT) aims to promote social skills and acts as control
      condition. DMT is part of the military training but not mandatory for the study population.
