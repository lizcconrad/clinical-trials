  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The buccal cavity is colonized by numerous microorganisms whose the number and composition
      could be modified with medical background (diseases and drugs) and the level of oral hygiene
      of the patients. Among all microorganisms identified in the periodontium, few of them are
      implicated in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal pathologies. To date, four major bacteria
      are identified for their ability to degrade periodontal tissues.

      Although the periodontitis is established to be the consequence of bacterial virulence and
      immune dysfunction, these factors fail to explain the refractory periodontitis of some
      patients to etiologic treatment .

      Others microorganisms such as protozoans could have an impact on this disease.
