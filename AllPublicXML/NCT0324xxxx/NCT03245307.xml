  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2（VEGFR-2）,
      inhibits multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in vitro. This study in patients with
      advanced cancer evaluated the effect of Apatinib on CYP450 function by comparing the
      pharmacokinetics of CYP-specific probe drugs in the presence and absence of Apatinib. The
      probes used included Nifedipine (CYP3A specific), warfarin (CYP2C9 specific).

      This open-label study consists of a drug interaction phase that (part A) and a
      drug-continuation phase (part B). Patients will receive CYP450-probe drugs, and PK
      assessments will be performed before apatinib-administration and aſter once-daily
      administration of apatinib for 5 days (the predicted time point when steady-state plasma
      apatinib concentrations will have been achieved).
