  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests whether an enhanced primary cared based literacy promotion intervention
      consisting of a video and text message will increase shared reading occurrences between
      parents and children compared to the standard version.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of an enhanced
      intervention consisting of a video and a series of text messages in promoting shared reading
      between parents and children. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms (1)
      the enhanced intervention consisting of a video in the waiting room, standard guidance on
      shared reading, and a series of text messages (2) regular care which includes standard
      guidance on shared reading. The primary outcome will be shared reading occurrences. Secondary
      outcomes will include receipt of intervention, measure of the cognitive home environment,
      developmental screening results, and measure of parent reading beliefs.
