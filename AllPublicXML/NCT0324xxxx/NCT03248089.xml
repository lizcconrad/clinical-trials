      Tumor Derived cell free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly used in the clinic to obtain genotype
      information about lung cancer, but its concordance with concurrent tumor-derived sequenced
      data is not known. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority
      of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping.

      Primary objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping as it
      pertains to the detection of clinically-actionable biomarkers in first line, treatment naïve,
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

      The following secondary objectives will be studied:

        -  Turn around Time (TAT) of cfDNA vs. tissue results.

        -  Time to treatment (TtT) initiation.

        -  Quantity not sufficient rate (QNS) of tissue for clinically-actionable biomarker
           testing.

        -  Tumor Not Detected (TND) rate of cfDNA in blood.

        -  Rescue rate of QNS samples using cfDNA-derived genotyping.

        -  Rate response for patients that are actionable biomarker positive (either in cDNA or
           tissue) treated with target-drugs according investigator criteria. Up to three RECIST
           assessments per patient will be retrospectively done by external personnel (no
           investigational team).

        -  Rate of discovery of genomically mediated, acquired resistance to targeted therapies in
           the biomarker-positive subsets.

      Approximately 20 mL of peripheral blood will be collected in StreckTM tubeS. cfDNA will be
      drawn following blood withdraws following standard of care of the participating site, which
      would be, before treatment (v2); on the same date as the first standard of care labs (V3),
      which would be approximately 2 weeks (14 days) into first-line treatment and after one year
      from enrollment or upon progression whichever occurs first (EoS visit).
