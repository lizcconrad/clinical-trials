  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study was to clarify the relationship between protein intake and
      health by using a very large, general population cohort study, UK Biobank, to study the
      associations between reported protein intake (expressed in g/day, g/kg/day and % of total
      energy intake) and three health outcomes (all-cause mortality, incidence CVD and cancer).
