  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and it is associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein (PVI) by radiofrequency
      energy or cryoablation has been shown to be an effective treatment of AF by reducing
      morbidity, improving quality of life and functional capacity.

      Renal artery sympathetic denervation (RND) by catheter ablation has been shown in a
      preliminary study to improve outcome of PVI in patients with paroxysmal and/or persistent AF
      with concomitant refractory or moderate hypertension. In patients with renal impairment, RND
      also conferred benefit in reducing AF recurrence after PVI. The initial indication for
      catheter-based RND is for blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension.
      However, a recent study failed to show significant difference in blood pressure reduction by
      RND. Therefore, the effect of RND on AF suppression may be independent of blood pressure
      control. Possible mechanisms of RND on AF may include risk factors modification and
      anti-arrhythmic effect.

    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aimed to evaluate the effect of RDN added to PVI for
      persistent AF. Study will be performed in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki.

      Study Hypothesis: Catheter based RDN can prevent recurrence of AF in patient with persistent
      AF undergoing PVI by mechanism not related to hypertension control.

      Primary outcome measure: Freedom from documented AF episodes post PVI as defined by longer
      than 30 seconds of AF recorded by implantable loop recorder 2 to 18 months after procedure
      with or without antiarrhythmic medication.

      Sample Size:

      This is an exploratory study, the sample size calculation will not be applied and arbitrary
      assign 20 subjects to each arm will be adopted.

      Randomization Arms:

      Patients are randomized in 1:1 fraction to one of the following arms:

        1. PVI by cryo-balloon ablation without linear ablation;

        2. PVI by cryo-balloon ablation without linear ablation plus bilateral RND using a
           multi-electrode renal denervation catheter.

    <intervention_model_description>Research on the Basis of Earlier Theory Renal artery sympathetic denervation (RND) by catheter ablation has been shown in a preliminary study to improve outcome of electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein (PVI) in patients with paroxysmal and/or persistent AF with concomitant refractory hypertension and the same group later showed renal sympathetic denervation improved outcome of PVI in the cohort of paroxysmal and/or persistent AF patients with moderate hypertension. In patients with renal impairment, RND also conferred benefit in reducing AF recurrence after PVI.The initial indication for catheter-based RND is for blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension. Early data from clinical trials without sham controls was promising - demonstrating large blood pressure reductions in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.</intervention_model_description>
