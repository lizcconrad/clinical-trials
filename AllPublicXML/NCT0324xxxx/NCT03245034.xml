    <textblock>
      This feasibility study develops methods for larger-scale research, evaluating the
      acceptability and perceived impact of a group acupuncture and acupressure intervention, as
      well as suitability of a self-report instrument. During their weekly training program, eleven
      OB residents at NYU Lutheran Medical Center will receive three sessions of auricular
      acupuncture therapy. (This resident population was previously anonymously surveyed and all
      expressed interest in participating in such a study). The Professional Quality of Life Scale
      (ProQOL) will be administered at 6 time points. A brief survey will also be given to assess
      participants' acceptance of the intervention as well as applicability of the ProQOL
      instrument. Additional feasibility-related outcomes include protocol compliance/withdrawals,
      adverse events, and time taken to complete intervention and surveys.

    <description>Acupuncture treatment will be the NADA protocol, a well-known and commonly used protocol that has previously been studied for stress relief in health care workers.In this protocol, 5, Â½&quot; needles are inserted in each auricle and retained while the group relaxes for 20 minutes. It will be conducted by two acupuncturists credentialed at NYU Lutheran (TK and AG).</description>
