    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to: 1) assess the safety and tolerability and 2) establish a
      preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a
      maximum administered dose (MAD) of MK-2118 when administered via intratumoral (IT) injection
      as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) intravenous (IV) infusion and
      via subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with pembrolizumab IV infusion in the
      treatment of adult participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.

    <textblock>
      Participants will receive either MK-2118 monotherapy or MK-2118 in combination with
      pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years).

      All participants will undergo an at least 24-hour observation period following the first dose
      administration of MK-2118 on Cycle 1, Day 1.
