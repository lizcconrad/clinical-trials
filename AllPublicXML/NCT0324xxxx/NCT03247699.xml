      Healthy Subjects will receive treatment orally with 120-200ml tap water in fasted state.

      Treatment in period A is the &quot;Basel phenotyping cocktail&quot; capsule. Treatment in period B
      consists of simultaneous intake of isolated formulations. In both study arms peripheral
      venous and capillary blood (DBS) samples will be drawn
