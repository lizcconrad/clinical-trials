      BACKGROUND Global burdens of heart failure (HF) are increasing in modern societies.
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) increases peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) in HF
      patients, which was hypothesized to improve the survival of HF patients.

      OBJECTIVES The cohort study aimed to highlight the effect of HIIT on long-term survivals of
      HF patients.

      METHODS 329 HF patients, enrolled between 2009 and 2016, received multidisciplinary disease
      management program (MDP). They had cardiopulmonary exercise test for peak exercise capacity
      (VO2peak), echocardiographic examination for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV
      end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), b-type natriuretic
      peptide (BNP), and quality of life questionnaire. HF patients with LVEF≤ 40% (HFrEF) and HF
      patients with LVEF&gt; 40% (HFpEF) underwent≥ 36 times of HIIT. HFrEF and HFpEF patients were
      classified as the MDP group. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to estimate the
      interaction between time and VO2peak, LVEF, LVEDD, LVESD, and BNP during the follow-up.
      Survival analysis was conducted to assess effects of HIIT on the long-term survival of HF
      during at end of the study.

    <description>Patients warmed up for 3 min at 30% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). Five 3-minute intervals at 80% of VO2peak and each interval was separated by 3-minute exercise at 40% of VO2peak. The exercise session was terminated by 3-minute cool-down at 30% of VO2peak. All subjects used a EKG and BP monitors as indicators of the assigned exercise intensity. Borg 6-to-20 scale was used to assess the rate of perceived exertion during and after each exercise session. Patients suffering unstable hemodynamic, ischemic cardiac symptoms/signs, and uncontrolled arrhythmia were instructed to immediately terminate exercise training.</description>

        Baseline information of all eligible candidates, including age, gender, body mass index
        (BMI), and disease duration were recorded. Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), creatinine
        (Cre), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glycohemoglobin (Hba1c), and b-type
        natriuretic peptide (BNP) were evaluated during the follow-up. Each blood sampling for BNP
        analysis and short form-36 health survey (SF-36) of physical component score (PCS) and
        mental component score (MCS) for qualities of life were performed just before each
        cardiopulmonary exercise test and echocardiographic examination.
