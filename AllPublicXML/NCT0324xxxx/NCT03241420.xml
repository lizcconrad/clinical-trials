      To determine the utility and sensitivity of the lung clearance index (LCI) technique as a
      marker of small airways disease in adults with chronic lung conditions compared to healthy
      adults, adjusting for age, sex and smoking status.

      Target Population and Enrollment. The study will recruit and consent 300 patients from our
      Occupational Medicine and Interstitial Lung Disease Clinics at National Jewish Health who
      have been referred for evaluation of chronic lung conditions. The healthy control group will
      comprise 300 volunteers who are at least 18 years of age, have no history of pre-existing
      lung disease, and report no respiratory illness in the four weeks preceding enrollment.
      Inclusion criteria for the group with chronic lung disease will include physician diagnosis
      of a chronic lung condition (e.g. bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, coal mine dust
      lung disease, asbestosis), and age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria will include recent
      myocardial infarction, stroke, eye surgery, chest/abdominal surgery (within past month),
      known thoracic, aortic, or cerebral aneurysm, or uncontrolled hypertension. Study
      participation will consist of one visit that will last between 90-120 minutes. The chronic
      lung disease group will fill out the informed consent and complete both LCI testing and
      spirometry. The healthy control group will complete informed consent, a brief questionnaire,
      LCI testing, and spirometry.
