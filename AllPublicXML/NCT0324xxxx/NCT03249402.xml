  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple 40 milligram (mg) doses of
      JNJ-42847922 on the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of a combination
      oral contraceptive (OC) containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LN) in healthy
      female adult partcipants.
