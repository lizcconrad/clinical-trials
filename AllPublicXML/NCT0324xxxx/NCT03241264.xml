        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is in good health, as determined by the Investigator

          -  Subject consumes an average of no more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day within the 6
             months before administration of study drug

          -  Subject has serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (intact) within the limits of the
             normal range of the laboratory

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a disease or condition (medical or surgical) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may compromise the hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, skeletal, or central nervous systems; or other conditions
             that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             ND-L02-s0201 solution, or that may place the subject at increased risk

          -  Subject has a history of bone disease, including osteoporosis and osteomalacia,
             Paget's disease of bone, or a history of unexplained fractures or fractures after
             minimal trauma

          -  Subject has abnormal laboratory values considered to be clinically significant by the
             Investigator
