  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to assess the MTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability
      and preliminary antitumor activity of DBPR112 in patients with head and neck cancer and EGFR
      mutated lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human study to determine the MTD and
      RP2D of DBPR112 and to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of DBPR112 in Asian patients.
      Patients with non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed following prior therapy with
      an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor or in patients with
      squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN) who have progressed following prior standard
      therapy will be selected. Approximately 24 to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study as
      out patients/inpatients, in 2 study centers in Taiwan.
