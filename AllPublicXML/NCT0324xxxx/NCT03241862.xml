    <textblock>
      20 subjects with mild to severe oral commissures or none to severe perioral lines will be
      enrolled and injected with Restylane® Silk. Photographs will be taken prior to and 14 days
      after Optimal Cosmetic Results has been achieved, as judged by the investigator.

      Changes in the projected first impression will be assessed by a total of 200 blinded
      evaluators rating the photographs of subjects from the baseline and from 14 days post
      achieving the Optimal Cosmetic Results. Changes in subjects' mood will be self-assessed
      through Subjective Happiness Scale and Happiness Measures questionnaires. Aesthetic
      alterations will be assessed by the investigator via the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale,
      Oral Commissure Severity Scale, and the Perioral Lines Severity Scale as well as by the
      self-assessment of subjects using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale.
