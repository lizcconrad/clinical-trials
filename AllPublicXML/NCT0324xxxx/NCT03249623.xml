  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients residing in the intensive care unit typically receive mechanical ventilatory
      support. Selecting the appropriate level of mechanical ventilation is not trivial, and it has
      been shown that lung protective settings can reduce mortality in patients with lung injury.
      Despite being a life- saving therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation should be kept at a
      minimum to reduce effects of immobilization, long-term sedation, patient discomfort, risk of
      ventilator associated pneumonia, leading to decreasing mortality and economic costs etc. The
      duration of mechanical ventilation is also an important factor in weaning from ventilatory
      support, with prolonged ventilator support making the weaning process more difficult.

      The purpose of this study is to compare mechanical ventilation following advice from the
      Beacon Caresystem to that of standard care in general medical intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients, from the start of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation until successful
      extubation. The Beacon Caresystem will be compared to standard care to investigate whether
      use of the system results in similar care or reduced time for weaning from mechanical
      ventilation.

      All patients admitted to the ICU with mechanical ventilation are screened for inclusion.
      Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (≥ 24 h) will be considered for inclusion
      in the study on a daily basis. Patient screening will be performed by clinical researchers or
      a delegated clinician and consent/assent will be sought. Then patients will be randomised to
      the Beacon group or Standard Care group. Randomisation will be performed using sealed
      envelopes, and in blocks of patients, allowing interim analysis of results in appropriate
      steps during the study. To avoid that results are affected by patient disease type,
      randomisation will be stratified for equal distribution between randomisation groups.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either standard care of mechanical ventilation, or to
      follow the advice of the Beacon Caresystem. The results of these two strategies will then be
      compared based upon the following outcome measurements.

    <description>On randomisation to the Beacon group, a Beacon Caresystem will be connected to the patient. This involves connecting a pulse oximeter to the patient's finger (toe or ear) to measure pulse oximetry oxygen saturation and pulse, and placing a standard clinical respiratory gas analysis and flow sensor in the respiratory tubing connecting the ventilator to the patient. This sensor allows measurement of respiratory pressure, flow and volume; plus respiratory gas CO2 and O2.</description>

    <description>For this group mechanical ventilation is managed according to standard care. A Beacon CareSystem will be connected to the patient, as for the Beacon Randomisation group, but the system will be used solely for data collection, and advice will be disabled. Physiological variables captured in this arm of the study will mirror the intervention arm. Decision relating to weaning, extubation, reintubation and sedation including level of seniority of personnel involved in the decision tree process will be documented accordingly.</description>

    <description>The core of the system is a set of physiological models including pulmonary gas exchange, acid-base chemistry, lung mechanics, and respiratory drive. The Beacon Caresystem tunes these models to the individual patient such that they describe accurately current measurements. Once tuned, the models are used by the system to simulate the effects of changing ventilator settings. The results of these simulations are then used calculate the clinical benefit of changing ventilator settings by balancing the competing goals of mechanical ventilation.</description>
