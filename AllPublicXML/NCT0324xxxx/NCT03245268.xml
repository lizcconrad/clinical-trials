  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The International Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty (BPA) Registry is a prospective,
      multi-center, long-term observational project. Scheduled to start data collection in Q4 2017,
      the registry will run for approximately four years with a follow-up time for each patient of
      at least two years. Its primary objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BPA
      intervention in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) not
      amenable to pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA).
