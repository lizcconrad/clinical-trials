  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new brain stimulation technique, static magnetic
      field stimulation (tSMS), which involves holding a static neodymium magnet over the scalp,
      can influence normal rhythms of brain activity.

      The investigator's primary objective is to determine the feasibility of modifying frontal
      brain activity using static magnetic fields. The investigator's will be examining the effects
      of static magnetic field of the spectral power of EEG data with healthy human participants.

      This is a within-subjects design, where each participant will receive sham and active
      stimulation on the left and right frontal cortex. EEG data will be collected during each
      stimulation.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study, meaning that neither the participant nor the experimenter knows what kind of stimulation the participant is receiving. An unblinded monitor (separate from the staff that interacts with the participant) is responsible for providing the study coordinator with the active and sham magnet sequence. Each magnet has a number; the study coordinator is not aware which number corresponds to active or sham magnets.</masking_description>
