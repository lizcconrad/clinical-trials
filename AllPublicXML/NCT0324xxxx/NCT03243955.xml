  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is an emerging technology for
      non-invasive neuromodulation that has broad potential implications and warrants further
      study. The investigators' clinical experience from the University of California, Los Angeles
      (UCLA) Center for East-West Medicine (CEWM) has also demonstrated that TEAS can be used as an
      effective self-care tool for patients with chronic illness who do not have the time or
      resources for frequent acupuncture treatments. Chronic constipation is the chosen area of
      study because of the large population with a substantial impairment in health-related quality
      of life and work productivity. The investigators have recently completed a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating the benefit of perineal self-acupressure on quality of
      life measurements in this population, which supports investigation into other
      acupuncture-based self-care interventions. Given these findings, the investigators
      hypothesize that home patient-administered TEAS can provide measurable improvements in both
      symptom severity and health related quality of life.

      This study will be a double blinded randomized controlled trial. Respondents will be screened
      by phone and qualified subjects will be sent home for 2 weeks to complete a bowel movement
      logbook, then return into the CEWM office where they will submit validated surveys
      (specifically, the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL) and have a photo taken of their tongue. A baseline
      non-invasive heart rate variability (HRV) measurement will be taken at this time as well.
      Study personnel will instruct each subject on TEAS pad placement and how to use the device,
      but not tell the subjects where to place the pads. The subjects will been assigned to one of
      two experimental groups (verum and sham) based on a 1:1 random allocation, with the study
      personnel blinded to the allocation. Both groups will be given transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulator (TENS) units with pre-set parameters and access to the adjustable amplitude
      dial for self-adjustment of amplitude, with the verum group given pre-printed information on
      proper application on true acupoints, and sham group will be given information on
      non-acupuncture points. The subjects will be instructed on daily use for 30 minutes per day
      for at least 5 days per week, and asked to track device use as well as bowel movement
      frequency and quality using a logbook. They will also submit to an online survey every week
      during the 4-week trial period. At the conclusion of the study, they will return the units
      and repeat the survey and HRV measurements.
