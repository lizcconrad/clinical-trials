  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the drug gets into the blood stream and
      how long it takes the body to get rid of it during an acute migraine attack and also during
      the time between acute migraine attacks.

      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

      This study includes two study periods. Each study period requires an overnight stay in the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for at least one night (and up to three nights), followed by up
      to two outpatient appointments. This study will last approximately 5-6 weeks (not including
      screening).

      Follow-up is required four to seven days after last dose of investigational drug. Screening
      is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.

      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.

             International Headache Society (IHS) International Classification of Headache
             Disorders (ICHD)-3 beta guidelines (1.1 and 1.2) (ICHD-3 beta, Cephalalgia 2013), for
             at least 1 year, based on medical history

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 40.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m²)
             inclusive, at the time of screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

             pressure ≤ to 50 or &gt;95 mmHg

          -  Have clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, including a QT interval
             corrected for heart rate using QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's
             formula (QTcF) value &gt;450 milliseconds (ms) (males) or &gt;470 ms (females), clinically
             significant bradycardia, cardiac block, or bradyarrhythmias

             active neuropsychiatric disease (for example, manic depressive illness, schizophrenia,
             major depressive disorder)

          -  Have a history of gastrointestinal surgery, or a history of or current irritable bowel
             syndrome, mal-absorptive disorders, or other gastrointestinal motility disorders.

          -  Have used or intend to use any migraine prevention treatments (including, but not
             limited to, propranolol or topiramate) within 30 days prior to dosing and until the
             follow-up visit
