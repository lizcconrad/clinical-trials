    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators provide participants≤14 years old the artificial intelligent
      clinic or normal clinic in the purpose of seeking out a better way to make a definite
      diagnosis with high efficiency and accuracy, and report a prospective, randomized controlled
      study aiming at comparison of artificial intelligent clinic and normal clinic for diagnosing
      congenital cataract.

    <textblock>
      Children ≤14 years old from ophthalmic clinic without treatment were enrolled to a
      prospective, randomized controlled study. Patients were assigned to two groups: participants
      in group A went to the artificial intelligent clinic and get the initial diagnosis, while in
      Group B, the participants went to the normal clinic. Investigators provide the final definite
      diagnosis from experts for two groups. Investigators compared the accuracy of the diagnosis,
      time consuming and the satisfaction level between two groups, aiming at comparison of
      artificial intelligent clinic and normal clinic for diagnosing congenital cataract.
