    <textblock>
      Current French guidelines allow oral intake of clear fluid in women in established labor
      under epidural analgesia. To date, no study assessed how these guidelines are followed in
      clinical practice. This study aims to assess the current practices as to the fasting during
      the labor at our institution, while assessing the experience and the expectations of the
      parturients (level of comfort or discomfort related to fasting).
