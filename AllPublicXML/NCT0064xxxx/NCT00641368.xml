      The study will evaluate the R4Power program, an online intervention designed to teach
      adolescents coping and problem-solving skills.

      This study examines the feasibility of a 10-lesson web-based intervention, the R4Power
      program, and its effectiveness in preventing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The R4Power
      Program teaches cognitive and problem-solving skills covered in classroom based
      interventions, including the Penn Resiliency Program, that have been found to reduce or
      prevent symptoms of depression in children and adolescents. This study examines whether
      adolescents can benefit from learning these skills through a computer (rather than classroom)
      intervention.

      Adolescents in grades 6 through 8 who participate in this study will be assigned to one of
      two conditions: an intervention group that will complete the R4Power program during the first
      year (R4Power1), or a waitlist control group that will complete the R4Power program the
      following year (R4Power2). Students will complete the 10-lesson program over the course of
      twelve weeks. They will learn and practice cognitive skills (recognizing the link between
      their thoughts and feelings, identifying thinking traps, challenging their negative beliefs)
      and problem-solving skills (assertiveness, relaxation and distraction, overcoming
      procrastination, and decision making). Adolescents who participate in this study will be
      followed for one year, and their coping responses and symptoms of depression and anxiety will
      be assessed at four points: at the beginning of the study (baseline) and at follow-up
      assessments approximately 4, 12 and 16 months after baseline.
