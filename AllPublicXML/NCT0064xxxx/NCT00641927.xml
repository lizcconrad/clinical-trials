      This study examines the relative safety and benefit of antidepressant therapy (versus
      recommended mood stabilizer therapy)of bipolar type II major depressive episode. We
      hypothesize that antidepressant therapy will be superior to mood stabilizer therapy with
      little or no difference in treatment emergent manic symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar type II (BP II) major depressive episode (MDE), affects 2.5% of the US adult
      population and results in an estimated healthcare cost of $40 billion annually. BP II
      disorder is a distinct clinical entity that differs from BP I disorder, and is characterized
      by a preponderance of MDEs that result in particularly high morbidity and mortality rates.
      The treatment of BP II MDE remains a challenge for clinicians. Concerns over antidepressant
      drug (AD) induced manic switch episodes have led current practice guidelines to recommend
      treating BP II MDE with mood stabilizer (MS) monotherapy and to avoid AD monotherapy. To
      date, there are no controlled clinical trials to test the validity of these empirical
      guidelines. Results from our preliminary BP II MDE studies have shown that fluoxetine
      monotherapy may be safe and effective initial treatment of BP II MDE with a low manic switch
      rate. Based upon these observations, we now ask (Specific aim #1): &quot;What is the relative
      safety and efficacy of initial AD monotherapy vs. MS monotherapy of BP II MDE?&quot; and &quot;What is
      the relative manic switch rate of initial AD vs. MS monotherapy of BP II MDE?&quot; To answer
      these questions, patients with BP II MDE will be treated in a 12-week, randomized, parallel
      group comparison of venlafaxine monotherapy vs. lithium monotherapy. We hypothesize that AD
      monotherapy will have superior efficacy vs. MS monotherapy, and that there will be a similar
      manic switch rate among both treatment conditions. If our hypotheses are correct, we believe
      that these results may have an important public health impact on the current practice
      guidelines for treating BP II MDE.
