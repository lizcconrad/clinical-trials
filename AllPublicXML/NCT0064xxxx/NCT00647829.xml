  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was performed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      valdecoxib 20 mg twice daily (BID), valdecoxib 40 mg once daily (QD), and placebo in patients
      with moderately to severely painful symptomatic sore throat over a 24-hour period. In
      addition, the study was to validate a new scale and criteria for measuring pain in sore
      throat and evaluate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and past sore
      throat pain on pain score and efficacy of analgesics. The study also examined what type of
      medications are commonly used for sore throat and whether this information has relevance to
      analgesic efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Included patients had moderate to severe pain, as measured by the Sore Throat Pain
             Intensity Scale (STPIS) on swallowing ≥66 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)
             and a minimum of 4 points on the 10-point Tonsillo-Pharyngitis Score (TPS) but who
             were not coughing or experiencing any evidence of mouth-breathing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who used throat lozenges, throat spray, cough drops or menthol-containing
