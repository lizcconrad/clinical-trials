      The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of the CYPHER SELECTTM +
      Sirolimus-eluting Balloon-expandable Coronary and Infrapopliteal Stent over balloon
      angioplasty in de novo and restenotic native below the knee tibioperoneal, anterior and/or
      posterior tibial and/or peroneal arterial lesions in a prospective, multicenter, randomized
      clinical study.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in 18 centers in Europe.
      A total of 200 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis
      to either balloon angioplasty or the CYPHER SELECTTM + Coronary and Infrapopliteal Stent for
      infrapopliteal use in subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford 3, 4,
      or 5).

      All subjects will undergo a repeat angiography at 12 months to assess the primary endpoint of
      In-Segment Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months.

          -  The subject is currently taking Coumarin / Warfarin which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, interferes with the subject's participation in the study;

             with the subject's optimal participation in the study;

          -  The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study
             that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the
