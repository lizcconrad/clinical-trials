        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be able to communicate meaningfully with the investigator, be legally
             competent, provide written informed consent, and follow a specified diet and exercise
             program.

          -  Female subjects must be nonlactating and must either be a) at least one year
             postmenopausal; or b) surgically sterilized by bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy; or c) using adequate contraceptive precautions (i.e.,
             oral contraceptives, approved hormonal implant, intrauterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicide, condom with spermicide).

          -  A serum pregnancy test, which must be negative, is required of all females except
             those who are surgically sterile or postmenopausal.

          -  The subject must be at least 18 years old.

          -  The subject must have a systolic blood pressure &lt;=140 mmHg, a diastolic blood
             pressure&lt;=90 mmHg, and a pulse rate &lt;=95 beats per minute (see Section VI.I.). Treated
             hypertensives are allowed in the study.

          -  The subject must have been enrolled in a nonpharmacologic weight loss program with
             documented weight loss of &gt;=10 kg maintained for at least 6 months, have gained back
             &lt;50% of their peak lost weight (while currently maintaining a weight loss of &gt;=10 kg),
             and be stabilized on a weight-maintaining diet for at least 1 month prior to
             screening.

          -  The subject's body mass index (BMI) must be &gt;=27 kg/m2 and &lt;=40 kg/mg2, rounded to the
             nearest whole unit, and must have been &gt;=30 kg/m2 prior to initiation of the
             nonpharmacological weight loss program prior to screening.

          -  The subject must have lived in the immediate geographic area for at least 2 years
             prior to screening.

          -  If the subject is on chronic medication, the dose must have been constant for at least
             two months prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must not have a history of anorexia nervosa.

          -  The subject must not have a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, any
             clinically significant abnormal cardiac condition, or be known to have a clinically
             significantly abnormal ECG. Specifically excluded conditions include coronary artery
             disease, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.

          -  The subject must not have a history of stroke.

          -  The subject must not have a history of narrow angle glaucoma.

          -  The subject must not have an organic cause of obesity (e.g., untreated
             hypothyroidism).

          -  The subject must not have a history of seizures.

          -  The subject must not have severe renal or hepatic dysfunction.

          -  The subject must not be using any of the following medications while taking study
             medication: monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, phenelzine, procarbazine
             HCl, selegiline), lithium, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, opioids (e.g.,
             dextromethorphan, meperidine, pentazocine, fentanyl), prescribed or over-the-counter
             weight loss agents, centrally acting appetite suppressants, tryptophan, migraine
             agents (e.g., sumatriptan succinate, dihydroergotamine) or any other medication that,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, may pose harm to the subject, obscure the effects
             of study medication or interfere with the process of drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion (i.e., enzyme inducers or enzyme inhibitors). The regular use
             of sympathomimetics (e.g. cough and cold remedies, asthma medication) is
             contraindicated during the study. Study medication should be discontinued for 3 days
             before the use of opioids. THE SUBJECT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN OFF ANTIDEPRESSANTS IN
             ORDER TO BE PLACED IN THE STUDY.

          -  The subject must not have a history of hypersensitivity to MERIDIA.

          -  The subject must not have a history of alcohol or drug addiction.
