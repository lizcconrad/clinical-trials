  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of forodesine in
      treating subjects with CLL who have failed at least one prior treatment regimen or who are
      treatment naïve but are either elderly, have poor performance status or are otherwise
      predicted not to tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years and older

             using the standard diagnostic criteria.

          3. Subjects with Rai stage III or IV, or earlier stage requiring therapy as determined by
             the 1996 National Cancer Institute -Working Group (NCI-WG) criterion

          4. Primary resistant (no CR or PR) or progressive disease after response to at least one
             prior treatment regimen OR treatment naïve subjects who meet at least one of the
             following criteria.

               1. age &gt;65 years

               2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, 3, or 4

               3. Inability to tolerate standard cytotoxic chemotherapy in the opinion of the
                  treating physician.

          5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (for subjects with primary resistance or
             progressive disease after response to at least one prior treatment regimen).

          6. Willing to take adequate contraceptive measures (i.e., latex condom, cervical cap,
             diaphragm, abstinence, etc.) for the entire duration of the study and 3 months after,
             except for patients who are post menopausal or have prior hysterectomy.

          7. All investigational treatments should have been discontinued for at least 3 weeks

          4. Active serious infections that are not controlled by antibiotics.

          5. ECOG performance status &gt;2 (except for treatment naïve subjects where ECOG performance
             status 0, 1 or 5 is excluded).

          6. Inadequate renal function: creatinine &gt; or equal to 2.0 unless related to the disease.
