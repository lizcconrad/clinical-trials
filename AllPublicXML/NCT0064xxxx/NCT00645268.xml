  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effect on erectile function in a population of type 2 diabetic men with
      erectile dysfunction who have undergone the following treatment regimen: pre-treatment with a
      daily dose of double-blind sildenafil versus placebo for 4 weeks (Phase I) followed by an
      as-needed, flexible-dose, open-label treatment phase with sildenafil for 12 weeks (Phase II).
      To assess safety and tolerability of this dosing regimen and to investigate its effects on
      endothelial function and subject's responses to the Self-Esteem And Relationship (SEAR)
      questionnaire.
