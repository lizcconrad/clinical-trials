  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern frontline therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies is based on intensive
      administration of multiple drugs. In patients with relapsed disease, response to the same
      drugs is generally poor, and dosages cannot be further increased without unacceptable
      toxicities. For most patients, particularly those who relapse while still receiving frontline
      therapy, the only therapeutic option is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). For
      those who relapse after transplant, or who are not eligible for transplant because of
      persistent disease, there is no proven curative therapy.

      There is mounting evidence that NK cells have powerful anti-leukemia activity. In patients
      undergoing allogeneic SCT, several studies have demonstrated NK-mediated anti-leukemic
      activity. NK cell infusions in patients with primary refractory or multiple-relapsed leukemia
      have been shown to be well tolerated and void of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects.
      Myeloid leukemias are particularly sensitive to NK cells cytotoxicity, while B-lineage acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are often NK-resistant. We have developed a novel method
      to expand NK cells and enhance their cytotoxicity. Expanded and activated donor NK cells have
      shown powerful anti-leukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and
      T-lineage ALL cells in vitro and in animal models of leukemia.

      The present study represents the translation of these laboratory findings into clinical
      application.We propose to determine the safety of infusing expanded NK cells in pediatric
      patients who have chemotherapy refractory or relapse hematologic malignancies including AML,
      T-lineage ALL, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),
      juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML),myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Ewing sarcoma family
      of tumors (ESFT) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). The NK cells used for this study will be
      obtained from the patient's family member who will be a partial match to the patient's immune
      type (HLA type).

      Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the in vivo lifespan and phenotype of the
      expanded NK cells and explore the efficacy of these donor NK cells in study participants with
      relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies or sarcomas.
