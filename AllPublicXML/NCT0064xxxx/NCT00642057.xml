  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the results of studies looking at tetrabenazine have shown its effectiveness in the
      management of hyperkinetic(too much) movement disorders, it has not been made available in
      the U.S. The drug must be obtained from Cambridge Laboratories, the distributor, using an
      individual IND (#16,161). The cost of the drug is passed on to the patient. The purpose of
      the protocol is to provide an efficacious drug, with few side effects, in an attempt to get
      rid of a variety of incapacitating dyskinesias (abnormal movements).
