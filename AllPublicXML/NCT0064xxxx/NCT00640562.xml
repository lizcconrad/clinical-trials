    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to assess if the new compound Seroquel XR™ is non-inferior to
      Risperidone, considered as the reference drug for the treatment of depressive symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

      PLEASE NOTE: Seroquel SR and Seroquel XR refer to the same formulation. The SR designation
      was changed to XR after consultation with FDA.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week from baseline to last visit</time_frame>
    <description>The CDSS scale is used to assess the level of depression in schizophrenia and to estimate the severity of depressive symptoms.
CDSS has 9 items rated on four-point scale: 0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe. Anchor point descriptions are provided to aid differentiation between each item score. The first eight items are rated on basis of patients' responses to questions; the 9 item is based on clinician's assessment.
The sum score is derived by adding the point score of all items (from 0 to 27 points); total score 4-5 is considered for minor depression and 6-7 score for major depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of HAM-D Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks from baseline to last visit</time_frame>
    <description>21-item scale for depression. Symptoms are rated finely (on a 5-point scale: absent; doubtful or trivial; mild: moderate severe) or coarsely (on a 3- point scale: absent; doubtful or mild; obvious, distinct, or severe).Total score range 0- 66, higher values represent worse outcome.Number of participants refers to valid for efficacy per protocol. Change:total score at week 12 minus total score at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of PANSS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks from baseline to last visit</time_frame>
    <description>30-item scale where each symptom is rated on a severity ranging from 1-7. Symptoms are categorized into 7 items referring to positive, 7 items referring to negative and 16 general psychotic. Total score range 30- 210, higher values represent worse outcome. Number of participants analyzed refers to valid for efficacy per protocol population.</description>

    <measure>- Change From Baseline to Week 12 of Clinical Global Impression (CGI- Severity of Illness) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks from baseline to last visit</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S subset ranges from 1 to 7 such that a score of 1 indicates &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot;, while a score of 7 indicates &quot;among the most extremely ill of patients&quot;. The change from start of treatment (baseline V2) in the Severity of Illness will be calculated by subtracting the score at start of treatment (baseline V2) from the following visits</description>

    <measure>CGI- Global Improvement Mean Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12week: descriptive statistic of CGI by visit and treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S subset ranges from 1 to 7 such that a score of 1 indicates &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot;, while a score of 7 indicates &quot;among the most extremely ill of patients&quot;. The change from start of treatment (baseline V2) in the Severity of Illness will be calculated by subtracting the score at start of treatment (baseline V2) from the following visits</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of Drug Attitude Inventory 10 Item Scale (DAI 10) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week from baseline to last visit</time_frame>
    <description>These items are presented as self-report statements with which the patient agrees or disagrees. Each response is scored as +1 if correct or -1 if incorrect. The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. A positive score means a positive subjective response. A negative total score means a negative subjective response</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) Total Score to Week 12 as an Indication of Neurological Side Effects Section</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks from baseline to last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Extrapyramidal Side Effects (EPS) will be assessed using the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS; Simpson GN et al 1970) . The CRF is source data for these assessments and day 0 is considered as baseline.
The SAS scale, containing 10 items, will be rated on a five-point scale where 0 is normal and 4 are severe symptoms. Min score =0, max score 40
Change from start of treatment (day 0) will be calculated as the visit score minus the score at start of treatment for each of the neurological assessments.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) Score.</title>
        <description>The CDSS scale is used to assess the level of depression in schizophrenia and to estimate the severity of depressive symptoms.
CDSS has 9 items rated on four–point scale: 0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe. Anchor point descriptions are provided to aid differentiation between each item score. The first eight items are rated on basis of patients’ responses to questions; the 9 item is based on clinician’s assessment.
The sum score is derived by adding the point score of all items (from 0 to 27 points); total score 4-5 is considered for minor depression and 6-7 score for major depression.</description>

The SAS scale, containing 10 items, will be rated on a five-point scale where 0 is normal and 4 are severe symptoms. Min score =0, max score 40
Change from start of treatment (day 0) will be calculated as the visit score minus the score at start of treatment for each of the neurological assessments.</description>
