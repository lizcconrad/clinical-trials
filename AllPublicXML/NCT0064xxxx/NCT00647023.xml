    <textblock>
      The incretin hormones are secreted from the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrient
      ingestion, and are responsible for 70 % of insulin secretion in response to glucose. The
      incretin response is attenuated in subjects with type 2 diabetes and other conditions
      associated with insulin resistance. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by
      irregular periods and increased androgen levels. It is the most common endocrine disorder
      amongst young women at fertile age, and the most common cause of female infertility. Insulin
      resistance plays an important role in the development of the disease, and women with PCOS are
      at increased risk of developing tyoe 2 diabetes. the incretin hormones have not previously
      been investigated in women with PCOS, and the purpose of the present study was to investigate
      the secretion of the two most important incretin hormones Glucose-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      Glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) during a three hour oral glucose tolerance
      test.
