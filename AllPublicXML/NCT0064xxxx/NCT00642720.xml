      Study Synopsis Study Title: Double blind, single centre, cross-over study on the effects of
      weekly subcutaneous administration of 40 mg pegvisomant or placebo on quality of life and
      insulin sensitivity in acromegalic patients with normal serum IGF-I concentrations during
      long-term treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogs

      Study Objectives:

        1. To determine whether the addition of weekly pegvisomant administrations improves quality
           of life

        2. To determine whether the addition of weekly pegvisomant administrations improves insulin
           sensitivity

      Study Population: Acromegalic patients, who have normalized their serum IGF-I levels down to
      the upper 25 centiles of normality during long-term treatment with monthly injections of a
      long-acting somatostatin analogue Number of Subjects: 20

      Procedures:

        -  Patients on treatment with Sandostatin LAR (SL) 20 - 30 mg per months i.m. or patients
           on treatment with Lanreotide autosolution (LA) 90 - 120 mg deep s.c. will be enrolled.

        -  For 4 months, all subjects will also receive weekly s.c. injections of either placebo or
           a fixed dose of 40 mg pegvisomant

        -  After a 4 weeks wash-out period, patients will switch from either placebo to pegvisomant
           or from pegvisomant to placebo

        -  Before, and after 2 and 4 months of each treatment period, serum efficacy parameters and
           quality of life (AcroQol ™/ PASQ™) will be assessed.

      Introduction Both lanreotide (Somatulin Autosolution ™ (SL)) and octreotide (Sandostatin LAR
      ™ (LAR)) are equally effective in controlling disease activity in acromegalic subjects with a
      normalization of serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels in roughly 65%. However,
      SL is injected as a deep intramuscular injection, while LA is injected as a deep subcutaneous
      injection. Physicians, involved in the treatment of acromegalic patients know that
      biochemical control of the disease in their patients not necessarily means that all those
      patients stop complaining. To address these issues, Sonino and co-workers studied with
      several symptom questionnaires the effects on quality of life (QoL) of SL. Together with a
      significant decrease in growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I, treatment with SL significantly
      improved psychological distress, well-being and social fears (1). In another study on the
      efficacy of the novel GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant to lower serum IGF-I concentrations
      a questionnaire evaluating five clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly showed dose
      dependent significant differences from placebo (2). Recently, Webb and co-workers reported
      the successful development of a disease-specific questionnaire suitable to measure
      health-related quality of life in acromegaly (ACROQOL) (3).

      No clear biochemical parameter appears to be available that correlates well with disease
      activity related quality of life (4). At the same time, serum GH concentrations and serum
      total IGF-I levels, but not QoL, are used as parameters to determine dosing of Sandostatin
      LAR, or any of the available medical therapies for acromegaly (5-8).

      The growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant as monotherapy once daily normalizes IGF-I
      in virtually all acromegalics (9;10), but pegvisomant monotherapy is also very costly.
      Recently, we reported the results of a 42-week dose-finding study on the efficacy of the
      combination of long-acting somatostatin analogues once monthly and pegvisomant once weekly in
      26 patients with active acromegaly. Pegvisomant dose was increased until IGF-I levels
      normalized or until a weekly dose of 80 mg was reached. IGF-I levels normalized in 25 (95 %)
      with a median weekly dose of 60 mg pegvisomant. There were no signs of pituitary tumor growth
      but mild elevations in liver enzymes were observed in 10 patients (38%) (11). One of the
      potential advantages of combining pegvisomant with somatostatin analogues is that pegvisomant
      monotherapy improves insulin sensitivity compared to somatostatin analogues (12;13), although
      it is unclear yet whether or not long-term pegvisomant administration would improve insulin
      sensitivity in normal subjects (13;14). Therefore, one might expect that pegvisomant
      monotherapy has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, compared to the combination of
      both pegvisomant and somatostatin analogues, as the latter ones decrease insulin sensitivity
      by several mechanisms (13;15).

      Conclusion:

        -  So-called biochemically well controlled acromegalic subjects with normal serum IGF-I
           concentrations frequently still have an impaired QoL.

        -  These subjects, when controlled by long-acting somatostatin analogs have impaired
           insulin sensitivity because of the pharmacological properties of these somatostatin
           analogs.

        -  We postulate that co-administration of the growth hormone receptor antagonist
           pegvisomant will improve QoL and insulin sensitivity

      Objectives:

        1. To determine whether the addition of weekly pegvisomant administrations improves quality
           of life

           sensitivity
