      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety (by collecting adverse events and
      serious adverse events) of adalimumab administered every other week to patients with
      moderately to severly active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed prior disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
