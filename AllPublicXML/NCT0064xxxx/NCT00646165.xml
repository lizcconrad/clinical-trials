    <textblock>
      An open label, multi centre, three arm, dose finding Phase 1 trial with Forodesine as a
      single drug treatment in patients with relapsed CLL to establish dose and duration of
      treatment resulting in the best achievable response with Forodesine as a single drug
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed Binet Stage B or C B-CLL as defined by the National Cancer
             Institute (NCI) sponsored working group who have received up to 2 previous lines of
             treatment, one of which was fludarabine based. The two previous treatments could have
             included combination therapies.

          -  Patients must be ≥18 years of age, have a life expectancy of &gt;6 months, and an Eastern
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. - Female patients
             must not be pregnant (as confirmed by negative pregnancy test for women of
             childbearing potential) and female and male patients must be willing to use effective
             contraception for the entire duration of treatment and 2 months thereafter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received more than 2 previous lines of treatment will be excluded
             from this study.

          -  Additional groups of patients who may not participate in the study include: patients
             who are pregnant and/or nursing; patients on corticosteroid treatment; patients with
             active infection (bacterial, viral or fungal) or severe infection (WHO 4th degree)
             within the last 3 months; patients with total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN; patients with
             calculated creatinine clearance &lt;70 mL/min; patients with seropositivity for human
             immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus; patients with any
             coexisting medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the
             required study procedures; patients who have participated in another clinical study &lt;6
             weeks prior to this study; or patients with a known hypersensitivity to the study
             medication.
