      The purpose of this study is to compare in home support services for patients with COPD with
      usual care. The study is designed to evaluate the impact of an interdisciplinary palliative
      care team on community based self management of advanced COPD.

      A total of thirty patients will be enrolled into this study. Twenty patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive usual care, and ten patients will be randomly assigned to usual care plus
      in home support services. This study will use objective criteria to identify patients with
      COPD likely to benefit from home based palliative care services. The patients will undergo
      initial assessment by medical, social work, and spiritual care personnel followed by a family
      meeting to establish a care plan. Periodic scheduled visits, and as needed unscheduled visits
      to address urgent needs will occur over one year's time in an attempt to return patients with
      COPD to the center of decision making regarding their care, avoid acute exacerbations and
      thereby avoid unscheduled clinic and ER visits. Patients will complete the QOL survey and
      symptom assessment scale upon initial intervention. After obtaining information from all
      patients who qualify for the study, participants will be randomized into cohorts. Those who
      are randomized to serve as cases will be provided with community based self management
      services by an interdisciplinary palliative care team. The control group will receive
      standard care. At the conclusion of 12 months both cases and controls will again complete the
      QOL survey,medical utilization, and symptom assessment.
