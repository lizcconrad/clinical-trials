      The purpose of the study is to examine the vitamin D state of elder patients in therapeutic
      departments and to compere the treatment during the hospitalization with the out-patient
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      Today vitamin D is thought to be one of the most important vitamins in the human body. It's
      made in the skin during the sun expose, so it must be sufficient in so sunny countries as
      Israel. Although many old people in our country suffer from vitamin d deficiency which bring
      them to recurrent falls, osteoporotic fractures and physical disability. This problem is
      still underestimated by health authorities in different countries.

      In this study we will examine the vitamin D state of the therapeutic patient older than 65
      year including their physical self-estimation, muscle strength measurement and
      gait-and-balance tests. Then, according to the resent studies, we will treat the patients in
      the interventional group with two large doses of vitamin D during a month. After that we will
      compere their health and physical state with the patients treated in the out-hospital
      department.

      So we will try to find a useful approach to treat the vitamin D deficiency during the
      hospitalization.
