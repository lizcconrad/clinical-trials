  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with small cell lung cancer have incurable extensive stage disease.
      The usual initial treatment for this condition is chemotherapy which produces responses in
      about 50-80% of patients. Despite this, the cancer usually returns. Once common body region
      where it re-grows is in the chest, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath,
      cough, difficulty swallowing, pain and bleeding. These symptoms can worsen a patient's
      quality of life and in some situation be life-threatening. In this study , we propose to give
      patients who have extensive stage small cell lung cancer which responds to chemotherapy
      radiotherapy treatments to the chest. By giving this type of radiation before the cancer has
      a chance to re-grow, we hope to control the disease within the chest and prevent future
      symptoms that it may cause if the cancer were to re-grow in the chest. Patients treated on
      the protocol will be checked regularly for disease control, quality of life and radiation
      side effects, if any.
