    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's paroxetine
      hydrochloride 40 mg tablets to GSK's Paxil® 40 mg tablets following a single, oral 40 mg (1 x
      40 mg) dose administered under fasting conditions to healthy adult volunteers.

                    1. postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or

                    2. bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of

             equal to 19 (see Part II, Administrative Aspects of Bioequivalence Protocols).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C tests, HIV

             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiate screen, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 21 days of the initial dose of study medication.

                  prior to the initial dose of study medication.

               2. Use of any hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy within 3 months
                  prior to study medication dosing.

               3. Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior
                  to the initial dose of study medication.

               4. Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pimozide, or thioridazine within 30
                  days prior to the initial dose of study medication.

          4. Diseases:

               1. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
                  hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or
                  neurologic disease.

               2. Acute illness at the time of either the pre-study medical evaluation or dosing.

               3. A positive HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C test.

          5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results:

               1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant
                  Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

               2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing.

          6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days
             prior to the initial dose of study medication.
