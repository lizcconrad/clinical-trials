  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of this project are to determine the anticaries benefits of a prototype
      multi-mineral mouthrinse containing 225 ppm fluoride and 30 ppm of a Ca through the
      remineralization of enamel white-spots (non-cavitated lesions). The selection of patients
      with pre-existing white-spot lesions will permit an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of
      the multi-mineral mouthrinse in reminerzalizing and/or inhibiting progression of enamel
      white-spot lesions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To participate in this study, panelists will be required to meet the following criteria:

          1. Subjects must be 13 - 65 years of age;

          2. Subjects must read and sign the Informed Consent prior to initiation of study
             procedures. All subjects will receive a copy of the signed Informed Consent;

          3. Subjects must have a reasonable functional dentition, without a large number of
             missing teeth, and teeth #'s 22-27 present;

          4. Have normal salivary gland function (unstimulated whole salivary flow rate equal to or
             greater than 0.25 ml/min and paraffin stimulated whole salivary flow rate equal to or
             at least 1.0 ml/min);

          5. Subjects must be willing to participate in the study, be able to follow the study
             directions, be willing to return for all specified visits at their appointed time, and
             to use the product as per instructions;

          6. Subjects must be in good general health based on medical history and oral soft and
             hard tissue examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Criteria that will not permit participation in this study will be as follows:

          1. Any subject who is pregnant or lactating - based on oral interview only - as pregnancy
             may interfere with the outcome of the study;

          2. Any subject who has a systemic health condition such as diabetes that could affect the
             outcome of the study at the discretion of the examiner;

          3. Any subject who has an oral condition, such as excessive, untreated dental caries,
             periodontal disease, chronic dental neglect, or any oral pathology including
             xerostomia determined by oral examination and subject history that in the opinion of
             the dental examiner could affect the outcome of the study;

          4. Any subject who has full dentures, or full orthodontic appliances. No use of
             nightguards will be permitted during the study period;

          5. Any subject who uses oral care products (other than those permitted) during the
             treatment or wash-out periods;

          6. Any subject with an immunological disorders such as HIV positive, AIDS, and systemic
             Lupus Erythematosis;

          7. Any subject concurrently participating in another clinical study;

          8. Any subject currently taking antibiotics or other medications, which in the opinion of
             the Investigator/Examiner might influence the study outcome;

          9. Any subject with a history of sensitivity to oral products or allergies to ingredients
             in the products;

         10. Any subject who fails to keep any of their scheduled appointments.
