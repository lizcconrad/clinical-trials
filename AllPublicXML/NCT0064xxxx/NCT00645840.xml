  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether control of inflammatory pathways mediated
      by IL-1 beta using the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra will yield measurable decreases in
      expression of genes that are otherwise overexpressed as a consequence of IL-1 beta effects in
      children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Ultimately, we believe that control of IL-1
      beta pathways will be associated with preserved insulin secretory capacity.
