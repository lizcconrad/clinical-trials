      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and activity of MNTX in relieving
      opioid-induced constipation following orthopedic procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- controlled phase 2 study to
      evaluate the safety and activity of subcutaneous (SC) MNTX versus SC placebo in subjects who
      have undergone orthopedic procedures and who are expected to require opioids for one week
      after randomization. Subjects will sign an informed consent form and be screened between Days
      4-10 after their orthopedic procedure. Those subjects who meet all eligibility requirements
      will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either a four-day
      treatment of once daily SC MNTX 12 mg or SC placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment with study
      medication will begin on the same day as screening, or no later than the following calendar
      day. All bowel movements and the time of bowel movement will be recorded. Treatment with
      study medication will be continued until either the subject no longer requires opioid
      medication for pain relief or a maximum of four days (four doses) of treatment is reached.
      Subjects will be given patient diaries at the start of the study. Study drug will be
      transferred from hospitals to rehabilitation facilities for subjects discharged to
      rehabilitation facilities.
