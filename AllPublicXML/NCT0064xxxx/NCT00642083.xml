    <description>The viabahn stent-graft is a combined ePTFE-Nitinol self-expanding stent-graft preloaded on a catheter-based delivery system. It was originally designed for improving blood flow in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease in superficial femoral artery lesions with reference vessel diameters ranging from 4.8 to 7.5 mm. This device is also increasingly used for the exclusion of popliteal aneurysms. Its flexibility might make the device ideal for the treatment of recurrent outflow stenosis in AV loop-fistula.</description>
