  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine whether frovatriptan was effective in
      the prevention of menstrually associated migraine (MAM) headaches when compared to placebo.
      Secondary objectives included determining the effectiveness of frovatriptan in reducing the
      incidence, severity and duration of MAM headaches and associated symptoms, to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of the two frovatriptan dosing regimens and to compare the
      effectiveness of these regimens in the prevention of MAM headaches. In this cross-over study,
      patients treated each of 3 perimenstrual periods (PMPs) with placebo, frovatriptan 2.5 mg
      daily (QD) and 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) for 6 days, starting 2 days before the anticipated
      onset of a MAM headache.

      A statistically significant reduction in the incidence of MAM headache (p&lt;0.0001) was
      observed with both dosing regimens of frovatriptan when compared to placebo. Additionally,
      the frovatriptan BID regimen was superior to the frovatriptan QD regimen in the prevention of
      MAM headache (p&lt;0.001). Significant reductions in MAM headache severity and duration, the
      incidence of associated symptoms and characteristics, and the use of rescue medication were
      observed when the PMP was treated with frovatriptan, compared to placebo. Both dose regimens
      of frovatriptan were equally well tolerated and no cardiovascular or other safety and
      tolerability concerns arose with repeated administration of frovatriptan over a 6 day period.
