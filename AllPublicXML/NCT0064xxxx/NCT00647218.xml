    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and
      radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells
      that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with radiation
      therapy works in treating patients undergoing surgery for stage II or stage III breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel and concurrent radiotherapy (as measured by
           pathologic response rates) in patients with stage II or III breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the toxicities of this treatment regimen.

        -  Correlate paclitaxel-induced tumor response with local recurrence-free survival, distant
           disease-free survival, and overall survival.

        -  Evaluate protein expression profiles by mass spectrometry in biopsy material and blood
           specimens collected before and after treatment with paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
           patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour twice weekly and undergo radiotherapy once
           daily, 5 days a week, for 6½ weeks.

        -  Surgery: At 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgical
           resection (e.g., modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary node
           dissection).

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients receive doxorubicin
           hydrochloride IV over 20 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Hormonal therapy: After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, patients with estrogen
           receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumor receive hormonal therapy at the
           discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection periodically to analyze changes in cell
      cycle by flow cytometry; antibody assays; kinase assays for cyclin B1/CDC2; genetic assays
      for p53, p21, and other molecular markers; and protein expression assays by mass
      spectrometry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
