      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety of an investigational
      implantable hemodynamic monitor (IHM). The IHM is implanted surgically under the skin in the
      upper chest area and records the force with which the heart pumps blood (heart pressures).
      This study will also determine how doctors use the information related to heart pressures in
      the management of heart failure.

             and IV

          -  Subject has been managed with standard medical therapy for heart failure (such as
             diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor
             blockers (ARB), and beta-blocker for at least 3 months prior to the baseline
             evaluation

          -  Subject must have at least one heart failure-related hospitalization or emergency
             department visit requiring intravenous treatment within 6 months prior to baseline
             evaluation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are likely to be transplanted within 6 months from randomization or will
             remain hospitalized until transplantation

          -  Subjects with severe COPD or restrictive airway disease (recommended FEV1 less than or
             equal to 1 liter or 50% predicted)

          -  Subjects who are on continuous positive inotropic therapy

          -  Subjects with known atrial or ventricular septal defects

          -  Subjects with mechanical right heart valves

          -  Subjects with a presently implanted non-compatible pacemaker or ICD

          -  Subjects with cardiac resynchronization therapy which has not achieved optimal
             programming for more than 3 months

          -  Subjects with a major cardiovascular event within 3 months prior to baseline
             evaluation

          -  Subjects with a severe non-cardiac condition limiting 6 month survival

          -  Subjects with a primary diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension

          -  Subjects with serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.5 mg/dL or on chronic renal
             dialysis

          -  Subjects enrolled in concurrent studies that may confound the results of this study

          -  Women who are pregnant or with child bearing potential and who are not on a reliable
