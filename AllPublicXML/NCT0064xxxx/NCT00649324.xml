      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's
      hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg tablets to Ivax's Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg tablets following a
      single, oral 50 mg (1 x 50 mg) dose administered under fasting conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18 years and older

          2. Sex: Male and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating female a. Women of childbearing potential
             must have a negative serum (β‑HCG) pregnancy test performed within 21 days prior to
             the start of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If dosing
             is scheduled on Sunday or Monday, serum may be collected for the HCG pregnancy test
             within 48 hours prior to dosing for each study period. An additional serum (β‑HCG)
             pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study. b. Women must practice
             abstinence or use an acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the
             study. No hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy are permitted in this
             study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following: 1) intrauterine device
             in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study and remaining in place
             during the study period, or 2) barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with
             a spermicidal agent, or 3) surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or
             hysterectomy) or postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of
             at least one year. c. Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of
             the following is reported and documented on the medical history: 1) postmenopausal
             with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or 2) bilateral oophorectomy with
             or without a hysterectomy and an absence of bleeding for at least 6 months, or 3)
             total hysterectomy d. During the course of the study, from study screen until study
             exit, all men and women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide containing
             barrier method of contraception in addition to their current contraceptive method.
             This requirement should be documented in the informed consent form.

          3. At least 60 kg (132 lbs.) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs.) for women and all subjects
             within 15% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of &quot;Desirable
             Weights of Adults&quot; Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1999 (See Part II
             ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV
             test, 12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 21 days of the initial dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used.

          2. Social Habits: a. Use of any tobacco products within one year prior to dosing. b.

             vitamins or herbal products within 7 days prior to the initial dose of the study
             medication. d. Any recent, significant change in dietary or exercise habits. e. A
             positive test for any drug included in the urine drug screen. f. History of drug

             contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy within 3 months prior to study
             medication dosing. c.Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity
             within 28 days prior to the initial dose of study medication.

          4. Diseases: a. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or neurologic
             disease. b. Acute illness at the time of either the pre-study medical evaluation or
             dosing. c. A positive HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C test.

          5. Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory test results: a. Clinically significant
             deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant Abnormalities (See Part II
             ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS). b. Abnormal and clinically
             relevant ECG tracing.

          6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days
             prior to the initial dose of study medication.

          7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial
             dose of study medication.

          8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to hydrochlorothiazide, any of the inactive ingredients,
             or other related products.

             administration.

         11. Sitting pulse rate less than 55 beats per minute after a five minute rest at screening
             OR prior to Period I Day 1 dosing.

         12. Average sitting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or average sitting diastolic
             blood pressure less than 60 mmHg following a five (5) minute rest at screening OR
             prior to Period I Day 1 dosing. Blood pressure measurements will be taken in
             triplicate with at least two (2) minutes elapsing in-between readings.
