  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the adhesive quality of a new formulation
      of the Mylan Estradiol Transdermal System with that of Climara® Transdermal System following
      a single system application in 80 healthy postmenopausal female volunteers. As a secondary
      objective, primary dermal irritation was assessed after removal of each transdermal system.

             PROTOCOLS).

          4. Absence of menses for one year for postmenopausal subjects, or at least 6 weeks for
             oophorectomized subjects. (For oophorectomized subjects, an operative report
             documenting bilateral oophorectomy and surgical pathology report documenting the
             absence of malignant disease.)

          5. Baseline FSH and 17-beta-estradiol serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status
             confirmed within 14 days of initiation of study medication. (FSH greater than or equal
             to 40 mIU/mL; 17-beta-estradiol less than or equal to 31 pg/mL)

          6. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a prestudy medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation and 12-lead ECG) performed within 14 days
             of the initial patch application.

          7. The physical examination shall include pelvic and breast exams.

             a. Pelvic findings should be consistent with hypoestrogenemia. b. A mammogram will be

               2. Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior
                  to the initial dose of study medication.

               3. Use of any systemic antibiotics, estrogens, or hormones within 28 days prior to
                  the initial dose of study medication.

               1. History of any significant chronic disease such as (but not limited to):

        1. Thrombotic disorders. 2. Coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. 3. Liver, kidney or
