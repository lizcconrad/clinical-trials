      Research Question: Are anastomotic leak and surgical site infection rates equivalent in
      patients having laparoscopic bowel resections without bowel preparation vs those having bowel
      preparation?

      Bowel preparation is a distressing and uncomfortable procedure for patients undergoing
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery, and also carries some risk of morbidity due to dehydration,
      electrolyte inbalance and possible infectious complications. If it is found that there is no
      difference between those patients who have preoperative bowel preps and those who do not have
      them, then we can save these patients this additional distress and risk at the time of their
      surgery.

      Rationale: The question of whether a bowel prep is needed for colon resection in open surgery
      has been answered. However, in laparoscopic colorectal resections, it has not been
      prospectively investigated. Usually, reasons for still using a bowel prep in laparoscopic
      colon resections is that small instruments grasping the colon can tear it, and without a
      prep, stool spillage can result. As well, it may be difficult to manipulate a colon filled
      with stool, and difficult to identify lesions to be resected.

      There are no previous randomized trials in the laparoscopic literature comparing laparoscopic
      colorectal resections with and without bowel preparations. There are a number of trials for
      open resections and one trial including both laparoscopic and open resections. Unfortunately
      this trial does not separate the data analysis for these two groups.

      Primary and Secondary Outcomes: The question to be identified is whether anastomotic leaks,
      and surgical site infection rates are equivalent in patients having laparoscopic resections
      without bowel prep versus prepped patients.

      Methodology: Once consent is obtained, the patients will be randomized into two groups-the
      study group who will eat a low residue diet prior to surgery and who will not undergo bowel
      preparation, or the control group who will complete the standard bowel preparation protocol.
      Both groups will have the scheduled surgery. All patients will be monitored for signs of
      anastomotic leak and surgical wound infection daily while in hospital and at routine follow
      up visits at 2 and 6 weeks postoperative. If these two complications are observed, standard
      treatment will be followed.
