    <textblock>
      A comparison of the safety, efficacy and budesonide pharmacokinetics of the currently
      approved Pulmicort Turbuhaler with a new version of the inhaler, in children and adolescents
      who have asthma. In addition the study evaluated the functionality of the new inhaler at the
      end of its intended life.
