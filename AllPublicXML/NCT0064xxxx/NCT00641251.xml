  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is the first stage of a research program whose ultimate goal is to conduct
      a randomized clinical trial involving type 2 diabetics with BMI from 30.0 to 39.9 kg/m2. This
      program will determine the relative effectiveness of RYGB combined with intensive medical
      management (IMM), versus IMM alone, in reducing CVD event rates and mortality in patients
      with poorly controlled diabetes. IMM will include rigorous lifestyle modification for weight
      loss and stepped pharmacologic treatment for diabetes and other CVD risk factors. The
      proposed study is a randomized trial which will provide an assessment of the efficacy of
      treatment, in reducing CVD risk factors and also assessing the feasibility, cost, and safety
      of a larger trial.
