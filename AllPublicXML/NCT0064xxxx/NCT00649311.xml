      This Phase 2 study EPLA-0501-072 (A6141012) was conducted beginning 02 April 2003 and was
      prematurely terminated due to poor enrollment on 12 September 2003. There were no statistical
      analyses of efficacy conducted because the numbers of patients enrolled were insufficient for
      inferential analysis due to the poor enrollment. There were no serious adverse events or
      deaths reported during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of mild to moderate hypertension, or newly diagnosed hypertension, defined as
             seDBP ≥90 mmHg and &lt;110 mmHg and seSBP &lt;180 mmHg

          -  Withdrawal of all previous antihypertensives prior to the single-blind placebo run-in
             period and the double-blind treatment period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary hypertension (e.g., renal, renovascular, or adrenocortical disease,
             pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, primary aldosteronism, iatrogenic), severe
             hypertension, or malignant hypertension

          -  The patient cannot withdraw from antihypertensives by any route including diuretics,
             alpha-blockers, betablockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE-I, ARB, or other
             medications affecting blood pressure; patients who have stable angina and have not had
             their nitrate dosage changed within the past three months (i.e., on a stable
             maintenance dose) are eligible for this study; sildenafil citrate, theophylline, or
             papaverine must not be taken within 24 hours prior to a clinic visit
