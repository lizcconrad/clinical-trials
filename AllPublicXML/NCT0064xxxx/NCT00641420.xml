    <textblock>
      Fractionated laser resurfacing is commonly used as a treatment for acne scarring in fair
      skinned individuals. This study aims to test the efficacy and safety in darker skin types.
      Patients are randomized to either the 10mJ 40mJ dosages and receive a total of five
      treatments at 17% one month apart. Improvement is judged by a dermatologist as 0-25%, 25-50%,
      50-75% or 75-100%. Side effects such as pigmentary abnormalities and pain are also evaluated.
