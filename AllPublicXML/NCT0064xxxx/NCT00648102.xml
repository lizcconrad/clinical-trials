      This research study is for individuals who have advanced breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian
      or bladder cancer. Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. is testing a form of immune therapy (vaccine)
      to see if it can be used to make the immune system attack the cancer. The study includes
      administration of additional treatments, in combination, thought to enhance the immune
      response effect. This study specifically administers the vaccine systemically to explore
      whether dendritic cell targeted vaccines can generate more robust effects via intravenous
      injection. (CDX 1307-02)

      Protocol CDX1307-02: CDX-1307 is an investigational drug that is being tested to see if it
      can stimulate the immune system (the cells and substances that protect the body from
      infection and foreign matter) of people with certain kinds of cancer. It is believed that the
      body's immune system can attack tumor cells and kill them. It is thought that immune cells
      recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to fight the cancer. One of
      these proteins is called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-β) and is found on several
      types of cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and ovarian. The study
      drug, CDX-1307, is given as an intravenous infusion (administered in a vein in the arm or
      through a port-a-catheter). In addition, the study includes combination therapies which are
      thought to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells. In addition, the study includes
      combination therapies which are thought to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients must have incurable, metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast,
             colorectal, pancreatic, bladder or ovarian cancer with measurable or evaluable-only
             disease. Locally advanced breast cancer is defined as inflammatory breast cancer with
             biopsy-proven skin involvement, or chest wall recurrence. Locally advanced disease of
             other histologies is defined according to the standard definition for that disease.
             Evaluable-only disease includes bone only or unresectable skin/chest wall only
             metastases, but does not include malignant effusion(s) only. Cancer with elevated
             serum tumor marker(s) (e.g. CA27.29, carcinoembryonic antigen, etc.) only does not
             constitute evaluable disease.

          2. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          3. Both genders may be enrolled.

          4. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed between prior therapy and initiation of treatment
             with CDX-1307. Prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment. No prior radiopharmaceuticals within 8 weeks prior to enrollment. The
             patient must have recovered from any clinically significant toxicity experienced
             during prior treatment(s).

          5. Patients on the following medications may be enrolled into the study if the
             medications were initiated ≥ 8 weeks prior to Screening and if no dosing changes are
             anticipated during the study:

               1. Hormonal therapy including gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRh) agonist,
                  antiandrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase
                  inhibitors, and progestins.

               2. Bisphosphonates.

          6. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          7. Breast cancer patients must have received and progressed through at least one line of
             chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for metastatic or unresectable locally advanced
             breast cancer. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer must have received and
             progressed through at least one line of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, or endocrine
             therapy plus trastuzumab, for metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast
             cancer. For incurable colorectal, pancreatic, bladder, or ovarian cancer, where
             therapy with potential survival benefit is available or where disease-specific
             palliation is the goal of therapy, patients must have received these appropriate
             standard of care therapies and experienced recurrence or progression while on that
             care. If no such therapy is available, patients with progressive disease may be
             enrolled. Chemotherapy or radiation must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of vaccination with CDX-1307.

          8. Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks.

          9. Male patients who are sexually active must agree to practice an effective form of
             barrier contraception during the course of the study.

         10. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria:

               -  Neutrophils ≥1.5 x109/L

               -  Platelets &gt;100 x109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL

               -  Creatinine &lt;2 mg/dL

               -  AST ≤2 X ULN

               -  Bilirubin ≤2 X ULN unless due to Gilbert's syndrome.

                  * Laboratory abnormalities attributed to liver involvement with cancer but
                  outside of the normal range will be allowed if they do not exceed the following
                  limits:

               -  AST ≤4 X ULN

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Since treatment with CDX-1307 theoretically may cause permanent sterility, women of
             childbearing potential will be excluded. Women who participate in this study must be
             post-menopausal [absence of menses for at least 2 years or age &gt;55] and/or surgically
             incapable of bearing children.

          2. Previous administration of hCG-β vaccine or therapy.

          3. Concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents.

          4. Positive tests for HIV, HBV or HCV.

          5. Patients with systemic infection within 72 hours of registration that require
             antibiotics or produce a fever &gt; 101oF.

          6. Patients with active central nervous system metastases, unless previously treated and
             asymptomatic and not progressive in size or number for 2 months (1 month in the case
             of stereotactic radiation).

          7. History of a second malignancy, except for adequately treated and cured basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ; or any other cancer from which
             the patient has been disease-free for ≥ 5 years.

          8. History of anaphylactic reaction following exposure to humanized or human therapeutic
             monoclonal antibodies, or known hypersensitivity to GM-CSF or yeast derived products.

          9. Patients with any of the following conditions: myocardial infarction within 1 year of
             Screening, congestive heart failure (unless LVEF ≥ 50% as determined by MUGA within 30
             days of Screening), uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 160 mm Hg/systolic and ≥ 100 mm
             Hg/diastolic), symptomatic or life-threatening arrhythmia persistent on medication at
             Screening, or clinically evident chronic lung disease unless lung capacity ≥ 55% or
             FEV1 ≥ 60% at Screening. Note that the performance of MUGA scans and Pulmonary
             Function Tests are not required except if clinically indicated.

         10. Any underlying medical condition that in the Principal Investigator's opinion will
             make the administration of study drug hazardous to the patient or would obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events.

         11. Medical condition requiring the use of corticosteroids (must be discontinued at least
             4 weeks prior to enrollment).
