    <textblock>
      In this study, depressed veterans with hepatitis C will be randomly assigned to the control
      group or to the exercise intervention group. The exercise intervention is designed to begin
      slowly for most participants and to progress within each participant's target heart rate
      range for moderate intensity exercise. The exercise intervention is a 12 week home based
      walking program. Ideally individuals will walk for 30 minutes, at a moderate intensity, a
      minimum of three times per week. However, the duration and relative intensity will be
      tailored for each individual.

      Central Hypothesis Veterans who receive the exercise intervention will be significantly less
      symptomatic for depression than veterans in the control group.
