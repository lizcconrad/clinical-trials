    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to identify and understand the environmental
      characteristics associated with tobacco use and tobacco initiation among Asian American youth
      from primarily two communities: Chinese and Vietnamese. The specific aims of this study are
      twofold:

        -  To estimate the prevalence of smoking among Chinese and Vietnamese youth in the Houston
           area compared with non-Asian American communities.

        -  To study the relationship between environmental characteristics (both pro- and
           anti-tobacco) and tobacco initiation and use among Chinese and Vietnamese youth.

        -  To explore if degree of acculturation is related to tobacco initiation and use among
           Chinese and Vietnamese youth.

      This is a survey about health-related behaviors, risks, attitudes and acculturation. It
      includes questions about use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; safety and violence; diet
      and physical activity; and youth programs and resources in your community. Your answers are
      completely anonymous, and your name will not appear anywhere on this survey or as part of
      this survey. Your parents will not see your responses.
