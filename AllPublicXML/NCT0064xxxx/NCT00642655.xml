    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of IVIG in combination with
      Rituximab to lower the level of HLA-sensitive antibodies and block their ability to attack a
      transplanted organ in patients who are highly HLA-sensitized and are awaiting
      transplantation.

      Patients eligible for the study will be those who have anti-HLA antibody (Panel Reactive
      Antibody {PRA}) of &gt;30%. If patients meet these criteria, patients will be asked to have an
      assessment of the ability of IVIG to reduce the anti-HLA antibodies activity in the test
      tube. Patients will receive IVIG 2gm/kg x1 on hemodialysis. Seven days later, patients will
      receive Rituximab 1gm in the CSMC Infusion Center as per protocol for Rituximab infusion. The
      second Rituximab infusion will be on day #22. Additional IVIG infusion will be given at month
      one.

      Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 12 months after the last IVIG
      infusion and will be asked to return for follow up visits at month 1 through 5, month 7 and
      12.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for the study will be those who have anti-HLA antibody (Panel
             Reactive Antibody [PRA]) of &gt;30% and are eligible for transplantation at Cedars-Sinai
             Medical Center. We currently anticipate entering 20 patients over the course of the
             study. We currently have ~100 patients on our wait list that would meet the above
             criteria. Patients will be selected based on the ability of IVIG to inhibit the
             cytotoxic anti-HLA antibody activity in vitro. They will then receive IVIG 2gm/kg X1
             on day 1 while on hemodialysis. Seven days later, the patients will receive Rituxan®
             1gm in the CSMC Cancer Infusion Center as per protocol for Rituxan® infusion. The
             second Rituxan® infusion will be on day#22. The patients will have monitoring of
             anti-HLA antibody and outlined tests as shown above.

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol

          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by normal liver function tests (NL: AST, ALT,
             Bilirubin and negative tests for hepatitis C and hepatitis B.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (for women of child bearing age)

          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of
             birth control during treatment and for twelve months (1 year) after completion of
             treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening or 5 half-lives
             of the investigational drug (whichever is longer)

                  interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
                  complications

               -  Inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures
