      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. This may be effective treatment for
      leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the best dose of yttrium Y 90-labeled monoclonal
      antibody BU-12 in treating patients with advanced relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the biodistribution of indium-111 BU-12 in patients with refractory CD19+
           leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD19 antibody BU-12

        -  Determine the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response.

        -  To define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD19 antibody
           BU-12.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 anti-CD19 antibody BU-12/indium-111 BU-12 IV over 60
      minutes on day 0 and undergo whole-body imaging on days 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7. Patients also
      undergo blood collection and bone marrow biopsy periodically for dosimetry calculations and
      pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

    <description>Patients in whom the biodistribution is as expected (unaltered) AND a HAMA response does not develop will receive a single dose of 90Y-BU-12 in a dose escalated manner to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-BU-12 over 60 minutes on Day 0. A single course of BU-12 includes the imaging dose of 111In-BU-12 followed 7-8 days later by the therapy dose of 90YBU- 12.</description>
