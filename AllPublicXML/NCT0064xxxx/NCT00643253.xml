  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of routine, pre-natal care practice-site based
      pre- and post-natal breastfeeding promotion interventions in low-income minority women, with
      stratification for maternal country of origin. Our primary outcome measure is breastfeeding
      duration and extent, i.e. &quot;intensity.&quot; Our secondary outcomes measures are: a) infant weight,
      and b) participant/ provider experiences of the intervention.

      The Provider Approaches to Improved Rates of Infant Nutrition &amp; Growth Study (PAIRINGS) trial
      randomizes women to a Prenatal Care Provider (PNC) + Lactation Consultant (LC) intervention,
      or Control group. The PNCs will use a brief, computer prompted protocol throughout pregnancy
      and at follow-up of maternal-infant dyads. The LC will meet women, one-on-one while pregnant,
      at daily hospital rounds, during well-infant care and (as needed) home visits. Post-partum
      interviews at 1,3 and 6 months will collect infant feeding data.

      Primary Outcomes (Hypotheses): Breastfeeding

        1. Breastfeeding Intensity at 1,3, and 6 Months- There will be significant differences, by
           treatment group, in BF intensity. Intensity will be assessed via 7 day recall of the
           frequency of breastmilk feedings vs. other liquids and solids.

        2. Exclusive Breastfeeding at 1,3, and 6 Months- There will be significant differences, by
           treatment group, in the rate of exclusive BF.

           Secondary Outcomes (Hypotheses): Infant Growth

        3. Weight-for-Length, by Breastfeeding Intensity: There will be a significant association
           between BF intensity and weight-for-length z scores at 4,6,9, and 12 month well-child
           visits.

        4. Weight Gain, by Breastfeeding Intensity: There will be a significant association between
           BF intensity and weight gain from the 4th -12th month of age.

        5. Weight-for-Length, by Treatment Group: There will be a significant association between
           treatment group and weight-for-length z scores at 4,6,9, and 12 month well-child visits

        6. Weight Gain, by Treatment Group: There will be a significant association between
           treatment group and weight gain from the 4th - 12th month of age.

    <description>Women will receive: a) International Board of Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) education/counseling during the pre-natal, intra-partum and post-hospital discharge period to promote early and continued exclusive breastfeeding. The protocol specifies 2 prenatal meetings, a hospital visit, and a home visit if indicated and accepted, and; b) Electronic Medical Record Prompts- will appear on the prenatal record 5 times throughout the pregnancy. They are brief discussion points re breastfeeding that the provider is asked to raise with their patients.</description>
