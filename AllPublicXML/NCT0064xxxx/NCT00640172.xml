      Eligible elderly men and women with anemia will undergo a full hematologic evaluation plus
      additional laboratory tests to determine the etiology of the anemia. In a subset of subjects,
      bone marrow aspirate and biopsies will be obtained for a planned analysis of erythroid
      progenitor and stem cells. Plasma; serum; and bone marrow samples will be will be compared to
      elderly non-anemic controls. Bone marrow samples will also be compared to non-anemic young
      controls (purchased).

      Eligible elderly men and women with anemia will undergo a full hematologic evaluation (blood
      sample for complete blood count, CBC) to determine the etiology of the anemia (eg,
      myelodysplastic syndrome). Peripheral smears; iron studies; serum creatinine; serum
      erythropoietin; reticulocyte count; vitamin B12; and folate levels may be obtained/conducted.
      When no etiology is identified (ie, &quot;unexplained anemia&quot;), additional laboratory tests will
      be performed which will include some or all of urinary hepcidin levels; plasma cytokine
      levels; serum soluble transferrin receptor; C-reactive protein; erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate; D-Dimer; neopterin level; tryptophan level; and blood for a cytokine profile that may
      include IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and VEGF levels. Serum; plasma; and nucleated peripheral blood
      cells may be banked for future DNA and other analyses. In a subset of those found to have
      either unexplained anemia (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) or anemia of chronic inflammation
      (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) , bone marrow aspirate and biopsies may be performed for a
      planned analysis of erythroid progenitor and stem cells in these populations. In addition,
      plasma and serum and bone marrow samples will be obtained from elderly non-anemic controls
      (approximately 6 to 30 subjects), and bone marrow samples will be purchased for non-anemic
      young controls (approximately 6 to 30 subjects) .
