  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of a dose escalation, to establish the safety of ofatumumab in RRMS
      patients. A 48-week treatment period followed by an individualized follow-up period until
      normalization of peripheral B-cell counts or Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of two phases, a 48 week treatment period, followed by an individualized
      treatment period of up to two years.

      Patients are treated in cohorts of increasing doses (100 mg, 300 mg and 700 mg) with 12
      patients in each dose cohort. Within each cohort patients are randomized asymmetrically in a
      2:1 ratio such that eight patients will receive ofatumumab and four patients will receive
      placebo. After 24 weeks the patients randomized to placebo will be treated with the active
      dose for the cohort. For blinding purposes, patients randomized to the active dose will be
      treated with placebo after 24 weeks. Thus, each patient will receive two administrations of
      trial product with 24 weeks follow-up resulting in a total treatment period of 48 weeks
      duration. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review and evaluate the safety
      data of each cohort, a minimum of 4 weeks data including the week 4 Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) from at least 10 patients, to consider if progression to the next higher dose
      cohort is acceptable.

      The trial product is administered as two infusions separated by two weeks. Clinical
      assessment and Gadolinium enhanced (Gd-enhanced) MRI scan will be performed at weeks -4, 0,
      2, 4, and every 4 weeks until week 48. The MRI scan at week 2 is carried out for safety
      assessment prior to administering the second infusion in the first treatment course. When
      patients in all dose cohorts have been dosed and have had week 4 MRI scans performed, an IDMC
      will review all available safety data.

      After completion of week 48 patients will be followed to monitor B-cell and IgG
      normalization. B-cell levels will be monitored every 12 weeks until CD19+ cells have returned
      to baseline level (Visit 3) or normalized level. If the B-cell levels are not normalized
      after two years the patient should be followed until either the IgG or the B-cell levels are
      normalized (see Section 9.2.4 for details). During this period Gd-enhanced MRI follow up
      scans will be performed every 12 weeks to evaluate potential rebound, safety and for
      Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) monitoring.

        <description>The investigator performed the physical examination, which included but was not limited to: general appearance and the following body systems: lymph nodes, mouth and throat, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, extremities, muscular-skeletal, neurological (apart from multiple sclerosis [a brain and spinal cord disease]), and skin. All abnormal clinically relevant findings such as vein problems (venous varices), disorder of the vertebral column (vertebropathy), increased hearing loss, post operative mark (scar), and chronic skin disorder with no sweat and itching (anhidrotic eczema) were reported.</description>

            <description>Ofa was administered as two doses of 100 mg via intravenous (iv) infusions separated by 2 weeks (wks) during the first 24-wk treatment period. Matching placebo was administered as two iv infusions separated by 2 wks during the second 24-wk treatment period. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) evaluated the safety data at Week 4 for participants receiving the 100 mg dose before considering progression to the 300 mg dose. After completing Week 48 of the second treatment period or withdrawing from the study for any reason, participants entered an Individualized Follow-up Period (IFUP) in which they were monitored for B cell and IgG normalization until individual study termination.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Week 0 for the FTP, Week 24 for the STP, and Week 0 for the IFUP) in Basophils, Eosinophils, Leukocytes, Monocytes, Lymphocytes, Neutrophils, and Platelet Count at Week 24 (FTP), Week 48 (STP), and Week 104 (IFUP)</title>
        <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for hematology assessment. Change from Baseline (Week 0 for the FTP, Week 24 for the STP, and Week 0 for the IFUP) in basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets count was calculated as the value at Visit 10 (Week 24) for the FTP, the value at Visit 17 (Week 48) for the STP, and the value at Week 104 for the IFUP minus the value at Baseline.</description>

            <title>100 Milligrams (mg) Ofatumumab (Ofa)/Matching Placebo</title>
            <description>Ofa was administered as two doses of 100 mg via intravenous (iv) infusions separated by 2 weeks (wks) during the first 24-wk treatment period. Matching placebo was administered as two iv infusions separated by 2 wks during the second 24-wk treatment period. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) evaluated the safety data at Week 4 for participants receiving the 100 mg dose before considering progression to the 300 mg dose. After completing Week 48 of the second treatment period or withdrawing from the study for any reason, participants entered an Individualized Follow-up Period (IFUP) in which they were monitored for B cell and IgG normalization until individual study termination.</description>

        <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for hematocrit assessment. Hematocrit is the percentage of blood volume (BV) that is occupied by red blood cells (RBCs). Change from Baseline (Week 0 for the FTP, Week 24 for the STP, and Week 0 for the IFUP) in hematocrit was calculated as the value at Visit 10 (Week 24) for the FTP, the value at Visit 17 (Week 48) for the STP, and the value at Visit 26 (Week 104) for the IFUP minus the value at Baseline. Hematocrit is measured as a percentage, i.e., volume (V) of red blood cells per volume of blood.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Week 0 for the FTP and Week 24 for the STP) in Complement Activation (CH50) at Week 24 (FTP) and Week 48 (STP)</title>
        <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for CH50 prior to and 2 hours after dosing, and the samples were sent to a Central Laboratory for analysis: Bio Analytical Research Corporation (BARC). Change from Baseline (Week 0 for the FTP; Week 24 for the STP) was calculated as the value at Weeks 24 (FTP) and 48 (STP) minus the value at Baseline. Ofa depletes (induces the cell death of) B cells. When Ofa binds to a B cell, it induces complement CH50, which in turn causes cell death via cytotoxicity. Therefore, the CH50 levels were measured to ensure that CH50 was being appropriately activated.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-serious AEs are reported for both the first period (FP; Weeks 0-24) and the second period (SP; Weeks 24-48). SAEs were collected during the IFUP (collected/reported up to Week 104); however, non-serious AEs were not.</time_frame>
      <desc>The duration of B-cell depletion observed following ofatumumab administration makes attribution of an SAE/AE in the SP to placebo versus ofatumumab difficult. Because it may not be appropriate to ascribe events reported in the SP to placebo, SAEs/AEs are reported by treatment sequence rather than by each individual treatment received.</desc>

          <description>Ofa was administered as two doses of 100 mg via intravenous (iv) infusions separated by 2 weeks (wks) during the first 24-wk treatment period. Matching placebo was administered as two iv infusions separated by 2 wks during the second 24-wk treatment period. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) evaluated the safety data at Week 4 for participants receiving the 100 mg dose before considering progression to the 300 mg dose. After completing Week 48 of the second treatment period or withdrawing from the study for any reason, participants entered an Individualized Follow-up Period (IFUP) in which they were monitored for B cell and IgG normalization until individual study termination.</description>
