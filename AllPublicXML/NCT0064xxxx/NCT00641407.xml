  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maintenance of nearly normal glycemic levels reduces the risk of diabetic complications,
      but is difficult to achieve, despite the administration of escalating doses of oral
      antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Most patients
      eventually require insulin which usually is added when glycemic control with a regimen of
      oral antidiabetic agents becomes suboptimal.

      The aims of the present study were: 1) To compare the clinical efficacy of insulin glargine
      and neutral protamine lispro (NPL) insulin when added to ongoing oral therapy in poorly
      controlled type 2 diabetic patients; 2) to find out the possibility to phenotype the patient
      who may benefit more by the single treatment.

      This an open-label, randomized, parallel, 36-week comparative study was performed between
      January 2007 and March 2008 at a single centre.

      Patients were randomized to either NPL (Lilly) or glargine (Lantus, Aventis) to be
      administered subcutaneously at bedtime. Both insulin formulations consisted of cartridge
      containing 3 ML of either insulin preparation. Oral antihyperglycemic agents were continued
      at the prestudy dosages. No dietary advice was given beyond reinforcement of standard
      guidelines. The initial bedtime insulin dose was 10 IU for all patients with the goal to
      achieve a target FPG of &lt; 100 mg/dL in both groups. The insulin dose was titrated weekly
      according to daily self-monitored fasting blood glucose measurements that provide values
      corresponding closely to laboratory measurements of plasma glucose. The patients were taught
      to increase their insulin dose by 2 IU if FPG was greater than 100 mg/dL, and by 4 IU if FPG
      was greater than 180 mg/dL on three consecutive mornings. Before the start of insulin
      therapy, and at weeks 12, 24 and 36, blood was withdrawn for measurements of full blood
      counts, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes and lipids. Insulin doses, self-monitored
      plasma glucose (SMPG), and any events associated with signs or symptoms of hypoglycaemia were
      recorded in diaries.
