  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney failure on dialysis can be successfully transplanted. However, many of
      them do not attain a normal kidney function and/or present a slow deterioration of kidney
      function after transplantation. As a consequence, they can develop an endocrine disorder
      called hyperparathyroidism, which can cause bone disease and a high risk of bone fractures.
      In spite of the known bone disease and hyperparathyroidism, there is no well defined
      treatment for these patients.

      Moreover, kidney transplant recipients present a higher mortality rate compared to the
      general population, and the principal cause of death is cardiovascular disease. Dialysis
      patients are known to have extensive cardiovascular calcifications and increased vascular
      stiffness, and these factors have been closely associated with cardiovascular mortality.

      The effect of vitamin D on bone health is well known in the general population. Many studies
      showed a reduction in fracture rate in post-menopausal women and older men receiving vitamin
      D and calcium supplements. Vitamin D analogues are also commonly used to treat
      hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. Finally, vitamin D has been suggested to have
      beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and to reduce mortality in dialysis patients.

      Hectorol® is a vitamin D analog which has been demonstrated to effectively treat
      hyperparathyroidism in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients.

      The effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone disease, hyperparathyroidism and
      cardiovascular function in kidney transplant recipients have not been properly studied.

      Whether Hectorol® therapy helps reducing the severity of bone disease and improving vascular
      function in kidney transplant recipients is still unknown.

      The investigators plan to study the cardiovascular and bone effects of Hectorol® in 100
      kidney transplant recipients. The kidney transplant patients will be screened for kidney
      transplant dysfunction and hyperparathyroidism. The study medication will be given to 50
      patients. The other 50 patients will continue to be treated with the actual standard of care
      at the transplant clinic. Subjects will be followed for 18 months and their laboratory
      values, bone density, vascular calcification and stiffness will be collected to see if there
      is an effect of Hectorol® compared to the actual standard of care.
