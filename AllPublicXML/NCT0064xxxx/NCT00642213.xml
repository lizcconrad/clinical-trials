  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary goal is to study temporal trends in the incidence rate, causes, treatment, and
      outcome of stroke among a large biracial metropolitan population of 1,349,351, of whom
      215,611 (15%) are black (2000 Census). Such data are critical for the planning, intervention,
      and evaluation of public health efforts to decrease the mortality and morbidity due to stroke
      in the United States.

      We have completed this goal for 1993-94, 1999, 2005, and 2010. We ware in the process of
      collecting this data for 2015. In the 2015 study period we will also be ascertaining 3 year
      recurrence rates for all incident stroke events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For calendar years 1993-94, 1999, 2005, 2010, and 2015 we will identify every hospitalized or
      autopsied stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) at all regional hospitals in our region.
      We will also estimate the number of non-hospitalized strokes and TIAs by screening for
      potential cases at more than 100 outpatient sites throughout five counties in Greater
      Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky. We plan to identify and abstract detailed information from the
      medical record for every potential case. These results will be compared with data from all
      stroke patients identified by similar methodology in all study periods.

      In addition, we have interviewed 1500 ischemic stroke patients and/or their families in the
      study periods 1999-2010 to obtain detailed information including demographic information,
      functional outcome and quality of life, access to and type of rehabilitation therapy, social
      support, caregiver availability and health status, access to post-hospital care, health
      insurance status, current health status, medications, prior risk factors, and knowledge about
      stroke signs and symptoms. We also obtained genetic material via a blood sample for most of
      this cohort.
