      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) in patients undergoing
           axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer therapy.

        -  To determine the incidence of breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes draining in the
           arm as identified by axillary reverse mapping.

        -  To determine the safety of axillary reverse mapping.

      Lymphazurin is a blue dye used usually in breast cancer surgery to trace the drainage pathway
      that flows to lymph nodes. The dye will travel to the lymph system and will end up in the
      lymph nodes that are draining the arm.

      In this study, lymphazurin will be used to find the drainage routes from your arm, rather
      than your breast.

      AXILLARY REVERSE MAPPING:

      Before axillary lymph node surgery, your surgeon will inject lymphazurin into your arm. Your
      surgeon will watch how the dye flows and find the channels and nodes draining the arm. You
      will then have standard axillary lymph node (lymph nodes found under the arm) surgery. Any
      lymph nodes found that are dyed blue (lymph nodes that have traveled down the drainage
      pathways) that would normally be removed will be removed and sent to the pathology
      department. Pathologists will check the nodes to see if they have breast cancer cells in
      them. Also as part of routine care, all other axillary lymph nodes draining the breast will
      be removed and checked for breast cancer cells.

      This is an investigational study. Lymphazurin is FDA approved and commercially available. The
      use of lymphazurin with axillary reverse mapping is investigational.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

    <description>Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) performed using 2 - 5cc of isosulfan blue, injected into the inner arm prior to skin incision for the axillary lymph node dissection. Blue channels identified during surgery and locations compared to axillary vein. Any blue nodes within the standard axillary lymph node dissection field removed then sent to pathology as a separate specimen labeled &quot;axillary reverse mapping nodes&quot; and evaluated with serial sectioning, and hematoxylin-eosin stain (H&amp;E) as well as immunohistochemistry.</description>
