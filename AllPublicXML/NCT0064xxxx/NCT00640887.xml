  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the project is to evaluate rifabutin (RBT) as a replacement for rifampicin
      (RMP), for the combined treatment of tuberculosis and HIV infection. RBT represents an
      alternative to RMP for HIV infected patients as its half-life is longer and the enzymatic
      induction effect appears to be less important on the associated antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      drugs.

      This phase II trial is to determine precisely the pharmacokinetics parameters of RBT in
      combination with different ART regimens in Vietnamese HIV infected patients with pulmonary
      tuberculosis, in order to define optimal doses that will be further tested in a larger phase
      III trial comparing safety, tolerability and efficacy of RBT and RMP regimens.

      Patients will be offered to participated in the study after the first 6 weeks of the
      nationally recommended TB treatment. All the enrolled patients will be switched to rifabutin
      and randomized, two weeks later, to one of the three study ARV regimens. The RBT doses will
      be then adapted to the allocated ARV regimen according to a cross over scheme. Three full
      pharmacokinetics profile will be performed at different time point : before initiation of
      ARV, after one month of the first RFB dosage and one month after the second RFB dosage.
