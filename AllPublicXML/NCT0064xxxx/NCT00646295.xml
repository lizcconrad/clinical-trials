  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid related orbitopathy (TRO) is an autoimmune disease. Clinical features include:
      orbital pressure pain, ocular soft tissue swelling, muscle enlargement around the eyeball,
      eyelid retraction and bulging of the eye anteriorly out of the orbit. In many cases, the
      cornea may become too dry, and as a result, corneal ulcers may form, which can become
      infected. In severe cases, damage to the optic nerve can occur secondary to optic nerve
      compression by enlarged muscles in the orbit.

      Inflammation with soft tissue swelling occurs in the 1st stage of the disease. Scar formation
      can occur in the 2nd phase. The muscles under and nasal to the eyeball are most commonly
      involved. In many patients, intra-ocular pressure (IOP) can increase in primary. IOP in
      upgaze (when looking up) can increase.

      Goldmann applanation is the standard device to measure the IOP. It measures the average IOP
      (between the &quot;systolic&quot;, when the heart contracts, to the diastolic IOP, when the heart
      relaxes). Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer is a new device that can measure IOP and ocular
      pulse amplitude (OPA) which is the difference between diastolic IOP and systolic IOP. The
      choroid is a vascular layer inside the eyeball that feeds part of the retina (the retina is
      like the film in a non-digital camera). OPA is suggestive of choroidal blood flow. IOP
      measurements using Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer are less influenced by corneal thickness
      as opposed to Goldmann applanation which measures higher values in thicker corneas. In the
      current study we are interested in measuring the relationships between measurements taken
      with Goldmann applanation (IOP) and those taken with the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer
      (IOP and OPA). In addition, we will investigate the effect of orbital muscle enlargement on
      IOP/OPA following an up gaze position (looking up).
