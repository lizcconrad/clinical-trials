  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide data on the addition of narrow band ultra violet B (nbUVB)
      phototherapy to participants who have not shown an excellent response to three months of
      etanercept.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive etanercept 50 mg twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants who
      reach PASI-90 at Day 84 will be discontinued from the study (they can continue receiving
      commercial etanercept outside the study). Participants remaining in the study at Day 84 will
      decrease etanercept to 50 mg weekly for another 12 weeks.

      Participants who do not attain a 90 percent reduction in PASI from baseline (PASI-90) after
      12 weeks will be randomized (1:1) to receive either etanercept alone or etanercept with short
      courses of narrow band ultra violet B (nbUVB)phototherapy. Participants randomized to the
      nbUVB group will receive nbUVB treatments three times a weeks for at least four weeks. At
      every planned study visit after Day 84, nbUVB treatment will be discontinued in participants
      who reach PASI-90. nbUVB phototherapy will be re-initiated for another four weeks at the
      subsequent planned study visit if they lose their PASI-90 response.

      Efficacy will be evaluated with PASI, BSA and PGA by a blinded evaluator at Days 0, 28, 84,
      112, 140 and 168. The effect of the treatment on quality of life will be evaluated using the
      DLQI questionnaire at Days 112, 140 and 168. Safety will be evaluated by physical examination
      and adverse events evaluation.

          <title>PASI - (Psoriasis area and severity index)</title>
          <description>Four anatomic sites (head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities) are assessed for erythema, induration (plaque thickness), and desquamation (scaling) as seen on the day of the examination. The severity of each sign is assessed using a 5-point scale
0 = No symptoms
1 = Slight
2 = Moderate
3 = Marked
4 = Very marked
The area affected by psoriasis within a given anatomic site is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that anatomic site and assigned a numerical value according to the degree of psoriatic involvement from 0-6 Total scale 0 = best and 72 = worst</description>

        <description>Four anatomic sites - head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities - are assessed for erythema, induration, and desquamation. The severity of each sign is assessed using a 5-point scale:
0 = No symptoms
1 = Slight
2 = Moderate
3 = Marked
4 = Very marked
The area affected by psoriasis within a given anatomic site is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that anatomic site and assigned a numerical value according to the degree of psoriatic involvement from 0-6.
Total scale 0 = best and 72 = worst</description>

        <description>The aim of this questionnaire is to measure how much one's skin problem has affected one's life over the week prior to the visit.
Questionnaire is patient-assessed (self-reported). DLQI scores are evaluated at each time point.
Scale is from 0 best to 30 worst.
0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 2-5 = small effect on patient's life 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life</description>

PGA scores are evaluated at each time point.
The degree of overall lesion severity at the time of the physician's evaluation of the patient evaluated using the following scale:

1 = minimal
2 = mild
3 = moderate

Questionnaire is patient-assessed (self-reported). DLQI scores are evaluated at each time point.
Scale is from 0 best to 30 worst.
0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 2-5 = small effect on patient's life 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life</description>
