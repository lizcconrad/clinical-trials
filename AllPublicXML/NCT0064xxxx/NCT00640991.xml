      Insulin will safely reduce glucose levels in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction and admission hyperglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either the control arm and will receive usual AMI care
      or the experimental arm, which will include routine AMI care as well as intensive therapy
      intervention.

      In addition to the capillary blood glucose measurements obtained to titrate insulin doses in
      the experimental arm patients, laboratory plasma glucose will be drawn in all patients at
      randomization, 10, 24, 48, and 72 hours post randomization, 7 days post randomization (or
      hospital discharge if that occurs first), and 30 days post randomization.

    <description>The experimental arm will have an IV infusion of glulisine insulin started directly after randomization for at least 24 hours and for as long as CCU-level care is required, and the insulin infusion will be adjusted to achieve and maintain a target glucose range of 5.0-6.6 mmol/L (90-118 mg/dL). Once transferred to the ward, patients in the experimental arm will switch to glargine insulin and will continue this treatment for the remainder of their hospitalization and after hospital discharge, for a total duration of 30 days post randomization.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Both nondiabetic patients and patients with non-insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus
        admitted with a suspected AMI are eligible if they meet the following criteria:

          -  Signs or symptoms of AMI with definite ECG changes, defined as persistent ST-segment
             elevation (&gt; or = than 1 mm)in two or more contiguous leads, or new left bundle branch
             block

          -  Onset of symptoms within 24 hours before hospital presentation

          -  Capillary blood glucose level on presentation &gt; or = 8.0 mmol/L (144 mg/dL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with conditions that REQUIRE the administration of insulin, including:

               -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus, defined by a documented history of diabetes mellitus
                  before the age of 30

               -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus that was treated with insulin prior to AMI presentation

               -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus that is known to be very poorly controlled (e.g.
                  admission capillary blood glucose &gt; 16.0 mmol/L (288 mg/dL)or marked elevation in
                  glucose for which the site investigator plans to treat with insulin therapy)

          -  A history of severe hypoglycemic episodes (defined as hypoglycemia with symptoms which
             the patient is unable to reverse without the assistance of another person) within the
             past two years

          -  Known or suspected end-stage liver disease (due to the risk of hypoglycemia in the
             setting of liver dysfunction and consequent impaired regulation of glucose
             homeostasis)

          -  Cardiogenic shock on admission (due to the inaccuracy of glucose meter readings)

          -  Documented pregnancy

          -  Any concomitant disease (e.g. cancer) that might limit life expectancy to less than 90
             days

          -  Anticipated poor adherence with study treatments or an other factor that might
             jeopardize 90-day follow-up (e.g. no fixed address, long distance to hospital, etc.)

          -  Prior enrollment in this trial or current enrollment in another trial of ST-segment
             elevation myocardial infarction
