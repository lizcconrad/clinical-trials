      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's doxycycline
      monohydrate 150 mg tablets to Par's AdoxaÂ® 150 mg tablets following a single, oral 150 mg (1
      x 150 mg) dose administered under fasting conditions.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18 years and older.

          2. Sex: Male and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating female.

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum beta human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (beta-HCG) pregnancy tests performed within 21 days prior to the
                  start of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If
                  dosing is scheduled on weekends, the HCG pregnancy test should be given within 48
                  hours prior to dosing of each study period. An additional serum (beta-HCG)
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. No
                  hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy are permitted in this
                  study. Acceptable forms of contraception include the following:

                    1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    3. surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or
                       postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at
                       least one year.

               3. Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following is
                  reported and documented on the medical history:

                    1. postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or

                    2. bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of
                       bleeding for at least 6 months, or

                    3. total hysterectomy

               4. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit, all men and
                  women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide-containing barrier method
                  of contraception in addition to their current contraceptive device. This
                  requirement should be documented in the informed consent form.

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women with all
             subjects having a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 30 but greater than or
             equal to 19. (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV
             test, 12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 21 days of the initial dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used.

          2. Social Habits:

               1. Use of any tobacco products within one year prior to dosing.

               3. Ingestion of any vitamins or herbal products within 7 days prior to the initial
                  dose of the study medication.

               4. Any recent, significant change in dietary or exercise habits.

               5. A positive test for any drug included in the urine drug screen.

               1. Use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications within the 14 days
                  prior to the initial dose of study medication.

               2. Use of any hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy within 3
                  months prior to study medication dosing.

               3. Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior
                  to the initial dose of study medication.

          4. Diseases:

               1. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
                  hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic
                  disease.

               1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant
                  Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

               2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing.

          6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days
             prior to the initial dose of study medication.

          7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial
             dose of study medication.

          8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to doxycycline monohydrate or any tetracyclines.

          9. History of difficulties in swallowing, or any gastrointestinal disease which could
