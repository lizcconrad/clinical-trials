          -  Purulent discharge from the nose

          -  At least one of the following clinical signs and symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis

               -  Lasting for more than 7 days prior to and no longer than 21 days before
                  Evaluation 1: facial pain over the sinus or facial pressure over the sinus or
                  facial tightness over the sinus or facial swelling or toothache.

          -  Subject must be a suitable candidate for oral antimicrobial therapy and is able to
             swallow capsules intact.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             prior to Evaluation 1)

          -  Significant anatomical abnormalities of the sinuses

          -  Any other infection or condition which necessitates use of a concomitant systemic
             antimicrobial.

          -  History of any hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins
             (including cefdinir), or quinolones (including levofloxacin).

          -  Subject who has taken: a systemic antibiotic within 14 days before study drug
             administration; a long acting injectable antibiotic (e.g., penicillin G benzathine)
             within 30 days before study drug administration.

          -  Known significant renal or hepatic impairment.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic,
             gastrointestinal, neurological or endocrine disease, malignancy, or other abnormality

          -  Investigator considers the subject unsuitable for cefdinir or levofloxacin therapy,
             for any reason.

          -  Previous enrollment in this study.

             drug): Concomitant theophylline or any theophylline analog, unless plasma levels of
             these drugs can be adequately monitored during the study; Warfarin and probenecid.

          -  Immunocompromised subjects.

          -  Subject who requires parenteral antibiotic therapy for this infection or who has any
             other infection or condition, that necessitates use of a concomitant systemic
             antibiotic.

          -  Subjects receiving antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate,
             metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc within 2 hours
             before or after dosing with study drug.

          -  Subjects with a known or suspected central nervous system disorder that may predispose
             the subject to seizures or lower the seizure threshold.
