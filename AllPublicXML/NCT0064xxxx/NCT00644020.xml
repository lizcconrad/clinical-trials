  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a randomized, double-blind, placebo involved and multi-center clinical
      trial. All subjects are assigned to 4 groups, including 3mg, 6mg, 12mg per day and placebo
      group. Each group includes 25 subjects, who have hepatic-cellular carcinoma accompanied with
      branch vein thrombosis. They receive investigational drug 40 days after resection surgery.
      Each cycle lasts 4 to 6 days with an interval of 29 days in all 6 cycles.

      -  Patients who have signed the Informed Consent Form and are eligible for the entry
           criteria will be randomly assigned to either the TYROSERLEUTIDE treatment group or the
           placebo group. No matter which group the subject is assigned, he/she would receive
           chemotherapy treatment through the portal vein pump which was transplanted during the
           carcinoma section surgery 40 days before the randomization.

        -  Participants will be given either TYROSERLEUTIDE or placebo through intravenous
           injection with an interval of 29 days, during which the participant will not take any
           investigational drug or any other anti-tumor treatment as well. On the day just next to
           the completion of each cycle of research treatment which usually lasts for 3-5 days, the
           participant will receive medical inspection so as to observe and ensure drug safety.

        -  Participants will continue to receive investigational drug for 6 cycles until being
           detected with recurrence or metastasis of tumor or experiencing any serious side
           effects.

        -  A CT scan or MRI scan will be performed for each participant to exclude the recurrence
           or metastasis of tumor and assess the effects of treatment once before the initiation of
           each new cycle.
