  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and the incidence of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are extremely high in
      Taiwan (1, 2). More than 45,000 patients are under renal replacement therapy in the year 2004
      (2). The disease had not only caused a significant impact in personal life, but also a great
      burden on social security and government-run health insurance. However, despite this high
      prevalence, the awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in general population remains low
      (3, 4). The patients always come out too late for the intervention to slow down the
      progression of renal failure. Furthermore, most of them are not well prepared for the renal
      replacement therapy. The facts result in high mortality and morbidity in this specific
      population (5). It is mandatory to screen out and treat these patients early enough. However,
      these patients are deep into the community as the asymptomatic nature of CKD.

      The major purpose of the study is to screen the community for the early CKD and provide the
      appropriate intervention at time. The study will collect the characteristic demographic
      epidemiological data and find out risk factors for CKD of this geographic area, provide
      multidisciplinary education of CKD and establish timely referral for appropriate nephrologist
      care for treatment and monitoring of complications.

      The project will be last for 3 years. We will start to screen the patients within the
      community to identify the CKD population. This population will randomized into two group (one
      group with standard nephrologist care and another group with standard nephrologist care plus
      multidisciplinary CKD education) to evaluate the effectiveness of CKD education on the
      progression of renal function. The primary end-point will be the doubling tine estimated GFR,
      development of end-stage renal disease and all cause mortality. The non-CKD group of
      community will also follow up for urine and blood test for renal function, to determine the
      incidence and risk factors of new-onset renal disease. The accomplishment of this study will
      retard renal progression, improve community health and establish a model in preventing the
      chronic kidney disease.
