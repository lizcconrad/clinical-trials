  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a difference between paravertebral
      block and general anesthesia in terms of time to discharge from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit
      and pain level in patients undergoing outpatient breast cancer surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal anesthetic technique for breast cancer surgery allows for good postoperative pain
      relief and rapid discharge. Breast cancer surgery with potential axillary dissection is often
      performed under general anesthesia due to the potential for poor analgesia with local
      anesthetic infiltration at the surgical site alone. General anesthesia can be associated with
      increased post-operative pain, nausea, and delayed discharge when compared to regional
      anesthesia for breast and other types of procedures (1,2).

      The paravertebral block is a technique that has been used perioperatively for breast (3,4),
      thoracic (5), abdominal (6), and hernia surgeries (7). It has also been used for pain control
      after rib fractures and penetrating trauma (8,9). The paravertebral block is performed by
      injecting local anesthetic above or below the transverse processes of the vertebral bodies
      where the spinal nerve roots emerge from the intervertebral foramina. The most common
      technique is to insert a needle 2.5 centimeters lateral to the spinous process at each level
      and &quot;walk off&quot; the transverse process. Injections at one or multiple levels block the somatic
      and sympathetic innervation to these dermatomes (10).

      Rare complications of thoracic paravertebral blocks include epidural spread, intrathecal
      injection, and Horner's Syndrome (1,11,12). One of the most feared complications of the
      traditional technique is pleural puncture, which has an incidence of 0.64% to 6.7% in the
      published literature (3,11,13).

      Ultrasound guidance in regional anesthesia is gaining widespread popularity. This technology
      provides visualization of key anatomic structures and has been shown to decrease block
      placement and onset times (14,15) and improve patient comfort (15). Ultrasound-guided blocks
      are associated with success rates of greater than 90% (15,16). In the thoracic region,
      ultrasound can be used to identify the vertebral transverse processes, as well as the ribs
      and the pleura of the lungs (17). In this way, pleural puncture can be avoided during
      paravertebral block placement.

      To date there have been no published prospective, randomized trials comparing the multiple
      injection thoracic paravertebral technique using ultrasound guidance to general anesthesia in
      breast cancer surgery patients.

      Our hypothesis is that paravertebral block anesthesia will result in shorter Post Anesthesia
      Care Unit (PACU) stays and decreased Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores when compared to
      general anesthesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Secondary endpoints will
      include the need for postoperative opioids and the presence of nausea and/or vomiting.

    <description>Sedation will be provided with midazolam and fentanyl. The transverse processes of T1-T6 will be located using ultrasound guidance. The area will be prepped with betadine. At each level, a 21 Gauge, 4-inch Stimuplex needle will be inserted in order to make contact with the transverse process. Once the transverse process has been located, the needle will be &quot;walked off&quot; the process and inserted 1 cm deep to its inferior border. After negative aspiration, 3 mL of 1.5% mepivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and bicarbonate and 3 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 will be injected. Sedation will be provided with 50-100 mcg/kg/min of propofol during the surgical procedure. Approximately 20 minutes before the end of the procedure, 4 mg of zofran will be administered.</description>

    <description>Patients in the general anesthesia group will receive midazolam preoperatively for anxiolysis. Anesthesia will be induced with propofol and fentanyl. An LMA will be inserted and anesthesia maintained with sevoflurane in air and oxygen. 4 mg of zofran will be administered approximately 20 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure. The LMA will be removed and the patient will be transported to the PACU at the conclusion of the surgery.</description>
