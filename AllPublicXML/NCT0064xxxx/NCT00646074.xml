  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals with Alzheimer's or dementia return home, where their care is supported by
      family and friends. Although family caring at home is usually rewarding, it is often
      challenging, too. The demands and responsibilities of caring for a loved one at home can be
      stressful. The actual activities of caregiving vary according to the needs of the individual,
      but can include helping with bathing, dressing, eating, and many other activities. Caregivers
      must learn care techniques and how to manage changes in roles and lifestyle. While adjusting
      to these changes, caregivers may be advised to 'take care' of themselves, but may not receive
      guidance or support for doing this. In this study, we are testing a self-care intervention
      for older, spouse caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's or dementia to see how helpful the
      intervention is in reducing distress and in helping caregivers adopt and maintain healthy
      lifestyle behaviors.

      We have developed an intervention for caregivers that is called Self-Care TALK. The
      intervention includes creating a health-promoting, self-care education and support
      partnership between caregivers and nurses through the use of weekly telephone conversations.
      Each conversation focuses on a health-related topic, such as: healthy habits, building
      self-esteem, focusing on the positive, avoiding role overload, communicating, and building
      meaning. The conversations follow a basic format, but also are unique to each person.
      Participants complete questionnaires before and after the intervention, so that we can test
      the effect of participation in Self-Care TALK on caregiver health.

      We know that education and support about self-care can be achieved through partnerships
      between family caregivers and health care professionals. Our goal is to build on this
      knowledge in testing whether participation in the Self-Care TALK intervention will result in
      less distress and better health and well-being for spouse caregivers, compared to caregivers
      who receive no additional care beyond usual education and support. In working toward this
      goal, we are using a partnership approach, in which nurses and caregivers discuss several
      health-related topics and mutually identify creative solutions for caregivers to incorporate
      self-care and health-promotion strategies into their daily routines. Promoting healthy
      outcomes for caregivers is essential to supporting their personal well-being, and to
      fostering their ability to continue home care for their loved one.

      Informal caregiving, or providing non-paid assistance for a family member or friend who is
      unable to care for self, is challenging and stressful. Caregivers commonly experience
      negative psychological, emotional, physical, and social outcomes, including depression,
      strain and other disruptions in health and well-being. The overall aim of the study is to
      test the effectiveness of a health-promoting self-care education and support partnership
      between advanced practice nurses (APNs) and older spouse caregivers, in reducing perceived
      caregiving strain and in promoting health. The theory-based, multi-dimensional Self-Care TALK
      intervention is provided using a telephone-based approach to facilitate participation among
      carers, considering their concurrent responsibilities in the caregiving role.

      A randomized, treatment/comparison, repeated-measures experimental design is used to test the
      effectiveness of the health-promoting treatment (Self-Care TALK) compared to usual care, for
      spouse caregivers age 60 and older. Subjects must be living with and caring for the person
      with dementia and the dementia diagnosis must have been within 2 years of enrollment.

      Subjects complete questionnaires at baseline (Time 1) before randomization to the treatment
      or comparison group. Treatment group subjects receive written materials related to self-care
      and health promotion for use during the TALK sessions. Self-Care TALK is implemented through
      6 weekly telephone sessions with advanced practice nurses. Sessions focus on several
      self-care topics, including: healthy habits, building self-esteem, focusing on the positive,
      avoiding role overload, communicating, and building meaning. Basic content is structured, but
      conversations are individualized with regard to each person's environment, abilities, and
      activities.

      All subjects complete questionnaires again at 8 weeks (Time 2), and 24 weeks (Time 3) after
      baseline. Treatment group subjects are hypothesized to have lower caregiving strain, higher
      perceived health, well-being, and self-efficacy related to health, and less depressive
      symptomatology than comparison group subjects. Promoting healthy outcomes for caregivers of
      persons with dementia is essential to fostering ability for continued home-based care.
      Comparison group subjects receive written materials related to self-care and health promotion
      post Time 3.
