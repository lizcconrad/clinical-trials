      Test hypothesis that milk can raise blood sugars as well as orange juice or glucose tablets
      without raising blood sugars too much the way that orange juice or glucose tablets sometimes
      do.

      Subjects will wear a continuous glucose monitor prior to test to determine normal glucose
      levels. The morning of the test an IV will be inserted into the subject and insulin and
      saline drips will be started. Blood glucose levels will be checked every 10 minutes until the
      subject becomes hypoglycemic. IVs will be stopped at that time and subject will be given skim
      milk, orange juice or glucose tablets at that time. Blood will be drawn every 15 minutes
      until blood sugars stabilize. Blood draws will be analyzed to determine glucose, insulin,
      epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone and GLP-1 levels. Procedure
      will be repeated two more times using other glucose methods (skim milk, orange juice or
      glucose tablets).
