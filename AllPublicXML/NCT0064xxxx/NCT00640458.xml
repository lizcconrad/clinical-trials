    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 100 mg sildenafil on clitoral
      engorgement in pre-menopausal women, as well as examining the safety and toleration of the
      drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-menopausal women aged 18-45 with a primary diagnosis of Female Sexual Arousal
             Disorder for at least 6 months prior to entering the study. The FSAD could have been
             associated with female orgasmic disorder (FOD) and/or superficial or introital
             dyspareunia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

          -  Subjects not using an acceptable mean of contraception for the duration of the study.
