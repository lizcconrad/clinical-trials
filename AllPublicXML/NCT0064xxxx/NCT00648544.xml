    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the rate and extent of absorption of pravastatin sodium
      from the following formulations under fed conditions:

        1. Pravastatin Sodium 80 mg Tablets (Genpharm Inc. Canada)

        2. Pravachol® 80 mg Tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., U.S.A.) Bioequivalence of these
           formulations was assessed for pravastatin.

      Based on the results from this study, these two 80 mg pravastatin tablet formulations
      demonstrated bioequivalence under the single-dose fed conditions.

          -  Any subject who has had blood withdrawals within 56 days preceding this study, taken
             during the conduct of any clinical study at a facility other than BCR, or within the
             lockout period specified by a previous study conducted at BCR.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within 30 days
             preceding this study.
