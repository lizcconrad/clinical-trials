      An increasing literature shows that omega-3 fatty acids provide numerous health benefits,
      including a variety of psychiatric symptoms and disorders including stress, anxiety,
      cognitive impairment, mood disorders (major depression and bipolar disorder) and
      schizophrenia. Omega-3 fatty acids may additionally represent a promising treatment strategy
      in patients with PTSD. Moreover, given its beneficial cardiovascular effects, adjunctive
      omega-3 fatty acids may also benefit the general health status of these veterans, who
      frequently present with a variety of comorbid medical disorders.
