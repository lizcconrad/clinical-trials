  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the oncology practice, The National Union of the Centres of Fight Against the Cancer
      recently published the Standards, Options and Recommendations for the coverage of the pains
      provoked during the invasive gestures of a short duration realized at patients affected by
      cancer. These support the use of the Kalinox ® 170 bar as therapeutic alternative for the
      preparation of the painful procedures of a short duration such as spinal taps or osseous at
      the adult.The objective of this study thus is to clarify the appropriate efficiency and the
      tolerance of the equimolar mixture protoxide of nitrogen / oxygen during invasive procedures
      realized in adult oncology with regard to the analgesic reference methods and to the effect
      placebo leads by the accompaniment of the patient during the procedure.
