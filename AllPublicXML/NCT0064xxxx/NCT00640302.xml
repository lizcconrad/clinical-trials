  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in patients
      who have a clinical diagnosis of pandemic influenza infection. The study is observational
      only. The primary measure used in this study will be mortality. Symptom severity and
      duration, treatment limiting side effects, demographic information and resistance will also
      be examined. This project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia,
      Hong Kong or Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the
      continued use of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency
      response to pandemic influenza.

      The aim of this study is to describe treatment outcomes in patients infected with pandemic
      influenza (the most likely case being a version of the influenza A H5N1 virus) including
      overall survival, the incidence and duration of hospitalization, the resolution of protocol
      specified symptoms, the incidence and the severity of treatment limiting side effects in
      treated patients. This study will also describe the sequelae of influenza in infected
      patients including transmission to other persons, associations between baseline data and
      treatment outcomes and drug resistance. A repository of biological samples will also be
      created to examine virological and immunological concepts relating to pandemic influenza.

      It is an open label prospective cohort study. Patients presenting at study sites with the
      recognised clinical case definition for pandemic influenza (to be distributed by State and
      Commonwealth Departments of Health when first clinical case occurs) will be eligible to be
      enrolled on the study. Informed consent to participate in the study will be sought including
      parental/guardian consent for minors and presumed consent for adults who are incapacitated
      (consistent with NHMRC requirements).

      Patients will be asked to provide a blood sample and an appropriate respiratory tract sample.
      As a minimum, we will collect a combined nose and throat sample.

      A further respiratory tract swab will be collected on day 5 (range 5-10) and stored for
      future use. Index case follow-up will include an assessment and respiratory tract specimen
      and blood sample 14 days after informed consent. A final assessment for outcomes (including a
      blood sample) will occur approximately one month after enrolment.
