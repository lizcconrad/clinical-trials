  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pycnogenol® is a proprietary bark extract of the French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster
      ssp. atlantica). Pycnogenol® has prevented pathologic symptoms such as chronic inflammation
      and increased platelet aggregation, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The
      endothelium is increasingly recognized not only a target (with vascular remodelling occurring
      in response to an injury and resulting in atherosclerosis), but also a mediator in the
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Indeed, endothelial cells play an important regulatory role
      in the cardiovascular system by the expression of numerous molecules and release of mediators
      such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Data from animal studies, as
      well as human studies indicate that Pycnogenol may improve endothelial function, which is a
      powerful surrogate for clinical prognosis.
