  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 8-week study is to compare the effects of switching from therapy with
      epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin. This study will also assess the effect that changing
      to Remodulin will have on patient satisfaction with their treatment and impact on quality of
      life.

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial
      pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a
      variety of diseases and syndromes. Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an
      increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately
      leading to inactivity and death. The goal of PAH treatment is to lengthen survival time, to
      ameliorate symptoms of PAH and to improve health related quality of life (HRQOL).

      Remodulin® (treprostinil sodium), a stable analogue of prostacyclin, possesses potent
      pulmonary and systemic vasodilatory and platelet anti-aggregatory actions in vitro and in
      vivo. Recently, Remodulin received FDA approval for intravenous therapy based upon
      bioequivalence of the IV and SC routes of administration. Remodulin is more chemically stable
      than epoprostenol and may offer potential safety and convenience advantages compared to
      intravenous epoprostenol that may impact Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and/or
      patient satisfaction. Unlike epoprostenol, Remodulin does not need to be mixed daily and is
      stable at room temperature eliminating the need for ice packs. Furthermore, since Remodulin
      remains in the body longer than epoprostenol (4 hrs instead of less than 5 minutes) there is
      less risk of cardiovascular collapse from a sudden interruption of infusion, such as a line
      clog. In an open-label study in Europe, patients who were using a type of portable medication
      pump called the CADD Legacy pump were rapidly switched from Flolan to Remodulin with no
      serious side effects. This study will examine effects of switching from therapy with
      epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin and compare changes in HRQOL and treatment
      satisfaction before and after rapid switch from epoprostenol to Remodulin in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension using the CADD legacy pump.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR), a validated PAH-specific instrument consisting of 65 items used to assess symptoms, functioning and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning)and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), a validated generic measure of treatment satisfaction consisting of 14 Likert-response items comprising four domains: Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. The TSQM was completed at baseline and at Week 8. The TSQM consists of 13 items that made up three specific scales (Effectiveness, Side effects, Convenience) and one global satisfaction scale. TSQM items are scaled using either a 5-point or 7-point scale. Five-point scales are used for unidimensional continua (e.g. extremely satisfied to not at all), while 7-point scales are used for bipolar continua(e.g., extremely positive to extremely negative. Non-neutral midpoints are used for 7-point scales, resulting in a greater range of positive response options than negative options for these items. Scale scores are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction.</description>

        <description>The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR), a validated PAH-specific instrument consisting of 65 items used to assess symptoms, functioning and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning)and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>

        <population>Two subjects with a Week 8 visit outside of the visit window are included in the summary. One subject died prior to completing the Week 8 visit. One subject had an incomplete Baseline questionnaire and the CAMPHOR Activity component could not be calculated, therefore N=5 Activity and Total Score Components, and N=6 for Symptom and Quality of Life.</population>

        <title>Change in Score on Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication</title>
        <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), a validated generic measure of treatment satisfaction consisting of 14 Likert-response items comprising four domains: Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. The TSQM was completed at baseline and at Week 8. The TSQM consists of 13 items that made up three specific scales (Effectiveness, Side effects, Convenience) and one global satisfaction scale. TSQM items are scaled using either a 5-point or 7-point scale. Five-point scales are used for unidimensional continua (e.g. extremely satisfied to not at all), while 7-point scales are used for bipolar continua(e.g., extremely positive to extremely negative. Non-neutral midpoints are used for 7-point scales, resulting in a greater range of positive response options than negative options for these items. Scale scores are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction.</description>
