  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is a disease in which the blood vessels become blocked by plaques (consisting
      of fat, calcification, and fibrous tissue), reducing blood flow to vital organs and
      tissues.Blockage of the carotid arteries in the neck is a major cause of stroke. One way of
      treating carotid atherosclerosis is with cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. Statins
      have been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 24-40% and risk pf stroke by
      11-30%.The purpose of this study is to determine if short term treatment with atorvastatin
      causes early favorable changes in the plaques that block blood flow through the carotid
      arteries. These changes can be assessed 1) by taking pictures of the carotid arteries with
      MRI and Ultrasound before and after statin treatment, and 2) by special studies of the
      plaques removed from the carotid arteries by surgery.

      Candidates for bilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA) who meet study criteria will provide
      informed consent before their randomization. Before the first CEA, the patient will have MRI,
      US, and EBCT exams of both carotids. The most occlusive plaque will be resected at the first
      CEA. The patient will then receive atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 3 months. Then the second CEA
      will be performed. Six weeks after the second CEA, the patient will have another MRI, US, and
      EBCT exam and at 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter. This protocol will allow comparison of the
      characteristics of the plaque that has been exposed to drug vs the plaque that has not been
      exposed. It will also allow monitoring the effect of drug on restenosis after surgery.

    <description>An untreated carotid plaque will be obtained at the first endarterectomy. Atorvastatin 80mg will be administered for 3 months. The contralateral (treated) plaque will be obtained at the second endarterectomy. Hence, each patient will be his/her own control</description>
