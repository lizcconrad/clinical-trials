  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if ingestion of a probiotic formula (Jarrow-Dophilus
      EPS)reduces incidence of diarrhea and improves the quality of life of patients receiving
      antibiotic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A common complication of antibiotic use is antibiotic-induced diarrhea (AAD). AAD is the
      result of disrupted microflora, occurring two to eight weeks after antibiotic use. Probiotic
      supplementation may rebalance the intestinal flora, thus reducing the incidence of diarrhea,
      improving quality of life and reducing symptoms associated with antibiotic administration.

      The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
      that will assess the efficacy of the Jarro-Dophilus EPS probiotics formula for the prevention
      of AAD.

      In addition,a subgroup of participants will be requested to provide one fecal sample at the
      initiation of the study and one sample in the last three days of probiotic (or placebo)
      treatment. The samples will undergo microbial analysis for routine C &amp; S(Salmonella,
      Shigella, Campylobacter, Ecoli 0157, Yersinia), VRE, Yeast, Fungus culture (moulds) and C.
      difficile toxin.
