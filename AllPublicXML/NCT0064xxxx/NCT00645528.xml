      The purpose of this research is to determine if meeting in a group with other subjects with
      diabetes can reduce barriers to starting insulin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common, morbid and expensive disease among veterans. Achieving and maintaining
      adequate glycemic control can reduce the devastating complications of diabetes. Unfortunately
      a large percentage of veterans with type 2 diabetes continue to have poorly controlled blood
      sugars. Insulin is the most potent medication for reducing glycemia, but is not used often
      enough due to barriers that are both patient and provider driven.

      We propose to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of establishing an insulin
      education group that would serve to educate patients about insulin, to initiate insulin in a
      group setting, and to provide appropriate follow-up of those who start insulin. If the
      intervention is successful, we plan to develop a multicenter study to test rigorously the
      effect of this approach.

      Specific Aims:

      To determine if psychological barriers to insulin initiation in patients with uncontrolled
      type 2 diabetes are favorably affected by a group insulin education and insulin initiation
      visit, as measured by the Barriers to Insulin Treatment (BIT) Questionaire before and after
      the intervention.

      To evaluate the feasibility of the intervention as measured by the percent of patients who
      are referred to the class, but either cancel without rescheduling or fail to report and the
      percent of patients who begin insulin.

      To evaluate the safety of the intervention as measured by the proportion of patients
      experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms; proportion of patients requiring sugar intake to manage
      hypoglycemia; and the proportion of patients requiring assistance to manage hypoglycemia.

    <description>The Barriers to Insulin Treatment Questionnaire (BIT) was completed at the start of the first visit and at the end of the second visit. The BIT is a 14 item self-administered questionnaire with 5 subscales, each representing a different psychological barrier to insulin treatment. Scales are scored 1-10, representing the mean answer of the 10-point Likert questions for the relevant scale. The higher the score, the greater the barriers to insulin treatment, with the exception of the 2nd scale (&quot;Expectations regarding positive insulin-related outcomes&quot;) where the lower the score, the greater the barriers to insulin treatment. An overall sum score is calculated the same way, after inverting the items of the 2nd scale. The overall sum scale is scored 1-10, representing the mean answers of the 10-point Likert questions. The higher the score, the greater the barriers to insulin treatment. Reported here is the change in BIT score from baseline. This was assessed by paired t-test.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were referred by their primary care provider (PCP) through an electronic consult to participate in an insulin education and initiation group visit. All patients received the same education and standard of care; however, only those subjects who signed an informed consent form and met inclusion/exclusion criteria had their data analyzed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>From April to July 2008, 102 patients were referred to the clinic, and 71 (70%) reported to visit 1. Of these, 32 were excluded: 15 did not bring a glucose log; 7 had HbA1c &lt;8; 1 did not have HbA1c within 1 month; 1 was not referred by PCP; 6 did not consent; 2 were already on insulin. 39 were eligible for the study. 32 completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Insulin Education Class Participants</title>
          <description>Subjects attended two group visits, two weeks apart, during which they received education regarding goals of therapy, insulin use, and hypoglycemia. Self-monitored blood glucose values were reviewed and insulin was initiated, if felt appropriate by the physician investigator and if accepted by the subject. The Barriers to Insulin Treatment Questionnaire (BIT) was completed at the start of the first visit and at the end of the second visit.The BIT is a 14 item self-administered questionnaire with 5 subscales, each representing a different psychological barrier to insulin treatment.
Additionally, at the second visit, proportion of blood glucose readings below 70 mg/dl were recorded. All patients were asked how many times in the two weeks they experienced symptoms/signs of low blood sugar, how many times they required sugar intake for the these symptoms, and how many times they required another person to assist them.</description>

        <title>Barriers to Insulin Treatment Total Sum Score Visit 1 (Week 0)</title>
        <description>The Barriers to Insulin Treatment Questionnaire (BIT) was completed at the start of the first visit and at the end of the second visit. The BIT is a 14 item self-administered questionnaire with 5 subscales, each representing a different psychological barrier to insulin treatment. Scales are scored 1-10, representing the mean answer of the 10 point Likert questions for the relevant scale. The higher the score, the greater the barriers to insulin treatment, with the exception of the 2nd scale (&quot;Expectations regarding positive insulin-related outcomes&quot;) where the lower the score, the greater the barriers to insulin treatment. An overall sum score can be calculated the same way, after inverting the items of the 2nd scale. The overall sum scale is scored 1-10, representing the mean answers of the 10-point Likert questions. The higher the score, the greater the barriers to insulin treatment. The Total Sum Score and each subscale at Visit 1 is reported here.</description>
