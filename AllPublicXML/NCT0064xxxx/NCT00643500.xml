    <textblock>
      Patients with partial-onset seizures seen in community-based practices were to be included in
      this therapeutic use study

        -  to assess the safety and tolerability of Keppra (Levetiracetam) and to confirm the
           favorable safety of the drug found during clinical development

        -  to obtain further information about optimal dosing in daily clinical practice. Compared
           to previous registration trials, the study population corresponded more closely to that
           seen in daily clinical practice.
