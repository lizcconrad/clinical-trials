      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of RX-1741, an
      oxazolidinone, versus linezolid, another oxazolidinone, in the treatment of uncomplicated
      skin and skin structure infections

    <description>To qualify as a Cure, participants were required to fulfill the following criteria: all systemic signs and symptoms of uSSSI present at screening were improved or resolved; no further antibiotic therapy was necessary for treatment of uSSSI; and there was no worsening or appearance of new signs and symptoms of uSSSI.</description>

    <description>The microbiological response at the patient level was considered Eradicated (documented or presumed)if no pathogens were present in repeat cultures taken from the original site of infection or a clinical response of cure precluded the ability to obtain a culturable specimen.</description>

      <desc>While 51, 50 and 49 subjects were randomized to radezolid qd, radezolid bid, and linezolid, respectively, safety was assessed in the ITT population (those who received at least 1 dose of study drug.) Four subjects (2 in radezolid qd and 2 in linezolid) did not receive any study drug; thus, the # of subjects at risk is 49, 50 and 47, respectively.</desc>
