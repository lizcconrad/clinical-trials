      This study will determine the risk of brain aneurysm (abnormal outpouching of a brain artery)
      in young adults who had their carotid artery tied off as an infant as part of the
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) procedure. This procedure is sometimes performed
      on newborns with lung problems so that they can have oxygen brought to their blood outside
      the body. ECMO operates similar to a heart-lung machine. Blood drained from the veins has the
      carbon dioxide removed and oxygen added. The oxygenated blood is then returned to the body
      through the arteries.

      People 18 to 25 years of age who underwent ECMO as an infant at the Children's National
      Medical Center in Washington, D.C., may be eligible for this study.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical and neurological examinations.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck. MRI uses a strong magnetic field
           and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The subject lies in the
           scanner (a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field) for about 90 minutes, lying
           still for up to 15 minutes at a time. During part of the procedure, a contrast dye is
           injected into a vein through a catheter (thin plastic tube) to enhance the images.

      Objective:

      To assess whether the hemodynamic stress of long-term common carotid artery occlusion can
      lead to cerebral aneurysm formation in young adults.

      Study population:

      100 adults 18-25 years of age who underwent common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion as a
      neonate as part of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) procedure performed in the
      setting of pulmonary insufficiency.

      Design:

      Patients who underwent CCA occlusion as a neonate for ECMO at Children's National Medical
      Center will be identified and contacted. The study will be explained and informed consent
      will be obtained. Subjects will undergo outpatient evaluation to include history and
      physical, magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head.

      Outcome measures:

        -  Cerebrovascular anatomic anomalies such as cerebral aneurysms and persistent fetal
           circulation pathways, etc.

        -  Cerebral perfusion asymmetry on MRI.

        -  Cerebral parenchymal abnormalities such as stroke.
