    <textblock>
      It is important to confirm health benefits experienced by breast cancer survivors after
      participation in a physical activity behavior change intervention. One such potential benefit
      is a reduction in harmful inflammation that might lead to increased symptoms or cancer risk.
      Because little is known about how physical activity behavior change interventions influence
      inflammation in breast cancer survivors, the investigators study will measure inflammation
      with blood markers known as cytokines among breast cancer survivors before and after a
      physical activity intervention. Such information has the potential to lead to improved
      physical functioning, reduction in bothersome symptoms (e.g., fatigue), and reduced cancer
      risk in breast cancer survivors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female breast cancer patients between the ages of 18 and 70 years of age with a
             diagnosis of Stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer who are not currently receiving (and
             do not plan to receive during the study duration) chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
             The participant may be taking longer term therapies such as aromatase inhibitors,
             estrogen receptor modulators, etc.

          -  If the patient has undergone a surgical procedure, must be at least 8 weeks
             post-procedure.

          -  English speaking.

          -  Medical clearance for participation provided by primary care physician or oncologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of dementia or organic brain syndrome.

          -  Medical, psychological, or social characteristic that would interfere with ability to
             fully participate in program activities and assessments (e.g., psychosis,
             schizophrenia, etc.).

          -  Contraindication to participation in a regular physical activity program.

          -  Metastatic or recurrent disease

          -  Inability to ambulate

          -  Engaged in ≥ 60 minutes of vigorous physical activity or ≥ 150 minutes of moderate
             plus vigorous activity per week during the past month.

          -  Anticipates undergoing elective surgery during the duration of the intervention which
             would interfere with intervention participation (e.g., breast reconstructive surgery).

          -  Participant does not live or work within 50 miles of the study site.
