      Primary objective: To determine the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and immunohistochemistry
      surrogate of inflammation in patients with NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury treated with
      Rebamipide 3x a day vs Esomeprazole 40mg once a day. Secondary objective: For patients who
      become symptomatic during NSAID treatment, to compare the proportion of patients with
      positive treatment effects using the Likert scale. Third objective: To compare the proportion
      of patients with positive treatment effects as determined by Modified Lanza scoring between
      the two groups.
