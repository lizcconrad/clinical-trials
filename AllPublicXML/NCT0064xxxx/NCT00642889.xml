    <textblock>
      To determine the long-term safety and efficacy of a dose range of safinamide of 50-200
      mg/day, p.o., compared to placebo, as add-on therapy in patients with early idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease who are currently receiving a stable dose of a single dopamine (DA)
      agonist.

      The study will consist of 12 months of double-blind treatment. Patients will continue to take
      the original treatment administered in Study 015 (safinamide 100 mg/day, safinamide 200
      mg/day, or placebo).
