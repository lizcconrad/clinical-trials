      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the characteristics, clinical responses, and safety
      issues of patients receiving long-term treatment of Risperidone long-acting injectable. The
      goal is to evaluate patient outcomes based on pre-existing risk or disease factors and past
      medication use.

      This is an Observational, retrospective study on the use of Risperidone long-acting
      injectable. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the characteristics, clinical responses,
      and safety issues of patients receiving long-term treatment of Risperidone. Patient outcomes
      will be evaluated based on pre-existing risk or disease factors and past medication use. Data
      will be collected from medical charts and other available medical records from one year prior
      to risperidone treatment until discontinuation of risperidone long acting injectable. The
      study will compare the number of days hospitalized for reasons relating to psychosis before
      and after treatment with risperidone long-acting injectable. Information about past use of
      anti-psychotic medications will be collected. The occurrence and frequency of adverse events
      [Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms (EPS) - the abnormal body movements sometimes associated with
      antipsychotic medications, body weight changes, drowsiness, sexual problems] and the dose or
      change in dose of Risperidone long-acting injectable will also be collected. The study will
      also investigate the relapse rate and the hospitalization rate before and after treatment. It
      is a chart review type of study. No study drug has been used in the study.
