  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have developed a training intervention that successfully improves older adults' memory. We
      have also shown that older adults whose memory is as good as younger adults' memory (Hi-Old)
      use an altered pattern of memory-related brain activity compared to younger adults, whereas
      healthy older adults with poorer memory (Lo-Old) do not. We have also shown that individuals
      with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) have impairments of conscious, effortful,
      Recollection-based memory processes, whereas their automatic, Familiarity-based memory
      processes are intact. Our primary current goal is to investigate whether our successful
      memory intervention will improve Recollection and produce induce altered patterns of brain
      activity in the Lo-Old and aMCI.

      Young, Lo-Old, Hi-Old, and aMCI will be scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      while performing two memory tasks. Half of the Lo-Old and half of the aMCI will then receive
      the memory intervention, while the other half in each group will receive a control program
      consisting of information and games about aging. The Lo-Old and aMCI will then be rescanned
      while performing the two memory tasks. We predict that the memory intervention will improve
      performance on a number of memory tasks, and will induce altered patterns of brain activity.
      In the Lo-Old, their brain activity after the memory intervention will look more like the
      Hi-Old, while brain activity will become more focal in the aMCI.

    <description>Participants are exposed to long lists of words. Each word is presented either visually or auditorily, and each word is repeated after a variable number of intervening words (the lag), in each the same modality, or the other modality. Participants are instructed to respond &quot;yes&quot; only to words repeated in the same modality. If a performance criterion is met, the lag is increased for the next session; if the performance criterion is not met, the same lag is repeated in the next session.</description>
