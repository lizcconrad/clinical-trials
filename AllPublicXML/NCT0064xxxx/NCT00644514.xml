      The purpose of this study is to identify the mediators and genes in airway epithelial and BAL
      cells that are differentially regulated following inhalation of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) among study participants with allergic asthma and normal phenotypes. This approach is
      designed to identify novel genes associated with both asthma pathogenesis and asthma
      susceptibility. LPS, or endotoxin, a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria, is
      ubiquitous in the environment, and is thought to influence both susceptibility and severity
      of asthma.

      240 subjects (healthy adult men and women (age &gt;18-40) with and without atopy and asthma)
      will complete the screening evaluations in order to establish 3 study groups of 60 subjects
      each. Each qualified subject will undergo an inhaled LPS endotoxin challenge followed by
      bronchoscopy after 24 hours, which will consist of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and
      endobronchial brush biopsies. BAL involves squirting a small amount of sterile salt water
      into one of the airways then gently taking it back out through the bronchoscope. The brush
      sample involves gently moving a small brush back and forth in an airway to collect cell
      samples. Samples of whole blood will also be obtained at various time points. RNA will be
      isolated from these cell populations in order to assess differential gene expression
      expression using microarrays.

      Background:

      Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria, is
      ubiquitous in the environment, and is often present in high concentrations in organic dusts,
      as well as in air pollution, and household dusts. There is convincing evidence that endotoxin
      exacerbates airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in allergic asthmatics. Additional
      findings indicate that allergic airways can enhance the response to inhaled endotoxin, and
      that endotoxin can enhance the airway response to allergens. However, when considering the
      interaction between endotoxin and allergens, the timing of the exposure appears to be
      critical. Emerging evidence suggests that early exposure to endotoxin, a potent inducer of
      Th1 type cytokines (IFN-g and IL-12), may minimize the risk of allergen sensitization which
      could has profound effects on reducing the risk of developing asthma in children. Independent
      of its effect in allergic asthma, several studies demonstrate that inhalation of air
      contaminated with endotoxin is associated with the classical features of asthma (reversible
      airflow obstruction and airway inflammation, and persistent airway hyperreactivity and airway
      remodeling). Epidemiological studies have shown that the concentration of inhaled endotoxin
      in the bioaerosol is strongly and consistently associated with reversible airflow obstruction
      among cotton workers, agricultural workers, and fiberglass workers. Importantly, the
      concentration of endotoxin in the bioaerosol is the most important occupational exposure
      associated with the development and progression of airway disease in agricultural workers.
      Experimentally, inhalation of endotoxin can cause reversible airflow obstruction and airway
      inflammation in previously unexposed healthy study subjects. The ability of the host to
      respond to endotoxin is highly variable, and is influenced in part by genetic factors.:

      The rationale for this investigation is based on the following points:

        -  asthma is caused in large part by both genetic susceptibility and environmental
           exposure,

        -  a variety of immune and non-immune mechanisms can function independently or
           interactively to cause airway hyper-reactivity, airflow obstruction, airway
           inflammation, and airway remodeling,

        -  environmental challenges can be used to &quot;narrow the asthma phenotype&quot; and allow one to
           investigate unique gene-environment interactions that are involved in the development of
           biologically specific forms of asthma,

        -  genes that are over or under stimulated in the airway epithelia of asthmatics following
           inhalation challenge are important in the pathogenesis of asthma
