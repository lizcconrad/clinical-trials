  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of Memantine on non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's
      disease.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects about one million people in the United States. It is a
      common neurological condition that is clinically defined by rigidity (muscle stiffness),
      bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and tremor. Parkinson's Disease , however, reveals
      numerous non-motor symptoms that have been underemphasized. Problematic symptoms include
      varying degrees of dementia, psychosis, diminished assertiveness and confidence, general
      fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, problems with blood pressure, sweating, and bladder,
      and a common yet difficult to define sense of &quot;not feeling well&quot;.
