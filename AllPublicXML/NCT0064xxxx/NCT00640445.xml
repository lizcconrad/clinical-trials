  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans returning from combat deployments face the interrelated challenges of processing
      their combat experiences and transitioning back to civilian life. Unfortunately, many
      veterans wait years or decades before seeking help for post-deployment problems, if they seek
      it at all. This study seeks to determine whether Internet-Based Expressive Writing (IB-EW), a
      brief, low-cost, easily disseminated, and resource-efficient intervention, can reduce
      psychological symptoms and improve functioning among Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and
      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans as they navigate this transition, while also
      attempting to reduce barriers to help-seeking. Expressive Writing, a highly private, readily
      accessible, and non-stigmatizing intervention, has a strong evidence-base in civilian
      populations, but its efficacy in combat veterans has not been tested. This study therefore
      seeks to test the efficacy of Expressive Writing in a veteran population while further
      enhancing its accessibility by delivering it over the internet (Internet-Based Expressive
      Writing; IB-EW). This study will comprise a randomized controlled trial with three
      conditions: (a) Internet-Based Expressive Writing, (b) Internet-Based Control Writing, and
      (c) No Writing/Treatment As Usual, with a total of 1152 OIF/OEF veterans randomized across
      these groups. Expressive Writing participants will write with feeling about their transition
      from being a soldier to being a civilian; Control Writing participants will write factually
      about the information needs of new veterans; and Treatment as Usual participants will
      complete the assessments but not engage in any writing assignments. Participants will
      complete standardized self-report measures of psychological symptoms, psychosocial
      functioning, and life satisfaction at baseline (Session 1) and at three months (Session 6)
      and six months (Session 7) post-intervention. Participants in writing conditions will write
      for 20 minutes on four consecutive days (Sessions 2-5) following completion of baseline
      measures (participants in the TAU condition will not complete Sessions 2-5). The study will
      also attempt to identify individual difference characteristics related to the efficacy of the
      treatment, to see who may be most likely to benefit from the treatment. Analyses will
      primarily entail multivariate analyses of variance. Power is adequate to detect even a small
      effect.
