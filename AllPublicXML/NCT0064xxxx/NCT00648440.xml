        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18 years and older.

          2. Sex: Male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum Beta-human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy tests performed within 14 days prior to the start of
                  the study and the evening prior to dosing of each study period. If dosing is
                  scheduled for a Sunday or Monday, the Beta-HCG pregnancy test should be given
                  within 48 hours prior to dosing for that study period. An additional Beta-HCG
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. Acceptable
                  forms of contraception include the following:

                    1. hormonal contraceptives initiated at least 3 months prior to the start of
                       the study and continued during the study, or

                    2. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    3. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    4. postmenopausal or surgical sterility accompanied with a documented
                       postmenopausal course of at least one year (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or
                       hysterectomy).

               3. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit - including
                  the washout period, women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide
                  containing barrier method of contraception in addition to their current
                  contraceptive device. This advice should be documented in the informed consent
                  form.

               4. Women are allowed to be taking hormone replacement therapy provided that the
                  dosage regimen was initiated at least 3 months prior to the start of the study
                  and continued from study screen until study exit.

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women and all
             subjects within 15% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of
             &quot;&quot;Desirable Weights of Adults&quot;&quot; Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1999 (See Part II
             ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV
             test, 12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 14 days of the initial dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used.

          2. Social Habits:

               1. Use of any tobacco products.

                  at least 3 months prior to study medication dosing.

               2. Use of any medication known to alter hepatic enzyme activity within 28 days prior
                  to the initial dose of study medication, excluding hormonal contraceptives and
                  replacement therapy initiated at least 3 months prior to study medication dosing.

          4. Diseases:

               1. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
                  hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic

                  Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

               2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing.

          6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days
             prior to the initial dose of study medication.

          7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial
             dose of study medication.

          8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to midodrine, any of the inactive tablet ingredients, or
             other related products.

          9. History of difficulties in swallowing, or any gastrointestinal disease which could
