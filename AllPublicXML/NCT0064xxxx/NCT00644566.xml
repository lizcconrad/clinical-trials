  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the shortage of child psychiatrists and the high prevalence of child mental health
      disorder, pediatricians and other pediatric primary care providers often assume
      responsibility for the management of various psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. However, pediatricians have not been well-trained during
      residency to deal with the complexities of ADHD management. In addition, the system of care
      under which pediatricians practice do not afford the time availability that is required to
      properly manage a child with ADHD. On the other hand, if a pediatrician wishes to refer a
      patient to a child mental health specialist, many obstacles, including but not limited to
      stigma, insurance issues, and long waiting lists, often interfere with the patient actually
      receiving services for his/her ADHD. This research project seeks to examine an innovative
      model of care in which a child psychologist is located on the premises of a pediatric office
      and is available to share the care of patients with the pediatrician in order to address
      ADHD. We hypothesize that parents as well as pediatricians will be more satisfied with this
      model of care and that patients will ultimately have better outcomes. The beginning of our
      pilot has shown under-identification to be a barrier to care as well, and thus we propose to
      implement a quality improvement initiative to screen children for psychosocial issues as
      well. As we have had trouble with recruitment and unfortunately have had more children
      randomized to TAU than shared care, we propose in December 2007 a phase 2 of our study where
      all subjects, instead of randomization, are entered into shared care.

      Study Goals:

      A. To compare patients with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) treated by a
      pediatric provider in collaboration with a co-located psychologist/ADHD care manager
      available for evaluation/assessment and ongoing shared-care consultation to patients with
      ADHD in a pediatric primary care clinic treated as usual.

        1. Patients treated by the pediatricians with the added co-located services will have
           clinical outcomes that are superior to those that receive usual care

             1. Co-located services will increase the number of ADHD patients accessing specialized
                mental health treatment services

             2. A higher proportion of patients treated by the pediatric providers and
                psychologists than those in usual care receive doses of medication that are
                consistent with AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) recommendations

        2. Patients whose providers are offered to receive the aid of the co-located psychologists
           will be more likely to be co-managed by the pediatrician than referred out to the
           community.

        3. Parents will be more satisfied with care in the shared care model than in usual care

      B. Pediatricians' morale and attitudes to the treatment of ADHD will improve with the
      addition of a co-located psychologist.

      C. ADDITIONAL AIMS:

        1. To assist a pediatric primary care clinic in implementing a quality improvement
           initiative to help pediatric providers better identify ADHD by implementing the PSC-17,
           a general psychosocial checklist.

        2. Study the usefulness of using the PSC 17 screen as a clinical tool to identify ADHD in
           the primary care office by obtaining results and tracking physician disposition planning
           based on results.

      D. Operationalize Shared Care by examining what happens in such an arrangement, and see if
      patient recruitment and provider buy-in improves when shared care is assured.
