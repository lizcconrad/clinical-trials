  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single dose of Influenza
      Vaccines (0.5mL or 0.25mL) in healthy children aged up to 35 months or 36 up to 48 months. To
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 0.25mL IM of injection influenza vaccines in
      healthy children aged up to 35 months; to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      0.50mL IM injection of influenza vaccines in healthy children aged up to 48 months.

    <description>This phase II, observer-blind, parallel groups, single center, extension study will be performed over a period of approximately 6 months in a study population of healthy children up to 48 months of age.
Up to two hundred and forty-four children (244) having previously participated in Novartis Vaccines Study V70P2 will be vaccinated with the same influenza vaccines received in the previous trial.
Each subject will receive a single vaccine dose of 0.25mL, or of 0.5mL, if aged respectively up to 35 months or 36 up to 48 months, administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle, preferably of the non-dominant arm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children up to 48 months of age, who received both doses of one of the two study
             vaccines in the previous V70P2 trial, whose parents/legal guardians have given written
             informed consent prior to study entry,

          -  in good health as determined by:medical history, physical examination, clinical
             judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Experience of a severe acute infectious disease in the month prior to study start or
             experience of a mild acute infection disease in the week prior the study start;

          -  Any severe acute respiratory disease and infection requiring systemic antibiotic or
             antiviral therapy ongoing or resolved within 15 days prior to study start (chronic
             antibiotic therapy for urinary tract prophylaxis is acceptable);

          -  Fever (defined as axillary temperature ≥ 38.0°C/rectal temperature ≥ 38.5°C) within
             the 7 days before enrolment;

          -  Any serious disease including, for example:cancer,autoimmune disease (including
             rheumatoid arthritis),diabetes mellitus,chronic pulmonary disease,acute or progressive
             hepatic disease,acute or progressive renal disease;

          -  Known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, for example, resulting
             from:receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroid - except topical or inhaled
             steroids - or cancer chemotherapy),receipt of immunostimulants,receipt of parenteral
             immunoglobulin preparation, blood products, and/or plasma derivatives within the past
             3 months and for the full length of the study,high risk for developing an
             immunocompromising disease;

          -  Bleeding diathesis;

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any component of the study medication or chemically
             related substances;

          -  History of any anaphylaxis, serious vaccine reactions, or allergy to eggs, egg
             products or any other vaccine component;

          -  Laboratory confirmed influenza disease in the past 6 months;

          -  Surgery planned during the study period;

          -  Receipt of another investigational vaccine or any investigational agent within 30 days
             prior to study start. All routine vaccines should be given according to local
             recommendations: routine vaccines or any other vaccines not foreseen in the protocol
             can be given after the active trial phase (i.e. 4 weeks after last vaccination in the
             respective season) has been concluded;

          -  Participation to another trial of an investigational agent within 90 days of
             enrolment;

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the
             evaluation of the study objectives.
