  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle wasting is common in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and adversely affects
      morbidity and mortality. In 2/3 of males with advanced CKD serum testosterone (TT) levels are
      reduced, and likely contributes to the wasting. As TT in relatively safe physiologic
      replacement doses, increases muscle mass in otherwise normal TT deficient subjects, we
      hypothesize that physiologic TT replacement will be effective in preventing and treating the
      loss of muscle mass and function in CKD patients, will improve quality of life and may reduce
      some cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

        Inclusion Criteria:Inclusion criteria: CKD subjects; males with calculated GFR (MRDR
        equation) between 15 and 40 ml/min/1.73m2 and stable or slowly progressive renal failure
        (decline in function of &lt;1ml/min/month) including those patients requiring hemodialysis and
        serum testosterone levels of &lt;300 ng/ml and capable of safely performing required exercise
        testing and serum testosterone levels of &lt;300ng/ml and capable of safely performing
        required exercise testing.

        Control subjects; good health, normal serum creatinine levels, normal TT levels and able to
        perform required exercise testing safely. The racial and ethnic composition of the subjects
        will reflect the composition present in the ESRD population in the counties in Northern
        California from which our patients are referred. Subjects to be of age 45-80 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:Exclusion criteria: applicable to both CKD and control subjects. Any
        unstable chronic medical condition, previous kidney transplant. Uncontrolled diabetes
        mellitus, active vasculitis, active autoimmune disease, malignancy(&lt;5 yrs), obesity (BMI &gt;
        35), alcoholism or other recreational drug use, active heart disease, angina, uncontrolled
        arrhythmias or myocardial infarct within past 3 months, peripheral vascular disease with
        claudication, active lung, liver or GI disease, sleep apnea, medically unstable subjects
        and subjects who received anabolic, catabolic or cytotoxic medications during the prior 3
        months. History of prostate CA, PSA &gt;4g/ml, or advanced BPH (AUA symptom score &gt; 21) and
        abnormal prostate on digital rectal examination. Bone or joint abnormalities that would
        preclude exercise testing.
