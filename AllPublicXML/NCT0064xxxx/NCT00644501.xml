  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label extension study, offering patients who participated and completed
      previous study 901 to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and clinical follow-up, for 2
      additional years. The expectation is first to demonstrate that extended treatment with
      DiaPep277 is safe and second to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment. Only
      patients who completed the previous 2-year study and still have beta-cell function above a
      threshold level will be eligible for this extension study.
