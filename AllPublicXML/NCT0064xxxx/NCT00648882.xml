      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's levothyroxine
      sodium 300 mcg tablets to Abbott's Synthroid® 300 mcg tablets following a single, oral 600
      mcg dose (2 × 300 mcg) administered under fasting conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18-50 years.

          2. Sex: Men and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating women.

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum β human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy tests performed within 14 days prior to of the study
                  and on the evening prior to each dose administration. An additional serum (β HCG)
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. Oral
                  contraceptives are not to be used within 3 months prior to dosing and throughout
                  the course of the study due to the fact that they increase serum TBG
                  concentrations, and therefore, elevate T4. Acceptable forms of contraception
                  include the following:

                    1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the

                    2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    3. postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at
                       least one year or surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or
                       hysterectomy).

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women, and within 15%
             of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of &quot;Desirable Weights of
             Adults&quot; Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983 (See Part II Administrative Aspects
             of Bioequivalence Protocols).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal (euthyroid) and healthy during a prestudy medical
             evaluation (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, blood chemistry, serum T4
             (free and total), serum T3 (total only), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
             serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV test,
             12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiate screen, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 14 days of the initial dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used.

          2. Social Habits:

               3. Ingestion of any vitamins or herbal products within 7 days prior to the initial
                  dose of the study medication.

               4. Any recent, significant change in dietary or exercise habits.

               5. A positive test for any drug included in the urine drug screen.

             dose of study medication.

          8. Subjects who received any surgical treatment within 6 months prior to the initial dose
