  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is a common treatment for lung cancer. One Challenge of delivering radiation
      treatment to lung tumors accurately is tumor movement which occurs as a patient breathes. In
      some situations, tumors move enough during breathing so that some or all of the tumor may be
      missed by a radiation treatment. One way to decrease the amount a lung tumor moves during
      radiotherapy treatments is for patients to held their breath briefly during a radiation
      treatment. By doing this, a patient's lung tumor may not move as much as it would during
      regular breathing. In this study, the investigators aim to study patients with lung cancers
      which move during breathing. Patients will be asked to hold their breath after inspiration
      while a CT scan of their lung tumor is obtained. The purpose of this study is to study how
      much less patients' lung tumors move when they hold their breath
