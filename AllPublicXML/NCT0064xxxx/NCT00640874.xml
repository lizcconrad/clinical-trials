  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as
      short-term prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in people who have close familial
      contact with the disease. The study is observational only. The primary measure used in this
      study will be the incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving
      prophylaxis. Seroconversion to pandemic influenza, the incidence of adverse events and the
      relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis will also be examined. This
      project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia, Hong Kong or
      Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the continued use of
      neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency response to
      pandemic influenza.

      The aim of this study is to

        1. Describe the effectiveness of short-term prophylaxis against symptomatic pandemic
           influenza infection

        2. Describe the safety of short-term prophylaxis

        3. Describe the seroconversion rate against pandemic influenza among recipients of
           short-term prophylaxis

      The study is an open label prospective cohort study. Contact group members of people with
      diagnosed influenza who are recommended to receive NA inhibitor prophylaxis for short periods
      of time will be enrolled following provision of informed consent. Each episode of short-term
      prophylaxis will be recorded separately.

      By design it is hoped that volunteers in this study who develop symptoms and signs of
      pandemic influenza infection will be enrolled in the Index Case (PIPET A) protocol with
      follow-up as required.
