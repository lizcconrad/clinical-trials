    <textblock>
      Cervical paravertebral blocks (CPVBs) target the brachial plexus from a puncture site
      situated in the posterior aspect of the neck and represent an alternative to interscalene
      blocks (ISBs) for shoulder and proximal humeral surgery. Randomized controlled trials
      comparing CPVB and ISB have found no significant differences in success rate, onset and
      offset times. Because of the reliability of their cutaneous landmarks, CPVBs have become part
      of the investigators' standard practice. With this approach, the brachial approach can be
      identified either with loss of resistance to air (LOR) or nerve stimulation (NS). While some
      authors have used only LOR and reported good success rates, others have hypothesized that NS
      may increase the reliability of the block. In the proposed study, for the first time, the 2
      methods will be formally compared.
