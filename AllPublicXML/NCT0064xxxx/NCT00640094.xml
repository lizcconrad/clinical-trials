  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Experimental studies have documented the beneficial effects of the endogenously
      produced antioxidant, melatonin, in reducing tissue damage and limiting cardiac
      pathophysiology in models of experimental ischemia-reperfusion. Melatonin confers
      cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury most likely through its direct free
      radical scavenging activities and its indirect actions in stimulating antioxidant enzymes.
      These actions of melatonin permit it to reduce molecular damage and limit infarct size in
      experimental models of transient ischemia and subsequent reperfusion.

      Study design: The Melatonin Adjunct in the acute myocaRdial Infarction treated with
      Angioplasty (MARIA) trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      phase 2 study of the intravenous administration of melatonin. The primary efficacy end point
      of this study is to determine whether melatonin treatment reduces infarct size determined by
      cardiac magnetic resonance 5-7 days post-reperfusion. Other secondary end points will be the
      clinical events occurring within the first year: death, sustained ventricular arrhythmias,
      resuscitation from cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, major bleedings ,
      stroke, need for revascularization, recurrent ischemia, re-infarctions and rehospitalization;
      and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to 4 months of follow-up.

      Implications: The MARIA trial tests a novel pharmacologic agent, melatonin, in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction and the hypothesis that it will confer cardioprotection against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. If successful, the finding would support the use of melatonin in
      therapy of ischemic-reperfusion injury of the heart.
