  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial stiffness refers to the accumulation of extracellular deposits of matrix and calcium
      which reduce blood vessel compliance. Although there is growing evidence that increased
      arterial stiffness is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pathogenesis is
      unclear. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) provide tools for estimating
      arterial stiffness, and therefore predicting cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aims
      of the study are: (1) compare the effects of nocturnal and conventional haemodialysis on
      arterial stiffness, and (2) examine the relationship between arterial stiffness and clinical
      and biochemical parameters.
