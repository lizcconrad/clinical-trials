    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to determine and compare the minimum time required to achieve
      penile rigidity greater than or equal to 60% at the base of the penis that is sustained for
      at least 3 minutes measured by Rigiscan®, following visual sexual stimulation post dose of
      100 mg sildenafil citrate and 20 mg tadalafil in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).
