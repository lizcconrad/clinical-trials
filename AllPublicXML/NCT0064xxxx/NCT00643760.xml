    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether gabapentin enacarbil (XP13512/GSK1838262),
      hereafter referred to as GEn is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated
      with diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-response study of XP13512 compared with concurrent placebo control and LYRICA
      (pregabalin), in subjects with neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Three doses of XP13512
      (1200 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and 3600 mg/day) are being evaluated for the management of
      neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Approximately 392 subjects from 70 to 80 participating
      sites in the US will be randomized to receive either XP13512 at the above mentioned doses,
      placebo or pregabalin (300mg/day).

    <time_frame>Baseline and EOMT (representing the earliest date of Week 13 visit/withdrawal visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and EOMT values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (Baseline) and the earliest date of Week 13 visit/Withdrawal visit/last dose of study drug (EOMT). Participants used a hand-held diary to rate their API over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the Baseline score.</description>

    <description>Baseline and EOMT scores are the calculated means of the 24-hour average pain scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization and EOMT, respectively. Percent reduction from baseline was calculated as the [(EOMT score minus the baseline score)divided by the baseline score], multiplied by 100. The PI-NRS is an 11-point scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine) by which a participant assesses their 24-hour average pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Sustained improvement in the 24-hour average pain intensity score is defined as at least 2 consecutive days on which the 24-hour average pain intensity score is &gt;=2 points less than the mean 24-hour average pain intensity score at baseline. Time to onset is measured from baseline and was calculated as first day of event minus last day of baseline and is expressed in days. Baseline score is the calculated mean of the 24-hour average pain score for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 is a general health-related quality of life instrument consisting of 36 items with various response options (Yes/No, 5- to 6-point Likert scale). Summary scores are calculated for 8 domains and 2 components (physical and mental); where scores range from 0 to 100 (higher scores = better quality of life).

    <time_frame>Baseline and EOMT (representing the earliest date of Week 13 visit/withdrawal visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS-B, an emotional functioning instrument, assesses mood, tension, and other psychological symptoms and consists of 30-items assessed on a 5-point scale (0=not at all to 4=extremely). 6 summary scores are calculated: Tension/Anxiety, Depression/Rejection, Anger/Hostility, Vigor/Activity, Fatigue/Inertia, and Confusion/Bewilderment; and range from 0-20 (higher scores = more negative mood state). Analysis of this endpoint is based on the change from baseline (BL) (EOMT score minus the BL score) using an ANCOVA model with BL value, BMI, grouped center as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean 24-hour Average Pain Intensity (API) Score at End of Maintenance Treatment (EOMT) Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Data</title>
        <description>Baseline and EOMT values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (Baseline) and the earliest date of Week 13 visit/Withdrawal visit/last dose of study drug (EOMT). Participants used a hand-held diary to rate their API over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the Baseline score.</description>

          <description>Baseline and EOMT values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (Baseline) and the earliest date of Week 13 visit/Withdrawal visit/last dose of study drug (EOMT). Participants used a hand-held diary to rate their API over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <description>Current pain is defined as the participant's assessment of pain intensity &quot;right now.&quot; Participants recorded their current evening pain intensity in the evening before bedtime using an 11-point PI-NRS (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Baseline and EOMT are as defined for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the baseline score.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Dose of Rescue Medication at EOMT Using LOCF Data</title>
        <description>Mean daily use of rescue medication (milligrams of acetaminophen) was calculated by determining the average number of tablets taken per day of rescue medication (Commerical Tylenol) during treatment and multiplying that by 500 mg. Baseline and EOMT are as defined for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA model with baseline value, BMI, grouped center as covariates was used.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pain Score After Taking a 50-foot Walk at EOMT</title>
        <description>Baseline and EOMT scores are the pain scores each participant reported after taking a 50-foot walk at the randomization and Week 13/Withdrawal visits, respectively, using an 11-point PI-NRS (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA model with BMI, baseline pain intensity after 50-foot walk, pain intensity prior to 50-foot walk at the visit being assessed, and grouped center as covariates was used.</description>

Baseline score is the calculated mean of the 24-hour average pain score for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization.</description>

        <description>The BPI, a general pain instrument, assesses the severity and interference of pain; and consists of 6 items assessed on an 11-point NRS (0=no impact and 10=greatest impact). 2 summary scores are calculated: BPI Severity Score (average of first 4 items) and BPI Interference Score (average of 7 responses to item 6); where each summary score ranges from 0 to 10 (0=no impact and 10=greatest impact). Analysis of this endpoint is based on the change from baseline (BL) (EOMT score minus the BL score) using an ANCOVA model with BL value, BMI, grouped center as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at EOMT Using LOCF Data</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a general health-related quality of life instrument consisting of 36 items with various response options (Yes/No, 5- to 6-point Likert scale). Summary scores are calculated for 8 domains and 2 components (physical and mental); where scores range from 0 to 100 (higher scores = better quality of life). Analysis of this endpoint is based on the change from baseline (BL) (EOMT score minus the BL score) using an ANCOVA model with BL value, BMI, grouped center as covariates.</description>
