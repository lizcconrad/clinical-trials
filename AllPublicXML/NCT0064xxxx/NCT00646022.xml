      This study will evaluate members in families with a history of small bowel carcinoid cancer
      to study the natural history of those family members that have the disease, determine ways to
      improve early detection by performing surveillance on those at risk but without disease and
      to identify the gene(s) that may cause the tumors. Familial carcinoid tumors usually
      originate in hormone-producing cells that line the small intestine or other cells of the
      digestive tract. The tumors are slow-growing and usually take many years before they cause
      symptoms. It is known that these tumors occur more often in some families and are then passed
      from one generation to the next by inherited genes.

      Members of families, including all siblings and offspring in which two or more immediate
      blood relatives have had small bowel carcinoid tumors are eligible for this study. In some
      cases unaffected spouses of family members diagnosed with carcinoid cancer are also requested
      to participate by donating a sample of blood only.

      Participants undergo a medical evaluation every 3 years during a 3- to 5-day hospital stay at
      the NIH Clinical Center. All participants have a personal and family medical history obtained
      and undergo a physical examination, blood and urine tests.

      People who already have a small bowel carcinoid tumor or are at risk of developing a
      carcinoid tumor have some or all of the following procedures to determine the presence of
      carcinoid tumor and its (omit next two words- location or) spread to other areas of the body:

        -  Video Capsule Endoscopy: Visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by ingesting a
           disposable, &quot;vitamin-pill sized&quot; video capsule that has its own camera and light source.

        -  CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast : X-ray examination of the
           chest, abdominal and pelvis organs.

        -  18 FDOPA Positron emission tomography (PET) with CT for localization: Nuclear imaging
           scan to look at tumor activity.

        -  MRI Liver with contrast - to determine if disease has spread to liver

        -  Gallium 68 PET/CT-limited to individuals that have residual tumor.

        -  Clinical and research blood work

      Should mid gut carcinoid tumors be found every participant will be assisted in determine what
      the best course of treatment will be for them.

    <textblock>
      Carcinoid tumors are rare. In early stage disease they may cause either no or few nonspecific
      symptoms. Therefore, patients with carcinoid tumors most often present late in the course of
      their illness when there is already progression to an incurable state as a result of
      metastatic disease. At present there are neither practical population screening tests nor
      effective therapies and hence the 5 year survival rate is low. Due to the rareness of
      sporadic carcinoid tumors, large scale genetic analysis and development of sensitive and
      specific diagnostic tests have not been successful. While kindreds with familial carcinoid
      tumors that are not ascribable to known genetic syndromes are exceedingly rare, they provide
      a unique opportunity to facilitate the identification of the responsible gene mutation. In
      addition, the mutated gene in the rare familial form may also underlie the origin of the more
      common sporadic occurrence of carcinoid tumors. We propose to study families in which there
      are at least two known affected members with carcinoid tumors. We aim to diagnose patients
      with early and therefore potentially curable occult disease. Therefore, family members who
      have up to a 50% lifetime risk of harboring a carcinoid tumor will undergo an intensive
      diagnostic evaluation using biochemical, endoscopic and imaging modalities at initial and
      subsequent two year follow up encounters. Early phenotypic assignment of affected family
      members and collection of germline and tumoral DNA from multiple kindreds should also
      facilitate the genetic analysis leading to the identity of the disease gene. Evaluation of
      affected family members at varying stages of disease will contribute to our understanding of
      the natural history of carcinoid tumors and the relative utility of a variety of diagnostic
      and surveillance tests. Hopefully, such knowledge gained will also be applicable to patients
      with carcinoid tumors occurring sporadically or in the setting of other familial cancer
      syndromes. There is no planned treatment for patients with existing or newly diagnosed
      primary or metastatic carcinoid tumors. However, these patients may be evaluated by
      consultation with oncology and surgery for potential treatment on their service under their
      preexisting protocols.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Adult patients who a) have a present diagnosis of small intestinal carcinoid
                  tumor and have at least one blood relation with an immediate or distant family
                  member with a documented diagnosis of either small intestinal, pulmonary, kidney
                  or gastropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor or metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of
                  unknown primary b) do not have a diagnosis of small intestinal carcinoid tumor
                  and have at least two immediate or distant family members with documented
                  diagnoses of either small intestinal, pulmonary kidney, gastropancreatic
                  neuroendocrine tumor or metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary or c)
                  patients who have multiple synchronous primary small intestinal tumors without a
                  known relative with a neuroendocrine tumor of any type. This includes family
                  members of patients with carcinoid tumors even if the patients with tumors are
                  unwilling to participate so long as we have appropriate documentation confirming
                  the diagnosis of the carcinoid tumors in the affected family members. Adult
                  patients who are unable to provide informed consent but whose wishes suggest they
                  are willing to donate samples for research purposes will be considered for study
                  enrollment.

               2. Unaffected spouses of patients with a carcinoid tumor and who have children.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Families with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I, MEN II or other familial tumor
             syndromes such as Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome and Neurofibomatosis for which there is a
             known genetic predisposition to non-carcinoid tumors as well as carcinoid tumors will
             be excluded from the study.

          2. Pregnancy, breastfeeding.

          3. Anticoagulation, seizures, severe systemic disease of any sort, advanced metastatic
             carcinoid may be relative exclusion criteria prohibiting a full evaluation as
             described above under protocol design. However, these medical conditions should not
             absolutely exclude participation in the protocol. Participation in each protocol
             delineated evaluation procedure will be judged on a case by case basis with patient
             safety as the paramount consideration.
