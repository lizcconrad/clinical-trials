    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of sildenafil versus placebo on the female partner's sexual
      satisfaction as assessed by Question 3 of Female Partner of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Subject
      Questionnaire (FePEDS-Q): &quot;Over the past 4 weeks, when you had sexual intercourse, how often
      was it satisfactory for you?&quot; For ED subjects, determine difference in the Erectile Function
      domain of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) between sildenafil citrate and
      placebo at end of the treatment phase and determine the overall relationship between improved
      erectile function and increased ED subject and female partner satisfaction.
