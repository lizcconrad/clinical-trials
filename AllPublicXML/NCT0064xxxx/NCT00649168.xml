        healthy subjects with clinically normal laboratory profiles and 12-lead ECG Females of
        childbearing potential should either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to

        to dosing in each period Subjects whose sitting blood pressure is more than 140/90 mmHg at
        screening or prior to dosing in each period Subjects whose pulse is lower than 55 b.p.m. at
        screening or 50 b.p.m. prior to dosing in each period Female subjects who are pregnant or
