  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of the complex genetics of brain development will be undertaken with an emphasis on
      those genes that cause the most common structural brain anomaly in humans called
      holoprosencephaly (HPE). This malformation of the brain can result from either environmental
      or genetic causes, and it is the aim of these investigations to determine the genes
      responsible for both normal and abnormal brain development through the study of patients with
      this disorder. Mutations in one such gene, Sonic Hedgehog, have been shown by us to be
      responsible for approximately one quarter of familial cases of HPE. Other genes either
      related to the hedgehog pathway or located at unrelated defined genetic loci may also
      contribute to HPE and are the subject of active investigation. We anticipate that many genes
      important for normal brain development will be identified in the search for genetic causes of
      HPE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Holoprosencephaly (HPE) covers a nearly continuous spectrum of midline abnormalities ranging
      from unmistakable cyclopia with absence of forebrain separation to mild microforms, such a
      single central incisor.

      The objective of these studies is to identify genetic factors (coding and non-coding) that
      contribute to the pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly (HPE) or related brain malformations. Our
      approach involves common genetic strategies including mutational analysis of candidate genes.
      All individuals with overt or subtle clinical findings consistent with the HPE spectrum are
      eligible to participate. Mutational analysis of our entire coded collection of HPE probands
      (approximately 600 cases) in selected genes is the principal research method used to
      determine that a given candidate gene is commonly mutated in HPE. This approach pertains to
      an individual gene(s) or genetic element(s) as well as to targeted capture panels that study
      gene sets of hundreds of developmental genes whose involvement in brain development is
      supported by the basic research literature. We are also asking to include the option of
      investigating the entire set of genetic factors present in the DNA or RNA of patients who
      have HPE through a proposed change in the consent documents. Whenever a sequence variant is
      identified, that is not present in a commercially available control set of samples, attempts
      are made to test the functional significance of this change on the protein itself, or its
      expression. Sequence changes with a strong probability of being medically significant will be
      verified in a CLIA-approved lab (e.g. Muneke lab, for selected genes, or GeneDx) at our
      expense, before any results are given to the family through genetic counseling. Parental DNA
      (and rarely that of siblings) is usually obtained at the same time that a proband is
      enrolled. Typically, these samples are studied only to perform limited family studies once a
      sequence variant of potential medical significance has already been determined. Participation
      by direct blood relatives is encouraged since virtually all bone fide mutations are either
      family-specific or de novo. Such family information is critical for the research
      determination of genetic risk factors and accurate genetic counseling.

      The majority of subjects enrolled in this study will continue under the care of their local
      physician or genetic counselor with limited contact with the NIH investigators. Only rarely
      will families be seen at the NIH CC. These visits will involve face-to-face genetic
      counseling of medically significant results, following verification in a CLIA approved lab.
      This is not a treatment protocol. Our empiric ability to generate medically significant
      research results is limited by the extensive genetic and other etiologic heterogeneity.
      Therefore, for most participants this research is not a diagnostic study.

      We have modified our procedures to test all new probands for mutations in the four HPE genes
      (SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF). As new genetic elements that confer a risk for HPE are
      identified, we intend to add additional tests to this panel. Our lab is now certified to
      receive and test new samples according to CLIA guidelines. However, all previously collected
      samples will not be considered suitable for diagnostic purposes; hence, a second sample will
      need to be requested in these cases for CLIA confirmation.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. This research is open to all participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of
                  HPE or related brain malformations. Since the range of severity of HPE is
                  extensive, we accept cases compatible with a wide HPE spectrum of findings. All
                  races and genders are known to be at risk for HPE, anywhere in the world.
                  Nationality or place of origin are not specific barriers to participation,
                  provided that a blood tissue sample can be safely sent by international FedEx (to
                  be billed to our account).

               2. Direct blood relatives (typically parents, and occasionally siblings of affected
                  individuals) of patients with HPE are also eligible to participate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf
             of their children as minors) or assent.

          2. Medical condition(s) or mental retardation are not in themselves reason for exclusion
             if in the judgement of the referring physician this would involve no more than minimal
             risk. We anticipate that children with mental handicaps would be included in the
             research population. We will make every effort to explain the study for the purpose of
             assent in a matter that the family feels is both age and developmentally appropriate
             for that child.

          3. We generally review a brief clinical description from the referring physician about a
             potential research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into
             the study. We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not HPE or related
             to our direct research interests (e.g. HPE cases due to Trisomy 13 or 18 might not be
             considered directly related to current research). This almost never happens, and we
             would attempt to make referrals to a more appropriate investigator before a sample is
             sent to the NIH. Although not desirable, we will accept samples with a suspected
             diagnosis of HPE where this determination was made by the referring physician
             independent of any input from our HPE team. In such circumstances, we would likely
             verify by correspondence that a sample had been received and request further
             information.
