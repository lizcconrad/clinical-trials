        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychotic disorder

          -  Completion of previous study of intramuscular ziprasidone

          -  Ability to continue with oral ziprasidone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant treatment with other anti-psychotic agents within 12 hours prior to the
             enrollment; for depot agents, a period of two weeks or a cycle, whichever is longer,
             should occur between the last administration and the patient's enrollment.

          -  Treatment with antidepressants or mood stabilizers within seven days prior to the
             enrollment; for MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and moclobemide, this period
             should be of two weeks; for fluoxetine, five weeks.

          -  Resistance to conventional psychotic agents. (Resistance is defined as a failure to
             present a therapeutic response during the acute exacerbation after proper attempts of
             treatment with marketed antipsychotic agents in two or more occasions during the two
             years prior to the enrollment in the study.)
