  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the investigators clinical experience in patients with chronic disease (Hui, Hui,
      and Johnston, 2006; Hays et al 2005), a review of the literature (Johnston, Xiao and Hui
      2007), and inspired by Vickers and colleagues (PMID: 15117996), the investigators carry out a
      pilot study that investigates if acupuncture combined with patient education will relieve
      fatigue in patients who have completed primary treatment for breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Our hypothesis is that patients
      in the acupuncture/education group will experience greater relief of fatigue than those in
      the standard care group.

    <description>Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles, much thinner than those used for drawing blood, into very specific acupuncture points. Patients will receive a total of 8 acupuncture treatments, each lasting 50 minutes. Patient education will be delivered to individuals over the course of approximately 50 minutes for each of the four sessions; topics will include acupressure, nutrition, exercise, stress management, and lifestyle advice.</description>
