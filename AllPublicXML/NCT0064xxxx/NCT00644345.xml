  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvolt T-Wave Alternans (MTWA) is a relatively new non-invasive method for identifying
      patients at increased risk of sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias. MTWA can be measured
      during a routine exercise test, during pharmacologic stress or during cardiac pacing. Its
      clinical performance compares favorably with that of other non-invasive risk stratifiers and
      invasive electophysiologic studies. The purpose of the present study is to define the
      reproducibility of MTWA testing.

      The study will be performed in the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center at Assaf Harofeh Medical
      Center. Patients with coronary artery disease will be eligible to enroll.

      Patient will undergo an exercise test on a stationary bicycle. TWA will be measured at heart
      rate of 105 and 115 BPM. The test will be repeated one week later in the same fashion. The
      patient will continue follow-up in the rehabilitation center as dictated by the
      rehabilitation program. Patients will be kept on their regular medications and there will be
      no change of the medications from the first TWA measurement to the second.
