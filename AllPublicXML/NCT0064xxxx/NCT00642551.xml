  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From all K-vitamins, menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has been identified now as the most effective
      cofactor for the carboxylation reaction of Gla-proteins such as osteocalcin (in bone) and
      matrix-Gla protein (in the arterial vessel wall). The question remains whether
      supplementation with MK-7 also leads to measurable improvements of bone and vascular health.
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that MK-7 has a health benefit in apparently
      healthy postmenopausal women. In a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial the effect of
      an MK-7- supplement will be monitored during three years on bone quantity and quality and on
      vascular characteristics and function.
