          <title>Number of Participants With MAs in Hematology: Neutrophils + Bands (Absolute), Lymphocytes (Absolute), Monocytes (Absolute), Basophils (Absolute) and Eosinophils (Absolute)</title>
          <description>MAs are laboratory measurements marked as abnormal, per pre-defined study criteria, at any study time point. The following hematology MA definitions specify the criteria for the data presented. Neutrophils+bands (absolute): &lt;=1.50 x 10^3 cells/microliter (uL). Lymphocytes (absolute): &lt;0.75 x 10^3 cells/uL or &gt;7.50 x 10^3 cells/uL. Monocytes (absolute): &gt;2.00 x 10^3 cells/uL. Basophils (absolute): &gt;0.40 x 10^3 cells/uL. Eosinophils (absolute): &gt;0.75 x 10^3 cells/uL.</description>
          <population>All treated participants. If a value had &quot;not evaluable&quot; in the dataset, then these participants were not counted(neutrophils + bands [absolute], monocytes [absolute], basophils [absolute] and eosinophils [absolute]).</population>

Study treatment was given in the morning within 5 minutes of completing a light meal. Participants were admitted to the clinical facility the evening prior to dosing (Day -1) and remained confined for the duration of the study.</description>
