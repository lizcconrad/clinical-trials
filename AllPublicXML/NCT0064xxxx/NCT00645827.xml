  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin infusions are commonly used in hospitalized diabetics to control blood sugar, and
      they are effective. However, insulin infusions require the use of limited resources. Insulin
      infusions are therefore changed to insulin shots as a patient recovers. Once an insulin
      infusion is stopped and shots are started, blood sugar control is harder to maintain. This
      is, in part, because physicians have different ideas on how to dose insulin shots in
      hospitalized patients. A math equation has been developed by the research staff that attempts
      to predict the effective doses of insulin shots in patients whose insulin infusion have just
      been stopped. The math equation was developed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In
      this study, all patients will be treated with the same type of insulin shots, with doses of
      the insulin shots chosen either by the math equation or by the judgment of the patient's
      physician. The study will then follow blood sugar values for 24 hours to see if the math
      equation is effective. If the equation is proven to be effective, a new tool will exist for
      physicians to determine the best dose of insulin shots for type 2 diabetics. Such a tool
      would, in turn, allow for widespread use of insulin infusions to determine a patient's
      insulin needs before discharge from the hospital. Blood sugar control for type 2 diabetics
      that are inpatient or outpatient would improve as a result, with potentially far reaching
      public health benefits.

    <description>Subcutaneous insulin was dosed according to an equation (too long for publication here) which gives the patient's 24 hour SC insulin requirement. If patient was eating, 65% of equation result was given as insulin glargine SC qHS and 35% of equation result was divided evenly between three qAC doses of insulin aspart. If patient was not eating, 100% of ISC was given as insulin glargine. If IV insulin was stopped between 7 AM and 3 PM, 1/2 to 1/3 of scheduled insulin glargine dose was given as a one time insulin NPH SC dose at time of IV insulin cessation. Correctional insulin was given as follows: For BG ≥ 150 mg/dL, (BG-100)/X units insulin aspart SC, X = 1500 / (scheduled glargine dose + [3 x scheduled aspart dose]). For BG &lt; 70 mg/dL, ½ ampule D50W IV x1 was given.</description>

            <title>Insulin Infusion Conversion Equation</title>
            <description>Insulin infusion conversion equation is used to determine subcutaneous insulin dosing for first 24 hours after cessation of an IV insulin infusion.
IICE Dosing: Subcutaneous insulin was dosed according to an equation (too long for publication here) which gives the patient's 24 hour SC insulin requirement. If patient was eating, 65% of equation result was given as insulin glargine SC qHS and 35% of equation result was divided evenly between three qAC doses of insulin aspart. If patient was not eating, 100% of ISC was given as insulin glargine. If IV insulin was stopped between 7 AM and 3 PM, 1/2 to 1/3 of scheduled insulin glargine dose was given as a one time insulin NPH SC dose at time of IV insulin cessation. Correctional insulin was given as follows: For BG ≥ 150 mg/dL, (BG-100)/X units insulin aspart SC, X = 1500 / (scheduled glargine dose + [3 x scheduled aspart dose]). For BG &lt; 70 mg/dL, ½ ampule D50W IV x1 was given.</description>
