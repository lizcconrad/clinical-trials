  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if alternating chemotherapy with erlotinib increases
      tumor shrinkage in people with metastatic colorectal cancer. The investigator will also be
      studying the side effects (good and bad) of alternating chemotherapy with erlotinib on
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rates of Radiographically Measurable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease response assessed after every 2 Treatment Cycles, or around 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the response rates of radiographically measurable disease. Response rate of disease will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Second-line Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon completion of follow-up, for an average of 99 days following the initiation of study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression from start of second-line experimental regimen. Disease progression will be measured per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Second Progression (From Start of First-Line Regimen)</measure>
    <time_frame>Documented by Follow-up CT scans following first line treatment, average of 225 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days from the initiation of first line treatment to first documented progression. Progression will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.
Progression free survival (time to progression or death, whichever occurs first) is the same as time to progression as all of the patients in this trial progressed.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Patients were stratified according to whether they had received 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin with Oxaliplatin or Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Irinotecan for their 1st line treatment. Whichever they had not received in the 1st line setting, they received on trial. 16 patients signed consent. 2 patients withdrew, 3 ineligible, and 1 unevaluable.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The primary outcome measure will be the response rates of radiographically measurable disease. Response rate of disease will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease response assessed after every 2 Treatment Cycles, or around 8 weeks.</time_frame>
        <population>Patients who were considered for analysis were those who received treatment in a manner consistent with the protocol, as determined by the investigator.</population>
