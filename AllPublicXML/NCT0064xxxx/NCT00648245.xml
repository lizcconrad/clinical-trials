  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The symptoms associated with COPD include overproduction of mucus and inflammation in the
      lungs. Overproduction of mucus results in impaired lung function and it encourages bacterial
      growth and associated COPD exacerbations. Therefore, a treatment that inhibits mucus
      overproduction or blocks inflammation could benefit COPD patients. The drug under evaluation
      in this study, BIO-11006 Inhalation Solution, is a new drug that may inhibit overproduction
      of mucus and may have important anti-inflammatory properties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD encompasses a number of chronic lung disorders that obstruct the airways and may be
      accompanied by airway hyperactivity. The most common form of COPD is a combination of chronic
      bronchitis and emphysema. Many of the signs and symptoms associated with chronic bronchitis
      are a result of airway mucus hypersecretion induced by chronic inflammation of the airways.
      Clinically, mucus hypersecretion results in impaired gas exchange and compromised mucociliary
      clearance, encouraging bacterial colonization and associated exacerbations. A treatment that
      inhibits mucus hypersecretion or blocks inflammation could benefit COPD patients with chronic
      bronchitis. The drug under evaluation in this study, BIO 11006, is a new therapeutic agent
      that may inhibit mucus secretion and may have important anti inflammatory properties. In this
      study, BIO-11006 will be administered to COPD patients with chronic bronchitis, and the
      effects lung function will be assessed.
