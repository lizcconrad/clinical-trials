    <textblock>
      Tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets (ULTRACET®) were effective and safe as addon
      therapy with COX-2 NSAID for treatment of osteoarthritis (5) and chronic low back pain
      (6).There is no clinical trial regarding tramadol usage in chronic inflammatory arthritis
      such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ankylosing spondylitis. It would be important to do a
      pilot clinical trial on add-on effect of tramadol to NSAID in patients with AS or RA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis causing back pain, peripheral
      arthritis and enthesitis due to genetic background and autoimmunity. Patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis usually suffered from chronic pain over spine and peripheral joints since their
      second or third decades. It may also cause severe social and psychological burden to patients
      and their family.

      Exercise and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the standard first-line
      treatments for AS（1）. Only 50% of patients with AS reach the ASAS response criteria（2） in
      clinical trials. Patients with severe disease activity should be put on disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), such as sulfasalazine（3） and anti-TNF biological agents. Add-on
      of acetaminophen and low dose anti-depressant （4）can slightly improve the response rate.
      However, there is no data if tramadol or ultracet can benefit AS.
