    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to obtain the current status of patients with
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia. This study is also expected to further
      provide insight into the evolution of behavioral and psychotic symptoms and its relationship
      with treatment as well as severity of cognitive declines in a naturalistic setting.

      This is an observational, prospective, multi-center study to obtain information about the
      symptoms and treatment received for patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of
      dementia (BPSD). Patients must first meet eligibility criteria and sign informed consent.
      Patient treatment will be based upon investigator opinion. The following parameters will be
      assessed: patient's characteristics, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score, Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory (NPI), and Minimal Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Each patient will be observed
      for 12 weeks. Medication dosing regimen will be flexible throughout the study and is based on
      patient response and investigator judgment. During the study observation period, all patients
      will attend clinic visits for the subsequent 12 weeks (visit 2 to 3) as is the usual clinical
      practice. Patients can visit clinics on additional dates as needed or by request. At the
      pre-planned clinic visits, CGI score, NPI, vital signs, reports of adverse events, drug
      information, and MMSE score (visit 3) will be recorded. This is an observational study and no
      study drug is administered.
