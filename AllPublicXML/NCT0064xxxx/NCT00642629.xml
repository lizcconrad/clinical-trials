  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not fully clear how rheumatoid arthritis originates and develops, but it is understood
      that multiple genetic and environmental factors interact to trigger its onset. The immune
      system attacks the joint synovium, which damages the cartilage and bone in the joint by
      increasing the number of inflammatory cells and forming new blood vessels in the joint space.
      STA-5326 mesylate inhibits the production of IL-12 and IL-23 and therefore may inhibit Th-1
      cytokine production. A reduction in the Th-1 response has the potential to minimize or
      eliminate joint damage caused by the immune response in rheumatoid arthritis. This study is
      designed to assess whether the proposed mechanism of action is associated with a reduction in
      inflammation in the synovium of patients who have rheumatoid arthritis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female 18 years of age or older.

          -  Has a diagnosis of RA in conformance with the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
             criteria for at least 6 months.

          -  Has at least one knee, wrist, or ankle that has active synovitis and is amenable to
             arthroscopic procedures for the acquisition of synovial tissue via biopsy.

          -  Must be taking methotrexate for a minimum of 4 months prior to Day 1, with a stable
             dose regimen for at least 2 months, and

          -  have plans to remain on the stable dose regimen of methotrexate for the duration of
             this study.

          -  If female of childbearing potential, must be neither pregnant nor breast feeding, and

          -  must have a negative pregnancy test (serum β-hCG) within 1 week of Day 1. Must be
             willing to use &quot;double-barrier&quot; contraception methods for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is taking any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) other than MTX
             concomitantly or within 1 month prior to Day 1.

          -  A positive (≥10 mm) tuberculin (PPD) skin test, unless the patient has had prior BCG
             immunization or has received prior suppressive treatment such as 1 year of INH.

          -  Has received any investigational drug or experimental procedure for the treatment of
             RA within 3 months of Day 1 for a biologic compound or within 1 month of Day 1 for a
             non-biologic compound.

          -  Has any clinically significant disease (e.g., renal, hepatic, neurological,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, psychiatric, hematologic, urologic, or other
             acute or chronic illness) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the
             patient an unsuitable candidate for this trial.
