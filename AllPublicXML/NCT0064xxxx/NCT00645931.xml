  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the psychological effects of bone marrow transplants on
      children and their families. The investigators hypothesis is that families who show signs of
      psychological distress before transplant will continue those signs post transplant. The
      investigators are examining cognitive placement, emotional placement and other psychological
      factors in both the child undergoing transplant and his or her parent.

      Previous research on bone marrow transplants has conflicting results concerning the effects
      of maladjustment. The current research is conducted in consortium with DeVos Children's
      Hospital. Children receiving bone marrow transplants are assessed using the Child Behavior
      Check List (CBCL) and Cognitive based testing. Parents are assessed using the Parenting
      Stress Index (PSI). Children and parents are evaluated prior to transplant and then 50 days,
      6 months, and one year post transplant. Descriptive statistics are currently being used to
      determine results.
