  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a way to learn the hormone receptor status of a tumor
      before surgery is done. By testing for the hormone receptor proteins, doctors can find out if
      the breast cancer uses hormones to grow. This is important since the hormone receptor status
      of a tumor helps doctors decide if extra treatment like chemotherapy or pills are needed.

    <intervention_name>PET scan with injection of 5-8 mCi of 18FES</intervention_name>
    <description>Following injection of the tracer 18FES, dynamic images will be obtained for 30 minutes over the chest area to include cardiac region and breasts. Following the first dynamic imaging for 30 minutes, whole body images (base of skull to pelvis) will be obtained at 5 minute/bed position. An additional, longer scan after 60 minutes will be obtained for the chest (1-2-FOV for 15 minutes each). Total time from injection to completion of imaging will be about 90 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female patients

          -  Aged 18 or older at the time of breast cancer diagnosis

          -  Patients with invasive breast cancer at least 1 cm in size. Patients who have had a
             prior surgical excision are eligible provided there is a residual of at least a 1 cm
             area suspected on imaging studies.

          -  Histopathologic review at MSKCC confirming diagnosis of invasive breast cancer
             (ductal, lobular, or inflammatory breast cancer).

          -  Patients who are operative candidates. Patient will have surgery to include either
             mastectomy or lumpectomy. Radiologic assisted excisions such as needle localization
             are also eligible.

          -  Patients with bilateral breast cancer are eligible.

          -  Patients with metastatic cancer, provided they need surgical biopsy.

          -  Patients who are undergoing sentinel node mapping (day before or sameday mapping).

          -  Patient must sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or concurrent malignancy (except basal and squamous skin cancer and stage 0
             cervical cancer)

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Patients unable to tolerate PET or PET/CT

          -  Patients with known active infection, autoimmune or inflammatory disease such as
             sarcoidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Patients with non invasive breast cancer such as DCIS.

          -  Patients who have received prior radiation therapy to the affected breast.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy or
             hormonal therapy for breast cancer.

          -  Patients living in a residential care or correctional facility.
