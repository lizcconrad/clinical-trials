  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Snoring is a problem for many people, often disturbing energy level, quality of sleep, and
      the relationship with a bed partner. Two observational studies that have indicated a
      relationship between the consumption of caffeine and snoring. The objective of this study
      will be to observe the degree of snoring and quality of sleep when caffeine intake is reduced
      over a period of four weeks. This will be a prospective, before-and-after study of a
      behavioral intervention.

      This study will engage thirty adults who report snoring, drink two cups of coffee or more per
      day (or an equivalent amount of caffeine), and have a consistent bed partner who can report
      on snoring severity. Both subject and partner will be asked to fill out a diary each day. The
      subjects will record the type of caffeine consumed, time at which each beverage was ingested,
      the total minutes of physical exercise, any caffeine withdrawal symptoms, quality of sleep,
      and energy in the morning. The partner (reporter) will rate his or her own sleep quality and
      energy in the morning, as well as the snoring level of the subject. Beginning the second week
      of the study, the subject will reduce caffeine intake to half the baseline consumption, and
      on the third week, will eliminate caffeine altogether.

      At the end of each week, the participants will be asked to mail their diaries in to the
      researchers and start a new series of entries. The study team will also call each week to
      answer any questions or concerns of the subject and reporter, and encourage continued
      reporting. When six weeks have elapsed following the completion of the last diary, the
      investigators will make a final call to the participants to record their current level of
      snoring, quality of sleep, and daily energy level.
