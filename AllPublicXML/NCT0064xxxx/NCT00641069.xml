  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of use of automated chest compression device on blood pressure in
      patients presenting with cardiac arrest. Higher systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures
      are expected.

      The protocol compares arterial pressures produced by an automated self-adjusting
      load-distributing band device (AutoPulse™ 100, Zoll®) with those of manual cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Each patient will receive first
      manual compressions and then automated resuscitation.

      Patients presenting with cardiac arrest are treated following standard advanced life support
      guidelines. They are intubated and ventilated, received epinephrine and defibrillation if
      appropriate. Manuel chest compressions are continued. An arterial catheter is placed to
      monitor hemodynamics continuously as we usually do in this case. Patients are included at
      this stage. Three blood pressure values (every 1 minutes) are recorded. Then, the automated
      band device is started up without any pause, following our procedure for refractory cardiac
      arrest. Three blood pressure values are recorded again, during automated cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation.
