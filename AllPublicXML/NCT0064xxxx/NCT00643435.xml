  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient self-efficacy, or confidence in one's ability to take the necessary steps to achieve
      a goal, has been shown to influence a number of important health behaviors and outcomes.
      However, current ways of increasing patient self-efficacy are time and labor intensive and
      occur away from doctor visits, where most health care is delivered. We developed, and are
      testing in a study the effectiveness of a new way of teaching doctors how to talk to patients
      during office visits in a way that will boost their patients' self-efficacy for changing
      important health behaviors.
