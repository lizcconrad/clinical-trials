  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous study substituting zidovudine or stavudine to abacavir in patients with severe or
      moderate lipoatrophy has shown an increase in limb fat by DEXA. This study was conducted over
      a 24-week period and although improved outcomes were documented by objective measures, DEXA
      scans, subjective observation did not correspond. Longer-term follow up of these patients is
      required.

      This 48 week study is designed to compare the substitution of the thymidine analogues
      zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (D4T) with either tenofovir DF or abacavir, in patients treated
      with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and show improved outcomes on total limb
      fat mass, improved body shape by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed
      tomography (CT) scans and improved cholesterol and triglycerides.

      This is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, randomised, two-arm study of 48 weeks duration.
      One hundred HIV infected individuals who have documented lipodystrophy at &gt; 1 body/facial
      site and currently receiving zidovudine (ZDV) or stavudine (d4T) will be recruited.
