  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage is a major complication in esophageal surgery. Although contrast swallow
      is the current standard to exclude anastomotic leakage postoperatively, endoscopy may be
      superior. This is the first study to compare radiographic contrast study and endoscopy for
      the identification of local complications after subtotal esophagectomy.

      This prospective, blinded, intraindividual controlled study will be conducted with patients
      with transthoracic esophagectomy due to esophageal cancer. A radiographic contrast study will
      be performed prior to endoscopy at the 5th to 7th postoperative day. The investigators will
      not be aware of the results of the corresponding examination. Sensitivity, specificity and
      feasibility of the radiologic and endoscopic evaluation of the esophageal substitute will be
      compared.
