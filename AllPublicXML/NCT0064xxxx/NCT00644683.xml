  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premenopausal women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are frequently treated with
      chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can affect the ovaries, and the effects can range from temporary
      loss of menstrual periods to permanent menopause. It is difficult to predict how an
      individual's ovarian function will be affected by chemotherapy. There are a number of
      hormones which can be measured in the blood which are related to fertility and ovarian
      function. The levels of these hormones may change with chemotherapy, and may relate to the
      effect of chemotherapy on the ovaries.

      In this study, we plan to enroll 28 women ranging in age from 25 to 50 who are diagnosed with
      breast cancer and will be treated with chemotherapy. We will check blood levels of the
      hormones before, immediately after, and 1 year after treatment with chemotherapy. We will
      only be checking these blood tests for this study; the type of chemotherapy given will be up
      to the patient and her oncologist. We will also ask some questions about factors that can
      influence the levels of these hormones, such as number of children, age of menopause of other
      family members, and smoking history. The results from this study will be used to help us
      develop future studies looking at changes in ovarian function with chemotherapy, and the
      effects of other breast cancer therapies, such as endocrine therapy, on the ovaries.

    <description>To generate estimates of serum concentrations of inhibin A, inhibin B, and anti-Mullerian hormone in premenopausal breast cancer patients (25-50 years of age) before, immediately after, and 1 year following completion of chemotherapy.
Hypothesis: Serum concentrations of hormones involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone, inhibin A, inhibin B, and follicle stimulating hormone) are detectable in the serum of all premenopausal women prior to chemotherapy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>serum concentrations of reproductive hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To determine serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (estradiol and its metabolites) before, immediately after, and 1 year following completion of chemotherapy using standard estradiol assays, and compare these results to those obtained using metabolomics.
Hypothesis: Serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (estradiol and its metabolites) will be detectable in all premenopausal women before chemotherapy, and will decrease immediately after chemotherapy in a considerable subset of patients. In addition, metabolomics will provide the same information about the presence or absence of estrogens, and will also provide additional data about other compounds present in the serum.

        premenopausal women with invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast between the ages of 25 and
        50.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be women with a histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the
             breast (stage I, II, or III) with no evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Patients must be planning to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients
             may receive concurrent trastuzumab as indicated. If a patient has not yet undergone
             final surgical resection, it must be highly likely (but is not required to be
             definite) that the patient will be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have:

               -  Reached their 25th birthday and not yet reached their 51st birthday at the time
                  of study enrollment, AND

               -  Had menses within 3 months prior to starting chemotherapy

          -  Patients must not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for any oncologic,
             rheumatologic, or dermatologic condition.

          -  Patients must not have had prior bilateral oophorectomy or pelvic radiation, and must
             not have had prior hysterectomy

          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of reproductive potential must
             agree to use an effective non-hormonal contraceptive method, such as condoms, tubal
             ligation, non-hormonal intrauterine device, partner sterilization, and abstinence
             during chemotherapy.

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and given
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.
