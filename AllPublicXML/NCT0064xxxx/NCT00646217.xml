    <textblock>
      Most stroke survivors return home, where their care is supported by family and friends.
      Although family caring at home is usually rewarding, it is often challenging, too. The
      demands and responsibilities of caring for a loved one at home can be stressful. The actual
      activities of caregiving vary according to the needs of the stroke survivor, but can include
      helping with bathing, dressing, eating, and many other activities. Caregivers must learn care
      techniques and how to manage changes in roles and lifestyle. While adjusting to these
      changes, caregivers may be advised to 'take care' of themselves, but may not receive guidance
      or support for doing this. In this study, we are testing a self-care intervention for older,
      spouse caregivers of persons with stroke to see how helpful the intervention is in reducing
      distress and in helping caregivers adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors.

      We have developed an intervention for caregivers that is called Self-Care TALK. The
      intervention includes creating a health-promoting, self-care education and support
      partnership between caregivers and nurses through the use of weekly telephone conversations.
      Each conversation focuses on a health-related topic, such as: healthy habits, building
      self-esteem, focusing on the positive, avoiding role overload, communicating, and building
      meaning. The conversations follow a basic format, but also are unique to each person.
      Participants complete questionnaires before and after the intervention, so that we can test
      the effect of participation in Self-Care TALK on caregiver health.

      We know that education and support about self-care can be achieved through partnerships
      between family caregivers and health care professionals. Our goal is to build on this
      knowledge in testing whether participation in the Self-Care TALK intervention will result in
      less distress and better health and well-being for spouse caregivers, compared to caregivers
      who receive no additional care beyond usual education and support. In working toward this
      goal, we are using a partnership approach, in which nurses and caregivers discuss several
      health-related topics and mutually identify creative solutions for caregivers to incorporate
      self-care and health-promotion strategies into their daily routines. Promoting healthy
      outcomes for caregivers is essential to supporting their personal well-being, and to
      fostering their ability to continue home care for their loved one.

    <textblock>
      Up to 80% of stroke survivors return to community living arrangements, where post-stroke care
      is supported mostly by family and friends. Although family caring at home is cost effective
      from a societal perspective, the challenges of caregiving can be significant and often result
      in negative outcomes for the caregiver, particularly when the caregiver is older and more
      vulnerable to caregiving demands. Caregivers are advised to 'take care', yet receive little
      direction regarding how to accomplish self-care goals.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a self-care intervention for older,
      spouse caregivers of persons with stroke in reducing caregiving strain, promoting caregiver
      health and well-being, self-efficacy related to health, and in reducing depressive symptoms.
      A randomized, treatment/comparison, repeated-measures experimental design will be used to
      test the effectiveness of the theory-based, health-promoting treatment (Self-Care TALK)
      compared to usual care, for spouse caregivers age 55 and older. Subjects must be living with
      and caring for the stroke survivor, and the stroke must have been a first-ever stroke,
      occurring 6-36 months before enrollment.

      Subjects complete questionnaires at baseline (Time 1) before randomization to the treatment
      or comparison group. Treatment group subjects receive written materials related to self-care
      and health promotion for use during the TALK sessions. Self-Care TALK is implemented through
      6 weekly telephone sessions with advanced practice nurses. Sessions focus on several
      self-care topics, including: healthy habits, building self-esteem, focusing on the positive,
      avoiding role overload, communicating, and building meaning. Basic content is structured, but
      conversations are individualized with regard to each person's environment, abilities, and
      activities.

      All subjects complete questionnaires again at 8 weeks (Time 2), and 24 weeks (Time 3) after
      baseline. Data will be analyzed using linear mixed modeling and linear regression to
      determine the effect of participation in Self-Care TALK on the outcome variables. Treatment
      group subjects are hypothesized to have lower caregiving strain, higher perceived health,
      well-being, and self-efficacy related to health, and less depressive symptomatology than
      comparison group subjects. Promoting healthy outcomes for stroke caregivers is essential to
      fostering ability for continued home care of stroke survivors. Comparison group subjects
      receive written materials related to self-care and health promotion post Time 3.
