    <textblock>
      This study has the aim of describing viral mutation profiles in patients diagnosed with
      chronic hepatitis B receiving antihepadnaviral therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a naturalistic cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis B subjects receiving
      nucleoside or nucleotide antihepadnaviral therapy.

      It is anticipated approximately 800 subjects will be recruited at 20 Australian sites. Data
      will be collected on the study subjects and analyses performed to describe factors
      contributing to the emergence of viral mutations in Australian patients with chronic
      hepatitis B.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years and over

          -  Provided informed consent

          -  Diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg documented for at least 6 months)

          -  Currently prescribed antihepadnaviral therapy (including, but not limited to:
             lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir or telbivudine) for chronic hepatitis B
             management

          -  Been taking current antihepadnaviral therapy for at least 6 months prior to
             recruitment

          -  Negative tests for HIV Ab, Hepatitis C Ab and Hepatitis D Ab within the previous 2
             years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected co-infection with HIV, Hepatitis C or Hepatitis D

          -  Concomitant immunosuppression / immunomodulatory therapies

          -  Diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma where anticipated life expectancy is less than 6
             months

          -  Current participation in an interventional, blinded, pharmaceutical industry-sponsored
             clinical trial

          -  Current Child Pugh class C classification (current Child Pugh score &gt; 9)

          -  Other known or suspected cause of chronic liver disease

          -  Any other reason that, in the investigator's opinion, participation in the study would
             not be in the participant's best interest.
