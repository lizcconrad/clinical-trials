  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the effects of a GABA (gamma amino butyric
      acid)-enhancing medication, pregabalin (300 mg/day), on smoking behavior, tobacco withdrawal
      and cigarette craving in smokers. We hypothesize that in smokers, pregabalin at 300 mg/day,
      will be more effective than placebo in decreasing smoking behavior and attenuating tobacco
      withdrawal and cigarette craving.

      A total of 40 smokers will be randomly assigned to a sequence of treatment conditions: 300
      mg/day pregabalin or placebo treatment. Each treatment condition will last 4 days, separated
      by 3 to 15 days of washout period. Smokers will have twice daily outpatient visits during the
      first 3 days and a test session on day 4. In each treatment period, smokers will abstain from
      smoking for 2.5 days, starting at 10 pm on Day 1 until the test session on Day 4. During the
      test sessions, measures of smoking behavior and tobacco withdrawal will be obtained.

      Smoking is an important public health problem costing over 430,000 lives a year in this
      county alone. The first line-treatments, Nicotine Replacement Treatments (NRT) or bupropion,
      compared to placebo, approximately double the long-term success rate for smoking cessation.
      Given that there remains 46 million smokers in this country and over 70 percent of them
      interested in quitting smoking, development of new treatments for smoking cessation will have
      great public health implications.

      Currently this protocol is complete with 24 completers. This study has been published. (April
      2011)
