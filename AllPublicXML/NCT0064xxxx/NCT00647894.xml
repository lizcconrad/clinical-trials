                  start of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If
                  dosing is scheduled on weekends, the HCG pregnancy test should be given within 24
                  hours prior to dosing of each study period. An additional serum (beta-HCG)
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women must practice abstinence or be using an acceptable form of contraception

               4. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit - including
                  the washout period, women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide
                  containing barrier method of contraception in addition to their current
                  contraceptive device. Males must also use a spermicide containing barrier method
                  of contraception to prevent the pregnancy of their sexual partners. These
