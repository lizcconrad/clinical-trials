      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of once daily application of
      a diclofenac sodium patch to the skin near or over the painful area. In this study, the
      location being studied will be one of the following: the affected shoulder, elbow, or wrist.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the
      diclofenac patch on the subject's skin, in the location being studied.
