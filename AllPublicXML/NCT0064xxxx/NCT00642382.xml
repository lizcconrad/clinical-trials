      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Agilus is safe and effective in the
      treatment of mild to moderate ankle osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of Agilus to a saline
      injection (control) in the treatment of mild to moderate ankle osteoarthritis. This is a
      multi-center, randomized, double blind, saline controlled, prospective study with two (2)
      treatment groups. The active group will receive one injection of Agilus per week for three
      consecutive weeks for a total of three injections. The control group will receive one
      injection of normal saline per week for three consecutive weeks for a total of three
      injections. Follow up visits will occur at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 26 weeks following the third
      injection.
