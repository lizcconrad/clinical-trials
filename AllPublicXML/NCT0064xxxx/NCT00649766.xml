  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test two different types of health messages, one that is
      developed for a specific group (targeted) and the other that is more personalized to
      individuals (tailored), to see which is better at changing how often people have their eyes
      examined. We hypothesize that people who get the tailored messages will be more likely to get
      a dilated eye exam than people who receive the targeted messages.

      Studies have shown that people are not getting their eyes examined on a regular basis, even
      though dilated eye exams can detect eye diseases like glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy
      early, before significant vision loss has developed. Early detection can lead to earlier
      treatment, which can save sight by preventing or slowing the progression of these eye
      diseases. In this project we designed, implemented, and are now evaluating tailored and
      targeted print health messages to increase eye examination behavior in an African-American
      population 65 years of age and older, a group at increased risk of glaucoma and diabetes.
