      RATIONALE: Giving high-dose chemotherapy drugs, such as carmustine, etoposide, and
      cyclophosphamide, before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer
      cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells that were
      collected from the patient's blood are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming
      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of giving high-dose carmustine,
      etoposide, and cyclophosphamide together with a stem cell transplant and to see how well it
      works in treating patients with HIV-associated lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of high-dose chemotherapy comprising
           carmustine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide followed by autologous stem cell infusion in
           patients with HIV-associated lymphoma receiving combination anti-HIV therapy and to
           determine the efficiency of stem cell collection from these patients.

        -  To estimate the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate HIV viral load, CD+4/CD+8 counts, and immune recovery after high-dose anti-
           lymphoma chemotherapy.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of high-dose etoposide in patients receiving highly
           active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for
      transplantation. At least 5 days later, patients with an adequate number of collected cells
      proceed to high-dose chemotherapy.

        -  High-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive carmustine IV over 4 hours on days -7 to -5,
           etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2.

        -  Autologous PBSC transplantation: Patients receive PBSC infusion on day 0. Patients
           undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies of etoposide.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days and 100
      days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV seropositive at or before the time of lymphoma diagnosis

          -  Subjects must be on a multi-drug regimen (excluding azidothymidine) to maintain HIV
             viral load less than 50,000 Gc/mL; if the CD4 count at enrollment is less than 100
             then the viral load should be less than 10,000 by reverse transcriptase polymerase
             chain reaction (Rt-PCR); if the CD4 count is greater than 100/mm^3 prior to the start
             of any lymphoma chemotherapy and is greater than 100/mm^3 for at least 3 months then
             the viral load must be less than 150,000 gc/ml and clinically stable; if no
             pre-chemotherapy CD4 counts are available, then viral load alone will be used from
             enrollment

          -  The known hematopoietic toxicity of AZT (zidovudine) prohibits its use pre-transplant
             during stem cell collection and during the immediate period of engraftment
             post-transplant; resumptions of AZT should not begin until there is evidence of stable
             engraftment; therefore, AZT should not be resumed until at least 2 months after last
             blood product support is used; since platelet support continues until approximately
             day +14 days in our experience with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
             patients transplanted date, AZT will be prohibited until at least 2 months after
             transplant; therefore, if the anti-HIV drug combination needs to be modified then AZT
             can be part of the new regimen

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70%

          -  Biopsy proven intermediate grade or high-grade Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, (working
             formulation groups D-H and J, and Plasmablastic lymphoma of any disease state,
             including first remission given the poor risk nature of this histology) or Hodgkin's
             lymphoma of any subtype except nodular lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&amp;H) lymphocyte
             predominant; tissue histology will be reviewed at the City of Hope

          -  Patients with prior marrow involvement must demonstrate &lt; 10% involvement (by
             morphology) pre stem cell collection

          -  Pretreatment serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic
             pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Patients who are Hepatitis C antibody positive or Hepatitis B surface antigen positive
             without clinical evidence of cirrhosis will be eligible after further evaluation;
             specifically, if patient hepatitis C or B positive viral loads will be measured;
             patients with hepatitis B and ongoing evidence of viral replication may require
             therapy prior to receiving high dose chemotherapy; this decision will be at the
             discretion of the treating physician

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal and a 24 hour urine
             creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min

          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 2 x normal

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or diffusing capacity of the lung for
             carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;= 50% predicted

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;= 50% (by 2 dimensional [2 D]
             echocardiogram or multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA] scan); absence of
             cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure or dysrhythmia

          -  Subjects who are not in complete remission must have measurable disease; measurable
             disease means that there are bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined
             margins using either a medical photograph, computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or palpation of lesions with both diameters &gt;=
             2 cm; evaluable disease means that the lesions are only unidimensionally measurable,
             or have indistinct margins or have both diameters &lt; 0.5 cm, or that the palpable
             lesions have a diameter &lt; 2.0 cm, or are lesions in bone; pleural effusions and
             ascites are considered nonevaluable disease; scans must be within 28 days from
             enrollment
