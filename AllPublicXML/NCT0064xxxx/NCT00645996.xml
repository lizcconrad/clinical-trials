  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: It is well established that the presence of bacteria in the intestine has a
      profound influence on health. Probiotics, (&quot;beneficial bacteria&quot;) have shown ameliorating
      effects on various infectious diseases. The influence of probiotics on several
      immune-mediated conditions has also been investigated, among them, atopic dermatitis (&quot;Asthma
      of the skin&quot;), and milk allergy.

      The precise mechanism of action of probiotics is not fully understood. Several animal and
      human studies have shown the probiotic bacteria to influence the immune system. The aim of
      the present study is to evaluate whether supplementing the diet with oral probiotics affects
      the immune response of children following routine vaccination against 4 common childhood
      viral diseases: Mumps, Measles, Rubella and Varicella.

      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es):

      Hypothesis: Administration of probiotics will increase the amount of antibodies produced
      following vaccination for Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella, by over 15%.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether administration of probiotics during infancy influences antibody
           levels following the routine childhood vaccinations.

        -  To determine whether administration of probiotics during infancy influences the rate of
           adverse effects following the routine childhood vaccinations.

      Potential Impact: Vaccines, alongside with the discovery of Penicillin, have been cited as
      the great public health successes of the 20th century. However, even in countries with
      maximal childhood immunization coverage, the protective effect is not optimal. For example,
      only 70% to 90% of children immunized against chickenpox are actually protected against the
      disease. If we succeed in raising these numbers, even by a single percent, it will have a
      huge impact on society.
