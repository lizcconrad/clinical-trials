  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients presenting to Grady Memorial Hospital with an odontogenic (dental) infection
      that requires admission to the hospital and incision and drainage will be eligible for
      inclusion in this pilot study. The surgical method used for incision and drainage will be
      determined by the attending surgeon who will operate on the patient. The surgical procedure
      is a simple and universally standardized involving one or more small incisions in the mouth
      or in the upper neck and the placement of a drain(s) within the infected area to facilitate
      continued drainage of pus. Subjects will be randomized to either a red rubber or penrose
      drain(s). The drains are placed through the mouth or upper neck depending on the location of
      the infection and typically remain in place until the drainage has stopped (several days).
      All drains are secured with a single stitch through the gum or skin. The drain(s) will be
      removed bedside by removing a single suture and gently withdrawing the drain. The timing of
      this is determined by the clinical picture although this typically occurs within the first
      week. This is not a painful procedure. Currently some surgeons place red rubber drains which,
      after placement, allow the infection not only to drain but also be irrigated with saline both
      during the surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. Other surgeons place penrose
      drains, which, after placement, continue to allow the infection to drain but cannot be
      irrigated. Red rubber drains require daily irrigation and as such are labor intensive.
      Furthermore, drains that are irrigated may continue to drain the saline irrigant in the many
      hours after irrigation that upon clinical inspection may be difficult to distinguish from
      sero-sanguinous (pus) drainage. It is daily inspection of the drainage (or lack thereof)
      which determines the appropriate time to remove the drain(s). This in turn may influence time
      to discharge and ultimately hospital costs
