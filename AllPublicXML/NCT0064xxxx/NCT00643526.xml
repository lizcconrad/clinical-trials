  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the autoinjector works in a group of
      people who are likely to use the autoinjector for injecting their medicine in the future.
      However, no active medicine is given by the autoinjector.

    <textblock>
      This device (called an autoinjector) automatically injects medicine under the skin with a
      sterile needle, and is similar to other types of autoinjectors currently being used for this
      purpose. This trial has been designed to make sure that people, who are likely to use this
      device, are able to self-inject and understand the training material. A total of 68 subjects
      took part in the study. About half (30 patients) will have either Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),
      psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the other half will have
      psoriasis (a type of skin disease), since this device will be used by patients with one of
      these diseases to inject their medication. The study is designed to have each patient
      complete 2 self-injections with the autoinjector in 2 different sites-one in the front of the
      thigh and one in the abdomen 2 inches away from the navel. The order of the first injection
      location is decided by randomization. The patient will have an equal chance of having the
      thigh or the abdomen as the first injection. The study staff will assess the subject's safety
      prior to the patient leaving the clinic. Two prefilled, 1mL placebo autoinjectors for
      subcutaneous injection
