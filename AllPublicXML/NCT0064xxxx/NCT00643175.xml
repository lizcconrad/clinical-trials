  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis has been called a &quot;silent epidemic&quot; whose prevalence is increasing. It often
      presents as a fragility fracture, with hospitalizations resulting from minimally traumatic
      hip fractures. While the fractures are treated appropriately, the underlying pathology is
      often ignored. Numerous studies have shown that prior fracture increases the risk for further
      fracture. In 2004 the Surgeon General released a report on osteoporosis, the details of which
      include multi-disciplinary treatment of osteoporotic fractures. Treatment of osteoporosis
      after hip fracture is also being targeted as a future hospital quality assessment measure.
      Hospitals which have no plan in place to address osteoporosis treatment after hip fracture
      may be cited, and may have medicare money withheld. The goal of the study is to create an
      automated in-patient endocrinology consultation for osteoporotic hip fractures. We plan to
      gather patient data in a prospective manner including the endocrinologist recommendations,
      adherence to medical therapy after discharge, and future fracture rates. Possible planned
      interventions include only appropriate medical therapy for osteoporosis, DEXA bone scanning,
      and regularly scheduled telephone follow-up.

        Using the existing WebCAIS order system, an automated endocrinology consult and appropriate
        laboratory studies will be drawn on all non-traumatic hip fractures. Data from these
        patients will be collected in a prospective study, and the patients will be followed up
        over time to check adherence to osteoporotic medical therapy and future incidence of
        re-fracture.
