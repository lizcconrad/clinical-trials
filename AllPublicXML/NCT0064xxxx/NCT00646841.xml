    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to determine the effects of the Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System
      (GITS) formulation of Doxazosin when used in combination therapy with the 5 major classes of
      antihypertensive agents as measure by 24-hour diastolic blood pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects were males or females ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of primary
             essential hypertension and currently taking 1 or 2 individual antihypertensive agents

          -  Dosing for entry antihypertensive medication was at the accepted efficacious dose or
             the maximum tolerated dose and had to be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to study
             entry

          -  Subjects were required to have clinic sitting DBP ≥95 and ≤110 mmHg and SBP ≥140 and
             ≤180 mmHg as an average of 3 readings on their current antihypertensive therapy at
             visits 1 and 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to:

          -  Subjects taking antihypertensive medications for other indications (i.e. arrhythrma,
             unstable angina, CHF, etc.)

          -  Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a decrease of at least 20 mmHg systolic or 1OmmHg
             diastolic pressure between sitting and standing blood pressures after 2 rmnutes, or
             known fluid depletion.
