  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very few studies have proved the effectiveness of treatment for suicide attempt patients. Our
      objective is to evaluate the addition of the resources of an suicide prevention centre to
      standard psychiatric treatment in the Emergency Department. Consecutive suicide attempt
      patients in 2 Emergency departments (multicenter study) were included after standard
      psychiatric treatment and referral. After Written informed consent, psychological assessment
      (depression, suicide intention) was carried out After randomisation, control patients were
      given an information card describing the Suicide Prevention Center (SPC); experimental
      patients had a first meeting with a psychologist of the SPC.

      To verify the hypothesis of a decrease in suicidal behaviors in the experimental group, an
      evaluation of these behaviors was carried out every month during a two year follow-up.

      Very few studies have proved the effectiveness of treatment for suicide attempt patients. Our
      objective is to evaluate the addition of the resources of an existent suicide prevention
      centre to standard psychiatric treatment in the Emergency Department. Consecutive suicide
      attempt (self poisoning) patients in 2 Emergency departments (multicenter study) were
      included after standard psychiatric treatment and referral. After Written informed consent,
      psychological assessment (depression, suicide intent scale/SIS Beck Depression Inventory,
      Toronto Ale, Beck Hopelessness Sc, Audit, mini, PDQ 4) was carried out After randomisation,
      control patients were given an information card describing the Suicide Prevention Center
      (SPC); experimental patients had a first meeting with a psychologist of the SPC. The number
      of subjects included should be 405 per group. To verify the hypothesis of a decrease in
      suicidal behaviors in the experimental group, an evaluation of these behaviors was carried
      out every month during a two year follow-up The frequency of subsequent suicidal behavior
      will be monitored by the scrutiny of the Emergency Dept records. Death by suicide will be
      identified by the examination of information obtained from the national death statistics
      office (INSERM).
