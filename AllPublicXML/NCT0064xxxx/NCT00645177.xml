  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ABT-869 plus paclitaxel compared to
      paclitaxel alone on disease progression in metastatic breast cancer.

      Only the open-label lead-in portion of the study was enrolled (n=10). The randomized portion
      was not initiated. N = approximately 102 (90 randomized in a 1:1 ratio in Phase 2,
      approximately 6-12 enrolled in open-label lead-in to assess the tolerability of the
      combination) Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study of the
      efficacy and tolerability of the ABT-869 + paclitaxel versus placebo for ABT-869 + paclitaxel
      in subjects with documented metastatic breast cancer in the first line metastatic therapy
      setting. An initial open-label, lead-in cohort of six subjects will be monitored for 2 cycles
      (8 weeks) to assess the PK interactions and the safety of the combination of 0.20 mg/kg QD
      ABT-869 and paclitaxel (90 mg/m2). Enrollment into the randomized portion will begin after a
      cohort has completed two cycles (8 weeks) of therapy and no toxicities prohibit the cohort
      from continuing on to Cycle 3. Alternative doses may be explored based on the tolerability of
      the combination.
