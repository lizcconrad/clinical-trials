  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One complication of uveitis which is driven by an increase in VEGF is the formation of
      inflammatory ocular neovascularization (ION). Here, we analyze the therapeutic role of
      intravitreal bevacizumab in ION not responding to standard therapy (systemic and ocular
      corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants) in a multicenter retrospective study.The
      natural history of subfoveal choroidal new vessels histoplasmosis, multifocal choroiditis,
      Harada and other inflammatory chorioretinal disorders has been very guarded, but with this
      new approach, we hope to stop the visual loss in these relatively young patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Members of the American Society of Retinal specialists, the American Uveitis Society and the
      International Uveitis Society were invited to contribute their consecutive cases of ION not
      responding to standard therapy (corticosteroids (CST) 4 or immunosuppression) and treated
      with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. Cases with concomitant or prior cystoid macular edema,
      diabetes mellitus, or age-related macular degeneration were excluded. Most of the patients
      had initially been treated in a stepwise fashion with high doses of oral CST, with or without
      intraocular or subtenon CST or immunosuppressive therapy (as monitored by a rheumatologist).
      All patients opted to intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment after detailed information about the
      limited experience, potential side effects and the off-label character of the drug. The risks
      and benefits of intravitreal therapy were discussed with the patients (or their guardians)
      who signed an informed consent. Primary outcome measure: Best corrected visual acuity
      measured as logMAR. Secondary outcome measures:macular thickness on OCT, and stoppage of
      leakage by IVFA.
