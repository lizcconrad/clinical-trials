    <textblock>
      A study to look at the rates of remission (non re-appearance of erosive esomeprazole) when
      treated with esomeprazole or lansoprazole; in patients in with erosive esomeprazole (EE) that
      is in remission (i.e. previously healed EE).

    <measure>To compare rates of remission (non re-appearance of erosive esomeprazole) when treated with esomeprazole or lansoprazole; in patients in with erosive esomeprazole (EE) that is in remission (i.e. previously healed EE).</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptoms will be assessed by the investigator at each visit and the patients will undergo an endoscopy at Months 3 and 6</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare endoscopic remission rates through 6 months of treatment with E20 and L15, after initial healing of EE.</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptoms will be assessed by the investigator at each visit and the patients will undergo an endoscopy at Months 3 and 6</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The assessment of symptoms in the two treatment groups after 1, 3 and 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>patients will undergo an endoscopy at Months 3 and 6</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the safety and tolerability of up to 6 months of treatment with E20 and L15 after initial healing of EE.</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptoms will be assessed by the investigator at each visit and the patients will undergo an endoscopy at Months 3 and 6</time_frame>
