    <textblock>
      Standard care for patients with diabetes having CABG surgery at Providence St. Vincent
      Medical Center includes strict control of blood sugar (glucose) levels for 3 days after
      surgery. This is done through frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels and by giving insulin
      continuously through a needle into a vein (intravenously). This intensive glucose control has
      resulted in fewer complications such as serious infections and death, and has shortened the
      length of the hospital stay for patients.

      This study treatment is different from standard treatment in that it extends the intensive
      glucose control beyond the third postoperative day to one full year. Once discharged from the
      hospital following the CABG procedure, the intense glucose control is done using subcutaneous
      insulin (a shot under the skin), oral medications, and by measuring blood sugar levels
      frequently.

      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective strict glucose control is when
      extended beyond 3 days and hospital discharge for one year. Another purpose is to see how
      well patients can comply with the daily management of intensive glucose control for one-year
      as well as the study follow-up schedule.

      Purpose Pilot study to gather information for &quot;United States CABG Diabetes Project&quot; (USCDP)
      Multi-center Randomized Trial.

      For 14 years our research team has successfully implemented an increasingly aggressive series
      of intravenous insulin protocols that normalize blood glucose levels for 3 postoperative days
      in patients with diabetes who undergo cardiac surgery. This has resulted in significant
      reductions in mortality, infection and length of stay (LOS) and has normalized those outcomes
      to those of the population without diabetes (DM). The current protocol ends on the morning of
      the 3rd postoperative day.

      We believe that a logical expansion of this groundbreaking work is to extend the duration of
      intensive glycemic control beyond the third postoperative day and into the outpatient period.
      However it would be impossible to do so with the continued use of CII therapy. Therefore, we
      propose to employ intensive subcutaneous insulin therapies and oral hypoglycemic agents to
      affect continued tight glycemic control following discontinuation of CII and continue such
      therapy beyond hospital discharge for a period of at least one year.

      We hypothesize that this will lead to further reductions in major adverse cardiac outcomes in
      the high-risk diabetes coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) subgroup. The optimal method to
      test this hypothesis is with a very large, multi-center clinical trial. However, before
      embarking on such a resource-consuming endeavor, we intend to test the concepts, methods,
      implementation strategies, patient acceptability and compliance, proposed biomarkers and
      clinical outcomes of such a trial with this proposed limited pilot study.

      If the information obtained from this pilot study is favorable, we will submit for full
      funding of the multicenter USCDP clinical trial to the NIDDK and NHLBI divisions of the NIH.
      In order to test all aspects of the proposed trial, we intend to randomize patients into this
      pilot study.

    <description>The CDE and Study Coordinator will also meet with the patient in the hospital to show how the Lifescan One-Touch Ultra II glucometer works and review the study follow-up schedule. Patients will be sent home with the Lifescan One-Touch Ultra II glucometer and a supply of strips.
Post-Discharge Period Patients will meet alternatively with the CDE and study doctor on a specific schedule including every week for the first month, every 2 weeks in the second month, and every month thereafter till the 12th month. During these sessions the BG records will be downloaded from the Lifescan One-Touch Ultra II glucometer and reviewed to see patterns and any areas that could be improved or changed.
For all patients in the study arm, the medications that are being taken and the results of glucose monitoring charts will be reviewed weekly with endocrinologists so that any additional recommendations may be made to improve glucose control.</description>
