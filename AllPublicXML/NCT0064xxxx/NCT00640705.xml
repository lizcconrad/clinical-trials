      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of once daily application of
      a diclofenac sodium patch to the skin near or over the painful area. In this study, the
      location being studied will be either the left or right ankle.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a diclofenac
      patch on the skin.
