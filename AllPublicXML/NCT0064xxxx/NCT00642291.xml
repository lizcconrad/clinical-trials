    <textblock>
      To obtain safety and efficacy data for antiretroviral regimens containing emtricitabine in
      HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects. To determine emtricitabine concentrations in HIV-1
      infected pediatric subjects and, if necessary, to refine the dose of emtricitabine to achieve
      concentrations comparable to those in adults given 200 mg emtricitabine once-daily.
