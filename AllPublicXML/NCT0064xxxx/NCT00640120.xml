      The WIM-PC™ device, indicated for acoustic pulmonary function measurement that quantifies the
      presence of wheezing. This study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      using the WIM-PC™ device for wheeze detection during dynamic bronchial situations in infants
      that were hospitalized as a result of asthmatic attack.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory infection in infants under
      one year of age. About 1-2% of infants with bronchiolitis need to be hospitalized and
      approximately 8% of these children require intensive care. Pulmonary function tests in
      infants are objective, but require sedation, which is problematic in acutely ill infants.
      Wheeze quantification by lung sounds analysis methods is objective, non invasive and has been
      shown to correlate with clinical status in asthma and bronchiolitis. The recording procedure
      is simple, requiring only the attachment of 4 ECG-size sensors to the chest wall. A 30-second
      recording is often adequate, but recording time can be extended as necessary, to obtain good
      quality data, where wheezes are detected and counted with high degree of accuracy.

      Karmel Sonix Ltd has developed the WIM-PC™ device, indicated for acoustic pulmonary function
      measurement that quantifies the presence of wheezing. This study was designed in order to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of using the WIM-PC™ device for wheeze detection during
      dynamic bronchial situations in infants that were hospitalized as a result of asthmatic
      attack.
