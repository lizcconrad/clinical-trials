  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study of vorinostat in combination with lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The safety and
      tolerability of the combination regimen will also be evaluated in this study.

    <description>Dose escalation study. Level 1: 300 mg daily (q.d.) vorinostat orally (p.o.) for 14 days in combination with 10 mg q.d. lenalidomide p.o. for 21 days. Level 2: 400 mg q.d. vorinostat p.o. for 14 days in combination with 10 mg q.d. lenalidomide p.o. for 21 days. Level 3: 400 mg q.d. vorinostat p.o. for 14 days in combination with 15 mg q.d. lenalidomide p.o. for 21 days. Level 4: 400 mg q.d. vorinostat p.o. for 14 days in combination with 20 mg q.d. lenalidomide p.o. for 21 days. Level 5: 400 mg q.d. vorinostat p.o. for 14 days in combination with 25 mg q.d. lenalidomide p.o. for 21 days. 40 mg q.d. Dexamethasone p.o. will be given in each level on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle will be 28 days with a maximum of 8 treatment cycles.
Participants who do not have disease progression and who continue to meet the eligibility criteria after the 8 cycles will be offered continued treatment at the same dose level and schedule.</description>
