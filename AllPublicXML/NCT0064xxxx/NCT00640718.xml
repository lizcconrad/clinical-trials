      The EverOn™ system developed by EarlySense, Ltd., the sponsor of this study, is intended to
      assist hospitals to better address and improve recognition and response to changes in a
      patient's condition.

      The system, monitors the patient while in bed consists of a contact-free sensor that is
      placed under the bed mattress and identifies respiratory and heart rates, degree of patient's
      movement or agitation while in bed as well as patient's actual exit out of the bed. The
      EverOn system does not require a physical contact with the patient, eliminating the need for
      any direct contact electrodes, leads, cuffs or nasal cannulae.
