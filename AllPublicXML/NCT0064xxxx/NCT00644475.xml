      BACKGROUND The effects of ACE-inhibitors on fibrinolysis are well documented. Experimental
      and clinical studies have shown that ACE inhibitors induce a reduction in plasma PAI-1 levels
      in many cardiovascular diseases, like hypertension, coronary heart disease, and heart
      failure. Their effects on t-PA are more controversial, due to the fact that t-PA exists in
      several forms, including free and bound to PAI-1. Indeed an increase in t-PA activity has
      been observed in humans and it seems related to bradykinin increase which is known to
      stimulate endothelial t-PA synthesis. These favourable effects on fibrinolysis could be
      related not only to the Angiotensin II reduction and the bradykinin increase but also to the
      improvement in insulin sensitivity, as insulin has been suggested as one of the main
      regulators of fibrinolytic activity.

      To date conflicting results have been reported about the effects of ARBs on fibrinolysis.
      Some studies have reported small improvements, others no significant effect. These
      conflicting results may be due to possible methodological bias but a possible
      pathophysiological explanation might be that receptor subtypes other than AT1 mediate the
      effect of Angiotensin-II on endothelial PAI-1 expression, i.e. the AT4 receptors, and during
      AT1 receptor blockade there is an important increase not only of Angiotensin-II, but also of
      all its catabolites including Angiotensin IV. The dissimilar effects on of ACE Is and ARBs
      may also depend on their different action on the RAS and their different effect on insulin
      sensitivity: ACE-Is improve insulin sensitivity, while the majority of ARBs have been
      reported to have a neutral effect. Moreover, unlike ACE-Is, ARBs do not affect the metabolism
      of bradykinin, which is known to stimulate t-PA synthesis and release.

      AIM OF THE STUDY The aim of this study is to verify the effect of imidapril compared to
      candesartan on insulin sensitivity, evaluated through the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp,
      and on fibrinolysis, evaluated through the plasma PAI-1 and t-PA activity, in mild to
      moderate hypertensive patients.
