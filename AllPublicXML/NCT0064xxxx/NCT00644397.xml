  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internal fixation of femur fractures improves alignment and provides stability to the bone
      and the surrounding soft tissues. This generally allows for early motion of the adjacent
      joints; thus maximizing overall function of the limb. Open reduction and internal fixation
      with plates and screws is the standard method that has been used in the treatment of distal
      femoral fractures. One common traditional method of internal fixation is the 95-degree angled
      blade plate. Recent advances in technology for distal femur fractures include the LCPâ„¢
      Condylar Plate. This implant differs from the blade plate, because the LCP offers multiple
      points of fixed angle contact between the plate and screws in the distal femur. The
      introduction of plates with the option of locked screws has provided means to increase the
      rigidity of fixation in osteoporotic bone or in periarticular fractures with a small distal
      segment, and the LCP may be technically easier to apply than the blade plate. To the
      investigators' knowledge, there have been no published clinical or biomechanical studies
      specific to the LCP Condylar Plate, although the early results of LCP implants for other
      fractures are promising. The investigators believe that locked plating represents a valuable
      advancement in fracture treatment. However, the limitations of this new technology and the
      indications for its use have not been completely elucidated. Furthermore, the cost of the new
      technology is approximately seven times more than the traditional treatment. This is a
      randomized, prospective, multi-center study to compare the blade plate and the LCP in the
      distal femur. All patients 16 years of age or older, regardless of race or gender, with a
      supracondylar fracture of distal femur will be considered. Whether patients are treated with
      a blade plate or/and LCP, they will be receiving standard orthopedic care for their injury.
      Neither of these methods currently places a patient at increased surgical or post-surgical
      risk for problems with infection, nonunion, malunion, or other complications. Because of the
      study, early and late complication rates and functional outcomes after these treatments may
      be better defined, allowing for optimization of care of people with these injuries in the
      future. This should reduce not only direct and indirect costs to the individual, but also
      costs to society.

        Participating research centers will evaluate for enrollment all patients presenting with
        distal femur fractures. The number of patients to be recruited is based on previously
        reported malunion rates. Assuming a 15% incidence of malunion in the locked plating group,
        a difference of +/- 5% would be statistically significant. In order for the study to have
        power of 80% to detect a difference at the 0.05 level, 49 patients will be required in each
        group.
