      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      ACD in the single level surgical treatment of patients with symptomatic cervical degenerative
      disc disease. The primary follow-up information obtained from this clinical investigation are
      used to support a PMA application for the ACD.

             presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord compression in the
             face of continued non-operative management;

          5. No previous surgical intervention at the involved level or any subsequent,
             planned/staged surgical procedure at the involved or adjacent level(s);

          6. Is at least 18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of surgery;
