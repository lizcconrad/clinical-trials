  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an era of delayed fertility plans, there is an increasing need for a reliable method to
      predict ovarian reserve and responsiveness. The current tests include serum FSH, Inhibin B,
      Mullerian inhibiting factor (MIF) and ultrasonographic measures such as ovarian volume and
      number of antral follicles are non-specific and with questionable reliability. The
      biochemical tests represent the function of production of androgens, as a predictor of
      ovarian reserve, has not been tested yet.

      Working hypothesis and aims: testing the prognostic capability of hCG stimulating test of
      theca cells for estimating the ovarian reserve, and by that to calculate better the chance
      for IVF cycle success

      20 women &gt;40 years old and 20 women &lt;35 years old, attended to our IVF unit were included in
      the study. Another 20 other young women (&lt;35 years) with poor response in previous IVF cycles
      will be participate. All participants received a single hCG 10000 IU injection on cycle day
      2-4. Hormone levels of LH, FSH, E2, P, Testosterone, Androstendione and 17-OHP were taken
      prior to the injection and on days 1, 3 and 7 afterwards. hCG induced hormone levels will be
      compared with IVF results
