      Assess the effect of nepicastat in the treatment of in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      in conflict or combat zone experienced veterans, in comparison to placebo.

      The primary treatment objective is to assess the global efficacy of nepicastat in the
      treatment of hyper-arousal in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in conflict or combat
      zone experienced veterans, in comparison to placebo. The secondary treatment objectives are
      to assess the ability of nepicastat to induce PTSD remission; treat PTSD and other PTSD
      symptom clusters and improve quality of life and overall functioning. A medical safety
      objective is to assess the tolerability and side effects of nepicastat in the treatment of
      PTSD in veterans who served in conflict zones at least one time between 1990 -2008 [includes
      Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), Afghanistan, Gulf War, etc .

      This is a 6-week study with the long-term objective is to define the best approach to
      treating PTSD and enhancing the quality of life in patients. Results from this pilot study
      will assist clinicians in treating active military service members or veterans with PTSD by
      developing new treatment algorithms for future larger studies.
