    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effects of a 12 month gym- and home-based exercise
      program on bone density and falls risk factors in postmenopausal women with low bone density.
      It is hypothesised that the exercise program will lead to improvements in bone density and
      falls risk factors such as balance and muscle strength compared with usual care.
