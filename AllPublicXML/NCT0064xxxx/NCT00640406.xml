    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation is a prospective, international, multi-centre, randomized (1:1)
      trial with follow ups at 2, 6, 12 months and 3 years.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical impact of percutaneous transluminal
      renal artery stenting (PTRAS) on the impaired renal function measured by the estimated
      Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in patients with hemodynamically significant
      atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS).
