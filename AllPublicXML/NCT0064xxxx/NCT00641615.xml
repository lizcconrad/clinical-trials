    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of different doses of
      RNF43-721 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with S-1/CPT-11 chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RNF43 is a cancer testis antigen which express widely in colorectal cancer tissue but not in
      normal organs. RNF43-721 induces HLA A24 restricted specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)
      against RNF43 expressed target. S-1/CPT-11 chemotherapy is performed unresectable advanced
      colorectal cancer in Japan and is reported to be obtained almost the same result compared
      with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as first-line chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. Because
      synergistic effect between vaccine therapy and chemotherapy will be expected, we plan phase I
      study to evaluate the safety and immune response of different doses of RNF43-721 emulsified
      with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with S-1/CPT-11 chemotherapy.
