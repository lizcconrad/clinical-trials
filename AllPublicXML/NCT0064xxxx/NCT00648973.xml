    <textblock>
      The study was to determine if the drug worked to relieve nasal congestion experienced by
      people with seasonal allergies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled into the placebo run-in phase
      of the study on Day -7 (prerandomization, Visit 1). Baseline symptom scores were established
      during this run-in phase.

      Subjects with moderate nasal congestion who took at least 80% of their study medication
      during the run-in phase were eligible for enrollment in the two-week double-blind phase of
      the study and were randomized on Day 1 (randomization, Visit 2). They were treated for two
      weeks with their assigned medication. The severity of signs/symptoms were evaluated by the
      subjects every morning and night and by the investigator at each visit on Day 7 and Day 14.

      In addition, the subject and investigator provided a global evaluation of response to
      treatment on Day 7 and Day 14. Safety was evaluated by adverse events reported during the
      study, vital signs, and the incidence of somnolence.
