  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the combined use of
      external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and systemic chemotherapy of 5-FU has been widely
      recognized as the most effective chemoradiotherapy approach.But most patients succumb to
      local recurrence and metastasis after treatment, and the prognosis remains poor On the basis
      of the development and superiority of the interstitial brachytherapy and the radiosensitizing
      effect of gemcitabine, we performed a clinical study to explore the interaction of improved
      I-125 brachytherapy and gemcitabine and compare the regimen to the standard gemcitabine
      treatment specifically in patients with non-metastatic, unresectable pancreatic cancer.
