  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was an Open Label Extension to the recurrence prevention study to
      evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of paliperidone ER in subjects with schizophrenia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the open-label extension was the long-term assessment of safety and
      tolerability of ER OROS paliperidone 3 to 15 mg/day in subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia.
      In addition, the long-term efficacy and effect of ER OROS paliperidone on overall functioning
      and personal and social functioning, as well as quality of life, health economics, and
      subjective sleep measures, was explored. This open-label extension study followed a
      recurrence prevention study (R076477-SCH-301) that had both an open-label
      run-in/stabilization phase and a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase.

      Open-label study drug (ER OROS paliperidone 3 mg to 15 mg/day) was administered for 52 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who had experienced a recurrence event during the double blind phase of Study
             R076477-SCH-301

          -  Remained recurrence free until the end of the double-blind phase, or were in the
             run-in or stabilization phases when the study was terminated

          -  Who signed the informed consent for the open-label extension

          -  And who the investigator agreed that open-label treatment was in the best interest of
             the subject were eligible to participate in the open-label extension

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not eligible to enter the open-label phase if believed to be at significant risk for
