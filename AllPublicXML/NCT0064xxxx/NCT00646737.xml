    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of the substitution
      of mycophenolate mofetil for enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium in a population of stable
      renal transplant patients in Brazil, in a treatment regimen of immunosuppressants with
      tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.
