  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of reduced pump prime on blood
      transfusions and postoperative complications in patients at high risk of severe hemodilution
      during CPB.

      HYPOTHESIS The use of a new CPB circuit with a smaller internal volume, together with
      retrograde autologous priming of the lines (RAP) will allow a smaller prime volume and
      therefore less significant hemodilution on pump.

      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Overview

      Patients will be randomized on the morning of surgery to one of the two study groups in a 1:1
      allocation scheme:

        1. Low pump prime

        2. Standard pump prime Outcomes The primary outcome is the number of units of blood
           products transfused within the first 24 hours post CPB.

    Protocol was comparing to standard of practice, which has changed over the course of slow
    recruitment and no longer can be used as a comparator.
