    <textblock>
      Phase IIa, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multi-centre study in
      subjects diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary
      objective is to evaluate the effects of 12-weeks of treatment with GW856553 7.5 mg twice
      daily (BID) compared with placebo on the percentage of sputum neutrophils at 12 weeks. Twelve
      weeks of treatment with SERETIDE 50/500 BID will be compared with placebo for effect on
      sputum neutrophils as a positive control arm in the study

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Male adults or female adults of non-childbearing potential who are between 40 and 75
             years of age (inclusive). Note: a female is eligible to enter and participate in the
             study if she is of non-childbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of
             becoming pregnant). This includes any female who is post-menopausal. For the purposes
             of this study, post menopausal is defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1
             year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
             symptoms. Postmenopausal status may be confirmed by serum FSH and oestradiol
             concentrations at screening if deemed necessary by the PI. Surgical sterility will be
             defined as females who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal
             ligation.

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis: an established clinical history of

             Society/European Respiratory Society [American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory
             Society, 2004] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable
             disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow
             limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory
             response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette
             smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic
             consequences.

          -  Subjects with a cigarette smoking history of ≥10 pack years (1 pack year = 20
             cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year or the equivalent). Both current and former
             smokers are eligible to be enrolled. A former smoker is defined as a subject who has
             not smoked for ≥6 months at Visit 1.

          -  Subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 to FVC ratio (FEV1:FVC) &lt; 0.7 at Visit 1.
             Subjects will be assessed 30 (± 5) minutes after receiving salbutamol 400 μg.

          -  Subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 50% and &lt; 80% of predicted normal for
             height, age and sex at Visit 1. Subjects will be assessed 30 (± 5) minutes after
             receiving salbutamol 400 μg.

          -  Subjects capable of providing signed written informed consent to participate.

          -  Subjects must have a QTc &lt;450 msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a
             brief recording interval. For subjects with baseline bundle branch block the QTc will
             be &lt;480msec on baseline ECG or triplicate ECG averaged over a brief recording
             interval.

          -  A subject will be eligible for randomisation at the end of the run-in period only if
             the following additional criterion applies: Subjects with no evidence of an ongoing
             acute infection or sinus symptoms Specific information regarding warnings,
             precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other pertinent information on the
             investigational product that may impact subject eligibility is provided in the
