  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Genpharm's
      clarithromycin tablets following a single, oral 250 mg (1 x 250 mg) dose compared to the
      Biaxin® filmtab® (Abbott Laboratories USA) administered under fasted conditions. Thirty-four
      (34) healthy, light-, non- or ex-smoking subjects of at least 18 a years of age were
      randomized, in this four-period, two-treatment crossover bioequivalence study conducted by
      Eric Sicard, M.D. at Algorithme Pharma Inc. Montreal, Canada.

      Statistical analysis of the data reveals that 90% confidence intervals are within the
      acceptable bioequivalent range of 80% and 125% for the natural log transformed parameters
      AUCT, AUCI and Cmax. This study demonstrates that Genpharm's clarithromycin 250 mg tablets
      are bioequivalent to Biaxin® filmtab® 250 mg tablets (Abbott Laboratories USA) administered
      under fasted conditions.
