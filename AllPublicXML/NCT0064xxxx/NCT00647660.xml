  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's
      nadolol/bendroflumethiazide 80 mg/5 mg tablets to King's Corzide® 80 mg/5 mg tablets
      following a single, oral 80 mg/5 mg (1 x 80 mg/5 mg) dose administered under fasting
      conditions.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18 years and older

          2. Sex: Male and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating female

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum beta human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy tests performed within 21 days prior to the start
                  of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If dosing is
                  scheduled on weekends, serum for the HCG pregnancy test can be collected within
                  48 hours prior to dosing for each study period. An additional serum (β-HCG)
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or use an acceptable
                  form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. Acceptable forms of
                  contraception include the following:

                    1. hormonal contraceptives taken throughout the study, or

                    2. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    3. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    4. surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or
                       postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at
                       least one year.

               3. Hormonal replacement therapy will be allowed in this study

               4. Women will not be considered of childbearing potential if one of the following is
                  reported and documented on the medical history:

                    1. postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or

                    2. bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of
                       bleeding for at least 6 months, or

                    3. total hysterectomy

               5. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit, all men and
                  women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide-containing barrier method
                  of contraception in addition to their current contraceptive device. This
                  requirement should be documented in the informed consent form.

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs.) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs.) for women and all
             subjects having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 19 but less than or
             equal to 30 (see Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, 12-lead ECG, hepatitis B and hepatitis C
             tests, HIV test, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, benzodiazepine,
             cannabinoid, cocaine, opiate screen, phencyclidine, and methadone) performed within 21
             days of the initial dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used.

          2. Social Habits:

             pressure less than 90 or greater than 140 or a sitting diastolic blood pressure less
             than 60 or greater than 90 after a five-minute resting period at the Screening Visit
             or prior to Period I Day 1 dosing.

          8. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days
