  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a combination of two T-cell directed antibodies both conjugated to a
      cell-killing toxin will be evaluated. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that this
      so-called immunotoxin-combination (IT-combination) acts synergistically in eliminating T
      cells. In a subsequent clinical pilot-study, the IT-combination has generated encouraging
      results when applied as third line therapy. Extensive biological and clinical responses could
      be noted in the absence of severe acute toxicities. Building on this experience, the current
      study aims at evaluating the characteristics of the IT-combination when administered in an
      earlier phase of the disease, i.e. as second line instead of as third line therapy.

      &quot;The experimental design is a non-controlled multicentric fixed-dose Phase I/II study. A
      total of 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in 4 transplant centers throughout the
      Netherlands, in a 9 to 12 months period. The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4
      infusions IT-combination (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours apart over a 4-hour period.

      The intended follow-up period is 12 months. The patient will also be asked to participate in
      additional research aiming at determining the presence and evolution of biomarkers suggestive
      for the extent to which the IT-combination 'resets the T-cell compartment, induces clinical
      tolerance, and/or enhances the risk of over-immunosuppression.&quot;

    <description>The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4 infusions of IT-combination (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours apart over a 4-hour period. The IT-combination is a combination of two immunotoxins. One immunotoxin is a mAb anti-CD3 conjugated to recombinant ricin A chain and the other immunotoxin is a mAb anti-CD7 conjugated to recombinant ricin A chain.</description>
