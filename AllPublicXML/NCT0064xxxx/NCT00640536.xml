  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the structural and functional cardiac alterations
      in obstructive sleep apne (OSA) independent from systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension
      and their correlation to the severity of OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many risk factors for OSA, such as male gender, obesity, and increasing age are the same as
      for cardiovascular diseases. This fact makes it more difficult to establish a causal
      relationship between OSA and cardiovascular diseases. The relationship between OSA and right
      ventricular (RV) function is controversial. RV dysfunction may be a result of chronic
      intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia during apneic episodes. It may also occur secondary to
      left ventricular dysfunction as a result of increased afterload and sympathetic activity
      which causes secondary hypertension. As systemic hypertension is one of the most accompanying
      and contributing factors in OSA along with obesity, we tried to compare the effects of newly
      diagnosed OSA on RV function with an age and body mass index- matched control group.
