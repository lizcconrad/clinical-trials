  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with newly diagnosed brain tumors who undergo surgical resection and whose pathology
      in the operating room shows a high grade glioma will be eligible.

      During a screening visit, the study will be discussed, inform consent discussed and signed, a
      medical history will be taken and a physical examination and laboratory tests will be
      performed. If these tests are all within acceptable ranges, the subject will be considered
      for inclusion on this treatment protocol. If the results of any tests are extremely different
      from normal expected values, she/he may not be able to participate.

      Prior to surgery, the subject will have a contrast enhanced MRI and MRS. The neurosurgeon
      will attempt to remove the majority of the tumor in the operating room and will send a
      portion of the specimen removed to the pathologist immediately. This is called a &quot;frozen
      section&quot;. If the pathologist believes that the tumor is a high-grade malignant brain tumor,
      then the surgeon will place up to 8 dime-sized chemotherapy wafers in the tumor cavity of the
      brain. The remainder of the tumor specimen will be given to the pathologist to review more
      closely in the laboratory. If the frozen section does not show that the tumor is a high-grade
      malignant brain tumor, the subject will not receive the Gliadel wafers and will be removed
      from the study. The surgeon will then discuss with the subject the appropriate treatment
      options for the disease he or she has.

      During recovery in the hospital, another contrast enhanced MRI will be performed within the
      first 72 hours after surgery. This is a standard of care for patients who are not involved on
      this protocol as well. The subject will have another contrast enhanced MRI and MRS performed
      at the 21st Day after his or her surgery. After Day 21, He or she may begin other forms of
      treatment. The last contrast enhanced MRI and MRS assessment will be performed 12 weeks after
      the surgery and the implantation of the Gliadel wafers. Further MRI and MRS may be performed
      subsequently at the discretion of the doctor.

      Throughout the course of treatment, clinical data will be collected.

    <description>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy uses a continuous band of radio wave frequencies to excite hydrogen atoms in a variety of chemical compounds other than water. These compounds absorb and emit radio energy at characteristic frequencies, or spectra, that can be used to identify them. Generally, a color image is created by assigning a hue to each distinctive spectral emission. This comprises the &quot;spectroscopy&quot; part of MRS. MRS is still experimental, and is available in only a few research centers.
Physicians mainly use MRS to study the brain and disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, and the effects of drugs on brain growth and metabolism. The technique is also useful in evaluating metabolic disorders of the muscles and nervous system. MRS is a noninvasive scan similar to an MRI that may be done at the same time as an MRI.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients of &gt;17 years of age.

             intraoperative frozen section or squash preparation.

          -  Solitary, supratentorial lesions that do not cross the midline

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;=60% (or the equivalent ECOG level
             of 0-2) (see Appendix A; Performance Status Evaluation) and an expected survival of &gt;
             three months.

          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic reserve with WBC&gt;=3000/mm3, absolute
