                  tests performed within 14 days prior to the start of the study and on the evening
                  prior to each dose administration. If dosing is scheduled on Sunday or Monday,
                  the HCG pregnancy test should be given within 48 hours prior to dosing of each
                  study period. An additional serum (Beta HCG) pregnancy test will be performed
                  upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. Acceptable

               3. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit including the
                  washout period, women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide containing
                  barrier method of contraception in addition to their current contraceptive
                  device. This advice should be documented in the informed consent form.

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for man and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women and within 15%

             Adults&quot;&quot; Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1999 (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS
             OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).
