    <textblock>
      This study will provide data on the response over 24 months to two commercial weight loss
      programs (center-based and telephone-based) compared to control conditions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first study aim is to test, in a randomized controlled trial, whether participation in
      the multifaceted traditional center-based commercial weight loss intervention program and/or
      the telephone-delivered commerical program is associated with a greater degree of weight loss
      at six, 12, and 18 months and whether weight loss is maintained over a 24-month period in
      overweight or obese women, compared to usual care or control conditions. This study utilizes
      a randomized study design with subjects assigned to the center-based weight loss program,
      telephone-delivered program, or a usual care control group. The second study aim is to
      describe the effect of participation in the weight loss programs (versus control conditions)
      on circulating lipids (fasting total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, low-density
      lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), carotenoids
      (a biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake), insulin, glucose, leptin, C-reactive protein,
      and vitamin D, and cardiopulmonary fitness. The center-based intervention involves in-person
      counseling and obtaining food items from the center, whereas the telephone-delivered program
      involves telephone counseling with food delivered to the home every two weeks.

      Secondary aims of this study involve describing the characteristics associated with greater
      weight loss and maintenance in each of the two intervention arms. The hypothesis to be tested
      is that selected participant characteristics, such as older or younger age, might be
      differentially associated with greater success across the two types of programs and
      approaches.

      Notably, the results of this study would contribute valuable data to the scientific knowledge
      base regarding the various modalities of communication for behavioral interventions
      (in-person versus telephone counseling). This is an important issue currently being
      considered and debated among clinical and community-based behavioral and nutritional
      scientists whose intervention efforts focus on promoting behavior change and positive effects
      on health-related outcomes such as weight reduction.
