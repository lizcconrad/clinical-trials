  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's quinapril HCl
      and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/25 mg tablets to Parke-Davis' Accuretic™ 20 mg/25 mg tablets
      following a single, oral 20 mg/25 mg (1 x 20 mg/25 mg) dose administered under fasting
      conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18 years and older.

          2. Sex: Male and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating female.

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum beta-human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy tests performed within 14 days prior to the start of
                  the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. If dosing is
                  scheduled on weekends, the HCG pregnancy test should be given within 48 hours
                  prior to dosing of each study period. An additional serum (beta-HCG) pregnancy
                  test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. Acceptable
                  forms of contraception include the following:

                    1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    3. surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or
                       postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at
                       least one year

               3. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit - including
                  the washout period, women of childbearing potential must use a spermicide
                  containing barrier method of contraception in addition to their current
                  contraceptive device. This advice should be documented in the informed consent
                  form.

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women and all
             subjects within 15% of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of
             &quot;&quot;Desirable Weights of Adults&quot;&quot; Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1999 (See Part II
             ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests, HIV
             test, 12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiate screen, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 14 days of the initial dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Institutionalized subjects will not be used.

          2. Social Habits:

               1. Use of any tobacco products within 1 year of the start of the study.

                  initial dose of the study medication.

               4. Any recent, significant change in dietary or exercise habits.

                  to the initial dose of study medication.

          4. Diseases:

               1. History of any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
                  hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic
                  disease.

               1. Clinically significant deviation from the Guide to Clinically Relevant
                  Abnormalities (See Part II ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS OF BIOEQUIVALENCE PROTOCOLS).

               2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing.

          6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days

          7. Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the initial
             dose of study medication.

          8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to quinapril, hydrochlorothiazide, or other related
             products such as other sulfonamide-derived drugs.
