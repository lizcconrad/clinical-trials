      This is a pilot study of a family-based educational program for patients with heart failure,
      and their family members.

      1. Objectives(s): We plan to conduct a feasibility pilot trial of the Family Partnership
           Intervention (FPI) compared to patients in the HF Wait-list (WL) condition. We plan to
           demonstrate feasibility, estimate variances of major outcome variables, and to obtain
           preliminary estimates of effect sizes in preparation for subsequent grant applications.
           We will be able to develop a cost-effectiveness model for the relative benefit of FPI
           vs. no family-based for use in longer-term studies.

        2. Research Design: This is a short-term, randomized clinical trial which will involve
           assessments for participants in the FPI condition at a pre-intervention Baseline point,
           immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Participants in the WL
           condition will be assessed at Baseline, undergo an approximately 8 week waiting period,
           and then the FPI. A longer follow-up is not planned based on the purpose of this study
           as a feasibility trial.

        3. Methodology: We plan to randomize 40 Veterans and their family members to either the FPI
           condition or WL condition, in equal proportions. We will recruit patients with at least
           Stage C Heart Failure (NYHA class I - IV) from the Cardiology clinic of the Philadelphia
           VAMC. FPI will involve 4-6 hours of intervention delivered over a period of 6-8 weeks.
           Assessments at a pre-treatment baseline point, 8 weeks (immediately post-treatment), and
           6 months will cover the following domains: a) patients' demographic characteristics and
           clinical functioning, b) self-care, including self-management of symptoms, knowledge of
           HF, and adherence to medication and dietary intake of sodium, c) measures of family
           functioning relevant to the medical care of the patient, and d) health care utilization
           costs. Primary outcome measures will be patients' self-reported HF self-care and health
           care utilization costs. We anticipate that patients in the FPI condition will exhibit
           better self-care over time compared to patients in the WL condition. We also anticipate
           that patients and family members will exhibit an improved family environment and better
           HF knowledge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stage C Heart Failure,[34] which refers to past or current symptoms of heart failure
             with underlying structural heart disease. Indicated by chronic systolic dysfunction
             (left ventricle [LV] ejection fraction &lt; 45%), diastolic dysfunction (with echo
             evidence of diminished compliance of the LV), or both.

          2. The patient's cardiologist has recommended or initiated one of the following to
             prevent decompensation: continuing diuretic treatment, fluid restrictions, and/or
             restriction/reduction of dietary sodium intake.

          3. A family member or members available for study participation with whom patient lives
             for at least 5 days a week. Emphasis will be given to the closest family members
             available (i.e., spouse).

          4. Subjects are able to give informed consent (see below for exclusion due to
             well-documented dementia or evidence of cognitive impairment).

          5. Patients will be age 50 or above. Younger patients may have a different family
             environment than the most common type of patient who is the target of the FPI
             intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a well-documented diagnosis of dementia

          2. Moderate or greater cognitive impairment, based on the Blessed Test of Orientation,
             Memory, and Concentration (BOMC)[26] score of 16.

          3. Patient's family member has BOMC score of 10 (i.e., mild or greater cognitive
             impairment).

          4. Inability to communicate verbally, major visual impairment, uncorrected hearing loss.

          5. Patient and/or family member reports &quot;frequent use&quot; illicit substance abuse within the
             past year. Scores on the AUDIT-C 4 indicating alcohol abuse/dependence.[30]

          6. Patient or family member has a current diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum psychiatric
             disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder).

          7. Patient indicates active suicidal ideation and evaluated as a clinical risk.

          8. Patient is in the Philadelphia VAMC home-telehealth program or some other incompatible
             intervention.

          9. Patient has an unstable medical condition that would likely prevent the subject from
             completing the study.
