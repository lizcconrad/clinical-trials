  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the effects of four weeks of mirror-box training on
      weakness of one arm secondary to stroke. Primary measures are function and strength.
      Secondary measures will evaluate muscle tone, flexibility, and the subject's perception of
      their everyday function and improvement. Research Hypothesis: For chronic upper limb
      hemiparesis secondary to stroke, four weeks of mirror-box training with movement of the
      unaffected limb only results in a mean increase of 10 points on the Fugl-Meyer Test of Motor
      Recovery (Upper Extremity).

      Due to the relatively new nature of mirror training, there are few randomized controlled
      studies. This pilot case series will serve as our initial step in trying to identify the
      frequency, duration, and treatment exercises needed in this population. Additionally, this
      pilot will allow us to ensure our outcome measures are appropriate to detect meaningful
      treatment changes. After obtaining informed consent, patients will undergo two separate
      baseline assessments of strength, function, and tone 4 weeks apart. Training sessions will
      consist of supervised activities using the unaffected arm while observing its mirror
      reflection; the affected arm will remain still. Sessions will be one hour a day, five days a
      week, for four weeks. Patients will be tested for strength, function and tone in the affected
      arm at completion of the four week treatment period by the same occupational therapist that
      performed the pretests.
