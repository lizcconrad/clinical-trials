    <description>Oral or intravenous voriconazole. Oral tablets 400 mg twice daily loading dose on first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily taken at least 1 hour before or after a meal. Oral doses could be increased to a maximum of 300 mg twice daily if there was no clinical improvement after at least 3 days of treatment, no serious adverse events were reported, and clinical chemistry parameters were within the acceptable range for study entry. Intravenous treatment was initiated with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg twice daily for the first day followed by 4 mg/kg twice daily for at least 3 days (maximum infusion rate of 3 mg/kg/hr if administered by peripheral intravenous line). An intravenous loading dose was not required in patients who were restarted after oral treatment. Total duration of therapy (intravenous and oral) was 12 weeks.</description>
