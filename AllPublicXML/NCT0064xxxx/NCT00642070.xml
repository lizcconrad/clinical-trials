      This study is being done to identify those elements of the immune response that may
      predispose a woman to recurrent urinary tract infection. We suspect that lesser effectiveness
      of certain components of the host response will lead to recurrent urinary tract infection. We
      will also evaluate the role that the bladder reservoir may play in recurrent urinary tract
      infection.

      Procedures subjects will undergo once they have read and signed the consent are:

      Questions about their medical and sexual history and current symptoms of urinary tract
      infection. They will be asked to provide a clean catch urine sample. We will collect
      periurethral, vaginal and rectal swabs. Blood will collected. They will be given a diary to
      take home and record all episodes of sexual intercourse, contraceptive use, vaginal and
      urinary symptoms and medication use.

      They will be given standard treatment for the current urinary tract infection. Follow-up
      visits will be scheduled 2 weeks,one month,two month and three month after initial visit.
