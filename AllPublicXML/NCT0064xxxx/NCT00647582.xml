      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      therapy during and after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving radiation therapy during
      and after lumpectomy and to see how well it works in treating women with stage I or stage II
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the feasibility and acute tolerability of intraoperative electron
           radiotherapy (IOERT) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after lumpectomy in women
           with stage I or II breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy.

        -  To determine the local tumor control and distant tumor control rates in these patients.

        -  To determine the long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of IOERT to the tumor bed
           and EBRT after lumpectomy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard lumpectomy. Patients with negative lymph nodes undergo
      intraoperative electron radiotherapy to the tumor bed. Beginning 2-8 weeks after surgery,
      patients undergo whole breast external beam radiotherapy once daily for 24-27 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 8 years.
