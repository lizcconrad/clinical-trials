      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 in combination with conventional whole brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT) in the treatment of subjects with solid tumors metastatic to the
      brain.

    <description>This is an open label study; therefore, there are no numbered/labeled study arms.
This is a dose escalation study, ABT-888 dose will be escalated in conjunction with two schedules of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Subjects may be treated WBRT for 3 weeks (15 days) or 2 weeks (10 days).</description>
