      The purpose of this open-label, single dose, two-treatment, two-period, cross-over study is
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of galantamine oral solution and
      galantamine tablet.

      This is an open-label, single dose, two-treatment, two-period, cross-over study to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of galantamine oral solution and galantamine
      tablet. All patients are healthy male patients who are 18-45 years old with BWI (Body Weight
      Index) between 18-28 kg/m2. All patients must sign informed consent before being enrolled. 24
      patients were randomized in the study. The duration of study is 9 days. All patients must
      stay at site unit for 12 hours after single oral administration otherwise patients could stay
      home but must return to site at specific date and time. The day before dosing day (baseline),
      patients were randomized to one of the two groups to be administered either 4mg galantamine
      oral solution (1ml) or galantamine tablet (1 tablet). After 7-day washout period, patients
      were crossed over to receive the other formulation. Pharmacokinetic observation will last to
      32 hours after dosing. Plasma were collected at immediately before dosing and 0.25, 0.5,
      0.75, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 32 hours after dosing to determine plasma concentration
      of galantamine. Safety and tolerance evaluation will last until Day 9. Safety evaluation
      include adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram and laboratory
      tests. On study Day 1, patients will take either 4mg galantamine oral solution (1ml) or 4mg
      galantamine tablet (1 tablet). After 7-day washout period, on Day 8, patients will cross over
      to take the other formulation, the dosage and administration are the same.

    <measure>It is estimated that the plasma maximal concentration of galantamine (Cmax=31.53mg×L-1) after single oral administration can be reached in Chinese young volunteers at the peak time of 1.66 hours. The half life is 7.06 hours.</measure>

    <measure>The relative bioavialibility of galantamine oral solution (4mg) indicated by AUC0-t and AUC0-inf are 105.6%±18.5% and 106.2%±19.5% respectively.</measure>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must meet the following criteria: body weight index is between 18-28
             kg/m2

          -  Patients are deemed healthy based on physical examination, medical history, vital
             signs, electrocardiogram and results of clinical laboratory tests

          -  All patients must be able to read and understand the contents of informed consent that
             must be signed prior to any trial-specific procedures are done.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting one or more of the following criteria cannot be included in the
             study: the patient uses disallowed medicine, which is any prescribed medication within
             the last 2 weeks or OTC drugs within the last week prior to dosing (or at least 5 half
             lives for any drug ingested). Patients who have taken any non-prescribed systemic or
             topical medication may still be entered into the study, if, in the opinion of the
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise safety

          -  The subject has history of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Patient has been treated with an investigational drug within 30 days prior to
             screening

          -  Patient has a know hypersensitivity to galantamine or has a history of severe drug
             allergy or hypersensitivity

          -  Patient has any serious illness such as liver or renal insufficiency, cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, metabolic and other chronic
             disturbance

          -  Patient has donated blood within 60 days prior to dosing

          -  Patient is a moderate or severe smoker who smokes more than 3 cigarettes, or
             ex-smokers who has ceased smoking for at least 3 months prior to dosing

          -  Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the clinical
             study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason
