  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the American Heart Association (AHA) 2011 update of heart disease and stroke
      statistics, more than 9 million adult patients in the United States (US) have angina. This
      update also notes that a study of 4 national cross-sectional health examination studies found
      that, among Americans 40 to 74 years of age, the age-adjusted prevalence of angina was higher
      among women than men. Per ACC/AHA guidelines, the goal of antianginal therapy is the complete
      or near complete elimination of anginal chest pain and a return to normal activities and
      functional capacity. However, evaluating angina and responses to antianginal therapy is often
      not straightforward. This is particularly true of female patients with angina. Because angina
      and response to antianginal therapy may differ in men and women, an instrument designed
      specifically to address symptomatology in women with angina could enhance our understanding
      and characterization of angina and responses to therapy in this population. The current study
      will evaluate the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the newly developed Women's
      Ischemia Symptom Questionnaire (WISQ) based on changes in angina symptomatology in a female
      angina population treated with ranolazine, compared with the widely used Seattle Angina
      Questionnaire (SAQ).

    <measure>Evaluate the Validity of the WISQ in Women With Chronic Angina Based on Changes in Patient-reported Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin (NTG) Consumption Before and Following Treatment With Ranolazine Assessed as Coefficient of Determination (R^2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Validity of the WISQ was assessed by regression analysis. Results of this analysis are reported as the estimated coefficient of determination (R^2) of the WISQ Total Score at 4 weeks regressed on 4-week angina frequency, 4-week NTG use, and DASI score at 4 weeks. For mean (SEM) Baseline and Week 4 values for angina frequency and NTG use, please refer to Secondary Outcome Measures 7 and 8. For mean (SEM) Baseline and Week 4 DASI values, please refer to Secondary Outcome Measure 9.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the Reliability of the WISQ in Women With Chronic Angina Based on Changes in Patient-reported Angina Frequency and NTG Consumption Before and Following Treatment With Ranolazine Assessed as Cronbach's Alpha Value</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Reliability of the WISQ was assessed by estimating Cronbach's alpha (standardized); values of 0.7 or higher were to be considered adequate. (Standardized Cronbach's alpha is a coefficient of reliability or consistency, and is a function of the average inter-item correlation.) Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the WISQ instrument overall and for the Angina Frequency/Severity and Angina Stability subscales. Missing item responses were not imputed.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the Responsiveness of the WISQ in Women With Chronic Angina Based on Changes in Patient-reported Angina Frequency and NTG Consumption Before and Following Treatment With Ranolazine Assessed by Regression Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Responsiveness of the WISQ was assessed as the estimated coefficient of determination (R^2) of the change from baseline WISQ Total Score at 4 weeks regressed on change from baseline angina frequency and change from baseline NTG use. For mean (SEM) Baseline and Week 4 values for angina frequency and NTG use, please refer to Secondary Outcome Measures 7 and 8.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine Whether the WISQ is Noninferior to the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) With Regard to Angina Frequency Items Based on Changes From Baseline (BL) in the Angina Frequency Items of the WISQ With the SAQ Following Ranolazine Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from BL in angina frequency items following ranolazine treatment were measured. Analysis: multiple linear regression; response variable: ΔWISQ - ΔSAQ; independent variables: age and BL WISQ and SAQ scores. WISQ items: 15 points (higher=more severe state); SAQ items: 12 points (lower=more severe state). WISQ scores were recalibrated by multiplying by .75. Noninferiority was to be considered demonstrated if the lower limit of a 2-sided 95% CI for WISQ mean - SAQ mean was above the prespecified margin (WISQ vs SAQ difference of -2).</description>

    <measure>Compare Changes From Baseline (BL) in the Physical Limitation Items of the WISQ With the SAQ Following Ranolazine Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from BL in stress, excitement, temperature, satiety, anger, and other limitation items following ranolazine treatment were measured. Analysis: multiple linear regression; response variable: ΔWISQ - ΔSAQ; independent variables: age and BL WISQ and SAQ scores. WISQ items: 27 points (higher=more severe state); SAQ items: 45 points (lower=more severe state). WISQ scores were recalibrated by multiplying by 15/27. Noninferiority was to be considered demonstrated if the lower limit of a 2-sided 95% CI for WISQ mean - SAQ mean was above the prespecified margin (WISQ vs SAQ difference of -2).</description>

    <measure>Determine Changes From Baseline in the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) Following Ranolazine Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The DASI was analyzed as mean values at baseline and Week 4. The DASI is a self-administered questionnaire that measures a patient's functional capacity. It can be used to get a rough estimate of a patient's peak oxygen uptake. The maximum score for the DASI is 58.2 (better functional ability/capacity) and the minimum score is 0 (worse functional ability/capacity).</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the Degree of Correlation Between Changes From Baseline in Items of the WISQ and SAQ With Changes From Baseline in Angina Frequency and NTG Diary Data and the DASI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The DASI is a self-administered questionnaire that measures a patient's functional capacity. It can be used to get a rough estimate of a patient's peak oxygen uptake. The maximum score for the DASI is 58.2 (better functional ability/capacity) and the minimum score is 0 (worse functional ability/capacity). The planned analysis was the amount of variation in WISQ and SAQ score changes from baseline explained by changes in angina frequency, NTG use, and DASI score assessed by multiple linear regression analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were enrolled at a total of 30 study sites in the US. The first patient was screened on 07 November 2007, and the last patient was screened on 06 December 2010. The last patient observation was on 20 January 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the 2-week qualifying phase, patients continued antianginal medications without changing dose or frequency and completed questionnaires to document angina symptoms, treatment and status. Patients who had average angina frequency of ≥ 2 attacks/week during this phase and met all enrollment criteria were enrolled in the open-label treatment phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Determine Whether the WISQ is Noninferior to the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) With Regard to Angina Frequency Items Based on Changes From Baseline (BL) in the Angina Frequency Items of the WISQ With the SAQ Following Ranolazine Treatment</title>
        <description>Changes from BL in angina frequency items following ranolazine treatment were measured. Analysis: multiple linear regression; response variable: ΔWISQ – ΔSAQ; independent variables: age and BL WISQ and SAQ scores. WISQ items: 15 points (higher=more severe state); SAQ items: 12 points (lower=more severe state). WISQ scores were recalibrated by multiplying by .75. Noninferiority was to be considered demonstrated if the lower limit of a 2-sided 95% CI for WISQ mean – SAQ mean was above the prespecified margin (WISQ vs SAQ difference of -2).</description>

Analysis: multiple linear regression; response variable: ΔWISQ – ΔSAQ; independent variables: age and BL WISQ and SAQ scores. WISQ items: 27 points (higher=more severe state); SAQ items: 45 points (lower=more severe state). WISQ scores were recalibrated by multiplying by 15/27. Noninferiority was to be considered demonstrated if the lower limit of a 2-sided 95% CI for WISQ mean – SAQ mean was above the prespecified margin (WISQ vs SAQ difference of -2).</description>

        <title>Evaluate the Responsiveness of the WISQ in Women With Chronic Angina Based on Changes in Patient-reported Angina Frequency and NTG Consumption Before and Following Treatment With Ranolazine Assessed by Regression Analysis</title>
        <description>Responsiveness of the WISQ was assessed as the estimated coefficient of determination (R^2) of the change from baseline WISQ Total Score at 4 weeks regressed on change from baseline angina frequency and change from baseline NTG use. For mean (SEM) Baseline and Week 4 values for angina frequency and NTG use, please refer to Secondary Outcome Measures 7 and 8.</description>

Patients completed self-administered questionnaires to document angina symptoms, response to antianginal treatment, and functional status. They also completed daily diaries to document the occurrence of angina episodes and NTG consumption.</description>

        <title>Evaluate the Degree of Correlation Between Changes From Baseline in Items of the WISQ and SAQ With Changes From Baseline in Angina Frequency and NTG Diary Data and the DASI</title>
        <description>The DASI is a self-administered questionnaire that measures a patient's functional capacity. It can be used to get a rough estimate of a patient's peak oxygen uptake. The maximum score for the DASI is 58.2 (better functional ability/capacity) and the minimum score is 0 (worse functional ability/capacity). The planned analysis was the amount of variation in WISQ and SAQ score changes from baseline explained by changes in angina frequency, NTG use, and DASI score assessed by multiple linear regression analysis.</description>
