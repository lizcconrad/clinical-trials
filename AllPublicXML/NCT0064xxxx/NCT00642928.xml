    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to define the minimum effective dose of BF 2.649 between 5 mg,
      10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg versus placebo in reducing the Excessive Daytime Sleepiness of
      Parkinson's disease patients

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by resting
      tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and loss of postural reflexes that affects 1% of the North
      American population. Besides these motor problems there are also so called non-motor
      problems.

      Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a bothersome non-motor problem, which affects 20% to
      50% of all PD patients and currently, there isn't any registered treatment for that trouble.

      The study medication BF2.649 tested here is a novel, highly potent, selective, orally active
      inverse agonist at the histamine H3 receptor, therefore strengthens histaminergic
      transmission in the brain and increases wakefulness EDS is characterized by daytime
      somnolence and sudden sleep episodes. This problem has several consequences, e.g., an
      impairment of quality of life, an interference with activities of daily living and other
      handicaps in the management of social and family affairs.

      The primary endpoint of this study will be measured by the change in the well-validated
      Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). The ESS is a simple self-administered 8-item questionnaire.
      The outcome is to get an impression about the level of the daytime sleepiness in several
      real-life situations.

      On the basis of this pharmacological and clinical rationale it is considered relevant to
      carry out a dose-finding study for this original, non-amphetamine molecule in PD patients
      affected by excessive daytime sleepiness. PD severity will be assessed by the routinely used
      UPDRS.
