    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's levothyroxine
      sodium 200 μg tablets to Abbott's Synthroid® 200 μg tablets following a single 600 μg (3 x
      200 μg) dose administration in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. Twenty-nine
      healthy, non-smoking, subjects between the ages of 18 and 47 completed this open-label,
      randomized, two-period, two-treatment, single-dose crossover study conducted by Dr. James D.
      Carlson at PRACS Institute, Ltd., Fargo, ND. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that
      90% confidence intervals were within the acceptable bioequivalent range of 80% and 125% for
      the natural log transformed parameters LNAUC0-48hr and LNCPEAK for baseline corrected total
      L-thyroxine. This study demonstrated that Mylan's 200 μg levothyroxine sodium tablets are
      bioequivalent to Abbott's Synthroid® 200 μg tablets following a single, oral 600 μg (3 x 200
      μg) dose under fasting conditions

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 18-50 years.

          2. Sex: Men and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating women.

               1. Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum β human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy tests performed within 14 days prior to of the study
                  and on the evening prior to each dose administration. An additional serum (β HCG)
                  pregnancy test will be performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential must practice abstinence or be using an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. Oral
                  contraceptives are not to be used within 3 months prior to dosing and throughout
                  the course of the study due to the fact that they increase serum TBG
                  concentrations, and therefore, elevate T4. Acceptable forms of contraception
                  include the following:

                    1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    3. postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at
                       least one year or surgical sterility (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or
                       hysterectomy).

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women, and within 15%
             of Ideal Body Weight (IBW), as referenced by the Table of &quot;Desirable Weights of
             Adults&quot; Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983 (See Part II Administrative Aspects
             of Bioequivalence Protocols).

          4. All subjects should be judged normal (euthyroid) and healthy during a prestudy medical
             evaluation (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, blood chemistry, serum T4
             (free and total), serum T3 (total only), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),

                  study medication.

               4. Any change in dietary or exercise habits throughout the duration of the study.

          3. Medications:
