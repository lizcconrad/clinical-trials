      -  All study participants must have regular access to the Internet, however, the study will
           not provide this access. Participants will be randomly placed in one of two study groups
           (Group 1 or Group 2).

        -  Group 1 participants will be asked to make 3 in-person visits, each lasting 75-90
           minutes. The following information will be collected: name, mailing address, telephone
           number, and email address. During the study visit, the following measurements will be
           taken: height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and dietary patterns.

        -  Group 1 participants will also receive counseling around diet and physical activity from
           a registered dietician and be asked to use a specialized website that will allow them to
           track eating and physical activity patterns, learn new weight management skills,
           interact with the dietician, and receive support from other participants.

        -  Group 1 will also receive 5 telephone counseling calls with a health counselor. During
           the telephone calls, we will teach the participant new skills such as tracking diet and
           physical activity, goal-setting and staying motivated.

        -  Group 2 participants will be asked to make 2 in-person visits, each lasting 75-90
           minutes in length. The following information will be collected: your name, mailing
           address, and telephone number. During the study visit, the following measurements will
           be taken: height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and dietary patterns.
