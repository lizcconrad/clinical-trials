    <textblock>
      A study of the effect of the early treatment with Pulmicort of newly diagnosed asthma.
      Patients will receive either Pulmicort or a non-active treatment for three years. Neither
      patients or investigators will be aware of the treatment received. After three years of
      treatment all patients will receive Pulmicort for 2 further years.
