      To evaluate the efficacy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a 40 kD (PEGASYS) combination therapy
      with ribavirin (Copegus)given for 24 or 48 weeks in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)
      virus infection genotype 2 or 3 who responded during (i.e. had HCV-RNA &lt;50 IU/mL at the end
      of previous therapy), but relapsed after (i.e. had detectable HCV-RNA after the end of prior
      treatment) previous therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin given for at least 12
      weeks and at most 24 weeks.
