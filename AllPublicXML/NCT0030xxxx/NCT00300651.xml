      The following study addresses the hypothesis that cognitive-behavioral interventions will be
      effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia under the conditions of
      the German health care system. It is also hypothesized that interventions designed to reduce
      delusions will reduce cognitive biases and dysfunctional self-concepts.

      Background: In spite of the proven effectiveness in a series of randomized controlled
      studies, cognitive-behavioural interventions for the treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia
      have been not yet been evaluated under the conditions of the German health care system.
      Additionally, it remains unclear which processes are responsible for reducing positive
      symptoms using CBT-interventions.

      Hypothesis: The following study addresses the hypothesis that CBT will be effective in
      reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It is also hypothesized that CBT
      will reduce cognitive biases and dysfunctional self-concepts.

      Method: 70 patients with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia will be randomized to a
      CBT-treatment- and a waiting-list-control-group. CBT involves a formulation-based treatment
      of approximately 25 sessions by trained and supervised therapists plus standard care
      (psychiatric medical treatment) in an outpatient setting. Participants will be referred from
      cooperating psychiatrists. Patients randomized to the waiting-list condition take part in the
      assessment phase, then receive standard care alone for 12 weeks and are then offered CBT. The
      primary outcome measure will be the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Additionally,
      depression, dysfunctional self-concepts and cognitive biases will be assessed before and
      after treatment.
