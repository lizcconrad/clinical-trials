  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiographic contrast agents are administered to all patients undergoing diagnostic or
      interventional catheterization procedures. Injection of contrast enables visualization of the
      vasculature with X-ray based fluoroscopy or cineangiographic imaging. Unfortunately, the use
      of radiographic contrast agents is often associated with severe adverse side effects,
      including acute kidney failure. Acute kidney failure following exposure to an intravascular
      contrast agent is also known as Radiocontrast Nephropathy (RCN).

      Physiologic factors that may put a patient at higher risk of developing RCN include:
      pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, age, cardiovascular disease
      (particularly congestive heart failure and low ejection fraction), and dehydration or other
      conditions characterized by depletion of effective circulatory volume. These risk factors are
      relatively common in patients undergoing catheterization procedures. Treatment of high-risk
      patients can be modified, by hydration and/or minimizing contrast volume; however despite
      these efforts, RCN remains a well-recognized complication of coronary catheterization
      procedures.

      Given the frequency and detrimental consequences of RCN, there is a compelling clinical need
      for safe and effective therapies to reduce the incidence of RCN. One such potential therapy
      is endovascular cooling to induce mild hypothermia. This study has been designed to evaluate
      whether endovascular cooling can reduce the incidence of RCN in high-risk patients who are
      undergoing diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures.
