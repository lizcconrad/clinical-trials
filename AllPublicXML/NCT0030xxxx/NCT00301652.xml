    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to access the efficacy of MMF compared to CTX in inducing
      remission and improving renal function in subjects with ANCA associated vasculitis with renal
      involvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ANCA-associated vasculitides can be life threatening. Glucocorticoids and
      cyclophosphamide therapy is effective in about 80% patients. However, the side effects such
      as bone marrow suppression, infection, cystitis, infertility, myelodysplasia preclude further
      use of cyclophosphamide in some patients and the relapse rate is high.

      Recent studies have shown that mycophenolic acid(MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate
      mofetil(MMF), could exhibit multifarious effects on endothelial cells, including inhibition
      of ICAM-1 expression, neutrophil attachment,IL-6 secretion, and the process of angiogenesis,
      which contribute to the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of vasculitic lesions such as lupus
      nephritis with vasculitic lesions. This study was a feasibility study to assess the safety
      and effectiveness of MMF in inducing remission in subjects with ANCA-associated SVV compared
      with pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide. After enrollment, subjects were followed
      longitudinally, and formal measurements of disease activity were determined using the
      Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS).
