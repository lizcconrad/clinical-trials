      This protocol will evaluate the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) combined
      with beta-blocker therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure in whom beta-blocker
      therapy was either not tolerated or could not be up titrated to optimal doses before CRT.
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy will be combined with automatic implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator (AICD, CRT-D) as it has been shown to be associated with an improvement in
      prognosis in the patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure.

      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effect of CRT combined with beta-blocker
      therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure in whom beta-blocker therapy was either
      not tolerated or could not be up-titrated to optimal doses before CRT.
