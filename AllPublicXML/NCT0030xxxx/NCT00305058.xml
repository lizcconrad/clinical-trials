  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine which opiate pain medication (morphine or
      hydromorphone (Dilaudid)) is more effective in the treatment of acute pain in patients
      presenting to the emergency department.

      Pain is cited as the most frequent reason for visit to emergency departments (EDs) (McCaig,
      2001). It can be estimated from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an
      annual survey of a representative sample of visits to US EDs, that there are 17 million
      visits per year to US EDs for specific complaints of pain, 29 million visits including “back
      symptoms” and “injuries not otherwise specified” as well as specific mentions of pain.
      However it is widely acknowledged that pain is seriously under-treated in the ED as well as
      in other health care settings (Ducharme, 1996; Selbst, 1990; Wilson, 1989). The concern
      regarding under-treatment is reflected in new standards for pain management developed by the
      Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requiring assessment of
      pain at triage in the ED and referring to pain measurement as the “fifth vital sign”
      (Philips, 2000).

      Proper pain management is a tremendous challenge to ED physicians as pain is not only a
      noxious experience but also a symptom of injury and disease that needs to be understood and
      appropriately treated. Further complicating pain management is the large interpersonal
      variability in pain perception and expression reflecting cultural, contextual, and individual
      differences between people. Reasons for under-treating pain include concern over side effects
      of opioids, perception of pain complaints as possible drug-seeking behavior, under-staffing,
      concern that analgesics will mask symptoms, delay early diagnosis, treatment, and contribute
      to risks of tolerance and dependence in vulnerable patients.

      The elderly represent a group of patients who may experience pain differently from the
      non-elderly patient (Li 2001, Collins 1966, Walsh 1989, Woodrow 1972). This growing
      population has been significantly underrepresented in pain-related studies. Some studies have
      shown that the elderly are at risk for “oligoanalgesia” and receive inadequate doses of pain
      medication (Jones 1996).

      Morphine has long been considered the gold standard in pain control. Hydromorphone is another
      powerful opiate that has been used extensively for the management of post-operative pain and
      morphine-resistant cancer-related pain. A recent Cochrane review on the use of hydromorphone
      found 32 studies that focused on acute pain (Quigley, 2003). Of these 32 studies, only 9
      involved intravenous forms of hydromorphone (Coda, 1997; Collins, 1996; Deutsch, 1968;
      Jasani, 1994; Liu, 1995; Mahler, 1975; Rapp, 1996; Searle, 1994; Urquhart, 1988). Of these 8
      studies, 5 involved patient controlled analgesia, and only 1 study compared IV hydromorphone
      to IV morphine (Mahler, 1975). The Cochrane review concludes that there are gaps in the
      understanding of the efficacy and potency of hydromorphone. Only 1 study of hydromorphone in
      the ED could be located and this compared IV hydromorphone versus IV meperidine in patients
      with ureteral colic (Jasani, 1994). Although this study showed hydromorphone was superior at
      all time periods and had fewer side effects, the study used fixed doses of hydromorphone
      (1mg) and meperidine (50mg).

      It has been the clinical experience of some ED physicians that hydromorphone may be a better
      opiate in patients presenting to the ED with acute pain. Hydromorphone is also the opiate
      that is usually given if morphine does not adequately control a patient’s pain in the ED.

      Hydromorphone may also have other benefits, such as a faster onset since it is more
      lipophilic than morphine and crosses the blood-brain barrier faster.

      If it is shown that hydromorphone gives better pain relief to patients with comparable or
      fewer side effects when compared with morphine, then we may be able to provide evidence to
      suggest that hydromorphone should be the parenteral opiate of choice for adult ED patients
      presenting with acute pain of moderate to severe intensity.
