  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis is that the therapeutic response and pharmacological resistance to ADs in
      depressed patients can be associated with a polymorphism for the BDNF gene. The research of
      allelic forms associated to lesser efficiency or inefficiency of ADs could add to the body of
      evidence that BDNF mediates the mechanism of action of ADs, and could have important
      practical implications. We propose to compare in a group of patients with major depression,
      the allelic variability of the BDNF gene between responders and non-responders after a 3-week
      period and a 6-week period of SSRI treatment.

      -  The main objective is to research an association between polymorphism for the BDNF gene
           and the 3-week and 6-week response to a SSRI treatment (escitalopram) in major
           depression.

        -  A case control pilot study without any direct individual benefit (200 patients).

        -  Study period: 24 months.

        -  Scores from reliable and validated psychometric scales (Montgomery and Asberg Depression
           Scale, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) specifically analysing depression
           dimension at the time of inclusion, after three and six weeks of antidepressant
           treatment.

        -  Genetic analysis researching a polymorphism of the BDNF gene is done by a blood sample
           at the baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient suffering a severe depressive episode (according to DSM-IV), evolving since at
             least 2 weeks before entering the study

          -  Age superior to 18 years

          -  Caucasian type

          -  In absence of any medicinal treatment that could enhance depression: methyldopa,
             beta-blockers, reserpine,

          -  In absence of hypothyroidia or anaemia

          -  Without comorbidity that could affect therapy response : e.g. food disorder, substance
             abuse or dependence syndrome

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Will be excluded from the study the patients for which a modification of the depression
        diagnosis (according to the DSM-IV criteria) takes place during the period of study
