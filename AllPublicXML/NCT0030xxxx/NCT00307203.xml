    <textblock>
      Many individuals with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes. Individuals in the schizophrenic
      population often find it difficult to quit smoking. The purpose of this trial is to determine
      the safety and effectiveness of bupropion in treating individuals with schizophrenia who
      smoke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia affects 1 % of the population. Among individuals with schizophrenia, between 74
      and 92 % smoke cigarettes regularly. Heavy smoking represents a significant and neglected
      public health problem for people with schizophrenia; smoking cessation treatment is often
      overlooked as part of the psychiatric care for such individuals.

      The most effective treatment for smoking cessation described to date is sustained release
      (SR) bupropion. Past research suggests that SR bupropion may be especially effective in
      individuals with depressive symptoms, including individuals with schizophrenia. The purpose
      of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SR bupropion, when combined with
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in individuals with schizophrenia.

      This trial will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive SR bupropion
      or placebo. All participants will receive weekly CBT. Participants will be followed for 3
      months following completion of the 12-week treatment session.
