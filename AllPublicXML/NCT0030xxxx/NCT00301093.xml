      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified cancer cells may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill cancer cells. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vaccine therapy together with
      imatinib mesylate may be an effective treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy
      when given together with imatinib mesylate in treating patients with chronic phase chronic
      myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of GM-K562 cell vaccine when administered with
           imatinib mesylate in patients with persistent chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia
           in first hematologic response.

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of GM-K562 cell vaccination in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the disease response by serial BCR-ABL quantitative polymerase chain reaction
           measurements in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the development of tumor immunity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of GM-K562.

      Patients continue to receive oral imatinib mesylate at the same stable dose as before study
      entry. Patients receive GM-K562 subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 85, 113, and 141
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 10 patients receive escalating doses of GM-K562 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 10 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 20 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
