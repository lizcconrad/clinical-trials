  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of IMPROVE is to define the optimal maintenance therapy for ANCA-associated
      vasculitides (AASV) by comparing the AZA (standard regimen) with MMF in terms of efficacy,
      i.e. in preventing relapses.

      HYPOTHESIS :

      MMF might be more effective than azathioprine as maintenance drug in AASV patients, reducing
      by 50% relapse rate, with a same frequency of adverse effects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AASV, including Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and renal
      limited vasculitis (RLV), are progressive, multisystem, autoimmune diseases which require the
      prescription of immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment using corticosteroids and cytotoxic
      drugs has been standardised (ECSYSVASTRIAL project), but relapse rate remains high and
      treatment-related toxicity is non negligible. The IMPROVE trial aims to reduce this relapse
      rate by using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for maintenance therapy. The potential benefit of
      MMF has been suggested in a published open and uncontrolled study. Patients with newly
      diagnosed systemic AASV will be randomly assigned to receive either MMF or reference
      treatment with azathioprine (AZA), once remission has been obtained with cyclophosphamide and
      prednisone. MMF and AZA will be continued for a total of 42 months of therapy with
      concomitant prednisone dose tapering. The study will last 48 months. Hence, within the last 6
      months of the study duration, the patients will not receive any immunosuppressive drugs.

      The primary end-point will the disease-free period, taken as the period of time from
      remission until relapse or study end; secondary end-points will be adverse events, cumulative
      damage (assessed using damage score VDI) and immunosuppressive drug cumulative dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed patients with WG, MPA or renal-limited vasculitis.

          -  ANCA positivity. ANCA positivity requires PR3-ANCA or a typical cANCA pattern by
             indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), preferably confirmed by anti-PR3 ELISA. MPO-ANCA
             determined by ELISA requires demonstration of pANCA, and pANCA by IIF requires
             confirmation by anti-MPO ELISA. Optionally, central review of ANCA serology can be
             performed.

          -  Age 18 to 75 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any cytotoxic drug within previous year, unless started within one months of entry and
             according to the protocol design

          -  Co-existence of another systemic autoimmune disease, e.g. SLE

          -  Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection

          -  HIV positivity

          -  Failure to achieve remission after 6 months of CYC therapy

          -  Failure to control progressive disease with induction protocol

          -  Malignancy (usually exclude unless agreed with trial co-ordinator)

          -  Pregnancy or inadequate contraception

          -  Age below 18 and above 75 years*

          -  Endstage renal failure unless active extrarenal disease requires treatment (temporal
             dependency of hemodialysis is not an exclusion criterion)

          -  Inability for informed consent

               -  After discussion with the trial administrator, patients less than 18 years may be
                  incorporated on separate application according to the appropriate local ethic
                  committee.
