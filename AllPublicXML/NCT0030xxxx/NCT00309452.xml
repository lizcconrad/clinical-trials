  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effectiveness of a specialized package of
      phase-specific treatments for individuals in the midst of their first episode of psychosis.
      The pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments will be delivered within a state public mental
      health center.

    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a clinical trial for first episode psychosis patients not eligible for
      CMHC services that will compare randomized access to care at CMHC versus the usual procedure
      of referral to community providers outside CMHC. Patients randomized to access to CMHC
      services will receive multifaceted, intensive, phase-specific care delivered by a specialized
      clinical team. This care will include five principal components: antipsychotic prescription,
      multi-family group therapy, group cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive remediation and
      individual case management including supportive, problem solving approaches and a focus on
      resumption of movement towards educational and/or employment related goals. All consenting
      subjects will undergo research evaluations every six months for up to five years. Outcomes
      will be assessed in the domains of re-admission (primary outcome), relapse, symptoms, overall
      functioning, quality of life, education and employment, treatment satisfaction, adherence,
      substance use, adverse events (including self-harm) and economic measures including service
      use, cost of care and forensic data.

    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. A higher score indicates better functioning.
The score reported is a change from baseline. The change was calculated as score at 12 months minus score from baseline. A positive score indicates higher functioning.</description>

    <description>The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a 21-item scale rated from a semistructured interview providing information on symptoms and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. Each item is rated on a seven point scale, and a higher score reflects normal or unimpaired functioning. The range is from 0 to 126.
The score reflected is a change from baseline. Total score at 12 months minus total score at baseline. A positive score indicates better mental health.</description>
