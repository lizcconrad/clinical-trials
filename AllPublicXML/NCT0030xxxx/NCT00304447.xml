      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on the frequency and
      severity of Mylotarg® infusion-related adverse events, to evaluate the effect of
      corticosteroids on the efficacy of Mylotarg® induced complete response (CR) and complete
      response with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) at one-month post treatment.
