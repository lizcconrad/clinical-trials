  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a major health problem. It was hypothesized that isoflavone-containing
      products may be a potential alternative to HRT for preventing bone loss during the menopausal
      transition. We investigated whether one-year consumption of isoflavone-enriched foods
      affected bone mineral density, bone metabolism and hormonal status in early postmenopausal
      women in a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled parallel multi-centre trial.

      Two hundred and thirty-seven healthy early post-menopausal women (age 53 ± 3 y; time since
      last menses 33 ± 15 months) consumed isoflavone-enriched foods providing a mean daily intake
      of 110 mg isoflavone aglycones or control products for 1 yr whilst continuing their habitual
      diet and lifestyle. Outcome measures included bone mineral density of lumbar spine and total
      body, markers for bone formation and bone resorption, hormones, isoflavones in plasma and
      urine, safety parameters and reporting of adverse events.
