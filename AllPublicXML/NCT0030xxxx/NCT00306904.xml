  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary
      efficacy of 3 doses of Cand5. Cand5 is a small interfering RNA molecule that selectively
      silences the mRNA encoding for VEGF. The target population are patients with diabetic macular
      edema.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of newly diagnosed blindness in the working age
      (20-74) population in the United States1 and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading
      cause of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy. DME is the result of the breakdown of the
      retinal capillary endothelium in patients with diabetes mellitus (Type I and II).

      A key factor in the development of DME is the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier. The
      breakdown of the endothelial tight junctions of the capillary walls in the retinal
      vasculature leads to increased permeation of salts, proteins, and water from the capillary
      luminal side of the barrier and the accumulation of fluid in the extracellular space.
      Multiple agents appear to contribute to the disruption of the blood-retina barrier,including
      vasoactive agents, prostaglandin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a
      peptide that promotes neovascularization and increases vascular permeability. If the
      resulting fluid is more than the amount that can be removed through the active pump mechanism
      (retinal pigmented epithelium), fluids continue to accumulate and edema develops. When
      thickening evolves or threatens the center of the fovea there is a high risk of visual loss.

      Cand5 is a synthetic double stranded RNA (dsRNA) oligonucleotide. The molecule is a duplex
      formed by the hybridization of two partially complementary single strand RNAs in which the 3'
      end are capped with 2 deoxyribose (dT) units. Hybridization occurs across 19 ribose base
      pairs to yield the Cand5 molecule. Cand5 has a molecular weight of 13,345 grams/mole. Cand5
      selectively silences the mRNA encoding for VEGF.

      A comparison will be made between the three (3) treatment arms with regard to safety,
      efficacy, and duration of effect to determine a safe and efficacious dose of Cand5
      appropriate for evaluation in future pivotal trials.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be male or female age 21 or older.

          2. Patient must sign (and be given) a copy of the written informed consent form.

          3. Patients must have the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Patients
             with the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is
             present:

               -  Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes mellitus OR

               -  Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of
                  diabetes OR

               -  Documented diabetes by WHO criteria

          4. Patients must have ETDRS best corrected visual acuity of 69 to 24 letters (20/40 to
             20/320 Snellen Equivalent) in the study eye.
