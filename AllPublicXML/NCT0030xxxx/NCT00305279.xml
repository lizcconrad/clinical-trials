    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of different amounts of phosphorus in
      the diet on hormones that control phosphorus and bone health both in people who are healthy
      and in ones who have moderate kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease affects 11% of the US population; over half of those affected have
      skeletal manifestations of their renal disease. Renal osteodystrophy is a complex disease, in
      which multiple mineral systems and related hormones play a role, including phosphate
      homeostasis. Phosphate regulation primarily depends on renal handling of phosphate, which is
      partly controlled by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. However, other mediators in this
      system clearly exist. Recently, evidence has been accruing that one such factor may be FGF23,
      a protein produced by osteogenic cells. States of excess FGF23 are associated with marked
      phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and inappropriately low calcitriol. FGF23
      levels are measurable in healthy humans and markedly elevated in patients who require
      hemodialysis, although its physiologic role in either state is unknown. Some retrospective
      evidence suggests that FGF23 is affected by phosphate intake. We are performing a study to
      gather data describing the response of FGF23 to changes in dietary phosphorus intake in
      healthy men and women and in men and women with moderate renal insufficiency. The specific
      aims of this pilot study are: 1) To examine the physiologic effects of alterations in dietary
      phosphorus on FGF23 in healthy subjects; 2) To examine the physiologic response of FGF23 to
      dietary phosphorus alterations in patients with moderate renal failure; and 3) To assess
      whether serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D vary inversely with those of FGF23 when
      dietary phosphate is changed. The proposed research plan is a dietary intervention trial in
      which we will study the response of serum FGF23 levels to diets with varying phosphorus
      contents in healthy adults and adults with moderate renal insufficiency.
