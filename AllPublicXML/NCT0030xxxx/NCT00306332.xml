      T-cell and B-cell depletion in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation by using
      immunomagnetic negative and positive selection procedures

      Background:

      Removal of T-cells from the donor graft (T-cell depletion) offers the possibility for
      prevention of GVHD and subsequently less transplant related morbidity and mortality after
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). There are several techniques to deplete T-cells
      from the stem cell grafts e.g. physical, immunological and combined physical / immunological
      separation methods. All these techniques result in a stem cell graft with sufficient CD34+
      stem cells combined with an adequate depletion of T and B cells. CD34+ selected stem cell
      grafts are very pure and do not contain any additional cell populations. In contrast,
      CD3+/CD19+ depleted grafts still contain NK-cells, monocytes and dendritic cells that are
      part of the innate immune system. Theoretically,the presence of these cells may positively
      influence immunological reconstitution and the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect,
      respectively, resulting in improved outcome after SCT

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the differences in immunological reconstitution, transplant related mortality,
      disease-free survival and overall survival after T-cell depleted allogeneic SCT for
      haematological malignancies using either immunomagnetic CD34+ selection or immunomagnetic
      CD3+/CD19+ depletion using the CliniMACS system in approximately 270 consecutive patients.

      Additionally in this study in 20 consecutive patients the kinetics of NK-cel reconstitution
      and differences in NK-cell repertoire will be monitored. NK-cell mediated anti-tumor
      reactivity will be monitored in patients transplanted with and without NK-cells in the stem
      cell graft (CD3+/CD19+ depletion, versus CD34+ selection). Secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the clinical relevance of minor histocompatibility-specific cytotoxic T-cell
      responses for the GVL effect, the kinetics of NK-cell reconstitution and differences in
      NK-cell repertoire using the different T-cell depletion protocols.

      Design:

      Single center prospective randomised phase III study

      Population:

      Patients eligible for allogeneic SCT according to the standard criteria of our institution
      who will receive an allogeneic T- and B-cell depleted SCT with peripheral stem cells of an
      HLA-identical sibling donor or an HLA-identical unrelated voluntary (VUD) donor.

      Intervention:

      T-cell depletion will be conducted using two different techniques: either immunomagnetic
      CD34+ selection or immunomagnetic CD3+/CD19+ depletion.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoints are immunological reconstitution, relapse, disease free survival and
      overall survival. Secondary endpoints: NK-cell reconstitution and NK-cell mediated
      anti-tumour reactivity. Cytotoxic T-cell responses for the GVL effect.

      Estimated efforts and risks for participating patients:

      We don't expect any extra patient efforts or risks because T-cell depletion is a standard
      procedure in our clinic for many years. There is extensive experience with immunological
      T-cell depletion techniques. We hypothesize CD3+/CD19+ depletion will favour stem cell
      transplant outcome. Immunological and molecular biological studies will be performed on blood
      samples already obtained as part of the standard protocol.
