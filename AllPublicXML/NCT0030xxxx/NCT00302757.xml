  <official_title>Multicenter Phase I/II Study of Radioimmunotherapy With 90Y-ibritumomab Tiuxetan in a Nonmyeloablative Conditioning Regimen for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation From HLA-identical Donors in Patients With Advanced Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the additional use of radioimmunotherapy with a 90-Yttrium labeled
      monoclonal antibody targeting lymphoma cells in two dose reduced conditioning regimens for
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical
      donors. Radioimmunotherapy should allow an increased anti-lymphoma effect of the conditioning
      while the allogeneic grafts may confer potent graft versus lymphoma effects and rescue from
      potential hematopoietic side effects of the radioimmunotherapy. The study evaluates the
      feasibility and toxicity of such approach and will also analyze disease response and survival
      of the patients treated.
