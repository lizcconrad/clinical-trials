  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of one-day famciclovir (1000 mg twice a day
      (b.i.d)) in reducing the duration of genital herpes lesions and the associated symptoms
      compared to three-day treatment with valacyclovir (500 mg capsule b.i.d).

    <measure>Investigator-assessed Time to Healing of All Non-aborted Genital Herpes Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after initiation of study medication up to Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Time to healing of all non-aborted genital herpes lesions was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug taken no earlier than the recurrence of genital herpes to the investigator-assessed time of healing (i.e. loss of all crusts and re-epithelialization of the lesions; erythema could have been present). Non-aborted lesions are lesions which underwent vesicle, ulcer/soft crust, and/or hard crust formation and required re-epithelialization for healing. The median time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method by censoring missing values at the time of last clinical lesion observation.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Aborted Genital Herpes Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after initiation of study medication up to Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Lesions that developed no further than the papule stage (erythema may have been present) were considered as aborted lesions. Prodrome also was considered the sign of aborted lesions in this study. Lesions which underwent vesicle, ulcer/soft crust, and/or hard crust formation and required re-epithelialization for healing were considered as non-aborted lesions.</description>

    <description>Lesions that developed no further than the papule stage (erythema may have been present) were considered as aborted lesions.

    <measure>Time to Resolution of Symptoms Associated With Recurrent Genital Herpes</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after initiation of study medication up to Day 20</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimated time in hours of the resolution of all symptoms (pain, burning, itching, tingling and tenderness) associated with recurrent genital herpes. Kaplan-Meier method is used to estimate the time to resolution of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With a Second Recurrence of Genital Herpes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after investigator assessed healing of first recurrence of genital herpes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who experienced a first recurrence of genital herpes and took study medication were followed for a period of up to 6 months to the second recurrence.</description>

    <measure>Time to a Second Recurrence of Genital Herpes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after investigator assessed healing of first recurrence of genital herpes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who experienced a first recurrence of genital herpes and took study medication were followed for a period of up to 6 months to the second recurrence. Time to a second recurrence of genital herpes was calculated in 2 ways as follows:
From the date of treatment initiation no earlier than the recurrence of genital herpes to the date of onset for the second recurrence, or
From the date of healing of non-aborted lesions or confirmation of aborted lesions to the date of onset for the second recurrence.</description>

    <description>Patients received Famciclovir 1000 mg (2 x 500 mg tablets) twice a day for one day. The first dose was to be taken within 6 hours after onset of prodromal symptoms or genital herpes lesions and the second dose approximately 12 hours later. Patients also received 1 valacyclovir placebo capsule, beginning with the first famciclovir dose, twice a day for 3 days, each taken about 12 hours apart.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1179 patients were randomized in the study and followed to their first genital herpes recurrence. A total of 423 patients did not experience a recurrence within 4 months of randomization therefore, no treatment was initiated and study drug was not taken. A total of 756 patients were randomized and took study drug (safety population).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Investigator-assessed Time to Healing of All Non-aborted Genital Herpes Lesions</title>
        <description>Time to healing of all non-aborted genital herpes lesions was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug taken no earlier than the recurrence of genital herpes to the investigator-assessed time of healing (i.e. loss of all crusts and re-epithelialization of the lesions; erythema could have been present). Non-aborted lesions are lesions which underwent vesicle, ulcer/soft crust, and/or hard crust formation and required re-epithelialization for healing. The median time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method by censoring missing values at the time of last clinical lesion observation.</description>
