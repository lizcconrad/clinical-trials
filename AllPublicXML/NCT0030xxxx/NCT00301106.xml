      RATIONALE: Biological therapy using a gene-modified virus that can make interleukin-12 may
      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a gene-modified
      virus that can make interleukin-12 in treating women with breast cancer that has spread to
      the liver.

      Direct intratumoral injection of metastatic hepatic tumors using an adenoviral vector
      expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene (Adv.RSV-hIL12, also termed ADV-hIL-12).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Study the toxicity of escalating doses of adenoviral vector expressing the human
           recombinant interleukin-12 gene, administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection, in
           women with liver metastasis secondary to breast cancer.

        -  Determine tumor responses produced by this regimen.

        -  Determine immune responses induced by this regimen.
