      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and vinorelbine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known
      whether giving combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy is more effective than
      giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy followed by more chemotherapy
      in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy followed by
      radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to combination chemotherapy combined with
      radiation therapy followed by more chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III non-small
      cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage III non-small cell cancer treated
           with chemotherapy comprising cisplatin and vinorelbine ditartrate (CV) followed by
           radical radiotherapy versus concurrent CV chemoradiotherapy followed by CV chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the local progression-free survival (local control).

        -  Compare the hematological, pulmonary, esophageal, and neurological toxicities.

        -  Compare the response.

        -  Compare the quality of life.

        -  Compare the cost-effectiveness.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      clinically important factors. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (sequential treatment): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and
           vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3
           weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Beginning in week 15, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II (concurrent treatment): Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I beginning in
           week 1. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and vinorelbine
           ditartrate IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for
           up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, monthly for 6 months, and then at each follow-up
      visit.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 508 patients will be accrued for this study.
