  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of local anaesthesia efficiently reduces pain due to needle puncture. However, when
      tuberculin skin test is performed it is the skin reaction to tuberculin injection that is
      studied. It is a quantitative skin reaction measured in millimiters. From the study of
      literature it is not known whether local anaesthetic modify skin reaction to tuberculin.
      Therefore, before recommending the use local anaesthesia for tuberculin intradermal injection
      we have to rule out a potential effect of local anaesthetic on the result of the test. This
      is particularly important in children, since there are more sensitive to pain than adults
