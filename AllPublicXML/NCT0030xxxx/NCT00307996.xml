      The purpose of this study is to examine whether CoQ10 administration is effective as an
      antioxidant in hemodialysis patients.

    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress has been recognized as a potential risk factor for such complications as
      atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. This study investigates whether CoQ10
      administration is effective for protecting oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients. The
      subjects were recruited from day-time hemodialysis patients in Iwata City Hospital. 100 mg
      CoQ10 was administered every HD for 6 months. Several oxidative and antioxidative markers
      were measured in plasma at pre, 1, 3, 6 months and after washout.
