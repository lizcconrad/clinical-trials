  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to document the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy
      of OROS and immediate release (IR) MPH using PET scanning with C-11 altropane as the ligand.
      We hypothesize that the time to maximal receptor occupancy and the degree of receptor
      occupancy of immediate release (IR) MPH will be shorter and greater (respectively) than with
      an equipotent dose of OROS MPH.

      This protocol seeks to document the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy of OROS and
      immediate release (IR) MPH using PET and C-11 altropane. The main target of MPH in the brain
      is the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure
      DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This research will
      provide novel and unique information toward a better understanding of the mechanism of action
      of long-acting stimulant formulations to enable new drug development and an estimation of the
      relative abuse potential of the current formulation.
