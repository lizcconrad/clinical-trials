  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether long-term chronic alcoholism is associated
      with changes in emotional functioning and brain structure and function.

      This research investigates brain structure and function in alcoholics compared to healthy
      nonalcoholic individuals. Alcoholics have shown impairments in cognitive processing of
      emotional signals. Some alcoholics are impaired in social skills, and many are unable to
      implement the strategies for interpersonal interactions that they recommend for themselves.
      For example, alcoholics have difficulty interpreting non-verbal emotional cues and
      recognizing facial expressions of emotion. When listening to sentences, alcoholics also have
      some difficulty judging emotional intonations and emotional content. In our research, we are
      trying to understand where in the brain these emotional behaviors take place, and whether or
      not the brain functions differently for alcoholic and nonalcoholic individuals. We present
      emotional words and pictures on a computer screen, and using MRI scans, we observe how the
      brain works when people purposefully respond to the words and pictures. Additionally, we are
      comparing brain structure and activation patterns in men and women, because there may be
      gender differences in responses to emotional stimuli.

        Alcoholics and demographically equivalent healthy controls who have participated in one or
        more of our prior studies are contacted by telephone to determine whether or not they would
        like to participate again. Potential participants who have not previously been enlisted in
        any of our studies are recruited through fliers placed in the Boston Veterans Affairs
        Healthcare System, BU School of Medicine, and after-care programs in the Boston area, and
        through ads in local newspapers and web sites. For &quot;new&quot; participants, subject selection
        procedures include an initial prescreening telephone interview to determine identifying
        information such as age, level of education, health history, and history of alcohol and
        drug use and if eligible are invited to the laboratory for further screening and
        neuropsychological evaluations.
