      RATIONALE: Zoledronate and ibandronate may prevent or help relieve bone pain and other
      symptoms caused by bone metastases. It is not yet known whether zoledronate is more effective
      than ibandronate in preventing bone problems caused by bone metastases due to breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate to see how well it works
      compared to ibandronate in preventing bone problems in women with stage IV breast cancer that
      has spread to the bone.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of zoledronate vs ibandronate, in terms of preventing the
           occurrence of skeletal-related events (SRE) (e.g., fracture, spinal cord compression,
           radiotherapy or surgery for bone symptoms or events, or hypercalcemia ≥ grade 3), in
           women with stage IV breast cancer and bone metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the change in patient-reported measures of pain and use of analgesics in
           patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the time to first clinically apparent SRE in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these drugs.

        -  Compare the changes in performance status and overall survival of patients treated with
           these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to
      hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR] negative vs ER
      and/or PR positive) and current evidence of fracture (vertebral or nonvertebral) or spinal
      compression (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral ibandronate once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1. In both arms,
           treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, every 3 courses during study treatment,
      and at the end of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 488 patients will be accrued for this study.
