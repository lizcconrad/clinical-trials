  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      D-cycloserine may help lessen pain and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy caused by
      chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether D-cycloserine is more effective than a placebo in
      treating peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to study
      D-cycloserine at 2 different doses to see how well each works compared to the other and to a
      placebo in treating cancer patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Initially, patients were
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (D-cycloserine 250 mg twice daily or placebo twice
      daily), and treated for up to 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Later, the design was changed to randomize patients to 1 of 3 arms as follows:

        -  D-cycloserine 50 mg twice daily for up to 12 weeks

        -  D-cycloserine 200 mg twice daily for up to 12 weeks

        -  Placebo twice daily for up to 12 weeks
