    <textblock>
      This study will test an experimental antiviral drug called SIGA-246 for use against the
      smallpox virus (variola). Although smallpox has been universally eradicated, it could
      possibly be brought back as a bioweapon. In the event of a smallpox attack, it would be best
      to have an antiviral medication in addition to the smallpox vaccine. SIGA-246 has shown to
      have activity against other viruses from the same family (orthopoxvirus) that smallpox
      belongs to.

      Healthy volunteers who are 18-50 years of age and are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical
      examination, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive a one-time dose of SIGA-246 (either 500 mg,
      1000 mg, or 2000 mg) or a placebo (sugar pill) taken by mouth. They report to the clinic in
      the morning for the following procedures:

        -  Insertion of intravenous (IV) line in the forearm.

        -  Blood and urine tests before taking the study drug.

        -  Drug administration within 30 minutes of eating a light breakfast.

        -  Blood sampling from the IV line at 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5 and 6,
           10 and 12 hours after taking SIGA-246 to determine how the drug is absorbed,
           distributed, broken down and excreted. Samples are also collected by needle stick at 24
           and 48 hours for the same tests.

        -  Electrocardiogram at 2 hours and 24 hours after taking SIGA-246.

        -  24-hour urine collection after taking the SIGA-246.

        -  Complete diary card at home for 7 days after taking the SIGA-246.

        -  Follow-up visits at about 2 weeks and about 4 weeks after taking SIGA-246.

        -  Checks for health changes or problems at every visit.

    <textblock>
      Historically, smallpox has been responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths. In 1980 the
      World Health Organization declared the global eradication of smallpox which was achieved
      through a surveillance and vaccination program using live virus vaccine. In spite of its
      eradication, the deliberate use of smallpox as a bioterrorist agent remains a threat. While
      there is an effective vaccine, there have been concerns regarding vaccine complications which
      have prevented universal vaccination in the absence of disease exposure. In addition, in the
      event of a smallpox outbreak vaccination may be ineffective in immunocompromised individuals
      and in those who were exposed to the virus more than 3 days prior to vaccination. Antiviral
      therapy may be able to supplement a vaccine, however, there are limitations of the currently
      available drug options. SIGA-246 is an oral medication that has been shown to be highly
      active against variola virus and has demonstrated safety in animal models. The primary
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SIGA-246 at various doses
      with a secondary objective of evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the drug. To achieve these
      objectives, 30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled into one of three dosing groups (500 mg,
      1000 mg, or 2000 mg) to receive an oral, single dose of SIGA-246 or placebo. In each of the
      three ascending dosing groups there will be 8 active drug recipients and 2 placebo
      recipients. Safety of the study agents will be assessed by history, physical, and laboratory
      evaluations. Pharmacokinetic endpoints include C(max), T(max), t(1/2), AUC, CI and urinary
      excretion. Urine will be collected in 3 8-hour intervals and serial blood samples will be
      obtained after study agent administration.
