    <description>Subjects successfully meeting all screening criteria will be randomized to receive an infusion of aprotinin (a test dose followed by a loading dose of 2 million KIU before skin incision followed by 500,000 KIU/hour until the end of surgery) or matching placebo. The aprotinin was supplied in infusion vials of 200mL solution containing 2,000,000 KIU (10,000 KIU/mL) in 0.9% sodium chloride.
Subjects will be stratified into one of the 4 following strata:
Stratum 1: complete primary pneumonectomy
Stratum II: decortication or completion pneumonectomy
Stratum III: esophagectomy by transhiatal approach
Stratum IV: esophagectomy by transthoracic approach</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women 18 years of age and older

          -  Subjects requiring protocol specified oncological surgery. Subjects must have
             histological confirmation of malignancy in lung or esophagus

          -  Documented, signed and dated informed consent obtained prior to any study specific
             procedures being performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with previous exposure to aprotinin in the last 6 months or with a known or
             suspected allergy to aprotinin

          -  Subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgery

          -  Subjects with sepsis or mesothelioma

          -  Subjects with impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL or 221
             micromoles/liter)

          -  Subjects with a history of bleeding diathesis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary
             embolism or known coagulation factor deficiency. Based on the investigator's opinion
             of any active significant medical illness the subject may have.

          -  Subjects who refuse to receive allogenic blood products or whose preoperative red
             blood cell volume is so low that a blood transfusion would be likely to be given
             perioperatively (preoperative hematocrit of &lt;24% or hemoglobin of &lt;8 g/dl)

          -  Subjects who have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30
             days

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or women of childbearing potential in whom
             the possibility of pregnancy cannot be excluded by a negative pregnancy test and who
             are not using a reliable method of contraception

          -  Planned use of other antifibrinolytic agents, e.g. aminocaproic acid or tranexamic
             acid

          -  Subjects on chronic anticoagulant treatment with warfarin that cannot be temporarily
             discontinued for the surgical procedure (as per local practices)
