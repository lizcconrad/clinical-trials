  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Chilean children with history of Kawasaki
      disease have endothelial dysfunction years after the acute phase of the disease, and if this
      condition can be modified by treatment with statins.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) in its acute phase produces endothelial inflammation that can lead to
      dilatation and aneurysms of coronary and peripheral arteries. This initial injury leads to
      persistent endothelial dysfunction several years after having the disease. As a consequence,
      these patients may have a higher cardiovascular risk than general population. Studies with
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have suggested that these have an anti-inflammatory
      effect over the endothelium, that may be independent of its lipid-lowering effects. The
      hypothesis of this study is that KD produces endothelial dysfunction that is persistent years
      after acute disease, and that this dysfunction can be modified by treatment with statins.The
      study consists of two phases. On the first we will perform ultrasound assessment of
      endothelial-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery and evaluate other
      cardiovascular risk markers in patients and healthy controls. On the second phase patients
      with history of Kawasaki disease will be randomized and allocated to treatment with
      Pravastatin or placebo, after which a new evaluation of flow-mediated dilation of the
      brachial artery and cardiovascular risk markers will be performed.

      Comparison(s): Children older than 8 years of age with history of Kawasaki disease more than
      12 months before enrollment, compared with paired by age children without history of KD or
      other cardiovascular risk factors.
