  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted at multiple sites to determine the activity, safety,
      and tolerability of XL999 when given weekly to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma. XL999 is a small molecule inhibitor of cellular factors including VEGFR, PDGFR, and
      FGFR that may be involved in multiple myeloma.

    <description>Treatment consisted of 8 weekly infusions of 2.4 mg/kg of XL999 with each infusion given over 4 hours, unless drug-related toxicity required a dosing delay or adjustment. In the absence of progressive disease and unacceptable toxicity, subjects may have received XL999 treatment weekly for up to 1 year on this study.</description>
