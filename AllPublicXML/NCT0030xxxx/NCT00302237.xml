      The purposes of the registry are: 1) To provide an ongoing post-market surveillance mechanism
      to document clinical outcomes. 2) To provide additional information that the RX ACCULINK™ and
      RX ACCUNET™ can be used safely by a wide range of physicians under commercial use conditions.
      3) To evaluate the adequacy of Abbott Vascular's physician training program.

      CAPTURE 2 is an amendment to the CAPTURE study and will provide a mechanism for collection of
      data from the RX ACCULINK and RX ACCUNET Systems, when used by a broad group of physicians
      under commercial use conditions. The original CAPTURE study had built-in features that
      limited the ability to collect on-going real world data because it restricted the number of
      sites that could participate (up to 150 sites) and limited enrollment at each site (40
      patients per site). CAPTURE 2 will not have these restrictions. CAPTURE 2 is a descriptive
      post-approval registry that will be conducted at approximately 400 clinical sites in the
      United States with open-ended enrollment. The purposes of this registry are: 1) To provide an
      ongoing post-market surveillance mechanism to document clinical outcomes. 2) To provide
      additional information that the RX ACCULINK Carotid Stent System and RX ACCUNET Embolic
      Protection System (EPS) can be used safely by a wide range of physicians under commercial use
      conditions. 3) To evaluate the adequacy of Abbott Vascular's physician training program. As
      with the previous CAPTURE study, data will continue to be collected on any rare or
      unanticipated events that may occur. Patients in CAPTURE 2 will be followed after the index
      procedure to 30 days. During the 30 day follow-up period, any occurrence of death, stroke,
      myocardial infarction (MI), new neurologic events, and device-related adverse events will be
      reported to Abbott Vascular.
