  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for
      congestive heart failure (CHF) patients by integrating a readily available, low cost
      technology – the telephone – into coordinated CHF care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strong patient-provider communication and vigilant home-based monitoring can be critical
      elements of successful chronic disease management. Among CHF patients, automated clinical
      data acquisition via the telephone can improve insight into inappropriate use of medications
      and onset of fluid overload or edema – indicating deteriorating heart function (notably
      worsening ejection fraction). Routine, timely monitoring of this data can direct a nurse case
      manager to the subset of CHF patients likely to benefit from a clinic visit, evaluation,
      diagnosis, and counseling. This should result in: significantly increased medication
      compliance, significantly lower emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions
      (both those related to CHF and other conditions related to diminished physical capacity of
      patients with CHF), and improved physical function.

      This study is intended to answer three questions. First, do potentially avoidable acute
      events (measured by ED visits and hospital admissions) decrease when CHF management is
      accompanied by systematic telephone-based monitoring as compared with usual care? Second,
      does medication compliance improve when CHF management is accompanied by systematic
      telephone-based monitoring as compared with usual care? Third, does perceived health status
      (physical and emotional function) improve when CHF management is accompanied by systematic
      telephone-based monitoring as compared with usual care?
