    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the emotional experiences of fathers who have preterm
      infants who are hospitalized in a (neonatal intensive care unit)NICU setting. In addition, we
      will compare the emotional responses experienced by father of surgical NICU babies and
      fathers of medical NICU babies.

      Our primary hypothesis is that paternal stress levels will be lower for those fathers of
      infants who are hospitalized in a medical NICU compared with fathers of infants who are
      hospitalized in a surgical NICU.

      Secondary hypotheses include: 1) Stress levels for fathers of hospitalized infants will
      decrease over time; 2) Depressive symptomatology modulates perceived stress in fathers of
      NICU infants.

    <textblock>
      It is well known that birth and hospitalization of a preterm infant is stressful for parents.
      Numerous studies have evaluated emotional factors such as maternal stress, parental role
      alteration, and maternal depression. Researchers have also investigated both maternal and
      paternal emotional responses in relation to their infant being hospitalized in the NICU.
      Studies examining paternal response alone have received less research attention. To date, no
      studies have compared the emotional response of fathers of medical NICU babies and fathers of
      surgical NICU babies.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare perceived paternal stress and depressive
      symptomatology in fathers of preterm medical and surgical infants. Fathers who agree to
      participate will be given a questionnaire that is comprised of two self-report tools.
      Together these tools should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. Fathers who
      participate will be asked to complete these tools at three different times throughout their
      infants' stay in the NICU.
