      Investigating the effect of low dose growth hormone therapy on body fat composition, insulin
      sensitivity and metabolic profiles in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome and low
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) level.

      Metabolic syndrome, a constellation of glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      obesity, pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic state culminating to development of premature
      cardiovascular diseases is a serious public health problem with significant impact on life
      expectancy, societal productivity and quality of life of those afflicted with it. Insulin
      resistance has been proposed as the key linking factor for the metabolic syndrome. Although
      the underlying mechanism for the development of insulin resistance, diabetes and metabolic
      syndrome is not fully understood, increasing evidence suggests that neurohormonal
      dysregulation plays a pivotal role in causing this growing health hazard. In our previous
      study of 307 middle-aged men, low insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 level was independently
      associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, especially amongst those with
      positive family history of diabetes. Replacement with growth hormone has been shown by other
      researchers to reduce body fat and improve metabolic profiles in patients with adult growth
      hormone deficiency and type 2 diabetes.

      We hypothesize that treatment with growth hormone can lead to reduction of body fat, insulin
      resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in men with metabolic syndrome. This will be a
      12-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using growth hormone
      treatment in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome. The primary outcome measure will be
      body fat distribution, including changes in visceral and mesenteric fat, whereas secondary
      outcome measure will be insulin sensitivity, and tertiary outcome will be variable parameters
      of metabolic syndrome.

      The results of this study will have important impact on the treatment of patients with
      metabolic syndrome, and our understanding of the role of growth hormone in the pathogenesis
      of insulin resistance, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
