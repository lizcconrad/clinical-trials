  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to experience in a self-payed health check-up center,unsedated total colonoscopy is
      not inferior or may be better than unsedated sigmoidoscopy in terms of pain and patients'
      acceptance.

      Hypothesis: Unsedated total colonoscopy is not inferior to unsedated sigmoidoscopy in terms
      of pain and patients' acceptance.

      According to American Cancer Society guideline, screening total colonoscopy every 10 years or
      sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is recommended for average risk people above 50 years old.
      However,study in Taiwanese population demonstrated that 37.8% of colorectal lesions were
      beyond reach of sigmoidoscope, and in cases with lesions with advanced pathology, 66.7% did
      not have distal colorectal lesion. However, many people think colonoscopy is more painful and
      choose sigmoidoscopy for screening. However, according to experience in a self-payed health
      check-up center,unsedated total colonoscopy is not inferior or may be better than unsedated
      sigmoidoscopy in terms of pain and patients' acceptance.
