    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the misoprostol vaginal insert (50 mcg and
      100 mcg) can safely and effectively speed time to vaginal delivery compared to Cervidil (R)
      in women who need to have cervical ripneing and induction of labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is required in approximately 20% of pregnant women. Although contractions
      can be brought on by oxytocin (&quot;pitocin&quot;), some women need help in softening the cervix, or
      mouth of the womb (uterus), before oxytocin can be started. Prostaglandins have been shown to
      ripen, or soften, the cervix; at present, the only prostaglandin approved for marketing by
      FDA for this purpose is dinoprostone. Dinoprostone can be delivered in several ways; one
      method is to use a polymer vaginal insert that slowly releases the dinoprostone directly to
      the cervical tissues. This product is called Cervidil (R) and has been marketed for more than
      10 years in the United States. Misoprostol is another form of prostaglandin that is approved
      for protecting the stomach and intestinal lining for patients taking NSAIDs. Misoprostol has
      also been used by many obstetricians for cervical ripening and inducing contractions, but, it
      is not approved by FDA for this purpose.

      The same company that makes the Cervidil polymer insert has made an insert that will slowly
      release misoprostol. This study will determine whether this investigational insert containing
      misoprostol will decrease time to vaginal delivery compared to Cervidil. Two different doses
      of misoprostol will be tested (50 micrograms and 100 micrograms); each vaginal insert will
      gradually release a small, controlled amount of misoprostol over up to 24 hours.

      Comparator: The Cervidil (R) vaginal insert containing dinoprostone will be the comparator in
      this study.

    <measure>Minutes From Drug Insertion to Vaginal Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>2880 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Interval between time/date of insertion of study drug and time/date of neonate birth. This is a time-to-event analysis, there is no set time for the assessment. The endpoint occurs when the baby is born. 48 hours can be used as an approximate interval by which time most of the babies have been delivered.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Cesarean Section Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>2880 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with cesarean delivery after study drug was administered. There is no set assessment time or date as the woman's labor may last hours or days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Maternal/Fetal, Maternal (Post-Partum), and Neonatal Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>96 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome reports the percentage of adverse events in each treatment arm spontaneously reported or observed during the study. The intrapartum period (mother is still pregnant) is called the &quot;Maternal/Fetal&quot; period; once the baby has been born, adverse events are assessed separately for the mother (Post Partum) and the baby (Neonatal). The number of adverse events was assessed separately for each of the three periods.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Cervical Ripening Success Based On Modified Bishop Score (mBS) 12 Hours After Administration of Vaginal Insert</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measured the percentage of participants who achieved success on the mBS. This composite score is based on the mBS and vaginal delivery and it is measured 12 hours after insertion of the study drug. The mBS has a score of 0 when the cervix is not ripe and a score of 12 when completely ripened. The 12 hour score is compared to baseline. Using the mBS, assess at 12 hours whether each subject has met any of the following three criteria: 1) has improved (increased) the mBS by at least 3 points from baseline; 2) has reached a score of at least 6 on the mBS; or 3) has acheived a vaginal delivery.</description>

          <description>The mBS measures cervical softness. There are five elements assessed during a vaginal examination. Maximum mBS is 12: 0 to 3 for Dilation, 0 to 3 for Station, 0 to 2 for Consistency, 0 to 1 for Position, and 0 to 3 for Length of Cervix. A score of zero is a long, closed, thick firm cervix; a score of 12 indicates thin, completely soft, 100% effaced cervix.</description>

        <description>This outcome reports the percentage of adverse events in each treatment arm spontaneously reported or observed during the study. The intrapartum period (mother is still pregnant) is called the &quot;Maternal/Fetal&quot; period; once the baby has been born, adverse events are assessed separately for the mother (Post Partum) and the baby (Neonatal). The number of adverse events was assessed separately for each of the three periods.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Maternal/Fetal, Maternal (Post-Partum), and Neonatal Adverse Events</title>
          <description>This outcome reports the percentage of adverse events in each treatment arm spontaneously reported or observed during the study. The intrapartum period (mother is still pregnant) is called the &quot;Maternal/Fetal&quot; period; once the baby has been born, adverse events are assessed separately for the mother (Post Partum) and the baby (Neonatal). The number of adverse events was assessed separately for each of the three periods.</description>
          <population>Analysis was based on intention to treat, i.e., all subjects who had the insert placed in the vagina.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cervical Ripening Success Based On Modified Bishop Score (mBS) 12 Hours After Administration of Vaginal Insert</title>
        <description>Measured the percentage of participants who achieved success on the mBS. This composite score is based on the mBS and vaginal delivery and it is measured 12 hours after insertion of the study drug. The mBS has a score of 0 when the cervix is not ripe and a score of 12 when completely ripened. The 12 hour score is compared to baseline. Using the mBS, assess at 12 hours whether each subject has met any of the following three criteria: 1) has improved (increased) the mBS by at least 3 points from baseline; 2) has reached a score of at least 6 on the mBS; or 3) has acheived a vaginal delivery.</description>
