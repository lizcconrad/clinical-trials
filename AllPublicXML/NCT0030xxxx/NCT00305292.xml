  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UCSF Pain Clinical Research Center (PCRC) is conducting a study of the effects of
      modafinil (Provigil®; Vigiver, Alertec), alcohol and the combination on alertness, mood,
      visual motor and cognitive performance, and pain sensation. Modafinil is a stimulant drug
      marketed as a wakefulness and alertness promoting medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exact mechanism of action is unclear, and evidence has been gathered supporting a variety
      of different mechanisms including activity in a part of the brain that regulates wakefulness
      and alertness. The interaction between modafinil and alcohol has not been studied. The
      purpose of this study is to expand knowledge of the mood, memory, decision making, and pain
      relieving effects of each drug and how modafinil alters the effects of alcohol.
