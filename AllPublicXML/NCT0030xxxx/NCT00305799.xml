      RATIONALE: Understanding how oxaliplatin affects hearing loss, dizziness, and peripheral
      neuropathy may improve the ability to plan effective treatment for patients receiving
      oxaliplatin for solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying hearing loss and dizziness in patients receiving
      oxaliplatin for solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Define the prevalence of audiometrically detectable hearing loss in patients with solid
           tumors treated with oxaliplatin.

        -  Describe the association of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and
           audiometrically detectable hearing loss in these patients.

        -  Describe the association of CIPN and patient self-reported scales including, Peripheral
           Neuropathy Scale, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults, and Dizziness Handicap
           Inventory.

      OUTLINE: This is an exploratory study.

      Patients will complete three self-reported questionnaires including the Peripheral Neuropathy
      Scale, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory. Patients will
      also be asked a series of questions regarding symptoms or complaints about hearing changes,
      tinnitus, and dizziness that they may have experienced prior to, during, and after completion
      of chemotherapy. Patients will also undergo a hearing test.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
