      RATIONALE: Determining whether erlotinib passes into the cerebrospinal fluid may help in
      planning treatment for some types of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well erlotinib is able to pass into the
      cerebrospinal fluid of patients receiving erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of erlotinib in a subset of patients who
           are undergoing treatment with erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer and
           have no CNS metastatic disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized study.

      Patients will undergo single lumbar puncture (LP) to remove cerebrospinal fluid for analysis.

      After completion of study, patients will be monitored for 1 month after LP to assess for any
      LP-related complications.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patients must be enrolled in the trial: &quot;A Phase I/II Trial of Neoadjuvant Paclitaxel,
             Carboplatin and OSI-774 (Tarceva) with Concurrent Accelerated Hyperfractionation

               -  Patient must be in maintenance therapy phase of the study and have received
                  erlotinib for ≥ 1 week

          -  No known CNS primary or metastatic cancer at any time prior to time of enrollment

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patients must use adequate birth control measures while in the study

          -  No significant side effects to erlotinib that require dose reduction or interruption
