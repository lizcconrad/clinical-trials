  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if expressive writing is an effective intervention
      for reducing stress, enhancing cognition, and improving quality of life for caregivers of
      older adults with dementia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant and growing need exists to support caregivers of older adults with dementia,
      including methods of support that are easily implemented and targeted at caregivers who can
      not access multicomponent interventions. The current intervention examines the efficacy of
      one such approach: expressive writing (EW).

      We are examining the efficacy of EW, in terms of its ability to reduce stress, enhance
      cognition, and improve well-being, by comparing it to two control conditions: objective
      writing about how caregivers spend their time (time management; TM) and objective writing
      about non-personal historical events (history writing; HW).
