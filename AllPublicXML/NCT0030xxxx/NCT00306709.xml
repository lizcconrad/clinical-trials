      This is a randomized intervention that examines the effect of culturally adapted weight loss
      program in African American (AA) females age 40-65. Evidence suggests that AA women are more
      successful with weight loss programs that are culturally tailored (Karanja, et al, 2002).
      Take HEED is a combination of 2 interventions, Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet (TLC) from
      ATP-III and the CHANGE exercise program, which have shown success independently in previous
      clinical trials with AAs.

      Project/study objective(s), This is a randomized intervention that examines the effect of
      culturally adapted weight loss program in African American (AA) females age 40-65. Evidence
      suggests that AA women are more successful with weight loss programs that are culturally
      tailored (Karanja, et al, 2002). Take HEED is a combination of 2 interventions, Therapeutic
      Lifestyle Changes Diet (TLC) from ATP-III and the CHANGE exercise program, which have shown
      success independently in previous clinical trials with AAs.

      Methods, The 21 month program (6 months active intervention and 15 months maintenance) is
      provided by a Nurse matched with the study participants for race, age, and gender. Take HEED
      uses behavior change strategies (Prochaska et al 1992) which have been modified to include
      spirituality, AA cultural materials and examples woven into the lesson plans, and sustained
      peer support. The diet has been modified to include calorie reductions, increased fruit/
      vegetable and calcium intake, incorporation of AA ethnic recipes. Exercise has been
      culturally adapted featuring line- dancing, brisk walking and includes socialization time for
      development of strong interpersonal bonds that will encourage exercise in the participants.
      The control group receives KP's usual care which is a combination of nutrition classes and
      web based learning.
