  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to determine
      whether IVIG is effective in improving motor scores in patients with myasthenia gravis and
      worsening weakness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) and worsening
      weakness were enrolled in the study after providing informed consent. Fifty-two patients were
      recruited to the study, but one withdrew consent prior to starting so that 51 patients were
      recruited. Baseline clinical assessments using the Quantitative MG Score for Disease Severity
      (QMGS) were repeated at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment with IVIG or saline infusion. The
      Post-Intervention Status was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. The treatment was
      randomized and double-masked. Electrophysiological and immunological tests were done at
      baseline and after 2 weeks. Baseline characteristics were compared by the Student's t test
      for continuous variables or Chi-square test for categorical variables. An analysis of
      covariance was performed for the primary outcome measure, the change in QMGS.
