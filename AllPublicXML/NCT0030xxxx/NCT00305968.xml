  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 10% of the population in western countries suffer from abdominal pain and change of
      bowel habits - known as the irritable bowel syndrome. The patients suffer from low quality of
      life and they are often not well taken care of within the public healthcare system. They
      often feel frustrated and seek both their family doctors, specialists and alternative
      medicine for help. Many patients feel they do not know enough about their disease, and the
      uncertainty may enhance bowel symptoms. We want to evaluate the effect of patient information
      and education in these patients.

      The patients are enrolled in endoscopic clinics in 7 hospitals in Norway. They are randomized
      to receive intervention now (intervention group) or in 6 months (control group). The
      intervention is a 6 hour education about the irritable bowel syndrome, held by a experienced
      gastroenterologist at the local hospital.

      Elements in this &quot;school-day&quot; includes symptoms, epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment,
      nutritional advices.

      The patients are evaluated at time: 0 months and 6 months (intervention group and control
      group), 12 months (control group) and after 2 years (both groups).
