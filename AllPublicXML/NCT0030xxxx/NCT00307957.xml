  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pillar palatal implant procedure is a minimally invasive and commercially available
      treatment for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the United States and Europe.
      The implants are placed into the soft area in the roof of the mouth providing support to the
      soft palate. This research is being done to compare daytime sleepiness and sleep related
      quality of life after palatal implants.

      Patients will be enrolled into the study based on sleep study results, a physical exam and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once enrolled, patients are randomized into either the Pillar
      palatal implant group or a placebo/sham group.

      In both cases, patients come into the office for placement of the implants. This is an
      outpatient procedure. Patients are followed at one week, one month and 3 months. At each
      follow-up visit, patients will undergo a physical exam and complete questionnaires related to
      sleep and quality of life. Patients will also undergo reaction time testing on hand-held
      device similar to a pocket video game. At the three month visit, patients will return to the
      sleep lab for another sleep study.
