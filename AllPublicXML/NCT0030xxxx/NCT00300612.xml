    <textblock>
      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with malignant melanoma
      with the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Melanoma vaccine. It will establish the proper
      vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The
      vaccine contains killed melanoma cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of
      a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response
      to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer
      cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain
      stable or shrink.

      Patients 18 years of age or older with malignant melanoma may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests,
      urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if
      needed.

      Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines
      will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase
      I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the
      vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase
      II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be
      safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine
      treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 3 months for the
      remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 6 months for the next 2
      years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:

      Medical history and physical examination Blood tests X-rays and various scans (nuclear
      medicine/CT/MRI) FACT-G Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the
      patient's general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment,
      monthly during treatment, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It
      includes questions on the severity of cancer symptoms and the ability to perform normal
      activities of daily life.

    <textblock>
      According to statistics of the American Cancer Society, an estimated 55,000 individuals will
      be diagnosed with malignant melanoma and 8,000 will die of the disease this year in the
      Unites States despite all current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to
      melanoma vaccine therapy using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans
      in attempt to vaccinate patients against their melanoma The expression of the murine
      alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase [alpha(1,3)GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of
      alpha(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with advanced stage
      melanoma will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a trivalent vaccine
      composed of irradiated allogeneic melanoma cell lines (HAM-1, HAM-2 and HAM-3). These cell
      lines have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha(1,3)GT gene. Endpoints of the study include
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and
      immunological responses.
