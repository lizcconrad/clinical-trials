      A short presentation of a randomized clinical trial of biofeedback and anal injections as a
      first treatment option of faecal incontinence.

      Background: Faecal incontinence affects mainly women who have suffered sphincter disruption
      from vaginal delivery, but individuals of all ages can be affected. The treatment of this
      debility is not uniform between institutions or internationally. Often is surgical
      reconstruction of the anal sphincter performed, or other invasive, costly treatment options.

      The study: We intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, clinical trial where we compare the
      effect of two less invasive, less costly treatment options as a first alternative:
      biofeedback and anal injections. Our hypothesis is that anal injections will give a better
      and more lasting effect than biofeedback. The primary endpoint will be change in faecal
      incontinence assessed by the St. Marks incontinence score. Secondary endpoints will include
      change in quality of life and several physiological parameters. We intend to include 62
      patients in both groups, 124 all together, from 2 centres in Norway. The observation time is
      2 years. We plan to include the first patient April 2006, and conclude the study by December
      2010. This study can contribute to a more appropriate treatment-algorithm for these patients.
