      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of
      OROS*methylphenidate/CONCERTA* vs. immediate release methylphenidate as a treatment for ADHD
      specifically for those children who have behavioural difficulties in the
      afternoon/after-school and evening periods.

      Methylphenidate, namely immediate release methylphenidate is the primary stimulant used in
      the treatment of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Immediate
      release methylphenidate has limitations related to its time course of action.As the morning
      dose wears off, inattention may increase during late-morning classes. Similarly, when the
      midday dose is wearing off, the child may experience difficulty concentrating on homework.
      The second problem relates to compliance with midday and late afternoon dosing. Children feel
      stigmatized or embarrassed by trips to the nurse's office for medication and may skip doses
      as a result. In other cases, a school nurse may not be available or policies prohibit staff
      from administering drugs so children may be required to self-administer drug. CONCERTA® was
      developed to overcome these limitations. The purpose of this study is to see how effective
      and safe Concerta* is vs. immediate release methylphenidate in children with ADHD.

      Patients will take either Concerta* (18, 27, 36, or 54 mg) or Immediate Release
      Methylphenidate tablets (maximum 60mg/day) orally every morning for 8 weeks.
