      RATIONALE: Music therapy or book discussion may improve quality of life in patients
      undergoing stem cell transplant. It is not yet known whether music therapy is more effective
      than book discussion in improving quality of life in patients undergoing stem cell
      transplant.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well music therapy works compared to
      listening and discussing books on tape in improving quality of life in young patients
      undergoing stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Test the efficacy, in terms of resilience and quality of life, of a therapeutic music
           video (TMV) intervention vs listening and discussing books on tape (control group) for
           adolescents and young adults (AYA) undergoing autologous or allogeneic transplantation
           for cancer.

        -  Qualitatively describe the perception of helpfulness and meaningfulness of a sub-group
           of both interventions for AYA and family members 100 days post-transplant.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, limited multicenter study. Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (books on tape [control group]): Patients undergo six 1-hour sessions twice a week
           for 3 weeks with a trained counselor in which they choose up to 3 books on CD and listen
           to the book and/or discuss their impressions and thoughts about the contents with the
           counselor. Patients are provided with a portable CD player to listen to the books during
           their hospitalization.

        -  Arm II (therapeutic music video [TMV ] intervention): Patients undergo six 1-hour
           sessions twice a week for 3 weeks with a music therapist, designed specifically for the
           pre-transplant and acute phase of treatment. Phases of patient participation include
           song writing, recording the song with a digital accompaniment track, completing a video
           layout worksheet, taking photos or making drawings for the video, viewing clip art and
           pictures on a computer, and sharing the final video with family members and hospital
           staff.

      In both arms, patients complete questionnaires before and after sessions 2, 4, and 6 with the
      music therapist. Patients also complete computer-based questionnaires before hospitalization,
      after session six during hospitalization, and at 100 days post-transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Individuals randomly assigned to low-dose control group will have the same amount and timing of contacts as TMV group. A trained music therapist delivers the low-dose intervention (music therapy). Low-dose control group AYA initially choose up to three books-on-CD from a library selection of popular recordings. During the six sessions with the music therapist, AYA listens to the book and/or discusses their impressions and thoughts about he contents. Our rationale for having options of either listening to or discussing is to ensure the intervener has activities that will provide comparable contact time compared to the TMV group. As a parallel activity to the TMV protocol during which participants can work on their music video between sessions, AYA in the low-dose control group are provided with a portable CD player to listen to the books anytime during their hospitalization. As books ar e completed, or if the AYA changes their mind about the choice, the intervener offers other books.</description>

    <description>Intervention includes six 1-hour sessions (two sessions per week over 3 weeks) designed specifically for the pre-transplant and acute phase of treatment. The initial TMV session with the therapist occurs within 3 days of hospital admission. The phases of the intervention that require patient participation include song writing, recording the song with a digital accompaniment track, completing a video layout work sheet (determining the contents of the video), taking photos or making drawings for the video, and viewing clip art and pictures on a computer. The protocol concentrates many of these cognitive and active components to produce the video at the beginning, when patients experience less fatigue and malaise</description>
