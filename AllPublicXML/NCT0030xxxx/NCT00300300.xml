  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACL reconstruction in the Division of Orthopaedic surgery at Queen's is currently being
      performed arthroscopically assisted. The resultant function of the reconstructed ligament is
      greatly influenced by the placement of the transosseous tunnels, which are tunnels in the
      bones through which the grafts pass. Presently the placement of the tunnels is being judged
      from arthroscopically identified anatomical landmarks within the joint. The result is
      incidence rates of misplaced tunnels as high as 40%. Computer assisted tunnel placement would
      aid in the correction and reproducibility of anatomic tunnel placement. The objective of this
      study is to conduct a prospective, randomized trial comparing clinical and radiographic
      outcomes in subjects who receive either a patella or hamstring tendon graft to reconstruct a
      chronic tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. All subjects will be further randomized into
      a computer-assisted or a conventional arthroscopic surgical group to allow investigators to
      compare the precision and accuracy of tunnel placement between these surgical approaches. The
      main question under investigation is: does the increased accuracy of computer-assisted
      surgery make a clinical difference to the laxity of the reconstructed knee, and is the laxity
      further influenced by the type of tendon graft received?
