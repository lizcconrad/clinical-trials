      To assess the utility of clinical bedside examination for the measurement of jugular venous
      pulse in critically ill patients.

      Procedures: All patients with central venous catheters (CVP) will undergo physical
      examination of the jugular veins, while blinded to the actual CVP measured from the catheter.
      Clinicians with various experience levels (attending physician, fellow, resident physician,
      4th year medical student) will participate.

      The following clinical data will be obtained: Demographic data such as age, sex, weight and
      diagnosis will be collected. Each clinician's bedside CVP will be recorded from the bedside
      monitor. Clinicians will be blinded to bedside monitor.
