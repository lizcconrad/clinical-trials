  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pacemakers are implantable devices that pace (electrically stimulate) the heart. Some
      pacemakers have special programs to treat irregular atrial rhythms(top chambers of the heart
      beat too fast or too slow). Advances in pacemaker technology in recent years include features
      that automatically adapt to patient conditions without intervention from the clinician.
      Adapta (Model #ADDR01) is a new pacemaker that is designed to provide further automaticity
      advances by including the managed ventricular pacing (MVP) feature designed to promote
      intrinsic conduction (natural flow of electricity in the heart) by reducing unnecessary
      ventricular (lower chamber of the heart) pacing (electrical impulses). Adapta also contains a
      feature called TherapyGuide that is designed to allow the user to select certain conditions
      for each subject and receive a list of suggested pacemaker parameter value changes based on
      those conditions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall system safety and
      clinical performance of the Adapta pacing system.
