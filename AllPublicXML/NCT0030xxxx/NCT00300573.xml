  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the safety and efficacy of an investigation nucleoside analog reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), dexelvucitabine (DFC), to an approved NRTI, lamivudine (3TC)
      in HIV treatment-experienced patients who are resistant to 3 classes of antiretroviral
      therapies (NRTIs, PIs and NNRTIs). Patients meeting eligibility requirements will have a new
      'optimized' background regimen (OBR) selected for them by their investigator based on prior
      ARV treatment history and the results of HIV genotype and phenotype tests performed during
      the screening period. In addition to treatment with the new OBR, patients will be randomized
      to receive treatment with either DFC or 3TC in a blinded fashion. There is a 50 percent
      chance a patient will receive DFC or 3TC. Treatment in the study may continue for up to 96
      weeks. Patients with an inadequate response to therapy after 16 weeks will have the option to
      change their OBR and the option to switch to receive the other study medication (i.e., DFC to
      3TC or 3TC to DFC).

      The study will compare the safety and efficacy of an investigational nucleoside analog
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), dexelvucitabine (DFC) 200 mg once daily, to an
      approved NRTI, lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg once daily in treatment experienced patients with HIV
      that is resistant to 3 classes of antiretroviral therapies (NRTIs, PIs and NNRTIs). Patients
      meeting eligibility requirements will have a new 'optimized' background regimen (OBR)
      selected for them based on prior treatment history, and results of HIV genotype and phenotype
      performed during screening. In addition to the OBR patients will be randomized to receive at
      at one to one ratio DFC or 3TC in a blinded fashion. The OBR may include any approved HIV
      treatments except 3TC, FTC, ddI, d4T and ddC. Medications available through expanded access
      may also be available to selected patients. Treatment in the study will continue for up to 96
      weeks with primary endpoints at 24 and 48 weeks of therapy. Patients with an inadequate
      response to therapy after 16 weeks will have the option to change their OBR and the option to
      switch study medication (DFC to 3TC or 3TC to DFC). A total of 250 patients will be enrolled.
