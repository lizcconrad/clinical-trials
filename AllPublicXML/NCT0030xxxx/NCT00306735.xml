  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of three different dose
      schedules of palonosetron for the prevention of emesis over a 7-day study interval in
      multiple myeloma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of multiple-day chemotherapy regimens involving moderately or highly emetogenic
      agents are used for the treatment of cancers. Further, patients undergoing high-dose
      conditioning regimens in combination with bone marrow or stem cell transplants remain poorly
      controlled in terms of CINV. Patients treated with these regimens are at risk for developing
      CINV with each treatment as well as in the delayed setting.

      Palonosetron to date, has been studied against single-day moderately and highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy regimens. It is of interest, therefore, to explore the safety and efficacy of
      palonosetron when administered during a multiple-day chemotherapy regimen. For this purpose,
      a population receiving melphalan (100 mg/m^2) as a conditioning regimen before stem cell
      transplant for the treatment of multiple myeloma was selected.
