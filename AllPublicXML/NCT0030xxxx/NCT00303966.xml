  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. This phase II trial is studying how well
      sorafenib works in treating patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) treated with sorafenib.

      II. Determine the toxicity in patients treated with sorafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate bone marrow angiogenesis, CLL tumor cell expression of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors (flt-1, KDR, flt-4 and neuropilin-1), basic fibroblast
      growth factor, and plasma interleukin-8 levels with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as a complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission. Complete remission is defined as no evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in marrow with normal hematopoiesis and no palpable lymphadenopathy. Partial remission is defined as improvement in blood counts from baseline with &gt;50% reduction in lymph nodes on examination. These are definitions from the CLL International Working Group (IWG).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression will be defined as the time from treatment start until disease progression and will be evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Those who do not progress will be censored at the time that they were last known to be progression free.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be defined as time from the start of treatment until death from any cause and will be evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Mean Microvessel Density From Baseline to Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Mean microvessel density will serve as a marker of angiogenesis (other markers includes hot spot density). Will be examined using random-effects linear models.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) From Baseline to Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in VEGF levels (post-pretreatment) will be assessed. A negative value indicates a decrease with treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Plasma Level of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) From Baseline to Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The change (post-pretreatment) will be calculated and tested using a paired t test. A negative value indicates a decrease with treatment.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate</title>
        <description>Objective response is defined as a complete (CR) or partial (PR) remission. Complete remission is defined as no evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in marrow with normal hematopoiesis and no palpable lymphadenopathy. Partial remission is defined as improvement in blood counts from baseline with &gt;50% reduction in lymph nodes on examination. These are definitions from the CLL International Working Group (IWG).</description>
