  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dopamine agonists, pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip), are drugs that are used
      to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, these drugs can induce bothersome leg
      swelling or edema in about 20 percent of patients. The cause of this edema is unknown but may
      be secondary to stimulation of peripheral dopamine receptors in the kidney or blood vessels.
      We hypothesise that a peripherally acting dopamine receptor antagonist, will reduce edema in
      PD patients. This study will assess the effect of the peripheral acting dopamine D2 receptor
      antagonist, domperidone as a potential treatment for dopamine agonist-induced leg swelling.

      The study is a phase II, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. There
      are four periods: recruitment and randomisation; treatment period one (4 weeks); washout (1
      week); and finally treatment period two (4 weeks). Patients will be randomly assigned
      domperidone 20 mg tid in treatment period one followed by placebo tid in treatment period
      two, or placebo tid in treatment period one followed by domperidone 20 mg tid in treatment
      period two.
