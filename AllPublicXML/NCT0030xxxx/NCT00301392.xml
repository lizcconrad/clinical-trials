      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of pitavastatin for preventing diabetes
      in a population with impaired glucose tolerance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus and its complications are major health problems globally. People with
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at high risk of developing diabetes. It is therefore
      important to focus on preventing diabetes in individuals with IGT. HMG-CoA reductase
      inhibitors (statins) are widely used for hypercholesterolemia, one of the most frequent
      metabolic disorders. However, there is no direct evidence to whether statins are beneficial
      for preventing diabetes. This study is designed to compare the efficacy of life-style
      modification versus life-style modification with pitavastatin (a statin) administration, in
      individuals with IGT.
