  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis and a major health
      problem. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of lovastatin
      for controlling inflammation in mildly active RA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RA is characterized by persistent inflammation of peripheral joints, causing pain, stiffness,
      swelling, and warmth. The inflammation may cause progressive joint damage and destruction,
      resulting in deformity and loss of function. Both traditional and biologic disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been prescribed for RA patients to control existing
      inflammatory symptoms and affect long-term prognosis. However, DMARD use is expensive, and
      the long-term safety of DMARDs is unknown. Lovastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (also
      known as a statin) used to lower levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of lovastatin in controlling
      inflammation in individuals with RA who have mildly active RA disease despite treatment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms (Experimental or Placebo).
      There will be four study visits over 12 weeks. At each visit, a physical exam, vital signs
      measurement, medication history, a pregnancy test (if applicable), and blood collection will
      occur. Additional safety blood testing will occur at Week 2. Tender and swollen joint counts
      and a Physician Global Assessment will occur at study entry and Week 12. Participants will
      also be asked to complete self-assessments at study entry and Week 12.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Log Transformed C - Reactive Protein (CRP) at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 84 (Wk 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood draw for CRP, an acute phase reactant used to identify the presence of nonspecific inflammation. Change=Day 84 value minus Baseline value. Normal serum CRP reference range in this study is 0-4 mg/L (log transformed: -4.2 to 1.4). Participants with measurements for designated time points were included in analysis. An increased CRP level indicates the presence of inflammation. Reduced CRP levels could mean a decrease in inflammation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Day 84 (Wk 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-CRP score is on a scale of 0 to 10 and indicates current activity of rheumatoid arthritis (&gt;5.1=high disease activity; 3.2-&lt;=5.1=moderate disease activity; &lt;=3.2=low disease activity; &lt;2.6=remission). The score uses a combination of four variables: 1) the number of tender joints (of the 28 that are measured); 2) the number of swollen joints (of the 28 that are measured); 3) serum C-reactive protein (CRP) lab value in mg/L , and 4) Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity. Using a formula, the physician determines the score. Participants with measurements for designated time points included in analysis.</description>

    <description>Patients were ACR20 Responders if they had: at least 20% improvement in both tender joint count (28 examined) and swollen joint count (28 examined), and 20% improvement in at least three of the following 5 remaining ACR core measures: • Patient's pain assessment (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 100 mm) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm) • Physician's global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm) • Patient self-assessed disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)) score • Acute phase reactant C-reactive protein.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Serum IgM Rheumatoid Factor by ELISA (ELISA: Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 84 (Wk 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an antibody often present in the blood of a person with rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, a positive value for RF was 0.5 IU/mL or greater; a negative value for RF was &lt;0.5 IU/mL. Change= Day 84 value minus Baseline value. In general, presence of the antibody indicates aggressive rheumatoid arthritis and higher risk of joint damage.

    <description>Anti-CCP antibodies are autoantibodies frequently detected in the serum of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, a positive value for anti-CCP was 8 IU/mL or greater; a negative value for anti-CCP was &lt;8 IU/mL. Change= subtraction of Day 0 from Day 84 anti-CCP value. In general, high levels of the antibody indicate an aggressive rheumatoid arthritis and a higher risk of joint damage.

For toxicity, the dose could either be adjusted to one 40 mg lovastatin tablet or treatment could be discontinued. In addition to the active ingredient lovastatin, each tablet contained the following ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and pregelatinized starch. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was added as a preservative and D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Blue #1, and Yellow #6 were added as dyes.</description>

          <description>Participants were randomized to take two 40 mg lovastatin tablets orally once daily for a total of 12 weeks in a blinded (masked) fashion. In addition to the active ingredient lovastatin, each tablet contained the following ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and pregelatinized starch. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was added as a preservative and D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Blue #1, and Yellow #6 were added as dyes.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were taken from participants at Baseline and Day 84. Participants with measurements for designated time points included in analysis. Change=Day 84 value minus Baseline value. A positive difference reflects an increased laboratory parameter value over time; a negative difference reflects a decreased laboratory parameter value over time. Normal laboratory values depend on a subject age, gender, and the specific laboratory methods that were used to determine the lab values.

        <description>Blood samples were taken from participants at Baseline and Day 84. Participants with measurements for designated time points included in analysis. Change=Day 84 value minus Baseline value. A positive difference reflects an increased laboratory parameter value over time; a negative difference reflects a decreased laboratory parameter value over time. Normal laboratory values depend on a subject age, gender, and the specific laboratory methods that were used to determine the lab values.
