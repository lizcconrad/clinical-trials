      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of intrauterine lidocaine instillation in reducing
      patient discomfort during the removal of a &quot;lost&quot; intrauterine device (IUD).

      Methods: This double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 68 women who
      underwent removal procedure for a &quot;lost&quot; IUD. Thirty-four women were allocated to the
      lidocaine group and 34 to the saline group. The main outcome measure was the intensity of
      pain during, immediately after, and 20 minutes after the procedure, assessed by a visual
      analog scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Friedman's test with Bonferroni
      correction, Student's t test, and 2.
