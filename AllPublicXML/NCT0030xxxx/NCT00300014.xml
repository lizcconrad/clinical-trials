  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is compare the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone in clearing
      recurrent post-vitrectomy diabetic hemorrhage with conventional treatment, air-fluid
      exchange.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitreous hemorrhage is the most common complication of vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy.
      Despite measures to prevent and control this bleeding, it can lead to airâ€“fluid exchange in
      the office or to additional surgery in the operating room. Air-fluid exchange does not result
      in clear vision immediately after the procedure, and the patient has to maintain a face-down
      position. Vitreous lavage, a more invasive procedure performed in the operating room, may
      give rise to complications such as iatrogenic retinal breaks, incarcerations of vitreous in
      the sclerotomy sites, retinal detachment, rubeosis iridis, neovascular glaucoma, infective
      endophthalmitis, and sympathetic ophthalmia. In contrast, IVT injection as a treatment of
      post vitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage is a less invasive procedure and provides more
      prompt visual recovery, while avoiding the face-down position.

      We believe that the rapid clearing of vitreous hemorrhage results from as follows: (1)
      triamcinolone delivered in vitreous cavity can give rise to mechanical sediment entangled
      with remaining blood (2) direct vascular stabilizing effect may be induced (3) antiangiogenic
      effect may play a role.
