      To evaluate:

        1. the impact of combined antiviral therapy (Peginterferon plus ribavirin) on natural
           history of patients affected with HCV decompensated cirrhosis, after sustained
           virological response. A controlled study.

        2. safety and efficacy of antiviral therapy in this population by using a statistically
           significally number of patients as controls.

    <textblock>
      Decompensated HCV cirrhosis is a relevant problem as its clinical evidences predisposes to an
      high mortality risk, with a survival rate of 50% at 5 years (1,2). Davis et. al processed a
      mathematical model of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C and projected the total
      number of cases with cirrhosis increased by more than 50% by 2010 and then plateaued (3). As
      a result, there will be a dramatic increase in the number of cases with complications of
      liver failure and decompensated events of cirrhosis will increase to 25% in 2010, 32% in
      2020, 36% in 2030, and 38% in 2040 (3, table 1).Liver transplantation is the treatment of
      choice but the limited number of organ donor makes not realizable for the major of patients.
      Furthermore, age over 65 years correlated disease is not accepted to enter into the list of
      liver transplant. To prevent these patients from worsening their liver disease has positive
      economic implications in terms of health care resources used as diagnostic tests, clinic
      visits, drug therapy, hospitalization for management of complications, and later on, liver
      transplantation, and indirect costs related to lost work time and impaired quality of life.
      our controlled study on antiviral treatment of decompensated cirrhotics has shown that HCV
      clearance by therapy can be life-saving, improves hepatic function, and reduces disease
      progression. Treatment should be encouraged in CTP classes A and B, and especially in
      patients infected by genotype 2. The benefit of treating patients with genotype 1 remains
      unproven.
