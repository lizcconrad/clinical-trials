      This study is a prospective, single-center evaluation of the efficacy of clopidogrel dose
      adjustment in patients with insufficient platelet inhibition after elective coronary stent
      implantation.

      Background: The EXCELSIOR trial demonstrated a 7-fold increased risk for death, myocardial
      infarction and target vessel reintervention within 30 days in patients with platelet
      inhibition below median of study cohort after a bolus dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel. The
      median of platelet inhibition in this cohort was 14 % optical aggregation after stimulation
      with 5 µM ADP.

      Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel dose adjustment in patients with insufficient
      platelet inhibition after elective coronary stent implantation

      Methods: This prospective, single-center study will evaluate antiplatelet effects in 120
      patients receiving a bolus dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel before undergoing elective coronary
      stent implantation. Platelet inhibition will be evaluated 24 hours, 14 and 28 days after
      coronary intervention using optical aggregometry (5 µM ADP) and determination of surface
      protein expression by flow cytometry (P-Selectin, gp55, activated GP IIb/IIIa). If 24 hours
      after coronary stent implantation optical aggregation is &gt;14 %, patients will receive an
      additional bolus dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel, followed by a daily dose of 150 mg for at
      least 28 days. If optical aggregation at this point of time is ≤14 % patients will receive a
      daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel. No further dose adjustments during follow up will be
      performed.

      Hypothesis: Adjustment of clopidogrel dose in patients with insufficient platelet inhibition
      determined by optical aggregometry will provide a comparable antiplatelet effect as in
      patients with sufficient platelet inhibition after coronary stent implantation.
