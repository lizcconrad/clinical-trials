      The purpose of this study is to identify the safest dose of very low dose glucagon to prevent
      hypoglycemia in patients with Type I diabetes who use insulin pumps and to measure the the
      amount of glucagon in the blood and see how the body responds to the glucagon.

      Glucagon is currently used to treat severe hypoglycemia. DiObex believes that glucagon
      replacement therapy with very low doses of glucagon may prevent hypoglycemia without
      compromising effective glycemic control by insulin. In this study very low doses of glucagon
      will administered to Type I diabetics who use insulin pumps. The glucagon will be
      administered subcutaneously overnight for 6, 9 or 12 hours to see if the number of mild or
      impending hypoglycemia events can be safely decreased. Three different doses of glucagon will
      be compared to a control infusion.
