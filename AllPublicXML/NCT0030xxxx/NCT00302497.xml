  <official_title>12 Month, Prospective, Randomised, Open-Label Comparative Study to Evaluate the Protection of Kidney Function by Basiliximab in a CNI-Free Regimen in Newly Kidney Transplanted Patients (Three Months Post-Transplant) Who Are Recipient of One Kidney From Expanded Donor Criteria (UNOS Criteria)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors in the maintenance phase after kidney
      transplantation is associated with typical adverse effects, such as potential contribution to
      progressive impairment of renal function, hypertension, and metabolic abnormalities.

      This 15 month study with a safety follow up is undertaken to evaluate the potential benefit
      of an alternative treatment strategy to the chronic use of CNI. It will establish, through a
      comparative design, the superior protection of kidney function provided by chronic usage of
      basiliximab over tacrolimus early post-transplantation using EDC kidneys.
