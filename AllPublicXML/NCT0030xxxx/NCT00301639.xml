  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to document the pharmacokinetics of dopamine transporter
      DAT receptor occupancy of OROS MPH and Metadate CD using PET scanning with C-11 Altropane as
      the ligand. We hypothesize that CNS DAT occupancy of OROS MPH will be greater than that of
      Metadate CD at 10 hours after administration.

      OROS-MPH's pharmacokinetic profile uses an increasing delivery of MPH over the day (ascending
      pharmacokinetic curve). It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID treatment. Another new
      long-acting formulation is Metadate CD. Metadate CD consists of capsules with two types of
      beads. It was designed to replace IR-MPH BID treatment. The main target of MPH in the brain
      is the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure
      DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The time course of
      decay of the C-11 Altropane permits repeated imaging, thus allowing documentation of the
      pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy.
