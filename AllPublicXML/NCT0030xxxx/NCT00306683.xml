  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children treated for intracranial lesions, the 2 factors of the obesity are : the location
      of the lesion (hypothalamic-pituitary region) and craniopharyngiomas
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 % of the hypothalamic-pituitary lesions that occur in children are
      craniopharyngiomas with one or three cases per 1 million children each year.

      One major problem remains unsolved : the obesity

      This study is performed to optimize the management of the children with
      hypothalamic-pituitary lesions by reducing the hyperinsulinemia due to the lesion and the
      surgery
