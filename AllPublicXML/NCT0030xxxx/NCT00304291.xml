  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a severe demyelinating disease that selectively involves the
      optic nerves and the spinal cord but usually spares the brain. NMO is considered to have a B
      cell induced pathogenesis. Mitoxantrone (MITO, Novantrone®), a synthetic anthracenedione
      approved for worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and secondary progressive
      MS, has been shown to primarily suppress the humoral response. We conducted a prospective
      2-year study to evaluate the benefit of MITO in five relapsing NMO patients.

      The treatment protocol consisted of monthly 12 mg/m2 MITO intravenous infusions for 6 months
      followed by 3 additional treatments every 3 months. Neurological assessment including the
      determination of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was performed every 3
      months and during relapses. Orbital, brain and spinal cord MRI was performed at baseline, 3,
      6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Visual evoked potentials and ophthalmologic evaluations were
      performed at baseline and annually.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent longitudinal myelitis (&gt;3 segments of spinal cord involvement by MRI) with
             or without recurrent ON (unilateral or bilateral) but with normal brain MRI.

          -  Patients with recurrent longitudinally extensive myelitis without optic neuritis have
             an underlying pathology and serology similar to NMO and it is appropriate to consider
             this a form of NMO10.

          -  Cerebrospinal fluid required no intrathecal IgG synthesis or oligoclonal bands.

          -  Age was required to be 18-55 years

          -  Extended Disability Status Score ≤ 7.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac risk factors (e.g history of congestive heart failure and left ventricular
             ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%

          -  Systemic diseases such as lupus, Sjogren’s syndrome, anti-phospholipid antibody
             syndrome, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or vitamin B12 deficiency

          -  Previous treatment with mitoxantrone or anthracyclines
