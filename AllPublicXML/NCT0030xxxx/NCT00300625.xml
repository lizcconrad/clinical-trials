  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to validate the &quot;San Francisco Syncope Rule&quot;. This set of rules was
      derived by Quinn et. al. to help guide the treatment of patients evaluated in the Emergency
      Department who had an episode of syncope (passed out) or near syncope (almost passed out). A
      rule that considers patients with an abnormal ECG, a complaint of shortness of breath,
      hematocrit less than 30%, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, or a history of
      congestive heart failure was shown predict with a good degree of accuracy which patients
      would have an adverse event and require admission.

      A rule that considers patients with an abnormal ECG, a complaint of shortness of breath,
      hematocrit less than 30%, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, or a history of
      congestive heart failure was shown predict with a good degree of accuracy which patients
      would have an adverse event/serious outcome and require admission. Serious outcomes include
      the following: death,myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, stroke,
      subarachnoid hemorrhage, significant hemorrhage, or any condition causing a return ED visit
      and hospitalization for a related event.

      In Quinn's derivation trial, the sensitivity of the rule was 96%.
