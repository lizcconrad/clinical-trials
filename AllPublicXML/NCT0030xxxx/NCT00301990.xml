      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the
      white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Giving bevacizumab together with interleukin-2 may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with
      interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate the response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients with
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with bevacizumab and high-dose
           interleukin-2 (IL-2).

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response and survival of patients with metastatic RCC treated with
           bevacizumab and high-dose IL-2 with the historical data of patients treated with
           high-dose IL-2 alone.

        -  Compare the toxicity of bevacizumab and high-dose IL-2 in patients with metastatic RCC
           with the historical data of patients treated with high-dose IL-2 alone, in terms of
           number of doses of IL-2 administered during the first course of therapy, toxicity after
           the scheduled ninth dose of IL-2, and frequency of grade III and IV or unexpected or
           rare toxicities.

        -  Compare the time to disease progression in patients with metastatic RCC treated with
           bevacizumab and high-dose IL-2 with the historical data of patients treated with
           high-dose IL-2 alone.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bevacizumab and high-dose IL-2
           during course 1.

        -  Correlate serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, DC function, TCR zeta
           chain expression, and arginase or arginine levels with toxicity, response, and survival
           of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the utility of known prognostic criteria for RCC patients on clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prognosis (good vs
      intermediate vs poor).

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days -13, 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71
      during course 1 and on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71 during courses 2 and 3. Patients also
      receive high-dose interleukin-2 every 8 hours on days 1-5 and 15-19. Treatment repeats every
      84 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.
