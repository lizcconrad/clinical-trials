    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the efficacy of cangrelor is
      superior, or at least non-inferior, to that of clopidogrel in subjects requiring PCI.

    <description>Stroke is defined as a sudden, focal neurological defect resulting from a cerebrovascular cause that is not reversible within 24 hours and not due to a readily identifiable cause such as a tumor or trauma. All suspected strokes were reviewed and adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) who considered all clinically relevant information and imaging studies to classify all strokes as:
primary hemorrhagic - stroke with focal collections of intracranial blood
ischemic cerebral infarction - stroke without focal collections of intracranial blood
infarction with hemorrhagic conversion - cerebral infarction with blood thought to represent hemorrhagic conversion and not primary bleeding
uncertain - no imaging or autopsy data are available.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        To be included in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:

          -  Angiography demonstrating atherosclerosis amenable to treatment by percutaneous
             coronary intervention (PCI) with or without stent implantation and diagnosis of Acute
             Coronary Syndrome (ACS) by elevated cardiac markers or ischemic chest discomfort
             w/electrocardiogram changes + age &gt; 65 or diabetes or ST-elevation MI.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they present with any of the following:

          1. Not a candidate for PCI

          2. Increased bleeding risk: ischemic stroke within the last year or any previous
             hemorrhagic stroke, tumor, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, or intracranial
             aneurysm; recent (&lt;1 month) trauma or major surgery (including by-pass surgery);
             currently receiving warfarin, active bleeding

          3. Impaired hemostasis: known International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt;1.5 at screening;
             past or present bleeding disorder (including congenital bleeding disorders such as von
             Willebrand's disease or hemophilia, acquired bleeding disorders, and unexplained
             clinically significant bleeding disorders), thrombocytopenia (platelet count
             &lt;100,000/µL), or history of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia associated with
             clopidogrel

          4. Severe hypertension not adequately controlled by antihypertensive therapy at the time
             of randomization

          5. Receipt of fibrinolytic therapy in the 12 hours preceding randomization

          6. Receipt of clopidogrel dose exceeding maintenance dose (ie, &gt;75 mg) at any time in the
             5 days preceding randomization

          7. Inability to swallow study capsules

          8. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPI) Inhibitor usage within the previous 12 hours [applicable
             to unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients]

        Subjects excluded for any of the above reasons may be re-screened for participation at any
        time if the exclusion characteristic has changed.

        <title>Incidence of Stroke</title>
        <description>Stroke is defined as a sudden, focal neurological defect resulting from a cerebrovascular cause that is not reversible within 24 hours and not due to a readily identifiable cause such as a tumor or trauma. All suspected strokes were reviewed and adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) who considered all clinically relevant information and imaging studies to classify all strokes as:
primary hemorrhagic - stroke with focal collections of intracranial blood
ischemic cerebral infarction - stroke without focal collections of intracranial blood
infarction with hemorrhagic conversion - cerebral infarction with blood thought to represent hemorrhagic conversion and not primary bleeding
uncertain - no imaging or autopsy data are available.</description>
