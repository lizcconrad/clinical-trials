  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at UVa Health System are interested in how women experience and deal with stress
      during pregnancy. Participants will be randomly assigned either to engage in coping
      strategies on one's own or to receive 6 weeks of relaxation training. Researchers will
      examine how coping strategies affect the course of the pregnancy and the health of the infant

      Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires and complete some tasks that require
      concentration as heart rate and other biological signals are monitored. Participants will
      also be asked to provide samples of saliva a few times during 1 day. These tasks will be
      repeated 3 times during pregnancy and participants will be asked to complete questionnaires
      at 6 months postpartum

      A stress-reduction workshop will be offered to all participants at the completion of the
      study.

      Participants will be paid for study completion
