      The purpose of this study is to determine if Hemopure® will enhance tissue preservation
      during Cardiopulmonary Bypass surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and feasibility of administering Hemopure®
      (HBOC-201) to reduce myocardial necrosis, as measured by CK-MB enzyme elevation, and enhance
      tissue preservation during cardiopulmonary bypass.

          -  Subject signs informed consent

          -  Subject and the treating physician agree that subject can comply with all study
             procedures and follow-up visit at time of subject screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             normal 24 hours prior to CABG surgery.

          -  Renal failure defined as serum creatinine greater 220 µmol/L

          -  Subject has an ejection fraction ≤ 30% (as measured by Echocardiography within 30 days
             of study enrollment).

          -  Pre-operative cardiogenic shock defined as cardiac index ≤ 1.8.L/min/m2 despite the
             use of vasopressors.

          -  Underlying medical conditions that would limit subject's life expectancy to less than
             12 months.

          -  Severe pulmonary disease [based upon clinical diagnosis or pulmonary function tests
             (FEV &lt;1 liter), if available] that may interfere with weaning subject from ventilator.
