  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been considerable international /national interest in the GEM−P regimen for
      treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Currently, there is no accepted
      standard therapy for these patients. Since the publication of our experience with this
      regimen (Study with CCR ethics number 1857 closed to recruitment in July 2003:Ng M, Waters J,
      Cunningham D et al, Br J Cancer 2005;92:1352−7), we have treated relapsed/refractory lymphoma
      patients with this regimen and would like to undertake a retrospective review of a sub−group
      of these patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      Patients treated with GEM−P with or without Rituximab prior to March 2005 for
      refractory/relapsed DLBCL will be included in the analysis. Accrual of eligible patients
      currently under follow−up will be performed in clinic at the time of next appointment.

      All patients accrued will give informed consent for retrospective case note review, after
      discussion with a study investigator and after receiving a study information sheet. All
      eligible patients identified from the pharmacy database, and will be consented at the time of
      the next clinic appointment, if they are agreeable for the retrospective case note review.
