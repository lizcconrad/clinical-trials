  <brief_title>Study Comparing the Safety of Switching From Lamivudine to Adefovir Dipivoxil Versus Overlapping Lamivudine and Adefovir Before Adefovir Dipivoxil Monotherapy in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Single Center Open-Label, Randomized Study Comparing the Safety of Immediately Switching From Lamivudine to Adefovir Dipivoxil Versus Overlapping Lamivudine and Adefovir for 12 Weeks Before Instituting Adefovir Dipivoxil Monotherapy in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In earlier clinical studies, when patients who have been on lamivudine (LAM) were switched to
      adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), some patients developed ALT flares with an elevation of ALT &gt; 10 x
      the upper limits of normal (ULN).

      There were no cases of hepatic decompensation with the flares, however. The transition
      methods were varied among physicians from no overlapping to overlapping for 1 to 3 months
      with LAM and ADV. There is still some uncertainty about the optimal approach to switching
      from LAM to ADV.

      This study will compare the safety of directly switching to ADV to a protocolled switch after
      a period of overlap of 12 weeks. This will facilitate pro-active switching in patients on LAM
      and will also highlight genotypic resistance ahead of phenotypic resistance as a reason to
      switch patients. Data to date have only been presented as part of a controlled study in
      patients with clinically evident LAM-resistance. This study will enroll patients who still
      have serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression whilst receiving LAM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic HBV infection is an important worldwide cause of morbidity, mortality and source of
      potential new infections. There are an estimated 350 million carriers of HBV in the world. In
      China, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10-15% of the population are
      chronically infected. In North America and Northern Europe, infection and carrier rates are
      much lower, usually below 1%. Intermediate carrier rates of 1-5% are found in Southern Europe
      (e.g., Italy, Greece and Spain), parts of South and Central America, the Middle East and
      Japan. Persistent infection develops in over 90% of perinatally infected children and in
      3-10% of people who become infected after the age of 6 years. Worldwide, it has been
      estimated that more than one million people die annually due to HBV-related end stage
      diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The goal of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B is to reduce a patient's risks for progressive
      liver disease through prolonged suppression or eradication of HBV infection and to arrest or
      ameliorate HBV-related liver damage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years of age with chronic hepatitis B

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)(+) for a minimum of 6 months prior to entry

          -  Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)(+) or (-) at baseline

          -  Patients having previously received LAM for at least 24 weeks

          -  Patients with compensated liver function (Child-Pugh score ≤ 6)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would interfere with patient treatment, assessment or compliance with
             the protocol.

          -  Received immunoglobulins, interferon or other immune or cytokine-based therapies with
             possible activity in hepatitis B disease within 6 months prior to study screening.

          -  Organ or bone marrow transplant recipients.
