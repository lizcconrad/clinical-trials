  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the leading contender for the next pandemic of influenza is H5N1, a strain of avian
      virus. Prevention and control of a pandemic will depend on the rapid production and worldwide
      distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. Candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines must be
      developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the most optimal formulation and the
      best vaccination schedule.This study is designed to test in healthy adults aged between 18-60
      years the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one and two administrations of a candidate
      pandemic H5N1 vaccine formulated from Split Virus. The vaccines contain different antigen
      doses . For each dose, adjuvanted vaccine will be compared to the plain vaccine in order to
      detect the optimal formulation for immunization against the H5N1 influenza strain.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  A male or female between, and including, 18 and 60 years of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Administration of any vaccine during the period starting 15 days before the first
             administration of the study vaccine and ending 21 after the second one.

          -  Administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccines during the entire
             study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first administration of the
             study vaccine.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination

          -  History of hypersensitivity to vaccines.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional
             abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the first administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

          -  lactating women

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to the first vaccination, or planned use during
             the study period.
