  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing in France. A recent cross sectional study has
      shown that in France, only 15% of children and 26% of adults had HbA1c&lt;7%. Adolescents seem
      to need particularly a better metabolic control.

      Working Hypothesis:

      We hypothesized that a stricter control of glycaemia by nurse-counselling could probably
      improve metabolic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

      Objectives:

      To show that nurse-counselling may improve levels of patient satisfaction.

      Methodology:

      The main criterion is the patient acceptance of diabetes measured by an analogical visual
      scale rated from 0 (I cope very well with my diabetes, I cope very badly with my diabetes) to
      10 cm. The scale will be measured every quarter within 12 months follow-up. We wish to
      improve patient's appreciation by 10 mm, near to &quot;I cope very well with my diabetes&quot;.

      This is a randomised parallel group study with 36 subjects in each group. During the
      follow-up, the &quot;routine follow-up&quot; group will continue its routine care. The &quot;complementary
      follow-up&quot; group will be called by nurses every 15 days and consult monthly. HbA1c is the
      secondary criterion and will be measured every 3 months.

      The total study duration is 18 months including 6 months for the recruitment and 12 months
      for the patients follow-up
