  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 women will be enrolled in this single-center, double-blind, randomized Phase
      I study to assess vaginal tissue and fluid levels, plasma levels and pharmacokinetics of
      dapivirine (TMC120) gel, which will be applied for 10 consecutive days in 18 healthy
      HIV-negative women ages 18 to 50. Volunteers will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
      2.5mL dapivirine vaginal microbicide gel at one of three concentrations.
