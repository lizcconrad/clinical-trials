  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men's quality of life (QoL) is potentially affected by mild erectile dysfunction (ED) to the
      same extent as it is by moderate and severe ED. This study will provide controlled clinical
      data measuring efficacy, QoL parameters and satisfaction changes in men with mild ED treated
      with Viagra versus those treated with a placebo. With an open-label extension, this study
      will also provide all study subjects the opportunity to receive the active drug treatment for
      6 weeks.

      <pre_assignment_details>183 subjects entered the study, and 176 subjects were treated in the Double Blind (DB) phase. One subject completed DB phase and continued into the open-label (OL) phase but had no events of sexual activity and therefore, did not take study drug and was excluded from the number of treated subjects, the safety analysis set, and PP population.</pre_assignment_details>
