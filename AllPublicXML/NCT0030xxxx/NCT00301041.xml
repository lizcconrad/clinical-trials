      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects and best way to give
      radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with invasive breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the ratio between post- and pre-treatment plasma transforming growth factor-beta
           1 (TGF-β) in women with invasive breast cancer undergoing hypofractionated radiotherapy
           vs standard-fractionated external-beam radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Establish longitudinal serum and plasma biorepository for retrospective evaluation of
           TGF-β and other biomarkers with special relevance to radiation response.

        -  Correlate pre-treatment plasma TGF-β levels with clinical fibrosis development.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (hypofractionated radiotherapy): Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once
           daily 5 days a week for up to 3.5 weeks (16 fractions total).

        -  Arm II (standard fractionated radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I
           at a lower dose for up to 5 weeks (25 fractions total).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
