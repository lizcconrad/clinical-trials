      To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARQ 197 given
      orally. This is an open label, dose escalation study of ARQ 197 administered orally at a
      starting dose of 10 mg bid (20 mg/day).

    <description>Patients in this trial will receive ARQ 197 orally at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 20 mg/day (first cohort) and escalate until the RP2D or MTD is determined. Patients enrolled under a previous amendment will continue to receive ARQ 197 twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days without therapy. Any patient enrolled under Amendment 3 will take ARQ 197 twice daily for 21 days where cycles will be repeated every three-weeks (21 days).
Patients enrolled under Amendment 4 will receive dose of 360 mg bid (720 mg daily) continuously for 21 days, and cycle will be repeated every three weeks.
All patients will remain on study until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment is permitted.</description>
