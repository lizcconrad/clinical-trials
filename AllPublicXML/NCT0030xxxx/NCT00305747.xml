      RATIONALE: Diindolylmethane may slow the growth of prostate cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of diindolylmethane in
      treating patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous
      hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and a recommended phase II
           dose of absorption-enhanced diindolylmethane (BioResponse-DIM^® [BR-DIM]) in patients
           with nonmetastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer and rising serum
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

        -  Evaluate the toxicities of BR-DIM.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of twice daily oral administration of BR-DIM in
           this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the effect of BR-DIM supplementation on serum PSA level.

        -  Correlate changes in expression levels of lymphocytes NF-kB with serum PSA levels in
           patients taking BR-DIM supplementation.

        -  Determine quality of life measures in patients taking BR-DIM supplementation.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral absorption-enhanced absorption-enhanced diindolylmethane
      (BioResponse-DIM^® [BR-DIM]) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BR-DIM until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and at the completion of
      study therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.

A study calendar will be provided and patients will be asked to fill the appropriate boxes when they take their study capsules. One treatment cycle is 28 days.</description>
