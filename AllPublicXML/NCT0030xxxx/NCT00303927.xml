      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well capecitabine works as second-line therapy
      in treating patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer who have the thymidylate synthase gene.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Characterize the 6-month survival of patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer
           (progressing after at least 1 prior gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen) who
           carry the double tandem repeat (S/S) variant of the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene
           enhancer region (TSER) treated with capecitabine.

        -  Characterize toxicity of capecitabine in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer who
           carry the S/S variant of the TSER.

      Secondary

        -  Explore the association between capecitabine exposure at steady-state, allelic variants
           in candidate genes (carboxylesterase 1, carboxylesterase 2, cytidine deaminase,
           thymidine phosphorylase [TP], dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [DPD],
           methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and drug response (toxicity and efficacy) in this
           patient population.

        -  Determine the relationship between expression of TS, TP, and DPD in tumor tissues and
           the response to capecitabine in this patient population.

        -  Analyze response rate to capecitabine, based on the presence of homozygous S/S variant
           of the TSER.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.
