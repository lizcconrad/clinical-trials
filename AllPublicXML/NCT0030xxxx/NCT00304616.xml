      This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of an 12 and 26-week
      aripiprazole administration to schizophrenic outpatients who maintain stable (no change with
      dosage, usage, route of the most recent antipsychotic drugs) symptoms and discontinued
      previous antipsychotic drugs.

      Aripiprazole (10~30 mg/day) will be orally administered for 12 weeks followed by an extension
      phase for a maximum of an additional 14 weeks (total of 26 weeks).

             would expose them to an undue risk of a significant adverse event or interfere with
             assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial
