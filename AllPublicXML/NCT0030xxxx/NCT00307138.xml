  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been continuing debate about whether use of hetastarch for volume replacement in
      coronary artery bypass surgery [CABG] increases the risk of postoperative bleeding. A recent
      meta-analysis of hetastarch use in on-pump CABG concluded that use of hetastarch in these
      procedures is associated with increased risk, but the safety of hetastarch use in off-pump
      procedures remains unresolved.

      We designed a double-blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate this question. The
      study was designed as an equivalence trial. Statistical power calculations were performed
      taking this into consideration. Sealed assignments from a block randomization table developed
      prior nto initiation of the trial were unsealed in the operating room. These were used to
      assign patients scheduled for off-pump CABG to receive either 1 L of hetastarch or 1 L of
      albumin as part of intraoperative volume replacement. Albumin was used for all subsequent
      intraoperative and postoperative fluid replacement.

      The rate of postoperative bleeding was assessed prospectively by monitoring hourly chest tube
      drainage and number of units of blood products transfused postoperatively in the Intensive
      Care Unit. Risk was assessed by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) established for
      this trial. The SAMC was scheduled per protocol to meet after the first 15 subjects (both
      groups combined) had 1000cc or more of chest tube drainage in the first 12 hours
      postoperative, and then subsequently either after 15 additional bleeds of this volume or
      following a schedule set at the discretion of the DSMC.

      The trial was continued until 156 patients had been recruited. At that time, 78 participants
      each had been assigned to the hetastarch and albumin groups. DSMC review at that time
      determined that use of hetastarch is associated with a risk of postoperative bleeding which
      is greater than the risk associated with use of albumin and the DSMC accordingly halted the
      trial.

      Recruitment

        1. Eligibility screening:

           a. All adult Kaiser Permanente members admitted to Summit Hospital (Oakland, CA) for
           coronary bypass graft surgery which is planned to be conducted off-pump.

        2. Recruitment period: 9/1/2004 through 7/27/05

             1. At recruitment, each subject who agrees to participate is assigned a study number

                  1. The study number is assigned sequentially and is totally independent of the
                     medical record number or other personal identifying information

                  2. The linkage between the study number and all personal identifying information
                     is kept in a locked file separate from other project data

        3. Exclusion criteria:

             1. pregnancy

             2. patients scheduled to undergo on-pump procedures

             3. patients with a history of any of:

                  1. cardiac surgery

                  2. primary bleeding disorders

                  3. end-stage renal disease.

        4. Statistical power analysis

             1. This study is designed as an equivalence trial

             2. Target outcome rates are based on those published in Sade RM, Stroud MR, Crawford
                FA Jr, et al. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1985 May;89(5):713-22.

             3. Statistical power is calculated using the confidence-interval-based technique for
                normally distributed interval variables.

                  1. The confidence interval is set at 95%

                  2. The range of equivalence is defined as +100 milliliters

                  3. Power is set at 90%

             4. The target sample size which results from this analysis is 165 patients in each arm
                (i.e., hetastarch and albumin).

        5. Analytic strategy

             1. All project analyses are conducted by intention-to-treat

             2. Bivariate comparisons between the study (i.e., hetastarch) and control (i.e.,
                albumin) group measurements use the Fisher exact test or Studentâ€™s t test for
                independent samples as appropriate given the nature of the measurement were used to
                conduct bivariate comparisons of study group measures with control group measures.

                1) Confidence intervals are calculated using the exact techniques

             3. Multivariate comparisons: Analysis of variance and general linear modeling are used
                to conduct multivariate comparisons of measures between the study and control
                groups while controlling for covariates.

        6. Intervention process

             1. When the patient is in the operating room, the anesthesiologist opens the envelope
                containing the study group assignment (i.e., hetastarch or albumin).

                  1. The attending anesthesiologist administers 1 liter of 6% hetastarch
                     intraoperatively to patients from the study group.

                  2. The attending anesthesiologist administers 1 liter of albumin intraoperatively
                     to patients from the study group.

             2. After the first liter of colloid is administered, the patients receive only albumin
                if more colloid is needed to meet additional requirements for fluid replacement.

             3. All patients receive the remaining standard operative regimen of crystalloids and
                blood products at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.

             4. All patients are transferred postoperatively to the Intensive Care Unit.

                  1. The attending intensivists are blinded to the patient's randomization
                     assignment

                  2. The attending intensivists use standard fluid replacement at their clinical
                     discretion.

                  3. No hetastarch is administered in the intensive care unit.
