      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as fludarabine and busulfan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A peripheral stem cell, bone
      marrow , or umbilical cord blood transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that
      were destroyed by chemotherapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine together with
      methotrexate and methylprednisolone may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving alemtuzumab together with
      fludarabine and busulfan works when given before donor stem cell transplant in treating young
      patients with hematologic disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the engraftment rate with reduced toxicity ablative conditioning regimen
           comprising alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and busulfan followed by allogeneic stem cell
           transplantation in pediatric patients with stem cell defects, marrow failure syndromes,
           hemoglobinopathy, severe immunodeficiency syndromes (nonsevere combined immunodeficiency
           disorders), myelodysplastic syndromes, or myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the acute reactions, incidence of infections, and rate of immune
           reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 6 hours on days -12 to -10,
           high-dose busulfan IV over 2 hours 4 times daily on days -9 to -6, and fludarabine IV
           over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation: Two days after the completion of conditioning
           regimen, patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or
           umbilical cord blood transplantation on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis:

             -  Most transplantations (bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation):
                Patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously beginning on day -1 until at least
                day 50 followed by a taper at either 2 months, 9 months, or 1 year in the absence
                of GVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate on days 1, 3, and 6.

             -  Umbilical cord blood transplantation: Patients receive cyclosporine as in most
                transplantations, and methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days 0-21 followed by a
                weekly taper.

      After transplantation, patients are followed periodically for up to 20 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.

          <description>All eligible patients received pre-transplant conditioning with Alemtuzumab, fludarabine and targeted busulfan followed by allogeneic transplant. The initial dose of busulfan was determined by performing PK (pharmacokinetics) analysis on a test dose of busulfan on the day prior to initiating conditioning. Based on the PK results a starting dose of busulfan was determined. A second PK study was done after the starting dose to ensure that the targeted dose was achieved. If it wasn't achieved, then a dose modification was made and a third PK study done.</description>

          <description>All eligible patients received pre-transplant conditioning with Alemtuzumab, fludarabine and targeted busulfan followed by allogeneic transplant. The initial dose of busulfan was determined by performing PK (pharmacokinetics) analysis on a test dose of busulfan on the day prior to initiating conditioning. Based on the PK results a starting dose of busulfan was determined. A second PK study was done after the starting dose to ensure that the targeted dose was achieved. If it wasn't achieved, then a dose modification was made and a third PK study done.</description>
