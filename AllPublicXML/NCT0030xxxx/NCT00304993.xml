  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipid abnormalities in people with the Metabolic Syndrome (the Insulin Resistance Syndrome)
      are characterized by elevations in triglycerides and LDL cholesterol; low levels of HDL
      cholesterol; and small, dense LDL particles. Statins generally do not change LDL particle
      size, so often fenofibrate is added. This combination may still not be sufficient. Niacin is
      a common third drug added to the treatment regimen, but niacin can increase insulin
      resistance. This study compares niacin as a third drug to rosiglitazone, an insulin
      sensitizer.

    <textblock>
      The Metabolic Syndrome is characterized by an atherogenic dyslipidemia consisting of
      hypertriglyceridemia, modest elevations of LDL cholesterol, low levels of HDL cholesterol,
      and LDL phenotype pattern B (small, dense LDL particles). Statins are first line therapy, and
      reduce LDL cholesterol levels without affecting LDL particle size. Fenofibrate addresses the
      triglycerides, HDL cholesterol levels, and LDL phenotype, so is recommended as second level
      therapy. The third element is niacin, but for insulin resistant patients, a question has been
      whether niacin might be exacerbating the underlying pathophysiology of Metabolic Syndrome
      patients. In SNARED, niacin was compared to the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone in study
      subjects already on statin and fenofibrate.

      All volunteers participating in SNARED exhibit LDL phenotype pattern B despite statin therapy
      at the time of recruitment. Comparisons of LDL phenotype at baseline are to be compared to
      measurements made after 4 months of statin + fenofibrate. If the LDL phenotype converts to
      pattern A (large LDL particles), this is a study endpoint. Otherwise, study subjcts are
      randomized to receive statin+fenofibrate+niacin, or statin+fenofibrate+rosiglitazone for six
      months, at which time lipid phenotype will again be determined..
