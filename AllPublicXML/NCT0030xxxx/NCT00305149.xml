    <textblock>
      .This study is trying to address change of chemotherapy dosage according to individual
      patient response to initial cycles of chemotherapy in order to reduce cumulative dose of
      chemotherapy.The study includes patients with early unfavorable and advanced hodgkin
      lymphoma. Patients with low risk were started with standard beacopp and only high risk
      patients were started with escalated beacopp.Following 2 cycles of therapy the patients were
      reassessed.Based on scintigraphy results decision was made regarding further therapylative
      chemotherapy for early responders and maximize dose intensity for late responders.

      Patients were eligible if they had early unfavorable disease or patients who presented with
      stage III or IV disease .Pt assigned to receive 6 cycles of Bleomycin Etoposide, Doxorubicin,
      Cyclophosphamide Procarbazine, Prednisone (BEACOPP) or increased dose BEACOPP. (IDB). Patient
      with Stage I or II with ³4 sites of disease, age ³50, ESR³50 “B” symptoms lymphocyte depleted
      histology “E” site, or bulky disease were defined as early unfavorable disease and were given
      standard BEACOPP (SB). Those with I, II B or bulky disease or Stage III, IV were defined
      according the IPS. Increased dose BEACOPP (IDB) cycles of therapy was initiated only to
      patients with IPS of 3 or more risk factors (high risk) Standard BEACOPP (SB) cycles were
      initiated to those with a score of 0-2 (standard risk). All patients had baseline GA67 or
      hybrid PET\CT scan at diagnosis and post first cycle for gallium scan or second cycle for
      hybrid PET\CT. Upon the scan results therapy was planned and given for addition of 4 cycles.
      Those with negative scan received cycles of SB as of the third cycle. Dose was reduced to
      level I to III if patient was hospitalized due to fever and neutropenia of 5 days or longer
      or pt had an episode of sepsis with unstable vital signs.

      Patient with residual uptake interpreted as positive scan had additional cycles of IDB for a
      total of 6 cycles
