  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza pandemics are caused by viruses that possess an Hemagglutinin molecule to which
      most of the population lacks immunity. If such virus is pathogenic to human and demonstrates
      the ability to transmit from person to person, the result is a global outbreak of disease
      that affects a high percentage of individuals in a short period of time and is likely to
      cause substantially increased mortality and morbidity in all countries of the world.
      Recently, purely avian influenza viruses, including the H5N1, H9N2 and H7N7 subtypes, have
      been directly transmitted to humans, raising concern over the possibility of a new influenza
      pandemic among the world's immunologically naive populations. In order to face this kind of
      situation, a pandemic influenza vaccine has to be developed.
