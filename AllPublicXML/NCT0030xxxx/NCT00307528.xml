  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the licensed Pneumovax 23™ vaccine is not always satisfactory in elderly subjects, the
      safety and the immune response of the new investigational pneumococcal protein vaccine is
      evaluated in healthy elderly population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since influenza vaccination is recommended in the age range of the study population, Fluarix™
      (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) vaccine will be offered free of charge during the study period
      (for 3 consecutive years starting from September 2004), to be used by Investigators according
      to national vaccination schedule/practice.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.
