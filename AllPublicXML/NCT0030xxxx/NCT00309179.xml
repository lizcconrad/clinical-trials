    <textblock>
      This study proposes to determine the safety of the administration of E7820 plus cetuximab and
      explore the MTD of the combination in a Phase Ib study. In addition, the efficacy of this
      combination will be explored in patients with colorectal cancer in the Phase II proof of
      concept phase of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Phase Ib, patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant
             solid tumor for which no effective therapy is available or the patient must not be a
             candidate for standard therapy.

          -  For Phase II, patients must have a pathologically and histologically documented
             colorectal carcinoma that is inoperable and/or metastatic. These patients must also
             have at least one unidimensional measurable lesion according to the RECIST guidelines.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0-1.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months.

          -  Patients must be aged &gt;= 18 years.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL
             and creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by ANC &gt;= 1,500 /mm3 and
             platelets &gt;= 100,000 /mm3.

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by liver function test
             abnormalities no greater than CTC grade 1 (bilirubin, alanine transaminase [ALT], and
             aspartate transaminase [AST]) unless increased LFTs are related to liver metastases in
             which case CTC grade 2 abnormalities acceptable.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Patients must give written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening
             procedures with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time
             without prejudice.

          -  Patients may have received prior bevacizumab therapy as long as therapy has been
             discontinued for 4 weeks or longer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a history of previous Grade 2 or higher hypersensitivity to
             sulfonamide derivatives.

          -  Patients previously treated with cetuximab, or who have received prior treatment with
             any EGFR-related cancer therapy, either an approved or investigational agent.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from any clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4)
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy related toxicity at study entry
             (excluding neuropathy, infertility, or alopecia).

          -  Patients who have received investigational drugs or any other anti-neoplastic therapy
             within 28 days of E7820 treatment.

             potential unless using adequate measures of contraception in the opinion of the
             Investigator (postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be

             completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this
             indication for at least one month before starting treatment with E7820. Any signs (eg,
             radiologic) and/or symptoms from their brain metastases must be stable for at least
             one month.

          -  Patients who have a positive history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or
             active hepatitis C.

             malignancies).

          -  Patients with a history of unstable ischemic cardiac disease or more than Class II
             NYHA heart failure.
