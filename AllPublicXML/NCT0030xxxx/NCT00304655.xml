      This study was designed to prove safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of
      acutely relapsed patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in
      Korea and to confirm the maintenance of efficacy and safety during maintenance period and the
      changes in emotional factors and social functions.

      After administering 15 mg/day of aripiprazole for two weeks, the test may change the dose
      within the range of 10 mg and 30 mg per day by clinical judgment. (Medication duration: 8
      weeks (acute phase) + 18 weeks (maintenance phase)] + 26 weeks (extension phase), *total 52
      weeks)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients as defined by the DSM-IV criteria
             having an acute relapse

          2. 18 to 65 years

          3. Males and females (females of child bearing potential must use acceptable
             contraception and must not be pregnant and lactating; females of child-bearing
             potential must have negative serum pregnancy test)

          4. Randomization to this study must occur no more than four weeks following the day of
             initiation of treatment for the present episode/relapse.

          5. Should have a total PANSS score of at least 60. In addition, patients should have
             scores of at least 4 (&quot;moderate&quot;) on any two of the four PANSS items that constitute
             the psychotic item subscale (hallucinatory behavior, delusions, conceptual
             disorganization, and suspiciousness).

          6. Patients must be able to be rated reliably on the battery of psychiatric and movement
             rating scales required by the protocol.

          6. Patients who must continue to take, or who may potentially need to take, during this
             study, any of the following concomitant medication, which could cause unwanted
             drug-to-drug interactions or which could confound the analysis of antipsychotic
             effectiveness: Tegretol (carbamazepine), Depakene Depakote (valproic acid or sodium
             valproate or divalproate sodium), Lithium carbonate and lithium citrate

         11. Patients having any somatic condition whose symptoms or physical signs could be
             misinterpreted as signs or symptoms of psychosis or as adverse effects from
             antipsychotic medications.

         12. Patients with any acute or unstable medical condition requiring pharmacotherapy

         13. Patients with any abnormal laboratory test result as judged by investigator

         14. Patients who have participated in any previous aripiprazole clinical study

         15. Patients having taken an investigational drug within the four weeks which precede the
