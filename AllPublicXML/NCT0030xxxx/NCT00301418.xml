    <textblock>
      This study will offer a safe treatment for patients with relapsing recurring glioblastoma
      (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). The trial will test the hypothesis that Erlotinib
      (Tarceva, OSI-774) can be safely used up to a dose of 150 mg two times a day for 12 months to
      ultimately enhance survival of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA. Correlation of
      response to Tarceva with particular genetic alterations including epidermal growth factor
      receptor variant type III (EGFRvIII) amplification and phosphatase and tensin homolog
      (mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1) (PTEN) loss will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic
      astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of
      tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival
      durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA, from initial diagnosis, despite
      multimodal treatment approaches. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection,
      external beam radiation or both. The role of adjuvant or concomitant chemotherapy in the
      initial therapy of GBM and AA has not, as yet, been clearly defined. Since most of these
      patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, improvements in both first-line
      and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. In
      August 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug status for
      Erlotinib in patients with malignant glioma. Erlotinib (OSI-774) has been shown to be active
      in a range of tumors including GBM, AA and non small cell lung cancer. Because of the
      promising results in preliminary studies of Erlotinib and because of significant experience
      with the safety of the dosages proposed in this study, this study will offer a safe adjuvant
      treatment for patients with relapsing recurring glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma.
      Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that Erlotinib
      can be safely used up to a dose of 150 mg bid for 12 cycles to ultimately enhance survival of
      patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA with particular genetic alterations including
      EGFRvIII amplification and PTEN loss.

    <description>Tarceva®: Will be given at a starting dose of 150mg QD dose for the first cycle which is 28 days. This will be followed by 14 days of 100mg PO on a bid schedule and 150mg PO on a bid schedule for the final 14 days of the second cycle. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity, 150 mg PO tid will be continued for up to 10 more cycles. This is an outpatient regimen, in which the drug is admininistered orally. Tumor response will be assessed after every 2nd treatment cycle. Patients may receive a maximum of 12 cycles of treatment under this research protocol.</description>

            <description>Erlotinib: Tarceva®: Will be given at a starting dose of 150mg QD dose for the first cycle which is 28 days. This will be followed by 14 days of 100mg PO on a bid schedule and 150mg PO on a bid schedule for the final 14 days of the second cycle. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity, 150 mg PO tid will be continued for up to 10 more cycles. This is an outpatient regimen, in which the drug is admininistered orally. Tumor response will be assessed after every 2nd treatment cycle. Patients may receive a maximum of 12 cycles of treatment under this research protocol.</description>
