      Corticosteroid combined with cytotoxic drugs has been regarded as the conventional therapy
      for Class IV Lupus Nephritis (LN), because of its efficacy in improving patients' long term
      survival. However, this treatment fails in some patients, especially those who present with
      significant vascular lesion. In addition, cyclophosphamide (CTX) has severe side effects with
      a high incidence of marrow inhibition and infection.FK506 (Tacrolimus) is a new calcineurin
      inhibitor. Similar to Cyclosporine (CsA), it inhibits the production of IL-2 and activation
      of T cells. Furthermore, it has an added value of inhibiting the production of IL-10 from Th2
      cells, thus reducing the production of auto antibodies from B cells.It also exerts its
      specific immunosuppressive effects through CsA-insensitive pathway. FK506 could inhibit not
      only the activation of naive T cells but also the activation and proliferation of primed T
      cells.FK506 is 10 -100 times more powerful than CsA in inhibiting the activation of T
      cells.Animal studies on MRL/lpr mice LN model demonstrated that FK506 could significantly
      depress the excretion of urine protein and the level of serum anti-dsDNA, inhibit glomerular
      cellular proliferation and formation of crescents, and reduce the deposits of immune complex.

      A preliminary study showed that FK506 was significantly effective on patients with IV LN,as
      indicated by rapid reduction of urine protein, increase in serum albumin, decrease in auto
      antibodies together with remission of lesion activity of the renal tissue. However, the
      drawbacks of this study were the small sample size and the lack of a controlled group. Hence,
      a multi-center controlled study comparing FK506 with cytotoxic agents to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of FK506 on patients with III or IV LN, and explore the effective range
      of FK506 blood concentration and the appropriate target patient population would be needed.
