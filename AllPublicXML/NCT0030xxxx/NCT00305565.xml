    <textblock>
      This is a postmarket medical device study. The objective of this study is to compare the
      safety and effectiveness of Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) Therapy administered at different
      amounts of electrical charge for the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant
      depression (TRD).

      This is a postmarket medical device study. This study will examine treatment outcomes for
      patients with TRD who are randomized to VNS Therapy administered at different amounts of
      electrical charge. The Sponsor, Cyberonics, provides funding for this study. Patients are
      followed for 54 weeks, 50 of those weeks are following implantation of the VNS Therapy
      system. No study sites will be permitted to enroll study subjects until Institutional Review
      Board (IRB) approval has been received. Sites are permitted to be approved by a local or a
      central IRB.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Percent Response at Week 22 of the Acute Phase (ITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Study Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>Originally, the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) (Guy W 1976)was designed as a 7-item scale used to assess how much the patient's illness had improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention.(1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.)
In this study, the CGI-I was categorized into just two groups. A value of 1 (considered a response) was assigned for very much improved (at least 85% improvement) &amp; much improved (at least 60% improvement). A value of 0 (considered non-response) was assigned for: minimally improved (at least 20-25% improvement), no change (between ±15% change), minimally worse (at least 20-55% worse), much worse (at least 60% worse), and very much worse (at least 80% worse). No score was assigned if the investigator did not provide a categorical rating at a particular follow-up visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of chronic or recurrent depression and is currently
             experiencing a major depressive episode.

          -  Patient has not had an adequate response to four or more adequate antidepressant
             treatments from at least two different antidepressant treatment categories.

          -  Patient has (in the investigator's judgment) sufficient impairment from his/her
             depression and/or depression treatment that the potential benefits/risks of VNS
             Therapy are warranted.

          -  Patient must currently be receiving at least one antidepressant treatment; the patient
             must be receiving all current antidepressant treatments in a stable regimen.

          -  If the patient has a current diagnosis of bipolar disorder, the patient must be
             receiving a mood stabilizer.

          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older and of legal age of consent.

          -  Patient must be able to complete the evaluations specified in the study procedures

          -  Patient has had a bilateral or left cervical vagotomy.

          -  Patient currently uses, or is expected to use during the study, short-wave diathermy,
             microwave diathermy, or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy.

          -  A VNS Therapy System implant would pose an unacceptable surgical or medical risk for
             the patient.

          -  Patient is expected to require full body magnetic resonance imaging during the
             clinical study.

          -  Patient is acutely suicidal.

          -  Patient has a history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other psychotic
             disorder or a current major depressive episode that includes psychotic features

Sustained Response is defined as the percentage of Acute Phase responders (week 22) who were also responders at the end of the Long-term (week 50) phase. An analysis of sustained response was performed using the IDS-C to evaluate the long-term durability of the improvements in depression scores observed with adjunctive VNS Therapy.</description>

Sustained Response is defined as the percentage of Acute Phase responders (week 22) who were also responders at the end of the Long-term (week 50) phase. An analysis of sustained response was performed using the MADRS to evaluate the long-term durability of the improvements in depression scores observed with adjunctive VNS Therapy.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impressions Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Percent Response at Week 22 of the Acute Phase (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Originally, the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) (Guy W 1976)was designed as a 7-item scale used to assess how much the patient's illness had improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention.(1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.)
In this study, the CGI-I was categorized into just two groups. A value of 1 (considered a response) was assigned for very much improved (at least 85% improvement) &amp; much improved (at least 60% improvement). A value of 0 (considered non-response) was assigned for: minimally improved (at least 20-25% improvement), no change (between ±15% change), minimally worse (at least 20-55% worse), much worse (at least 60% worse), and very much worse (at least 80% worse). No score was assigned if the investigator did not provide a categorical rating at a particular follow-up visit.</description>

          <description>The 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C/SR) (Rush et al. 1986, 1996) is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. Scale range minimum = 0 / maximum = 84. Higher values are considered to be worse outcomes.
