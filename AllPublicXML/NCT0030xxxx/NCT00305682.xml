      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. An
      umbilical cord blood transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a
      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving sirolimus and
      mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
      together with total-body irradiation followed by an umbilical cord blood transplant,
      sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil works in treating patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the one- and two-year survival of patients with hematologic malignancies
           treated with a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine,
           cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation followed by umbilical cord blood
           transplantation and post-transplant immunosuppression comprising sirolimus and
           mycophenolate mofetil.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the six-month nonrelapse mortality of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the presence of chimerism in patients treated with this regimen at days 21,
           60, 100, 180, and 365.

        -  Determine the incidence of neutrophil engraftment by day 42 in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of platelet engraftment by six months in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease
           (GVHD) at day 100 in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at one year in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the probability of overall survival within one or two years in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the probability of progression-free survival within one or two years in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of relapse or disease progression within one or two years in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients are stratified into five disease groups: 1.
      acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in
      first chronic phase and second chronic phase [CP2] after myeloid blast crisis; 2. acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, CML CP2 post lymphoid blast crisis, 3. large-cell
      B and T-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma; 4. chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
      lymphocytic lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma; 5. Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma.

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously on days -6 to
           -2 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -6. Patients who did not undergo prior autologous
           transplant or who received â‰¤ 1 course of prior multiagent chemotherapy or no severely
           immunosuppressive therapy in the past 3 months also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV
           on days -6 to -4. All patients also undergo total-body irradiation on day -1.

        -  Umbilical cord blood transplant: Patients undergo umbilical cord blood transplantation
           on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression: Sirolimus will be administered starting at day -3
           with 8mg-12mg mg oral loading dose followed by single dose 4 mg/day with a target serum
           concentration of 3 to 12 mg/mL. Levels are to be monitored 3 times/week in the first 2
           weeks, weekly until day +60, and as clinically indicated until day +100
           post-transplantation. In the absence of acute GVHD sirolimus may be tapered starting at
           day +100 and eliminated by day +180 post-transplantation. Patients also receive
           mycophenolate mofetil IV on days -3 to 5 and then orally on days 6-30.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 320 patients will be accrued for this study.
