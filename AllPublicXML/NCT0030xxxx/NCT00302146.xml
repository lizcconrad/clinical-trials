      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) to compare how people with Gaucher
      disease or Gaucher disease carriers with parkinsonism, and their family members, use dopamine
      in their brains in comparison with healthy normal volunteers and people who have Parkinson
      disease. PET assesses organ function by measuring metabolism. In this study, magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) is used in conjunction with PET to help better interpret and
      understand the information gleaned from PET.

      People 21 years of age and older with the following conditions may be eligible for this
      study:

        -  Gaucher disease and parkinsonism

        -  Parkinsonism and a family history of Gaucher disease

        -  Gaucher disease and a family history of parkinsonism

        -  Gaucher disease carriers who have parkinsonism or a family history of parkinsonism

        -  Unaffected people with a family history of Gaucher disease and parkinsonism

        -  Healthy volunteers

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Personal and family medical history

        -  Physical examination

        -  PET scan: The subject lies on a table that slides into the PET scanner until his or her
           head is positioned properly in the scanner. A catheter is inserted into a vein. An
           initial scan is done to obtain images before radionuclides are injected. Radioactive
           water is then injected through the catheter and the subject is asked questions in order
           to stimulate blood flow in certain areas of the brain to show what parts of the brain
           are activated. Fluorodopa is then infused through the catheter over 3 minutes. The PET
           scan can last up to 2 hours.

        -  MRI scan: This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of organs.
           The subject lies still on a bed in the middle of a circular scanner for about 30
           minutes.

    <textblock>
      An association between Gaucher disease and parkinsonism has been demonstrated by the
      concurrence of parkinsonian manifestations in patients with Gaucher disease and an increased
      incidence of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations in subjects with parkinsonism of various
      ethnicities. Furthermore, there is a significant number of obligate and confirmed Gaucher
      carriers with parkinsonian manifestations. Thus, alterations in GBA appear to be a more
      common risk factor than previously thought for the development of sporadic Parkinson disease
      and related disorders. However, in affected and at-risk individuals, the identification and
      characterization of early parkinsonian manifestations, and the rate of progression of
      symptoms have not been studied objectively. We propose an in-vivo study that will employ
      multiple imaging modalities to better define the phenotype in GBA-associated parkinsonism,
      follow disease progression, and identify at-risk individuals. The subjects include patients
      with Gaucher disease and Gaucher carriers with parkinsonian manifestations, and clinically
      unaffected but at-risk individuals carrying GBA mutations, and have/ a first degree relative
      with parkinsonism. The control groups consist of individuals with Gaucher disease but no
      parkinsonian symptoms, relatives of probands without GBA mutations, PD patients without GBA
      mutations, and healthy volunteers. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 6-[F-18]
      Fluoro-L-Dopa (6FD) will be used to evaluate presynaptic dopaminergic function, where 6FD
      uptake in putamen and striatum will be employed as a measure of neuronal structural integrity
      in substantia nigra. Each subject will be screened with an MRI to rule-out anatomic brain
      abnormalities, and to further delineate areas of interest in the PET scans. Subjects will
      also undergo transcranial ultrasonography (TCS) to assess the substantia nigra
      non-invasively. The results of both the PET scans and TCS will be kept confidential, and will
      not be communicated to the individuals or families involved in the study. In addition to the
      imaging studies, all patients will undergo a physical and neurological examination,
      neurocognitive evaluation, and olfactory testing.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The study will include adult subjects age 21 or older carrying GBA mutations. The two major
        study groups will include subjects with parkinsonism and unaffected subjedcts yet at risk
        with a first degree family member with parkinsonism.

        Controls will include subjects without GBA mutations, with sporadic PD and healthy
        volunteers who do not have a family history of parkinsonism or Gaucher disease.

        Healthy Volunteers and Control subjects will be matched for age, gender and handedness for
        statistical purposes.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The subjects excluded from the study are those:

          1. with severe cognitive deficits impairing decision making

          2. unable or medically unsafe to withdraw from their current medications, such as
             subjects on SSRIs and other psychoactive drugs.

          3. pregnant or nursing. All women of child bearing potential will undergo a pregnancy
             test.

          4. With a history of neurologic conditions such as stroke or any focal brain lesion that
             may result in parkinsonian manifestations. Individuals with such MRI findings will be
             excluded from the study.
