      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy
      together with capecitabine may kill more tumor cells. Celecoxib may prevent or lessen
      hand-foot syndrome caused by capecitabine.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well celecoxib works in preventing
      hand/foot syndrome caused by capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast or colorectal
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of celecoxib in reducing the incidence and severity of hand/foot
           syndrome caused by capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer or colorectal
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to metastatic disease (breast vs colorectal), ECOG performance
      status (0 or 1 vs 2), prior chemotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

        -  Regimen A (concurrent radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5-6
           weeks and receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 days a week. Following completion of
           radiotherapy, patients may continue oral capecitabine as in regimen B.

        -  Regimen B (no radiotherapy): Patients receive oral capecitabine once daily on days 1-14.
           Courses repeat every 21 days.

      Patients are also randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-21. In both arms, treatment
           repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 342 patients will be accrued for this study.
