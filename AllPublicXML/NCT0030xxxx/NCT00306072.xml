    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two levels of the herbal extract Salacia oblonga
      (salacinol) on postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes after
      ingestion of a high-carbohydrate control meal.

      Although we have generated a good quantity of animal and human data on the salacinol extract,
      we have not explored the effect of the salacinol extract on postprandial glycemia or
      insulinemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      We planned to study 66 patients with diabetes in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      three-treatment, crossover study. While in a fasted state, subjects were to consume one of
      the following three meals: a standard liquid meal containing 110 g carbohydrate, 18 g
      protein, 12 g fat, and 620 kilocalories (Control); Control plus 240 mg Salacia oblonga
      extract; and Control plus 480 mg Salacia oblonga extract. Postprandial serum glucose and
      serum insulin samples were to be analyzed for 180 min.

          6. Subject states that he/she has an active malignancy (subjects with cutaneous
             malignancies, other than melanoma, may be included in the study).

          7. Subject states that he/she has had a significant cardiovascular event &lt; 12 weeks prior
             to study entry.

          8. Subject states that he/she has end stage organ failure, including clinically advanced
             renal disease as assessed by the study physician.
