  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family members have poor overall understanding of ICU patients’ prognosis, resuscitation
      status and care, defined a priori as less than 75% correct responses to the yes/no ICU care
      questions.

      Family members of all adult patients admitted to an intensive care of San Francisco General
      Hospital will be screened for enrollment and recruited sequentially over a period of nine
      months (August 1, 2005-March 31, 2006). We will determine the frequency of family members’
      correct responses to the survey questions about ICU care. Family member responses will be
      compared to the chart and real-time patient observation reality (gold standard).

      Hypothesis # 2 Poor English language comprehension and low education level (defined as not
      having completed high school) are risk factors for poor ICU care understanding and knowledge.

      During their surveys family members will be asked questions regarding their English language
      comprehension and education level. Association of these possible risk factors with low level
      of ICU care knowledge will be tested primarily using analysis of variance. Should our
      hypothesis #2 prove to be correct, our future goal will be to develop recommendations for
      interventions to increase understanding specific for these high risk groups. One of these
      interventions is described in Hypothesis #3 below.

      Hypothesis # 3 Provision of the results of family members’ knowledge assessment to health
      care providers will result in improved ICU care knowledge on subsequent testing.

      Subjects will be randomized to two groups—one group’s health care providers will be shown the
      results of family members’ initial ICU knowledge assessment; the other group’s providers will
      not be given these results. One to two days after providing this summary to providers, all
      randomized subjects will undergo a second interview assessing their ICU care knowledge.
      Changes in the frequency of correct responses between the two groups will be compared using
      mean differences in proportions with 95% confidence intervals.
