  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration of a synbiotic, comprised on
      inulin and a bifidobacterial probiotic will colonise the gut wall and down-regulate TNF-alpha
      and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mucosa of Crohn's patients with active disease to
      reduce mucosal inflammation and induce remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is one of the two main forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. The
      Th1-mediated inflammatory response in Crohn's disease is characterised by increased IL-18 and
      INF-gamma and especially TNF-alpha, which are formed by lamina propria mononuclear cells. The
      aim of this investigation is to determine whether a synbiotic comprised of inulin and a
      bifidobacterial probiotic, that we have previously shown to down-regulate TNF-alpha and other
      proinflammatory cytokines in the gut mucosa in ulcerative colitis patients with active
      disease, can colonise the bowel wall, reduce mucosal inflammation and induce remission in
      Crohn's disease patients with active disease, in a randomised controlled trial. Crohn's
      disease is associated with high mortality and incurs significant social, commercial and NHS
      costs. Many patients are refractile to standard treatments, which often have undesirable side
      effects. An inexpensive, effective and non-toxic treatment based on the synbiotic concept
      would contribute greatly to relieving the clinical and financial burdens of the disease.
