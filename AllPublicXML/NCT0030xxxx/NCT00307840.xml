      The purpose of this study was to compare two different initial dosing schemes for the
      administration of paricalcitol in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism:
      the already in use iPTH/80 scheme, and an iPTH/120 scheme, which corresponds to the
      immediately lower dose, based on current instructions on paricalcitol dose adjustment. We
      studied the effectiveness of the two dosing schemes in achieving a target iPTH level (150 –
      300 pg/mL)

      Adjustment of the initial dose of paricalcitol, in hemodialysis patients with secondary
      hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), on the basis of severity of sHPT is generally preferred in
      current practice. Whether the proposed dose, based on the formula baseline intact parathyroid
      hormone (iPTH [pg/mL]) divided by 80, is the most appropriate has not been adequately
      assessed. A trial comparing the iPTH/80 dose to the immediately lower iPTH/120 dose was
      undertaken. We studied the ability of the two different dosing schemes to control iPTH levels
      within a desired range between 150 and 300 pg/mL, as well as the frequency of iPTH
      over-suppression (&lt; 150 pg/mL) in the two groups (iPTH/80 and iPTH/120).
