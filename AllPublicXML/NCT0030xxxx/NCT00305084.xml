    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of the combination (escalation
      doses of NGR-hTNF, from 0.2 mcg/sqm to 1.6 mcg/sqm , with a fixed dose of doxorubicin, 75
      mg/sqm). Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to
      National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC ).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will be conducted
      in sequential cohorts of patients. Three patients per each cohort are planned.

      Patients, with advanced or metastatic solid tumor previously treated with a non cumulative
      dose of doxorubicin (&lt;300 mg/sqm in order to allow an adequate number of cycles) or
      chemotherapy naïve will be enrolled.
