    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug (topotecan) as it
      is given directly into brain tumors by a delivery technique called convection-enhanced
      delivery. This drug has been used for different types of cancer, but in this study it will be
      given by an experimental delivery technique designed to maximize the amount of drug delivered
      to the brain tumor and minimize the side effects in other parts of the body.

      This study will also evaluate advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques.

      The study will assess quality of life parameters throughout the follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical efficacy with chemotherapy has been discouraging for malignant brain tumors, mostly
      because of side effects and delivery limitations. Because they are locally invasive and
      rarely metastasize, malignant gliomas have features that make them uniquely amenable to new
      strategies of regional drug delivery. Intracerebral clysis (convection-enhanced delivery) is
      a novel drug delivery strategy that uses a microinfusion pump to establish a pressure
      gradient in the brain via implanted catheters. The pressure gradient produces convective
      forces that distribute a therapeutic agent throughout the tumor and surrounding brain tissue.

      Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods of monitoring drug distribution and
      treatment response have been developed to maximize the clinical applications and minimize
      complications associated with treatment risks.

      Study participants will be taken to the operating room to have 2 catheters surgically placed
      into their tumor and surrounding tumor bed. These catheters will then be connected to small
      infusion pumps which will slowly infuse topotecan continuously over 4-5 days. Patients will
      have daily MRI scans while in the hospital. Upon completion of the experimental treatment,
      patients will be discharged and will be followed up in the outpatient clinic.

    <description>Once a plastic catheter is placed, within 24 hours of placement, the catheter will be connected to a small pump at the bedside, and the convection-enhanced delivery of the Topotecan will begin. The Topotecan will be infused for 4 to 5 days after which time the catheters will simply be pulled out. Patients will be monitored with blood tests and MRI scans during the treatment and at different time periods during the following months.</description>
