      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa)
      administered by injection subcutaneously (SC, under the skin), at a dose of 80,000 U once
      every four weeks or 40,000 U once every two in anemic patients with cancer not receiving
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epoetin alfa is an analogue (has the identical amino acid sequence) of erythropoetin, a
      hormone secreted by kidneys known to stimulate red blood cell production. Although epoetin
      alfa has been known to be effective in treatment of anemia associated with cancer
      chemotherapy, there are no specific formal guidelines on the use of epoetin alfa for the
      treatment of anemia in cancer patients not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
      Several prospective clinical trials investigating the efficacy of epoetin alfa in
      cancer-associated anemia included groups of patients not receiving chemotherapy where it was
      demonstrated that the use of epoetin alfa in this population was safe and effective in
      increasing hemoglobin (Hb) levels and reducing transfusion requirements. The optimal dosing
      regimen of epoetin alfa in cancer patients not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy
      remains unclear.

      This 17-week study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center study to assess the
      safety and effectiveness of epoetin alfa in anemic patients with cancer not receiving
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Eligible patients with hemoglobin level &lt;= 11 g/dL will
      receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U once every 2 weeks for 15 weeks or 80,000 U once every 4 weeks
      for 13 weeks. The study hypothesis are that there are no long-term safety concerns of epoetin
      alfa administered at these two dosing regimens and that both dosing regimens are equally
      effective in this patient population. Eligible patients with hemoglobin levels &lt;= 11 g/dL
      will receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U once every 2 weeks for 15 weeks or 80,000 U once every 4
      weeks for 13 weeks.
