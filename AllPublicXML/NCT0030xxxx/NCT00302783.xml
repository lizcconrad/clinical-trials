  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether multi-source feedback, including self-assessment
      and tailored coaching, improves resident communication skills and professionalism. We
      hypothesize that residents who are assigned to receive multi-source feedback, in addition to
      receiving standard feedback, will improve significantly more than residents receiving
      standard feedback alone, as measured by parent and nurse ratings of specific behaviors over
      time.
