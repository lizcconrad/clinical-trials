  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two fixed doses (16mg/day
      and 24mg/day) of galantamine (a drug for treating dementia) versus placebo for the treatment
      of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and to investigate the dose-response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two fixed doses of galantamine (16 and 24 milligrams per day [mg/day])
      in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and to investigate the dose-response. The study
      consists of a 4-week screening period during which all patients will receive placebo, and a
      22-week double-blind treatment period during which patients will receive placebo, galantamine
      16 mg/day, or galantamine 24 mg/day. For patients receiving galantamine treatment, the
      starting dose is 8 mg/day and increases at 4-week intervals in increments of 8 mg/day. The
      primary measures of effectiveness are the change from baseline to the end of the study (week
      22) in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Japan cognitive subscale (ADAS-J cog) and
      the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus - Japan (CIBIC plus-J). Safety
      assessments include the incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination findings. The study hypothesis is that
      galantamine will be more effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease than placebo.
      Study drug taken orally twice a day. 4-week screening period: All patients receive placebo.
      22-week treatment period: Patients receive placebo, galantamine 16 mg/day, or 24 mg/day. For
      galantamine treatment, the starting dose is 8 mg/day and increases at 4-week intervals in
      increments of 8 mg/day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease according to the National
             Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and the Alzheimer's Disease and
             Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria

          -  having a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score of 10 - 22 inclusive

          -  having an Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Japan cognitive subscale (ADAS-J cog)
             score of at least 18

          -  exhibiting an onset and progression of cognitive dysfunction during at least 6 months
             prior to the screening period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neurodegenerative diseases other than Alzheimer's disease, such as Lewy
             bodies disease, (dementia due to tiny round structures made of proteins that develop
             within nerve cells in the brain), Parkinsonism, etc

          -  Patients with cognitive dysfunction due to cerebral damage resulting from a lack of
             oxygen, a brain injury, etc

          -  Patients with multi-infarct dementia (brought on by a series of strokes) or active
             cerebrovascular disease

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease

          -  Patients currently taking drugs such as a cholinesterase inhibitors, which improve
             cerebral circulation/metabolism
