  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are one of the most commonly abused drugs among individuals who seek treatment for
      drug abuse. Thus, it is necessary to develop new treatments for opioid addiction. The purpose
      of this trial is determine whether tramadol is effective in treating opioid dependent
      individuals.

      This human laboratory study will test the effects of tramadol as a step in its development as
      a new treatment for opioid dependence. Tramadol is a moderate mu agonist opioid that may
      produce low levels of opioid physical dependence. Tramadol's capacity for producing physical
      dependence has not been systematically studied in humans. It is important to quantify
      tramadol, as it provides a measure of its opioid agonist effects. This would also be
      informative in regards to the abuse liability of tramadol when used as an analgesic (as
      currently marketed), or when used in the treatment of opioid addiction (as proposed in this
      study). The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the level of physical dependence as well as
      blockade efficacy produced by chronic maintenance on oral tramadol in opioid dependent
      individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive different doses of tramadol or placebo for
      up to six weeks. Experimental sessions will take place up to three times per week during the
      treatment period. During challenge sessions, participants will receive an injection; four
      different kinds of effects may occur in a session following this injection. First, no effect
      may occur (a placebo). Second, an opioid agonist effect may occur (opioid agonists include
      heroin, morphine, hydromorphone, tramadol, and methadone), which may cause the participant to
      feel &quot;high.&quot; Third, an opioid antagonist effect may occur (e.g., naloxone, naltrexone), which
      may cause the participant to feel a sense of opioid withdrawal.
