  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind study looking at the efficacy and satisfaction of Concerta
      substitution in adult subjects with ADHD receiving immediate release methylphenidate.
      Subjects will be administered a maximum dose of 1.3mg/kg/day of either methylphenidate or
      Concerta. The specific hypotheses of this study are:

      Hypothesis 1: ADHD symptomatology in adults with DSM-IV, ADHD will continue to be controlled
      in patients switched from MPH IR TID to Concerta.

      Hypothesis 2: Patient satisfaction will not decrease in patients switched from MPH IR TID to
      Concerta (ie., all patients will be equally or more satisfied on Concerta as compared with
      MPH IR TID.

      Concerta was specifically developed to replace three times a day immediate release (IR)
      methylphenidate (MPH). The clinical advantages offered by this novel compound go beyond ease
      of administration. By avoiding the peaks and valleys of serum levels associated with IR MPH,
      treatment with Concerta minimizes adverse effects at peaks and break through symptoms at
      valleys securing clinical coverage throughout the day, minimizing the risks of adverse
      effects from serum fluctuations that can occur with multiple dosing of the IR formulation of
      MPH. This unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Concerta is potentially
      particularly advantageous in the treatment of adults with ADHD because a) adults with ADHD
      tend to be forgetful; b) forgetfulness makes the self administration of treatment three times
      a day difficult; c) forgetfulness can lead to poor compliance and drop off of effects over
      time with its attendant detrimental effect on clinical control and quality of life. Subjects
      will be randomized by the pharmacy to CONCERTA or to continue MPH IR TID in a ratio of 4:1.

      This study includes: 1) a six-week design to document the response rate 2) assessment of the
      impact of either MPH IR or Concerta on functional capacities 3) careful assessment of safety
      and tolerability

         13. Non English speaking subjects will not be allowed into the study for the following
             reasons: a) the assessment instruments are not available and have not been adequately
             standardized in other languages; b) our clinical trials facility is located in
             Cambridge and not in the MGH main campus without the availability of translators; and
             c) even if such translation services were to be available, the assessments in the
             English language conducted by English speaking clinicians and raters with English
             speaking subjects is already extremely time consuming lasting many hours making it
             unfeasible, unrealistic, and of dubious clinical validity to conduct them with a
             translator with non English speaking subjects; d) psychiatric questionnaires and
             evaluations are taxing and adding the complexity of a translator has the potential to
             make the patient experience even more exhausting.
