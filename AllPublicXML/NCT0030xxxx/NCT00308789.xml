  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of delivering Nasal Continuous Airway
      Pressure (NCPAP): Biphasic Mode and a continuous mode, to see which is better in getting
      babies off the ventilator and decreasing lung damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a significant problem among low birth weight infants with
      a reported incidence of up to 26% in infants &lt; 1500 grams. Nasal continuous positive airway
      pressure (NCPAP) has been demonstrated to provide effective non-invasive respiratory support
      for preterm infants. The use of NCPAP is associated with a decreased need for mechanical
      ventilation and may impact on the incidence of CLD. There are two types of NCPAP now
      available, a Biphasic mode which allows for cycling at two different levels of positive
      pressure and a continuous mode which allows only for one level of positive pressure.

      Comparisons: Biphasic NCPAP will be compared with continuous CPAP to see which better
      facilitates the extubation of preterm infants who weigh &lt;/= 1250 grams at birth. The
      incidence of CLD, retinopathy of prematurity, sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage,
      periventricular leucomalacia and necrotizing entercolitis will also be compared between the
      two groups.
