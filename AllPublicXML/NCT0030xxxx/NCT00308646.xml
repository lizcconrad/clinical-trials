      During the past years, many efforts were put on the diagnosis and treatment of DM and its
      complications. It will be more effective if we can work on the primary prevention for the
      high risk groups of diabetes and prediabetes such as the early detection. As a first public
      health step, it is worthwhile to identify prediabetes people in community by screening
      program. Three thousand persons will be randomly selected from residents of Taichung city.
      All the participants will fulfill a structured questionnaire and 'Diabetes risk factor
      screening tool' which American Diabetes Association suggested in 2003. This project will
      estimate the prevalence of prediabetes in conventional hospital-base population as well as
      the validity of a screening questionnaire for prediabetes.
