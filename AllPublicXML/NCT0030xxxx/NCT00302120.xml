  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether performing MRI of the breast will improve
      breast cancer management by reducing the number of biopsies and in case of malignancy
      allowing one-stage surgical excision of the tumor.

      Each year 7000 women present with nonpalpable suspicious breast lesions on mammography in the
      Netherlands. In the usual care situation, these lesions are detected by mammography and
      ultrasonography and pathologically characterized by analysis of large core needle biopsy
      material. In case of malignancy, these lesions are surgically removed. First, a wire is
      placed in the breast with the tip of the wire within 1 cm of the tumor and then the surgeon
      follows the wire and removes the lesion. Unfortunately about 25% of women require more that
      one surgical procedure to remove all tumorous tissue. This is caused by incorrect presurgical
      diagnosis of the extent and invasiveness of the disease (multifocality, multicentricity,
      lymph node involvement). We hypothesize that MR mammography will improve presurgical
      diagnosis and differentiation of lesions and thereby decrease the number of invasive surgical
      procedures (primary outcome) and number of invasive biopsies (secondary outcome).
