      It is our hypothesis that patient's expectations concerning treatment outcome will be
      influenced by their psychiatric symptoms, and that this expectancy will have a strong
      influence on the efficacy of acupuncture treatment to suppress experimentally induced pain.
      We will conduct a study, monitoring expectations but not manipulating them, in a cohort of
      patients with chronic low back pain.

      Specific Aim: To characterize subjective analgesia (behavioral effect) of different
      expectancy levels on verum and sham acupuncture treatment and the relative contribution of
      acupuncture treatment and expectancy to the resultant analgesia in healthy normals and in
      those with low back pain, controlling for psychiatric comorbidity.

      Hypothesis 1: Patients with low back pain, low psychiatric comorbidity, and high expectations
      for acupuncture treatment will experience the same magnitude of acupuncture analgesia to
      thermal pain stimuli as healthy volunteers with high expectations for treatment.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients with low back pain and high psychiatric comorbidity will experience
      less acupuncture analgesia compared to patients with low back pain and low psychiatric
      comorbidity, regardless of the level of expectations for acupuncture treatment.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients with low back pain and high psychiatric comorbidity will have
      increased acupuncture placebo analgesia to thermal pain stimuli than both other groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age with discogenic low back pain, either with
             or without radicular pain for more than three months, assessed by the treating
             physician with the use of imaging. Patients with discogenic low back are chosen in
             order to study a more uniform pain syndrome, a concern in pain medicine research
             [153]. Patients must have pain for at least three months because 90% of back pain
             resolves within three months of onset, and back pain beyond this time is more likely
             to remain chronic [156].

          2. Average pain intensity of ≥4 on a scale from 0 to 10, because &lt;4 is considered a level
             with acceptable pain and function

          3. At least an 8th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided
             that the subjects feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment
             measures.

          4. No long-acting opioids. Short acting opioids are acceptable, provided that subjects
             undergo a 7-10 day washout period. It is not possible to recruit an entirely opioid
             naïve population.

          5. No prescription benzodiazepines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any interventional procedure for low back or radicular pain two weeks prior to the
             study or during the two week study period, such as lumbar epidural steroids, nerve
             root blocks, or facet joint injections/ radiofrequency lesioning.

          2. Having received acupuncture treatment before for any condition.

          3. Back surgery in the previous 12 weeks, the intent to undergo back surgery during the
             study period, or any clinically unstable systemic illness that is judged to interfere
             with the trial.

          4. Non-ambulatory status

          5. History of cardiac or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's judgment,
             precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for adverse
             outcome.

          6. An inability to complete questionnaires accurately.

          7. . Current opioid treatment through an intrathecal device

          8. Cancer or other malignant disease, except carcinoma in situ of the skin or cervix
