  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus
      GG will reduce the rate of failure or relapse following treatment of CDAD with metronidazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD), which nearly always follows antibiotic
      therapy, has become increasingly common and important in American hospitals, causing
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for this
      condition. We have recently reported (Clin Infect Dis, June 2005) that treatment with
      metronidazole is associated with a 22% rate of failure and 28% rate of relapse. No other
      medication has been shown to be more effective. There is a substantial theory and some
      limited data to suggest that dietary supplementation with non-pathogenic normal bowel
      bacteria will benefit these patients. Lactobacillus GG is the best-standardized and the most
      extensively studied of these agents.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be identified based on the diagnosis of CDAD. This diagnosis is made
             bases on the presence of diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain and/or leukocytosis together
             with a positive fecal assay for Clostridium difficile toxin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to take oral medications and those with underlying
             gastrointestinal disease or colonostomy will be excluded.

          -  Patients currently taking penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones or tetracyclines
             will be excluded because these drugs are active against Lactobacillus.
