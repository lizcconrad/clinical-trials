  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this gene therapy study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      intramuscular gene transfer using Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) or placebo in
      patients with moderate to high-risk Critical Limb Ischemia (a condition in which there is
      poor blood circulation in the leg). This trial will assess whether VEGF improves rest pain
      and/or heals ulcers in the legs of patients with peripheral artery disease (blockages in leg
      arteries.)

      VEGF is DNA, or genetic material that will be injected into the leg muscles on three separate
      occasions, each 2 weeks apart. Once the DNA is in the leg, it directs the cells of the artery
      wall to increase its production of VEGF, which has been shown to cause new blood vessels to
      grow. This experimental therapy is designed to grow new blood vessels around blockages in the
      leg arteries.

      The total length of participation in this study is approximately 1 year and will require
      approximately 8 clinic visits within that year. Following enrollment in the study, testing
      may be done for cancer screening, blood work, physical exams, vascular testing and eye exams.
      There is no charge for any testing or office visits required by the study.

      This study has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

             sympathectomy within the 2 months preceding screening

          -  Be a suitable candidate for surgical or endovascular revascularization in the limb in
             which treatment is proposed
