  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the contraceptive efficacy, safety, cycle control,
      compliance, and subject satisfaction of the transdermal contraceptive system, norelgestromine
      and ethinyl estradiol (NLGM / EE).

    <textblock>
      A multicenter, open label, descriptive study. Five hundred requiring contraception will
      receive the weekly transdermal contraceptive patch for 6 cycles. At the baseline and after
      the 1st, 3rd and 6th cycles, satisfaction with the method will be assessed. The contraceptive
      efficacy will be assessed by the Pearl Index and by life table analysis. To assess
      satisfaction with the weekly transdermal contraceptive patch, this method will be compared to
      the previous contraceptive method. Adhesion, cycle control, safety and efficacy are secondary
      outcomes. Treatment duration: 6 cycles (4 weeks each). The subject will wear a 20 cm2
      contraceptive transdermal patch for one full week, apply a fresh patch for week 2, and a
      third patch for week 3. The fourth week will be patch-free. Each patch deliveries 150 mcg of
      NLGM and 20 mcg of EE per day.
