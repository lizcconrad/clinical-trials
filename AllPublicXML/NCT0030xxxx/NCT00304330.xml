  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The information collected will provide insight in to the epidemiology of antibiotic
      resistance in a transplant compared to a non-transplant population. Data is needed regarding
      the date of admission, date of bloodstream infection and location of ward/ICU so trends in
      the emergence of resistance and antibiotic usage can be detected.

      We need to collect details on the demographics (age, sex etc), underlying conditions,
      transplant types and immunosuppression, in-hospital antibiotic management and clinical
      outcomes so that the effect of antibiotic resistance on patient outcome can be measured. We
      also need to collect microbiology and pathology data to determine the antibiotic
      susceptibility profile of the involved organisms. The following variables will be followed:
      time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness,
      prophylactic antimicrobials, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data,
      empiric antimicrobial usage, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of
      antibiotic once organism identified, suspected source of infection, microbiological and
      clinical outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, gender, weight,
      ethnicity, and past medical history

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.
