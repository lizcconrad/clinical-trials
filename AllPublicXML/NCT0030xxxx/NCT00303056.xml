  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the overall treatment effect on pain relief between
      icatibant and placebo. The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of icatibant in
      term of onset, extent and duration of pain relief relative to triamcinolone, to evaluate the
      safety of icatibant, to evaluate overall conditions of daily life after treatment with
      icatibant, to assess systemic exposure of icatibant following intra-articular injection.
