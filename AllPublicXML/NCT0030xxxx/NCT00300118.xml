      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mesalazine or budesonide is more active in
      the treatment of active Crohn's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is often treated with glucocorticoids or mesalazine. Both drugs are indicated
      for active Crohn's disease. Treatment with mesalazine is indicated for the treatment of
      mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. Budesonide 9 mg/day or mesalazine 4.5 g/day are
      better than lower doses.

      So far only one trial compares the efficacy and safety of budesonide and 5-ASA. The result of
      this trial is that budesonide is more effective in inducing remission than mesalazine. The
      primary objective of this trial is to confirm this result for other presentations of
      budesonide and mesalazine; i.e. Budenofalk® capsules (9 mg/day) and Salofalk® tablets
      (Eudragit-L-coated oral mesalazine; 4.5 g/day) in moderately active Crohn's disease.
      Mesalazine is used in this trial as a comparator.

        Inclusion Criteria (main):

          -  Symptoms of Crohn's disease since at least 3 months; diagnosis confirmed by endoscopic
             and histological, or endoscopic and radiological criteria [endoscopy not older than 12
             months or if older, then clinical signs (e.g. pain localization, pain intensity, blood
             in stool) and behaviour (according to Vienna classification) should be unchanged
             compared to former episodes]

          -  Localisation of CD either in terminal ileum, ascending colon or ileocolitis

          -  Active phase of disease (200 &lt; CDAI &lt; 400)

        Exclusion Criteria (main):

          -  Known Crohn's lesion in the upper GI-tract (up to and including the jejunum) with
             present symptoms

          -  CD in the rectum currently present

          -  Short bowel syndrome
