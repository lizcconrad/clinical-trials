  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the side-effect profile and efficacy of sustained
      release, OROS® and TTS, dosage forms of oxybutynin with immediate release (IR) oral
      oxybutynin and with placebo.

      Urinary incontinence (UI) refers to the involuntary loss of urine in sufficient amounts to be
      considered a social or health problem. While it is a psychologically distressing and socially
      disruptive, UI is believed to be an under reported and under diagnosed medical condition.
      This is a Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      with 1 week of single-blinded placebo run-in. Patients will be randomized to 6 weeks
      double-blind treatment with oxybutynin or placebo. The primary hypothesis to be tested in
      this study is that the treatment difference in the change in incontinence episodes per week
      after 6 weeks of treatment in the double-blind phase between individual oxybutynin-treated
      group and combined placebo group is equal to zero.

      The patients will receive oral OROS® containing oxybutynin, immediate release oral oxybutynin
      (1.7 or 2.5 mg) or TTS oxybutynin (60 cm2) daily for 7 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, aged 40 years or older, with screening PUD demonstrating an average urinary
             frequency of 10 per 24 hours and urge incontinence episodes ³10 times per week and £
             60 times per week, and CMG demonstrating detrusor contraction and/or severe &quot;must
             void&quot; urge (score = 2) at a bladder filling volume of less than or equal to 400 mL

          -  Women with mixed incontinence provided that symptoms and/or signs of stress
             incontinence are not the predominant manifestation of UI and urge incontinence
             episodes associated with urgency can be differentiated from urge incontinence episodes
             not associated with urgency

          -  Patients who are mentally intact and capable of understanding and following the study
             requirements

          -  Each patient must be determined to be in good general health prior to study
             participation. The evaluation will be based on the medical history

          -  Physical examination (general, genital, pelvic, rectal)

          -  Laboratory tests including blood chemistry profile (glucose, blood urea nitrogen, uric
             acid, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, total bilirubin,
             alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate
             dehydrogenase, sodium, potassium, creatinine, bicarbonate and chloride)

          -  Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets

          -  Urinalysis with microscopic examination

          -  And electrocardiogram (EKG)

          -  Creatinine clearance (Ccr) will be estimated as 0.85 x (140-Age) x (body weight in Kg)
             ¸ (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dl). The estimated Ccr must be greater than 50 mL/min

          -  Normotensive with supine blood pressure between the range of 100 - 140 mm Hg systolic
             and 65-90 mm Hg diastolic, and no clinically significant postural hypotension 30
             seconds and 2 minutes after standing. If patients are taking antihypertensive
             medications (may include calcium channel blockers but not undissolvable dosage forms),
             they must be normotensive on their antihypertensive medications. Patients should be on
             a stable dose of antihypertensive medications for at least 90 days before screening
             for the study and there should be no plan to change the dose of antihypertensive
             medications during the study

          -  Pre-menopausal women must be using a medically acceptable and effective birth control
             method (birth control pills or implants, IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, condoms with
             spermicide or spermicide-containing sponges) and have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at the time of screening

          -  Patients with positive urine cultures at screening may be treated with antibiotics and
             if urine cultures are negative following treatment and if the patient has been off
             antibiotics for a period of one week these patients may be rescreened. The patient's
             urine cultures should be negative before the patient begins recording the screening
             urinary diary and before the CMG

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known genitourinary conditions (identified on history or on examination)
             that may cause incontinence (eg, urinary tract infection, obstruction, bladder tumor,
             bladder stone)

          -  Patients with clinically significant medical problems or other organ abnormality or
             pathology for whom, in the opinion of the investigator, administration of oxybutynin
             would present undue risk (cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal,
             endocrine, neurological, rheumatological, hematological, urologic, or psychiatric
             disorders including depression)

             incontinence including dicyclomine, imipramine, propantheline, hyoscyamine (Levsin®),
             flavoxate, phenylpropanolamine, prazosin, pseudoephedrine, baclofen (Lioresal®), or
             terodiline less than the equivalent of 5 times the half-life of the drug

          -  Patients who have been treated with anticholinergic agents for urge UI and have been
             found to be refractory to these agents. (Note: Patients who have been shown to be
             responders to anticholinergic medications may be included in the study after an
             appropriate wash-out period equivalent to 5 times the half-life of the anticholinergic
             drug)

          -  Concomitant medications (including over-the-counter medications) during the study with
             the exception of medications taken regularly for chronic conditions or intermittently

          -  Estrogen replacement therapy, oral contraceptives, diuretics, calcium channel
             blockers)
