      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of domperidone (given to lactating
      mothers of very preterm infants) on the macronutrient composition of human milk.

    <textblock>
      Domperidone, a drug that enhances upper gastric motility, is an anti-dopaminergic medication
      that also elevates prolactin levels. It has been shown to safely increase the milk supply of
      lactating women. To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating
      woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels
      in the breast milk. However, the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient composition of
      breast milk has not been studied and current guidelines for fortification of human milk for
      premature infants do not distinguish between those women using or those not using
      domperidone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of domperidone (given to
      lactating mothers of very preterm infants) on the macronutrient composition of human milk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  i. Mother of an infant born less than 31 weeks gestation

          -  ii. Women mechanically expressing breast milk using a double collecting system

          -  iii. Experiencing lactation failure indicated by at least one of the following: A
             decreasing milk supply (by greater than 30 percent from peak volume based on maternal
             account) An inability to provide adequate breast milk to meet the daily nutritional
             intake of their infant

          -  iv. Women who have had little or no improvement in milk production following
             education/counseling with a lactation consultant/Neonatal Intensive Care nurse with
             respect to non-pharmacological techniques.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  i. Participants receiving any medication known to alter the effect of domperidone
             (e.g.cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine) or medication that interacts
             with domperidone (e.g. haloperidol, lithium).
