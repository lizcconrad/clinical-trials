  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Functional dyspepsia&quot; has been defined loosely as &quot;pain or discomfort centered in the upper
      abdomen.&quot; The symptoms can also include fullness, early satiety, bloating, belching, nausea,
      retching and vomiting. These symptoms may present with or without the co-existence of
      symptoms of heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Functional dyspepsia is a
      diagnosis of exclusion in which other disease states, such as ulcer, cancer, etc. are ruled
      out and the source of the pain is unknown.

      The standard of care for most patients presenting with dyspeptic symptoms has been with
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI), regardless of whether or not the patient's symptoms include
      acid-related conditions, e.g., heartburn, GERD, etc. Although PPI treatment has yielded some
      success in these patients, there is a significant population of patients whose dyspeptic
      symptoms are not adequately treated with PPI's alone.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of dexloxiglumide in the treatment of the
      symptoms of functional dyspepsia in patients whose dyspeptic symptoms are not being treated
      adequately with PPI's.
