      The purpose of this research is to identify cases from patients who have been referred for
      consultation to the Infectious Disease Section at the VAMC, Houston, and to compare them with
      other cases of CAP in order to determine whether there are features that might enable non-CAP
      cases to be distinguished from CAP.

    <textblock>
      Guidelines to treat community acquired pneumonia (CAP) have been developed and widely
      promulgated by important professional societies in the past 10 years. The impetus to do so
      came from the observation that practicing physicians were using a wide array of approaches to
      this common infection, many of which were substandard.

      The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) have
      been leaders in this field, publishing recommendations separately between 1993 and 2003. The
      PI served on the IDSA committee and coauthored the publication in 2000 and the update in
      2003. In 2004, a decision was made by the two professional societies to merge the committees
      and make a single joint set of recommendations; the PI is a member of that joint committee
      and a new document is being prepared for publication.

      The PI has observed a tendency to apply these guidelines to cases that might masquerade as
      CAP but are actually attributable to other conditions, such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and
      histoplasmosis. Further, the recommendations do not adequately cover pneumonia due to
      Staphylococcus aureus.

      The purpose of the research is to identify cases from the consult records of the Infectious
      Disease Section at the VAMC, Houston, and to compare them with other cases of CAP in order to
      determine whether there are features that might enable non-CAP cases to be distinguished from
      CAP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects who were seen in calendar year 2004 because they were thought to have CAP,
             but who, upon further evaluation, plainly did not, and consultation was sought.

          -  case control is diagnosis of CAP with verification by all or nearly all of the
             following features: presence of cough, increased sputum, fever, leukocytosis and a
             distinct new pulmonary infiltrate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  among the case controls, if the diagnosis of CAP was made despite the absence of the
             cardinal features of CAP, as cited above, the investigators will not include the case.
