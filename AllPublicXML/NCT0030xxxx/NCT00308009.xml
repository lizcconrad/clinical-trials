  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether it is best to do the TVT( procedure for urinary stress incontinence in
      women) at the time of prolapse surgery or at a later date. Women with both conditions were
      randomized to both procedures together or the TVT 3 months after the prolapse surgery. Any or
      no leakage when couching was the main end-point, evaluated 1 year after the last surgery

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women were evaluated by the POP-Q (pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification) prior to surgery
      and 1 year after.

      Examination for urinary leakage was done prior to surgery and 1 year after. Group 2 was also
      examined after prolapse surgery to see if TVT was still needed.
