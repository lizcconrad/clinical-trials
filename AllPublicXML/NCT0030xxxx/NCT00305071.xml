      In conventional treatment for non-complicated bacterial cystitis, 3-day oral antibiotics
      could achieve good cure rate. However, severe lower urinary tract symptoms were most
      bothersome and only could be partially relieved by NSAID, detrusor muscle relaxants, minor
      tranquilizer or pyridium. Some medication associated side effects were complained while
      receiving adjuvant medication treatment, including gastro-intestinal discomfort, dry mouth,
      blurred vision, lethargy, or allergic reactions. The irritative bladder symptoms from bladder
      inflammation had great impact on the quality of life and well tolerable adjuvant therapy
      would have clinical benefit to reduce the discomfort from the bladder.

      In the past years, cranberry juice or its extract has been proven to have protective effect
      on urothelium to prevent further bacterial ascending infection. The commercial cranberry
      extract tablets have good tolerability and showed good effect on symptoms reliving and
      infection protection on several clinical observation. In acute bladder infection, we could
      expect the bioactive components in cranberry could reduce the virulence of pathogens and
      assist to eradicate pathogens and to stable the urothelium. In literature review, only little
      works focusing on the symptoms relief in acute cystitis patients. To clarify the clinical
      benefit on lower urinary symptoms relieving, we attempt to conduct a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a compound cranberry extract tablet as an
      adjunctive modality in treating acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy
      female patients.

      Introduction

      Acute bacterial cystitis is a common and bothersome disease with a rapid onset nature.
      Uncomplicated cystitis occurs in patients without anatomical or physiological anomaly in the
      lower urinary tract. Although the infection is not life threatening in immuno-competent
      patients, the associated lower urinary tract symptoms cause massive impact on the
      quality-of-life of the victims. The voiding symptoms, such as urinary frequency, urgency,
      dysuria and suprapubic pain, were associated with the inflammatory response to microbial
      invasion. In most clinical scenario, 3-day empirical oral antimicrobial treatment could
      eradicate the pathogen efficiently.1,2 However, the lower urinary tract symptoms were not
      eradicated effectively by antibiotics only. In daily clinical practice, several symptomatic
      relieving treatments were applied while acute infection presented, including pyridine and
      anticholinergic agents. However, several side effects were complained according to the
      medication.

      In lower urinary tract infection, the virulence of the pathogen was the major factor
      associated with colonization and invasion in the urinary tract mucosa. The adherence of the
      pathogen to the urothelium is the crucial step in the urinary tract infection.3 Several
      studies revealed good anti-adherence effect of the cranberry juice.4-7 In several clinical
      studies, cranberry juice has been proven to be an protective effect in bacterial cystitis8
      and the role of cranberry juice in preventing urinary tract infection was well
      established.9,10 Cranberry is a rich source of bioactive compounds, such as phenolic acid and
      several organic acids, which have been proven playing major anti-bacterial effect.11

      In literature reviewing, the clinical application of cranberry juice or extract tablet was
      focusing on the preventive role on chronic or repeated urinary tract infection. The effect to
      reduce bacteriuria and pyuria has been mentioned.12 However, the effect on lower urinary
      tract symptom relieving effect of the food supplement cranberry was not established. In this
      study, we try to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a commercial compound cranberry extract in
      treating acute uncomplicated cystitis as an adjunctive role. The compound tablet contained
      900mg per tablet, including 600% concentrated cranberry extract 150mg, vitamin C 70mg,
      Rhizoma extract (Acrobio TS®) 150mg, Flos extract (Acrobio GL®) 60mg, lactose and mannitol
      490mg. The compound has been on the market in Taiwan as a food supplement and was well
      tolerable. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      adjuvant effect of compound cranberry extract on the symptomatic relieving effect.

      Material and Methods

      Study Method:

      We prepare to conduct a paralleled-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a compound cranberry extract tablet as an adjunctive
      modality in treating acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy female
      patients. The treatment arm will receive standard 3-day oral antibiotics plus 7-day compound
      cranberry extract tablets (UmayC) and the control arm will receive standard 3-day oral
      antibiotics plus 7-day identical placebo.

      Study Processes:

        1. Participant recruitment During study period, we will recruit 60 volunteer female
           patients visiting the urological outpatient clinics in Min-Sheng General Hospital for
           uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis to join our trial. The age limitation was 20 to
           65 years old and the acute cystitis was diagnosed by the clinical symptoms, physical
           exams and pyuria (WBC&gt;5/HPF) on urinalysis.

           The exclusion criteria: recent (less than one month) urinary tract infection or
           partially treated acute cystitis; anatomical or function disease of the lower urinary
           tract; patients received radical pelvic surgery; associated bladder stone disease; upper
           urinary tract anomaly or urolithiasis; systemic infection with body temperature higher
           than 38°C; known allergic reaction to cranberry or vitamin C; pregnant or prepare to be
           pregnant, or diabetic patients.

        2. Objectives and outcome measurements We try to evaluate the symptom relieving effect of
           compound cranberry extract as an adjuvant therapeutic modality. The study hypothesis is
           the compound cranberry extract tablet as an adjuvant treatment for uncomplicated acute
           bacterial cystitis with 3-day empirical antibiotics will reduce the irritative bladder
           symptoms (urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and dysuria and suprapubic pain).

           We conducted a Frequency-Urgency-Pain (FUP) score to evaluate the irritative lower
           urinary tract symptoms. Another 10-point Likert scales from 0 (none) to 9 (severe)
           questionnaire will be used to evaluate every individual symptom. A modified diary method
           was used to evaluate the symptoms change during the whole evaluation period. 3 in-face
           questionnaire interviews will be preformed on day 1, 4, and 8 by the study assistants. A
           brief form questionnaire will be done by telephone on day 2 and 3. The primary outcome
           of this study is the proportion of symptoms relief (based on FUP and individual symptom
           scale evaluation) after 3-day and 7-day treatments. The secondary outcome variables were
           the pyuria eradication rate after 3- and 7-day therapy and the time to symptoms relief.
           Possible adverse effect was recorded and reported.

        3. Sample size and randomization In this study, we will recruit 60 participants to detect
           the difference between the intervention and control groups with a 0.05 one-sided
           significance level and a 80% power. These participants will be randomly assigned to each
           group according to a pre-set random permuted blocks procedure. Efficacy analysis will be
           conducted according to the intension-to-treat principle.

        4. Intervention Intervention group will receive 3-day oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
           (80/400mg) 2 tablets twice a day on day 1 to 3 plus oral compound cranberry extract
           tablets (UmayC, 900mg) 2 tablets three times a day on day 1 to 7. The control group will
           received same oral antibiotics plus identical placebo prescribed as the same protocol of
           intervention arm. For patients with known allergic reaction to sulfa drug, the empirical
           antibiotics will be replaced by cephalexin (250mg) 2 capsules four times a day.

      Study Processes:

      After participant enrollment with inform consent, detail medical history will be collected,
      including basic physiological data (body weight and height), major medical disease (diabetes,
      cerebral vascular disease, or neurological disorder), major operation history (neurological
      and pelvic surgery), recent medication records (including recent antibiotics treatment),
      child-baring history, sexual activity, fluid drinking history, and socio-economical and
      education status.

      A voiding symptoms questionnaire, including FUP score and 10-point Likert scales symptomatic
      questions, will be done by in-face interview by study assistants. Random urine bacterial
      culture will be collected before medical treatment. The participants will be requested to
      receive 2 telephone interviews on day 2 and 3 by the study assistants and to return for
      urinalysis and 2nd in-face questionnaire on day 4 after complete antibiotics treatment. The
      clinical follow up will be arranged on day 8 by the physicians and urinalysis will be done
      again.

      Adverse event reporting and patient safety All participants will receive close follow up
      protocol for adverse event reporting. Any discomfort associated with the medical treatment
      will be recorded on daily interview record and be reported. Interruption of the trial and
      intervention decoding will be performed immediately once an intolerable side effect happened.
