      The purpose of this research is to compare reactions and antibody responses following receipt
      of different doses of the experimental influenza vaccine or standard influenza vaccine.

      Influenza is a common respiratory infection caused by viruses. Epidemics of influenza occur
      each winter and are responsible for more than 20,000 deaths each year in the United States.
      Most of these deaths occur among elderly persons and among people of all ages who suffer from
      a chronic disease. Standard influenza vaccines may not be as effective at protecting cancer
      patients as the general population from getting influenza. This research study will test an
      experimental influenza vaccine consisting of the important flu virus protein that stimulates
      protection. It is produced by genetic techniques in cultured cells and allows higher doses of
      the protein to be used. Influenza vaccines made this way have been given to humans in the
      past and the vaccine was well tolerated. It is expected that higher doses of this vaccine can
      be given with minimal reactions, as well as whether such a vaccine stimulates higher levels
      of infection-fighting proteins (or antibodies) in the blood than standard doses of the
      licensed influenza vaccine. This study will evaluate the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      a recombiant influenza vaccine in non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma.

          -  Medically stable subjects may have underlying illnesses such as hypertension,
             diabetes, ischemic heart disease, or hypothyroidism, but their symptoms/signs are
             controlled with medical therapy.
