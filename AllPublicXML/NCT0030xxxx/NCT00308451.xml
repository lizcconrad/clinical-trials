  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed work is to assess the effects of a dietary supplement, containing
      chromium (600 mcg per day) provided by chromium picolinate and biotin (2 mg per day) on
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, this study will assess whether use of the
      supplement will lower the post-prandial rise in blood glucose experienced after ingestion of
      a 75g carbohydrate load, relative to placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients. The study will
      also assess the chronic effects of supplementation over a 4-week period (relative to placebo)
      on fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lipids and lipoproteins.

      The purpose of this work is to assess the effects of a dietary supplement, containing
      chromium (600 mcg per day) provided by chromium picolinate and biotin (2 mg per day) on
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes who are currently taking an oral antidiabetic agent (OAD)
      and failing therapy with OADs. Subjects entering the trial must have a HbA1c &gt;/= 7.0% and
      have an OGTT &gt;/= 200 mg/dL at 2 hours post consumption of a 75 g glucose beverage. The study
      is an acute 30 day intervention in conjunction with the subject's current OADs and standard
      of care in comparison to placebo.

      Specifically, this study will assess whether use of the supplement will lower the
      post-prandial rise in blood glucose experienced after ingestion of a 75g carbohydrate load,
      relative to placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients as measured by the area under the curve for
      glucose (AUCg). The study will also assess the acute effects of supplementation over a 4-week
      period (relative to placebo) on fasting plasma levels of glucose, fructosamine, insulin,
      lipids and lipoproteins.
