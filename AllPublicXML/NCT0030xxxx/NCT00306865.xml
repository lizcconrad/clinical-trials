    <textblock>
      This study will examine how chemical changes in the brain produce symptoms of hand dystonia.
      Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive
      movement or abnormal postures. In focal dystonia, just one part of the body, such as the
      hand, neck or face, is involved. The study will use positron emission tomography (PET) to
      find our which areas of the brain in patients with focal hand dystonia differ from healthy
      volunteers without focal hand dystonia.

      Healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia between 18 and 65 years of age may
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical and
      neurological examinations.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  PET scanning: The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut. The subject lies on a bed that
           can slide in and out of the scanner. A custom-molded plastic mask is placed on the face
           and head to support the head and prevent it from moving during scanning. Two radioactive
           substances - five doses (one per scan) of [15 O] water and one dose of [11C] flumazil
           are injected into the body through a vein. The dose of injected radioactive substance is
           very small, and they are not harmful to the body. The [15 O] water doses are injected
           during the first hour and scans are taken every 10 minutes. The [11C] flumazil is
           injected during the second hour. The radioactive substances are detected by the PET
           scanner and provide information on the functioning of the brain chemistry.

        -  MRI scanning: MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body
           tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow
           cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur
           during the scanning process. Scanning time for this study will be less than one hour.
           Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.

      Objective

      The purpose of this study is to determine if in focal hand dystonia there is disinhibition
      involving key structures of the motor control system (basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum and
      motor cortex) caused by dysfunction of the GABA-ergic neurons. The major inhibitory
      neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), which acts
      mainly through GABA A receptors, the majority of which possess the benzodiazepine binding
      site. Pathological processes involving GABA-ergic neurons will cause alterations in the
      density of GABA receptors, which can be visualized and measured with positron emission
      tomography (PET) using as a radioactive ligand [(11)C] Flumazenil.

      Study Population

      This research will be conducted using 20 patients with primary focal hand dystonia and 20
      healthy volunteers that are matched by age and gender.

      Design

      By using positron emission tomography (PET) using radioactive ligand [(11)C] Flumazenil, we
      will detect alterations in the density of GABA receptors in patients with primary focal hand
      dystonia in comparison with control subjects.

      Outcome Measures

      We will be able to determine the density of GABA A receptors of the various Regions of
      Interest as measured by PET analysis among these groups of subjects. This study should
      provide new information concerning localization and degree of dysfunction of GABA-ergic
      neurons in movement related structures in dystonia, which might open new possibilities for
      pharmacological treatment of this disorder.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A. Patients will have clinically documented focal hand dystonia. This criterion will be
        established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Human Motor Control Section
        Outpatient Clinic.

        B. Patients (male or female) will range in age from 18 through 65 years of age. Female
        patients of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test, which must be negative and
        an interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant patients do not participate in the
        study. Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week prior to the study.

        C. Twenty healthy volunteers will be included; volunteers will be screened in the NINDS
        Human Motor Control Section Outpatient Clinic, and will have neurological and physical
        examinations. Healthy volunteers with chronic illnesses, taking any medication that affects
        the CNS will be excluded. Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week prior
        to the study. Female volunteers of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test, which
        must be negative and an interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant subjects do
        not participate in the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The following subjects will be excluded:

        A. Subjects younger than 18 and older than 65 years old.

        B. Subjects with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or AVMs.

        C. Patients with progressive neurological disorders other than dystonia.

        D. Subjects with past or present neuropsychiatric illness, head trauma with loss of
        consciousness, epilepsy, cerebro-vascular disease, migraine, past and present history of
        alcohol abuse, medical conditions that may alter cerebral structure.

        E. Subjects with cancer, except for skin cancer.

        F. Subjects incapable of giving an informed consent

        G. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding

        H. Patients who are currently on benzodiazepines, which binds GABA-A receptors and will
        compete directly with flumazenil for binding; baclofen which binds GABA-B receptors;
        flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist; or triazolam, a partial allosteric
        modulator of GABA A receptors. Patients need to be off of these medications for four weeks
        prior to entering the study.

        I. Patients who have had recent (within 3 months) BoTox injections. Botulinum Toxin A
        (BoTox) injections are commonly used to relieve pain and muscle spasms of dystonic
        patients.

        Participation of Children

        Patients or healthy subjects younger than 18 years of age will be excluded from the study
        due to the following reasons:

        (i) Absorbed radiation dose per mCi is relatively higher, and pharmacodynamic effects are
        greater in children compared to adults. (ii) No direct benefit for individual patients is
        anticipated from this study. The study is of &quot;greater than minimal risk&quot;, and thus does not
        meet the criterion of 45 CFR 46 Subpart D (the &quot;prospect of direct benefit&quot;) governing
        participation of children in research.
