    <textblock>
      There is a scarcity of clinical trials assessing the effects of medications in children with
      bipolar disorder. This study aims to assess the efficacy of Aripiprazole associated with
      Methylphenidate (MPH)for the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder
      comorbid with ADHD who improve in maniac symptoms while receiving aripiprazole but did not
      have an adequate response in ADHD symptoms. The study design is a 4-week randomized, double
      blind, cross-over group trial. Patients were randomized to aripiprazole + MPH or aripiprazole
      + placebo. The main hypothesis is: Aripiprazole + MPH will significantly reduce ADHD scores
      compared to aripiprazole + placebo.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic disorder that severely affects the normal development of
      children and adolescents. The disorder is associated with high rates of suicide and high-risk
      behaviors like sexual promiscuity and drug abuse. Bipolar disorder in children is also
      associated with high rates of comorbidity, especially with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). There is a scarcity of clinical trials assessing the effects of medications
      in children with BD. Moreover, the frequent presence of comorbid ADHD might determine lower
      response to treatment. Aripiprazole is a novel anti-psychotic drug. Its mechanism of action
      seems to be related to a stabilization of dopaminergic transmission, acting as a partial
      agonist especially in dopaminergic D2 receptors. It also has effects in 5-HT1a serotonergic
      receptors. Thus, it might have a promising effect in children and adolescents with comorbid
      BD and ADHD. A retrospective chart review, recently published, suggests the efficacy of this
      drug in children with BD. This study aims to assess the efficacy of Aripiprazole associated
      with Methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of 20 children and adolescents (age range: 8 to
      17 years-old) with Bipolar Disorder comorbid with ADHD who improve in maniac symptoms while
      receiving aripiprazole but did not have an adequate response in ADHD symptoms. The study
      design is a 4-week randomized, double blind, cross-over group trial. Patients were randomized
      to aripiprazole + MPH or aripiprazole + placebo. The hypotheses are: 1) Aripiprazole + MPH
      will significantly reduce ADHD scores compared to aripiprazole + placebo. 2) Patients
      receiving aripiprazole + MPH will not deteriorate in maniac symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 8 -17

          -  BD type I or II comorbid with ADHD

          -  Reduction of maniac symptoms (30% reduction in the YMRS scores and/or CGI scores â‰¤
             2)while using aripiprazole during a previous study (NCT00116259)without improvement of
             ADHD symptoms (reduction in ADHD symptoms &lt; 30% in the SNAP-IV). Those receiving
             placebo in the previous protocol will receive a 6- week open label treatment with
             aripiprazole. The same threshold for reducing maniac symptoms and absence of response
             in ADHD symptoms will be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IQ &lt; 70

          -  Pregnancy or absence of a contraceptive method in fertile girls

          -  Diagnoses: pervasive development disorder, schizophrenia, drug abuse or dependency

          -  Risk of suicide or homicide

          -  Clinical condition that might interfere in the study

          -  Known sensibility to aripiprazole
