      DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract): Injury control experts suggest that
      consistent SBU is the most effective means for motorists to reduce1he risk of death or
      serious injury in a crash. Sadly, the SBU prevalence among Massachusetts' residents is among
      the lowest in the nation. In accord with Healthy People 2010, Objective 15-19, and the CDC's
      Injury Research Agenda, the investigator will test the utility of a brief intervention to
      increase SBU among ED patients with self-reported SBU that IS less than &quot;always&quot;. A secondary
      aim is to determine if the brief intervention is more effective among persons being treated
      for a motor vehicle crash (MVC)-related injury during a &quot;teachable moment&quot; than other
      non-injured ED patients receiving the same intervention. The research staff will
      systematically sample ED patients, screening for SBU among eligible participants during a
      3-month period. Upon obtaining verbal consent, researchers will ask participants to complete
      a self-administered screening form on health and safety issues, including SBU. Patients that
      screen positive, (i.e., give an answer of less than &quot;always use&quot; safety belts) on a SBU
      screening question will be asked to participate in an intervention to promote health and
      safety among ED patients. Participants will be reimbursed for their time, and asked to do the
      following: to give written informed consent via IRB-approved forms and a HIPAA release form;
      complete an intake form, and agree to a follow-up phone interview at 3 and 6 months
      post-enrollment. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: an Intervention
      Group that will receive a brief intervention designed to increase SBU, and a Control Group
      that will receive only standard care. Research staff will contact participants for a
      follow-up phone survey at 3 and 6 months to test the hypothesis that individuals randomized
      to the Intervention Group will have a higher self-reported SBU than those in the Control
      Group that received only standard care. Likewise, for the secondary (exploratory) analysis,
      the hypothesis is that among those treated for MVC-related trauma--and randomized to the
      intervention group--will have a higher self-reported SBU than others with non MVC-related
      trauma due to a greater receptivity to brief intervention techniques during the ED visit
      (i.e. the &quot;teachable moment&quot;).
