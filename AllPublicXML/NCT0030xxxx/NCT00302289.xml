  <brief_summary>

      The primary aim was to measure the effect of green tea extract, tyrosine and caffeine on
      energy expenditure, appetite ratings and spontaneous energy intake together with recording of
      side effects in healthy normal weight subjects.

      Background: Long-term weight maintenance of a weight loss is often unsuccessful. Often a
      weight regain is observed in most studies that could indicate that most subjects are not able
      to change their eating habits. There is a need for simple and safe methods to prevent weight
      gain and re-gain i.e. by increasing thermogenesis and decrease spontaneous energy intake
      (EI). Studies have shown that nutritional and food-related non-nutritional factors influence
      the adjustment of EI and EE as the compounds can enhance the diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT)
      and suppress appetite.

      Method: The present study was designed as a 4-way crossover, randomised, placebo controlled,
      dou-ble-blind study. Each treatment was separated by &gt;3 d washout period. All treatments were
      administered as tablets containing either 500 mg green tea extract (whereof 125 mg
      cate-chins), 400 mg tyrosine, 50 mg anhydrous caffeine, or placebo.

      on each test day body weight and composition was assessed. All participants underwent a 4.5-h
      assessment of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry in a ventilated hood. Energy intake
      recorded of an ad libitum pasta salad brunch served after the last hood measurement

      Subjects: Twelve healthy lean (20&lt;BMI&lt;25) weight stable non-smoking subjects between 18-40
      years of age were tested 4 times each with a wash-out period of at least 3 days.
