  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nevirapine (NVP)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been commonly used in many developing
      countries due to its affordability and feasibility. Nonetheless, the potential drug-drug
      interaction between NVP and fluconazole (FLU) is a major concern. NVP can induce cytochrome
      P450 isoenzymes in the liver while FLU inhibit the activity of this enzyme. The recent report
      has demonstrated that fluconazole significantly raises plasma NVP levels and may cause
      serious hepatotoxicity. Conversely, NVP does not significantly influence the plasma level of
      FLU. However, there have not been enough data or any recommendations to adjust NVP dosage for
      the concurrent use of both drugs in order to avoid the adverse events. A previous study has
      demonstrated that genetic disposition may play a role in NVP hypersensitivity reactions.
      There is little data of safety and tolerability for concurrent use of NVP and FLU in Asian
      populations. We therefore conducted this prospective observational study to compare the
      trough plasma NVP levels and frequencies of adverse events among antiretroviral HIV-infected
      patients who did not receive FLU and received FLU in different dosages for cryptococcosis
      prophylaxis or treatment; and subsequently received NVP-based ART regimens.
