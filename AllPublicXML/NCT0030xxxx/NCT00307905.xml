  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that Traumeel S is more effective than placebo in reducing 48-hour mean
      cumulative morphine consumption in patients scheduled for surgical correction of fracture of
      neck of hip.

      224 patients, meeting all inclusion and none of exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the
      trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either intraoperative injection and post
      operative oral Traumeel S Tablets or placebo injection (normal saline) and indistinguishable
      oral placebo tablets. Baseline measurements of relevant outcome measures will taken
      preoperatively. Immediately after surgery, patients will receive an initial dose of morphine
      of 0.1mg/kg body weight. Patients will take the oral study medication for 21 days. Every four
      hours after surgery, patients will be asked to grade their pain on an NRS. Subsequent doses
      of morphine will be calculated based upon the patient's weight and current NRS, according to
      a preplanned scheme. Patients will be permitted to request additional morphine, beyond their
      calculated dose.
