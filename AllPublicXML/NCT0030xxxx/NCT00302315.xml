      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of physiotherapy applications in early
      postcesarean problems which make difficulties in functional activities, and includes a
      physiotherapy intervention group and a control group. Physical characteristics, obstetrical
      and surgical histories, and systemic problems, back pain, low back pain, headache,
      urinary/fecal incontinence problems and bowel habit of the subjects both in pregnancy and
      postpartum periods are recorded. First ambulation time after cesarean, presence of syncope,
      related vital signs, onset time of bowel peristalsis and defecation are also recorded.
      Intensities of incisional pain and difficulty in performing functional activities are
      evaluated by daily 0-10 cm visual analogue scales (VASs). Also, intensities of back pain, low
      back pain, headache, bloated feeling of the abdomen, and fatigue are also evaluated by daily
      VASs. Physiotherapy program included breathing exercises, active joint movements of the lower
      limbs, posture exercises, connective tissue manipulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation.
