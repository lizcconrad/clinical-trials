  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The identification of patients with potential early organ failure is the key in preventing
      admission or readmission to a critical care facility. The primary goal of the Outreach
      Project is to ensure that all patients with threatening organ failure receive appropriate and
      timely treatment in a suitable area; avoid admission to the intensive care unit (ICU); and
      share ICU skills by a partnership in education. The objectives of the study are to determine
      whether the introduction of an intensive care unit based medical emergency team, responding
      to hospital-wide preset criteria of physiologic instability, will decrease the number of
      predefined serious adverse events (SAEs) and to investigate the effects on quality of life
      and costs in a general surgery population.

      Study Hypothesis: The Outreach intervention will decrease the number of predefined serious
      adverse events; increase quality of life; and decrease costs.

      DESIGN: A multi centre longitudinal intervention trial with a before and after design in a
      university hospital.

      The INTERVENTION consists of three parts:

        1. The introduction of a hospital-wide intensive care unit based medical emergency team to
           evaluate and treat patients deemed at risk for developing an adverse outcome.

        2. Education and training of ward staff in the recognition and basic management of patients
           developing a critical illness.

        3. The development of an intensive care (nurse and physician staffed) consultancy service
           for general wards.

      STUDY POPULATION: The population for this study consists of patients undergoing major general
      surgery with an admission stay of more than 48 hours. It includes patients undergoing central
      or peripheral vascular surgery, major oncological surgery, lung surgery, major abdominal
      surgery and trauma surgery.

      MEASUREMENTS AND OUTCOMES: In total, 1500 patients will be included. (750 Patients in the
      control period and 750 patients in the intervention period). Measurements include the
      incidence of Serious Adverse Events, HRQoL (Quality of life EQ-5D), costs of care and ICU
      logistics.

      TIME-SCHEDULE: Data collection starts January 1, 2006 and stops no later than three months
      after the inclusion of 1500 patients or April 1, 2008. The final report of the study will be
      in December 2008.
