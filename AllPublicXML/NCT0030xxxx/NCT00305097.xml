  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Habitual consumption of coffee may have substantial beneficial effects on glucose metabolism
      according to recent findings of epidemiological studies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.
      However, data from longer-term human intervention studies with appropriate outcome measures
      are lacking. We will study the effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption on
      body fatness, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance that may underlie the observed
      associations with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in a randomized controlled trial. We
      hypothesize that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee will improve insulin sensitivity
      and glucose tolerance. Before starting a larger, long-term intervention study, we will
      conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility of such a trial. The pilot study will be an
      8-week parallel trial in 45 overweight individuals, who will be randomized to drinking 5 cups
      per day of 1) caffeinated coffee (n=15), 2) decaffeinated coffee (n=15), or 3) water (n=15).
      Body fatness (weight, waist circumference, bioelectrical impedance), insulin sensitivity
      (HOMA model), and glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test) will be the primary
      outcomes. We will assess the adherence of participants to their assigned treatment by
      measuring serum caffeine concentrations, documentation of coffee use in diaries by the
      participants, and counting unused coffee packets. We will also obtain feedback from
      participants on how to improve compliance in a future trial. If successful, this study will
      form the basis for a definitive trial of coffee consumption, body fatness, and glucose
      tolerance. Given the extensive use of coffee and the rapidly increasing health burden of type
      2 diabetes, such a trial would have important public health implications.
