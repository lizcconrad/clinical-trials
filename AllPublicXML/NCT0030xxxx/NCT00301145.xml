      RATIONALE: Varenicline tartrate may help people quit smoking by decreasing the symptoms of
      nicotine withdrawal. It is not yet known whether varenicline tartrate is more effective in
      helping people stop smoking when given together with a telephone-based counseling program,
      and Internet-based counseling program, or both programs.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well giving varenicline tartrate
      together with a telephone-based counseling program and/or an Internet-based counseling
      program works in helping adults stop smoking.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effectiveness of varenicline with telephone counseling vs Internet-based
           counseling vs telephone counseling and Internet-based smoking cessation interventions in
           adult smokers.

        -  Determine individual or group differences in patients undergoing these interventions.

        -  Determine heterogeneity in responsiveness in regard to the Classification and Regression
           Tree Analysis in patients undergoing these interventions.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of these interventions in regard to recruitment,
           implementation, barriers to treatment, exposure to intervention, satisfaction with
           treatment, treatment contamination, and program maintenance.

        -  Determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo a proactive telephone-based (PTB) smoking cessation program.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo a web-based (WB) smoking cessation program.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo an integrated PTB/WB smoking cessation program. Beginning 1
           week before the target quit date, all patients receive oral varenicline once daily for 3
           days and then twice daily for up to 12 weeks. They also receive a mailed packet
           containing a welcome letter, description of the intervention services offered, a privacy
           notice, a Free &amp; Clear Quit Kit (comprehensive education/self-help materials including
           health smoking substitutions), a phone call to orient the patient to the intervention to
           which they are randomized, and access to a toll-free support line. All patients undergo
           a pre-treatment assessment (pre-quit) and 3 post-quit assessments at 21 days, 12 weeks,
           and 6 months after their original scheduled quit date to determine medication adherence,
           treatment utilization, point-prevalent smoking outcomes, and continuous nonsmoking.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,200 patients will be accrued for this study.
