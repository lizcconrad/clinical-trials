      To evaluate clinical effectiveness of medication treatment for ADHD. It is hypothesized that
      the effectiveness is lower than efficacy outcomes measured in clinical trials

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, long-term, observational study of routine clinical care. The study
      measurements will be integrated into the clinical assessment and follow-up procedures of the
      outpatient services under the Provincial ADHD Program. The study is designed for systematic
      follow-up of children and adolescents, diagnosed with ADHD irrespective of comorbidity or
      whether they elect to receive medication treatment. Evaluations occur every 6 months for 24
      months. The population to be examined is children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD,
      aged 6 to 18 inclusive (at baseline), referred to the Provincial ADHD Program for clinical
      assessment. No studies have been conducted that have evaluated the outcome of core ADHD
      symptoms in a clinic setting. Metaanalysis of clinical trials of medication treatment for
      ADHD have suggested an effect size of approximately 0.8. Because of the heterogeneity of the
      clinic sample, a much lower effect size can be anticipated. Two hundred patients will be
      enrolled in this study with primary measure of effectiveness being change in ADHD symptoms.
