      A single-center random parallel study to compare the efficacy and safety of Mycophenolate
      mofetil versus intravenous Cyclophosphamide pulses in the treatment of crescentic IgA
      nephropathy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy is an immune-complex glomerulopathy that can result in capillary necrosis or
      extracapillary proliferation (crescents). Several studies have documented a higher incidence
      of hypertension and nephritic-range proteinuria in patients with the crescentic form of IgA
      nephropathy, suggesting that patients with this variant of the disease may have a worse
      prognosis. Some studies have shown that treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide had
      efficacy on reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function by healing vasculitic lesions,
      therefore preventing the progression of glomerular sclerosis. Recent studies have also shown
      that mycophenolate mofetil is effective in the treatment of lupus nephritis with vasculitic
      lesion and small vasculitis with renal involvement. We will conduct a single-center
      prospective open-labeled clinical trial of 40 patients with crescentic IgA nephropathy and
      treat them randomly with pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide or oral mycophenolate mofetil.
      After 12 months of treatment, we will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and relapse
      of mycophenolate mofetil compared with cyclophosphamide in the treatment of crescentic IgA
      nephropathy.
