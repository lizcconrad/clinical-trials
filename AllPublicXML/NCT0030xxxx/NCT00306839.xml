    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate mid and long term postoperative pain and further
      disabling complications in open inguinal hernia repair by Lichtenstein technique after mesh
      fixation with fibrin sealant (FS), compared to mesh fixation with sutures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in the FS group will be operated by Lichtenstein technique, with mesh fixation by
      fibrin sealant. Subjects in control group will be operated with conventional Lichtenstein
      technique (mesh fixation by sutures).

      Hernia repair will be performed according to standardized Lichtenstein technique, a technique
      for tension free hernioplasty. A Polypropylene, heavyweight, macroporous mesh will be used
      (8x15 cm) tailored to individual patients requirement. The different ways of mesh fixation
      will be randomly assigned within 24 hours before the operation. In the FS group, the two
      tails of the mesh will be fixed together in overlapping their edges and by surrounding the
      cord. The edges will be joined up to by 1 suture. No other sutures will be used. First the
      mesh will be put correctly in place. A small spot (0.5ml) of FS will be applied on the pubis
      under the mesh without spray then the remaining part (3,5ml) over the mesh on the entire
      surface in a thin uniform layer by spray. 2 ml Tissucol-Tisseel (4 ml of fibrin sealant) will
      be used per mesh. In the control group, the mesh will be fixed in a conventional manner.
      Nerve resection (if occurred) will be recorded; it should be avoided.
