  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether financial incentives for
      guideline-recommended treatment of hypertension are effective. We hypothesized that patients
      with hypertension cared for by physicians or practice groups receiving financial incentives
      were more likely to be prescribed guideline-recommended anti-hypertensive medications and
      achieve Joint National Commission (JNC) 7 guideline-recommended blood pressure goals compared
      to patients who were treated by providers that did not receive financial incentives.

      Background:

      Despite compelling evidence of the benefits of treatment, hypertension is controlled in less
      than one-quarter of US citizens. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial, we tested the
      effect of explicit physician-level and practice-level financial incentives to promote the
      provision of guideline-recommended anti-hypertensive medications and improved control of
      hypertension in the VA primary care setting.

      Objectives:

      The goals were to: (1) determine the effect of physician-level financial incentives on
      processes and outcomes of care for outpatients with hypertension; (2) assess the impact of
      practice-level incentives; (3) ascertain whether there were additive or synergistic effects
      of physician- and practice-level incentives; (4) evaluate the persistence of the effect of
      incentives after the intervention ceases; and (5) identify any negative impacts of incentives
      on patients, providers, or health care organizations.

      Methods:

      We randomized 12 VA hospital-based outpatient clinics to the following arms: (1)
      physician-level incentives; (2) practice-level incentives; (3) physician- and practice-level
      incentives; and (4) no incentives. We enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 practice
      group members (e.g., nurses). All participants received audit and feedback performance
      reports. Study measures included the use of guideline-recommended anti-hypertensive
      medications and the proportion of patients who achieved national (JNC 7)
      guideline-recommended blood pressure goals or received an appropriate response to
      uncontrolled blood pressure. The intervention period consisted of five four-month performance
      periods. For each period, trained reviewers collected medications, blood pressure readings,
      comorbid conditions, medication allergies, and lifestyle recommendations from the VA
      electronic health record system for a sample of eligible patients from the physicians'
      panels. After the final performance report, we implemented a 12-month washout period. To
      determine the impact of incentives for the intervention period, we performed a
      repeated-measures longitudinal analysis using the hospital as a random effect. We evaluated
      the rate of change in the proportion of patients who met the study measures over time for the
      intervention group physicians. We assessed post-washout performance using a linear analysis
      with clustering by hospital. To evaluate unintended consequences of the incentives, we
      examined the incidence of hypotension in the physicians' panels.

      Status:

      The study is completed. The primary findings were published in September 2013 in the Journal
      of the American Medical Association (JAMA). We are currently preparing manuscripts describing
      findings from the study's secondary aims.

    <description>This measure reports the unadjusted proportion of physicians' patients meeting the study outcome for the first performance period (baseline). Data are based on review of the electronic health records for 40 patients with hypertension randomly selected from each physician's panel. We used the guidelines from the &quot;Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7)&quot; to determine if the physicians' patients achieved the recommended blood pressures thresholds and if providers appropriately responded to uncontrolled blood pressure. Appropriate responses included increasing the dosage of a guideline-recommended antihypertensive medication or recommending a lifestyle modification to patient with Stage 1 hypertension.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Study participants had to be full-time primary care physicians employed by the Veterans
        Health Administration (VA) at one of the 12 VA hospitals that participated in the study.

        We defined a full-time primary care physician as spending at least 0.60 full-time
        equivalent (FTE) delivering patient care services in the primary care setting or having a
        panel size of at least 500 patients at the time of study arm randomization. The primary
        care settings included internal medicine, primary care medical clinics, and women's health
        care clinics. The trial did not actively recruit patients into the study. This study
        retrospectively reviewed a random sample of health records of eligible patients that had
        clinical encounters with the physician participants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The study did not include VA physicians that were trainees.

      <recruitment_details>We enrolled non-physician primary care personnel at the hospitals randomized to the two study arms that tested the effect of practice-level incentives. Only data from physicians were used to assess both physician-level and practice-level performances.

        <description>This measure reports the unadjusted proportion of physicians' patients meeting the study outcome for the first performance period (baseline). Data are based on review of the electronic health records for 40 patients with hypertension randomly selected from each physician's panel. We used the guidelines from the &quot;Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7)&quot; to determine if the physicians' patients achieved the recommended blood pressures thresholds and if providers appropriately responded to uncontrolled blood pressure. Appropriate responses included increasing the dosage of a guideline-recommended antihypertensive medication or recommending a lifestyle modification to patient with Stage 1 hypertension.</description>

Data are based on review of the electronic health records for 40 patients with hypertension randomly selected from each physician's panel.

Appropriate responses included increasing the dosage of a guideline-recommended antihypertensive medication or recommending a lifestyle modification to patient with Stage 1 hypertension.</description>

          <title>Proportion of Physicians' Patients Prescribed Guideline-recommended Antihypertensive Medications</title>
          <description>This measure reports the unadjusted proportion of physicians' patients meeting the study outcome for the fifth and final intervention performance period. Data are based on review of the electronic health records for 40 patients with hypertension randomly selected from each physician's panel. We used the &quot;Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7)&quot; to evaluate use of guideline-recommended antihypertensive medications. Assessing use of guideline-recommended medications included collecting information about the patient's compelling conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus) as well as allergies and refusals to antihypertensive medications.</description>
