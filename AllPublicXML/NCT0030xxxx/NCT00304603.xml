  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the mode of action of topiramate in the treatment of
      obese and diabetic patients by testing association between genetic variations within
      candidate genes or chromosomes (thread like structure found in cell which carries genes) and
      the clinical outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This pharmacogenomics (effect of genetic variation on drug response) study will analyze
      genetic variations in the DNA extracted from blood samples collected from patients who were
      randomized (assigned to treatments by chance) in 1 of 3 previous topiramate studies on
      obesity and diabetes. The study consist of a screening telephone contact, a single visit to
      the study site for a blood sample collection (10 ml of whole blood) for genetic analyses, and
      a 24-hour post-sample adverse event reporting period. The total duration of the study is 24
      hours from the time of the blood sample collection. Safety will be monitored up to 24 hours
      after blood sample collection. No study medication was administered.

    <description>The candidate gene analyses and the genome (entire hereditary information of organism) screen for percent change in weight will be performed in 3 phases. 1) Find polymorphisms (existence of distinctly different types in group of 1 species) within candidate genes and chromosomal regions that impact response to topiramate. 2) Confirm Phase 1 findings. 3) Verify that polymorphisms and chromosomal regions that were associated with percent change in weight in 2 phases are associated with percent change in weight in response to topiramate rather than change in diet and exercise.</description>
