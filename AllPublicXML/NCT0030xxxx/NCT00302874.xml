  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve glycemic control of inpatients admitted to the internal medicine wards, the
      researchers generated a protocol based on intensive insulin treatment for use in all
      inpatients with hyperglycemia.

      The researchers hypothesize that intensive insulin treatment will improve the glycemic
      control and the outcome of hospitalized patients.

      Study Information:

        -  All patients with a history of diabetes admitted to the internal medicine ward were
           enrolled in the study.

        -  At baseline, demographic and clinical information were obtained, including information
           necessary to determine the severity of the illness. Venous capillary blood glucose
           levels were checked 4 times a day by glucometer.

        -  During the pre-intervention period, patients were treated according to the common
           practice in the hospital without any intervention. The study team collected the baseline
           data on the glycemic control and treatment of patients admitted with hyperglycemia.

        -  During the intervention period, the study team visited the ward daily and guided the
           medical staff as to the use of the treatment protocol.

        -  During the post-intervention period, the study team collected the data without active
           intervention in the implementation of the protocol.

        -  Data was collected on the mode of treatment and glycemic control of all hyperglycemic
           patients throughout the study. The incidence of hypoglycemia, complications (myocardial
           infarction, stroke, infections), mortality, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU),
           length of hospitalization, and disposition at discharge were noted.
