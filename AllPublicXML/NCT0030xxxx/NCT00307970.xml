  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare lung delivery of fluticasone propionate delivered by HFA-pMDI, using a
      conventional polycarbonate of anti-static chamber/mask in a randomized crossover design in
      1-6 year old children.

      Hypothesis: Anti-static chamber/mask would increase the amount of inhaled corticosteroid
      delivered to young children who passively inhale and cannot breath hold.

      Objective -- to determine whether an anti-static chamber increases the one-hour steady-state
      fluticasone plasma concentration, which is an indirect measure of airway delivery and direct
      measure of systemic exposure. Twelve children 1-6 yrs with well-controlled persistent asthma
      were treated with HFA-FP pMDI, 2 actuations of 110 Âµg twice daily. The drug was administered
      by conventional polycarbonate or anti-static valved-holding chambers with masks in an
      unblinded, randomized, crossover manner each for at least three days. A blood sample was
      collected one hour after the last dose when adherence documented by electronic monitor was
      100%. FP plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
      assay. Results evaluated using regression analysis.
