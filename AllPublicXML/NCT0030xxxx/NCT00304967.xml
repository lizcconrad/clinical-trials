  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a method called dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the lens of the
      eye in young normal subjects. The DLS device uses a very dim laser light to study the lens of
      the eye. It detects proteins in the lens, identifying early changes that may make the device
      useful in future cataract studies. This study will use DLS to examine the characteristics of
      proteins in healthy young lenses that can be used for comparison with lenses in older people
      and people with cataracts.

      Normal volunteers aged 5 to 21 years may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the
      following procedures:

      Medical history

      Eye examination with dilation to include:

        -  Measurement of visual acuity

        -  Examination of pupils and eye movements

        -  Examination of the front of the eye (cornea, lens) with a slit lamp bio-microscope

        -  Examination of retina with an ophthalmoscope (instrument with a strong light and
           magnifying lens)

        -  Dynamic light scattering

    <textblock>
      The NASA-NEI Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) device detects early molecular lens changes
      before clinical means are able to detect any lens changes in animal and limited human
      studies. This ability will make it very useful in future clinical studies of cataract
      etiology as well as treatment. A recently concluded clinical cross sectional study of lenses
      (in vivo) using the DLS device showed good reproducibility and good correlation with clinical
      cataract grading. It also detected remarkable changes in the lens crystalline proteins with
      aging and with cataract formation. We therefore propose to study the characteristics of the
      crystalline proteins in pristine young normal lenses with DLS for comparison with aging and
      cataractous lens findings. We will examine 30 young normal subjects, perform undilated eye
      examinations, and obtain DLS measurements of their lenses. We will then use these DLS
      measurements for comparison with the previously obtained aging and cataract DLS measurements,
      to obtain normative data for future lens and cataract clinical studies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The study will enroll 30 normal control subjects, aged 5-21 years. Eligible participants
        must have normal clear lenses as determined by the eye examination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Individuals who cannot cooperate or keep still for the DLS measurements will be excluded.
