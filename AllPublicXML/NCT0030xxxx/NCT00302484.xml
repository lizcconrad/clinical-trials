  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a terminal chronic liver disease have a disordered bone metabolism resulting in
      a higher risk of falling ill with osteoporosis. Although liver transplantation restores liver
      function, immunosuppressive therapy (especially corticosteroids) after transplantation
      increases again the risk of osteoporosis and bone fragility. Zoledronate, a bisphosphonate,
      slows down the destruction of bone. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      bisphosphonates are effective in the prevention of osteoporosis following immunosuppressive
      therapy after liver transplantation.
