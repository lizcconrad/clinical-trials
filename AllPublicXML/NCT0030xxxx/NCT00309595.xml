  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating performance of the
      Cordis SMART™ Nitinol Stent System compared to balloon angioplasty. Patients will be
      randomized on a 1:1 basis. It is anticipated that a total of 120 patients will be entered
      into the study.

      Objective of the study is: Performance of the Cordis S.M.A.R.T.™ (CONTROL™) Nitinol Stent
      System for the treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) long de novo or restenotic
      lesions (≥ 70% stenosis or occlusions) in comparison with balloon angioplasty as determined
      by Binary Restenosis (≥50% restenosis based on a peak systolic velocity ratio ≥ 2.5) at one
      year as demonstrated by Duplex sonography.

      The study population will consist of 120 symptomatic peripheral vascular disease patients
      with SFA occlusions. The disease will consist of symptomatic, de novo or restenotic
      occlusions (5 - 22 cm) on diagnostic imaging. The occlusions must not extend beyond the
      proximal popliteal artery. For the purpose of this protocol, no lesion within 3 cm of the
      upper part of the patella may be treated. At least one calf vessel must be patent. Reference
      vessel diameter must be &gt;= 4.0 to &lt;= 6.0 mm.

      Trial participants who meet all entry criteria, will be randomized to the SMART™ Nitinol
      Stent or balloon angioplasty.

      Patients will be followed for 12 months after the procedure. Study examinations will be done
      at screening, procedure time, discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months after the study procedure.

      This study will be conducted as an investigator initiated multicenter study with 6 study
      centers in Switzerland. Principal investigators will be Prof. Amann, PD Dr. med T. Pfammatter
      (University Hospital Zürich) and Prof. I. Baumgartner, Prof. J. Triller (University Hospital
      Bern).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic leg ischemia by Rutherford Classification (category 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5);
             duration of intermittent claudication (category 1-3) should be at least 3 months;

          2. One de-novo or restenotic SFA with an occluded length &gt; 5 to &lt; 22 cm;

          3. Patent popliteal artery on the index side (without &gt; 50% stenotic (re) stenotic
             lesions) and at least single vessel infrapopliteal runoff (without &gt; 50% stenotic (re)
             stenotic lesions). However, balloon angioplasty to further improve the blood flow is
             allowed at the index procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Revascularization involving the same limb 30 days prior to the index procedure or a
             planned revascularization within 30 days after the index procedure;

          2. Patients having severe stenoses or total occlusions of the iliac artery on the same
             side must be excluded. However, intervention to restore adequate blood flow during the
             index procedure (prior to the treatment of the target lesion) is allowed;

          3. Requiring stent placement in the popliteal artery. For the purpose of this protocol
             all lesions are to be located at least three centimetres proximal to the superior edge
             of the patella.
