      To determine clinical outcomes and biomechanical gait performance of patients who receive the
      Zimmer Legacy® LPS Flex Knee system using a computer-assisted surgical technique. This study
      will provide evidence as to whether there are differences between the two surgical procedures
      with respect to complications such as infection and dislocations, rate and level of
      functional recovery, blood loss, operating time, degree of radiographic correction and
      quality and duration of post-operative pain and stiffness.

      The objective of this study is to determine the clinical outcomes and biomechanical gait
      performance of patients who receive the Zimmer Legacy® LPS Flex Knee system using a
      computer-assisted surgical technique. Pre and post-operative clinical and gait variables will
      be compared within the computer-assisted group. These same comparisons will also be made
      between the computer-assisted surgical group and a conventional surgical group who receive
      the same knee implant. This study will further provide evidence as to whether there are
      differences between the two surgical procedures with respect to complications such as
      infection and dislocations, rate and level of functional recovery, blood loss, operating
      time, degree of radiographic correction and quality and duration of post-operative pain and
      stiffness.
