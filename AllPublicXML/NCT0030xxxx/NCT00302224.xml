  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the safety, tolerability of a newly developed form of
      ketoconazole (DIO-902) for the treatment of elevated blood sugars in type 2 diabetes. This
      study also will also examine the effect of the drug on total and LDL cholesterol and blood
      pressure. Elevated cortisol may contribute to the development of Type II diabetes. The
      investigational drug DIO-902 may reduce the level of cortisol in blood and therefore provide
      better control of blood sugar levels in patients with Type II diabetes.

      DiObex is developing a modified form of ketoconazole (enantiomer) (DIO-902) as an
      investigational new drug for the treatment of the elevated blood sugar associated with type 2
      diabetes. Other benefits may include reduced total and LDL cholesterol, and reduced blood
      pressure. With chronic treatment, reduced visceral fat may also be seen. Ketoconazole
      (racemic) is an approved drug for the treatment of a variety of fungal infections. The
      approved racemic ketoconazole inhibits cortisol synthesis. In patients with Cushings Disease
      racemic ketoconazole reduces glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure. Elevated cortisol may
      be a contributing causal factor in the development of type 2 diabetes; clinical trials with
      racemic ketoconazole have been carried out in these patients. The results of these clinical
      trials support the concept of treating type 2 diabetes through a lowering of plasma cortisol
      and provide evidence of the safety and tolerability of racemic ketoconazole. Racemic
      ketoconazole has, however, been associated with liver toxicity which is generally mild in
      nature. However, in rare cases (1:10,000 to 15,000 patients) severe liver toxicity may occur,
      and in extremely rare cases this adverse event may be irreversible and life-threatening.
      Preclinical results suggest that DIO-902 may be both safer and more efficacious than the
      racemic mixture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, age 18 to 70

          2. Females are non-lactating and using adequate contraception, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator and negative serum pregnancy test if of child bearing potential
             (intact uterus and pre-menopausal)

          3. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) for at least 6 months. Type 2 diabetes may
             be untreated or may be treated with diet and exercise only and/or pharmacologic
             therapy as in Inclusion Criterion 4

          4. Pharmacologic treatment for type 2 DM may include the following and must be stable for
             &gt; 3 months Glucophage (Metformin) (&lt; maximum dose of 2550 mg) or Glucophage XR (&lt;
             maximum dose of 2000 mg)

          5. HbA1C level of 6.5 to 10.9%

          6. Fasting C-peptide level of greater than or equal to 0.8 nmol/L (2.4 ng/mL)
