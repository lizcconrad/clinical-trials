  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of age and device on delivery of HFA-Fluticasone Propionate (FP) in
      children of different ages. Hypothesis -- passive inhalation in younger children through a
      valved holding chamber/mask (VHC) will reduce the relative amount of FP delivered to airways.

      The objective was to determine the effect of age and device on delivery of fluticasone
      propionate delivered by HFA-pMDI in children of different ages. The one-hour steady-state
      fluticasone plasma concentration which is an indirect measure of airway delivery and direct
      measure of systemic exposure, was determined. Sixty children with well-controlled persistent
      asthma received two actuations of 110 mcg twice daily for at least 3 days. A blood sample was
      collected one hour after the last dose when 100% adherence was documented by electronic
      monitor. Five groups of 12 each were studied: 1) 12-18 yr by actuator alone; 2) 5-9 yr by
      actuator alone; 3) 5-9 yr by antistatic VHC/mouthpiece; 4) 5-9 yr by antistatic VHC/mask and
      5) 1-4 yr by antistatic VHC/mask. Fluticasone concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS assay.
      Fluticasone plasma concentration between groups was compared using one way ANOVA.
