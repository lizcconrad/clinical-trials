      This study will measure blood levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and nitric oxide
      (NO) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who are participating in a 3-month
      cardiac rehabilitation program at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, MD. EPCs are a kind of stem
      cell produced by the bone marrow that can develop into cells found in arteries and in the
      heart and, therefore, can repair diseased vessels. The study will examine whether the EPCs
      are affected by exercise and will look at how they may contribute to repair of cells lining
      the diseased arteries as a result of participation in the rehabilitation program.

      People with coronary artery disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened
      with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood tests. CAD
      patients also to a treadmill exercise test.

      Volunteers' participation ends at the screening visit. The blood drawn at screening is used
      to identify EPC specific genes to compare with the EPC genes from patients with CAD.

      CAD patients participate in Suburban Hospital's cardiac rehabilitation program. The exercise
      portion of the program includes 36 sessions of about 60 minutes each, spaced over
      approximately 3 months. Patients have a baseline blood test at screening and repeat blood
      tests at the end of each month of participation in the rehabilitation program. Some of the
      blood will be used for genetic tests to see how genes of the EPCs are changed by the
      patient's participation in the rehabilitation program.

    <textblock>
      Exercise training has long been recommended as a means of improving effort tolerance and
      reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). One
      mechanism of benefit may be through improved endothelial function with enhanced nitric oxide
      (NO) bioactivity. Such an effect may augment blood flow to exercising skeletal muscle and to
      the myocardium, and reduce vascular inflammation, platelet activation and adherence which
      could diminish the risk of thrombosis. In 46 patients with CAD, participating in the Suburban
      Hospital cardiac rehabilitation program (Protocol 03-H-0086), we detected increases in
      circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which may have the capacity to repair
      diseased or dysfunctional endothelium. In the last 23 participants (following amendment of
      the protocol) a subset showed increase in whole blood nitrite - a marker of intravascular NO
      - at completion of program. However, not all patients showed EPC mobilization or increased
      intravascular NO despite compliant program participation and improved effort tolerance. One
      possibility is that EPCs from patients who fail to derive vascular benefit as evidenced by
      increased intravascular NO may have different EPC gene expression profiles at baseline or in
      response to repetitive exercise, resulting in diminished protection of EPCs against oxidant
      stress with initiation of apoptosis, compared with EPC gene expression in patients who show
      evidence of EPC mobilization and endothelial repair. The purpose of our study is to 1)
      Prospectively demonstrate a relationship between EPC mobilization and increased whole blood
      nitrite as a marker of improved vascular NO bioactivity due to EPC mobilization, and 2)
      Determine EPC gene expression profiles, with a focus on activation or suppression of genes
      whose products regulate intravascular redox potential, apoptosis and growth factor and
      cytokine secretion. We hypothesize that activation or suppression of critical genes in EPCs
      at baseline or during exercise may determine EPC mobilization, endothelial differentiation
      and vascular repair potential as evidenced by increased intravascular NO.
