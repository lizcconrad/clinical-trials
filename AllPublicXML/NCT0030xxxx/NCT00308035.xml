  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have had a stroke often have difficulty walking and problems with their balance.
      The purpose of this project is to examine problems with foot postures in people who have
      weakness on one side of their body

      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Describe foot posture in individuals with hemiplegia following stroke using a
           quantitative navicular drop test.

        2. Determine differences in people with normal, hypotonic, and hypertonic foot posture with
           regard to ankle range of motion, ankle strength, gait, and balance.

      This is an observational design study to describe relationships between the variables.
      Measurements will include both descriptive and quantitative measures.

      Thirty subjects with stroke will participate in one session of testing which will include:
      clinical assessment of foot posture using a descriptive classification system, quantitative
      measurement of navicular drop during standing, measurements of ankle range of motion, ankle
      strength, gait (lower extremity biomechanics and forceplate analysis), and static and dynamic
      balance. A chi-square test will be used to determine goodness of fit between classification
      with the descriptive system and the quantitative measurement. Independent one-way ANOVAs will
      be used to determine the mean differences in the foot posture groups for each of the
      dependent variables.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects must have a diagnosis of a single stroke with resultant hemiplegia and be
             able to stand up from a seated position and walk 30 feet without assistance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they present with significant foot or ankle pathology,
             other medical problem that would affect gait or balance, or language / cognitive
             deficits that would impair ability to give informed consent.
