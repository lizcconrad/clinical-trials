           multiple) doses of XTL6865, a mixture (1:1) of two human monoclonal antibodies
           (HCV-AbXTL68 and HCV-AbXTL65), in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and virologic activity of
      escalating single and multiple doses of XTL6865, a mixture (1:1) of two human monoclonal
      antibodies (HCV-AbXTL68 and HCV-AbXTL65), in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus
      infection.

      An additional purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of XTL6865 in the
      presence and absence of viral infection.

      This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center design of
      ascending single doses in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In
      addition to Placebo, the following XTL6865 doses will be administered: 5 mg, 20 mg, 75 mg,
      250 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, and 2400 mg. No patient will be enrolled in more than one dose
      level. At each dose level, 3 patients will receive XTL6865 and 1 patient will receive the
      Placebo. After the single dose infusion, the patients will be followed for 6 weeks.

      If certain criteria are met and the safety review of the 1200 mg dose cohort data determines
      that XTL6865 was safely administered and tolerated at that dose level, the patients in the
      600 mg and 1200 mg dose levels are eligible for the multiple dosing phase. Infusions of 600
      mgs will be given to 4 eligible patients, one infusion per day, for 5 days. One patient will
      receive Placebo and 3 patients will receive XTL6865 600 mg. The patients will be followed for
      6 additional weeks.

      If certain criteria are not met, the 2400 mg dose cohort will be infused. After the safety
      review has determined that XTL6865 was safely administered and tolerated, the patients in the
      1200 mg and 2400 mg dose levels are eligible for the multiple dosing phase. Infusions of 1200
      mgs will be given to 4 eligible patients, one infusion per day, for 5 days. One patients will
      receive Placebo and 3 patients will receive XTL6865 1200 mg. The patients will be followed
      for 6 additional weeks.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. male or female patients between 18 and 65 years of age;

          2. female patients must be either postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or non-pregnant and
             non-lactating and have a negative serum pregnancy test result prior to enrollment into
             the study. Female patients of childbearing potential (including peri-menopausal women

             for 6 weeks following the XTL6865 dose;

          3. patient has been persistently HCV RNA-positive and remains HCV RNA-positive at
             screening (patient must have HCV RNA-concentrations which are at least 2 logs above
             the assay cut-off of 600 IU/mL) and HCV antibody (anti-HCV) positive;

          4. patient is negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis delta virus
             (HDV), and has no evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (assessed by
             Hepatitis B surface antigen or HBV DNA in blood within 3 months of Day 1 of the study)
             or other clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities (e.g. amino
             transferases) leading to the a diagnosis of current acute Hepatitis B disease;

          5. patient is in reasonably good health, as determined by the Investigator based on
             medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             clinical laboratory tests, except for findings related to their hepatitis C positive
             status.

          6. subject’s private physician has been informed of the subject’s planned participation
             in the study;

          7. capable of understanding and complying with the protocol, willing to reside in the
             study unit during the study period and to cooperate fully with the Investigator and
             site personnel, and must have signed the informed consent document prior to
             performance of any study-related procedures;

          8. infected with HCV genotype 1

          9. failed previous treatment for HCV infection with an approved regimen of IFN/RBV or
             pegylated IFN/RBV. Treatment failure includes both non-response (defined as a patient
             who did not experience a &gt; 2 log decrease in HCV RNA after 12 weeks of treatment or
             who failed to clear virus to below the limits of detection after 24 weeks of
             treatment) or relapse (defined as re-emergence of detectable concentrations of HCV RNA
             after response to treatment). Treatment must have been discontinued at least 3 months
             prior to Day 1 of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             severe psychiatric disorder (including major depression), organic brain disorder,
             mental retardation, or other clinical conditions or diseases which in the judgment of
             the Investigator would interfere with the study or confound the results;

          7. patient has present active malignancy (except for superficial cancers)

          8. past history of pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, or current therapy with

         10. patient with hypertension that is not, in the investigator's opinion, adequately
             controlled by medication (DBP &gt; 90 and SBP &gt; 140). In order to assess PK in the fasted
             state, patients should be able to delay administration of prescribed anti-hypertensive
             medicine for several hours without anticipating undue risk of medically significant
             increases in blood pressure. Patient should be on a stable anti-hypertensive regime
             for at least 30 days prior to screening with no changes in anti-hypertensive
             medications.

         11. patient is currently receiving antiviral therapy for HCV;

         12. patient has received IFN/RBV or pegylated IFN/RBV treatment within 3 months of study

             of study entry (Day 1);

         14. any patient who does not meet the conditions for prior and concomitant treatments
             described in Section 6.6 of this protocol;

         15. any patient considering or scheduled to undergo any surgical procedure during the
             study;

             from the study or b) prevent the patient from completing the study;

         19. has limited mental capacity or language skills to the extent simple instructions
             cannot be followed or information regarding adverse events cannot be provided.
