    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will determine the antitumor activity, based on the objective rate, of
      oral MKC-1, administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 4 weeks, in patients with
      advanced or metastatic breast carcinoma. The study will also evaluate the safety and response
      duration in patients, time to tumor progression, and overall survival in patients following
      MKC-1 therapy.
