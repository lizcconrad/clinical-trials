      A prospective, randomized crossover cohort. Study subjects consisted of patients newly
      diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) confirmed with sleep study. All are CPAP naïve.

      Randomization:

      Arm 1: auto CPAP sleep study then auto CPAP for 2 months Arm 2: fixed CPAP titration then
      fixed CPAP for 2 months

      Then switch over to the other arm

      Trial end after 4 months, compliance and other parameters would be compared between two arms
      as described in the endpoint session.
