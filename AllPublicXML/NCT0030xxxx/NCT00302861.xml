  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, single arm Phase 1/2 study evaluating the feasibility,
      safety, and tolerability of a series of 16 immunizations of Id-KLH with GM-CSF in patients
      with previously untreated B-CLL. The length of the controlled portion of the study is two
      years. The study will be conducted at investigative sites in the United States.
