      The long-term safety and efficacy of galantamine (12 mg bid) will be documented during a one
      year open-label treatment in subjects with Alzheimer's Disease who completed the GAL-INT-8
      trial (up to 400 eligible patients). Safety will be tracked by means of adverse event
      reports, laboratory parameters and physical exam. Long-term efficacy will be evaluated by
      means of a Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale(ADAS) and activities of daily living scale
      Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale(DAD)

      This is a twelve-month, open-label trial in which treatment with 12 mg bid galantamine will
      be evaluated. Only subjects who took trial medication during the 24-month trial period of
      GAL-INT-8 will be eligible. Safety will be assessed by periodic physical examination, vital
      signs, ECG and laboratory tests and reports of adverse events. The ADAS-cognitive scale and
      DAD scale will be used to document long-term efficacy.

      Patients will be seen at 6 monthly intervals but the ADAS-cognitive scale and DAD scale will
      only be performed at end of trial. The treatment will consist of tablets which will contain
      12 mg of galantamine. Duration of treatment equals 12 months. Patients will receive 1 tablet
      twice daily preferably to be taken with food (breakfast in the morning at approximately 8 AM
      and a snack or meal in the evening at approximately 6PM).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have taken trial medication during the 24-month trial period of
             GAL-INT-8 and should be enrolled within 1 month after completion

          -  Patients and their primary caregiver give informed consent for the participation in
             the trial

          -  Patients must have remained in good health, as determined by medical history, complete
             physical examination and laboratory tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If a patient developed, during the trial GAL-INT-8, symptoms of other neurological or
             psychiatric diseases that might contribute to dementia, the subject cannot be
             enrolled. This includes subjects developing neurodegenerative disorders such as
             Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease or Huntington's chorea, or Creutzfeldt-Jacob
             disease, and subjects with cognitive impairment resulting from stroke, acute cerebral
             trauma, hypoxic cerebral damage, infection or primary or metastatic cerebral neoplasia

          -  Subjects with the following co-existing medical conditions: a) Any history of epilepsy
             or convulsions except for febrile convulsions during childhood b) Peptic ulcer: if the
             ulcer is considered to be still &quot;active&quot;, i.e., if treatment for this condition
             started &lt;3 months ago or if treatment is not successful (symptoms still present), the
             subject is not eligible. c) Clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
             metabolic or endocrine disturbances

          -  Patients with current, clinically significant cardiovascular disease that would be
             expected to limit the subject's ability to complete a 12-month trial. The following
             would usually be considered clinically significant cardiovascular disease: a) Unstable
             angina

          -  angina or coronary artery disease that required a change in medication (anti-angina or
             digitalis) within the last 3 months b) Decompensated congestive heart failure i.e.
             when symptoms occur in a subject on stable medication during rest or light exercise
             (NYHA III and IV). Note: if the only signs of decompensation are pretibial or
             malleolar oedema and the exercise tolerance is still reasonable (absence of dyspnoea)
             the subject should not be excluded c) Cardiac disease potentially resulting in
             syncope, near syncope or other alterations of mental status

          -  In addition, the following conditions should lead to exclusion: atrial fibrillation
             without prophylactic treatment to prevent thromboembolic stroke, bradycardia &lt;50
             beats/min., atrioventricular block &gt; first degree. d) Severe mitral or aortic valvular
             disease e) Hypotension or treatment for hypotension f) Systolic blood pressure greater
             than 170 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg

          -  Patients using any agent for the treatment of dementia (approved, experimental,
             including over the counter agents), including, but not limited to nootropic agents,
             cholinomimetic agents, choline, oestrogens taken without medical need, chronic NSAIDs
             (30 consecutive days), vitamin E more than 30 IU daily, and deprenyl

          -  Conditions that could interfere with the absorption of the compound or with the
             evaluation of the disease
