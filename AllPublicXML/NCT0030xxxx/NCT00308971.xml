  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress and acute phase inflammation are now recognized to be highly prevalent in
      both the chronic kidney disease (CKD; pre-dialysis) and end stage renal disease (ESRD; on
      hemodialysis) populations, and several lines of evidence point to their contribution in the
      development of atherosclerosis. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as C-reactive
      protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 are robust predictors of cardiovascular events and death in
      these two populations. The uremic state is characterized by retention of oxidized solutes
      including reactive aldehyde groups and oxidized thiol groups. It has recently been
      demonstrated that initiation of maintenance hemodialysis does not improve biomarkers of
      oxidative stress or inflammation, suggesting that dialysis alone is inadequate to control the
      atherosclerotic uremic metabolic state. In this study we hypothesize that administration of
      antioxidant therapy will decrease biomarkers of acute phase inflammation and oxidative stress
      in patients with Stage III and IV CKD.
