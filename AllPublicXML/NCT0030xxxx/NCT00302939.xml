      This study looks at the causes of anemia in adults of all ages who are referred by their
      primary care physician.

      This study is being done to determine if the range of causes of anemia changes with advancing
      age. The goal of this study is to apply research methods to see if causes of anemia can be
      determined in patients where a clear cause is not found with routine clinical testing
      available to all patients in physician offices.

      Participants in this study will be evaluated at the NIA-ASTRA unit at Harbor Hospital in
      Baltimore. Testing will consist of both diagnostic and research blood and urine testing along
      with history and physical exam. An optional bone marrow aspirate or aspirate and biopsy may
      be performed if the patient permits and it is indicated for either research or clinical
      diagnostic purposes. All study information supporting a specific diagnosis will be provided
      to the patient and, at their request, to their primary care physician if specific treatment
      is indicated.
