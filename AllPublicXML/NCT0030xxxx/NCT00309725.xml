      The objective of this trial was to investigate the effect of galantamine (an
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) on heart rate and PR interval (the time it takes for the
      heart's electrical impulse to get from the atria to the ventricles) during the administration
      of rapidly increasing doses and at the end of a 2-week treatment period with 32 mg per day in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease.

      This 6-week, double-blind, parallel group trial was also designed to detect cardiac
      arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, such as heart block. Holter monitors and
      Electrocardiograms were used to measure cardiac parameters at baseline, at the end of Week 2
      (first dose of 12 mg twice daily), at the end of Week 4 (first dose of 16 mg twice daily) and
      at Week 6 (after 2 weeks of maximum tolerated dose allowed in the trial, i.e., 24 or 32
      mg/day). Other safety data collected were adverse event reports, urine and blood analysis,
      vital signs and physical examination. Drug levels in the blood were also tested. Patients
      were randomized to receive either placebo or galantamine up to 32 mg daily (i.e., 4 mg twice
      daily in Week 1, 8 mg twice daily in Week 2, 12 mg twice daily in Weeks 3 and 4, and 16 mg
      twice daily in Weeks 5 and 6). Dosage could be reduced from 16 mg twice daily to 12 mg twice
      daily during the first 3 days of the 32 mg/day dosing period, if a patient could not tolerate
      the higher dose. This titration is more rapid and the dose is higher than currently
      recommended for treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in accordance with NINCDS-ADRDA
             (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's
             Disease and Related Disorders Association) classification for probable Alzheimer's
             disease

          -  Mild/moderate dementia as evidenced by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score
             ranging from 11 to 24, inclusive, at baseline

          -  History of cognitive decline that has been gradual in onset and progressive over a
             period of at least 6 months

          -  Evidence of sustained memory deterioration in an otherwise alert patient, plus
             additional impairment in at least one of these five areas: orientation, judgment and
             problem-solving, functioning in community affairs, functioning in home and hobbies,
             and functioning in personal care

          -  Patients who live with or have regular daily visits from one or more responsible
             caregiver who are capable of assisting with the patient's medication, able to
             accompany the patient for assessments, and willing to provide information about the
             patient.On days that the patient was sent home with a Holter monitor, the caregiver
             was required to stay with the patient in the same household for the 24 hour duration
             of the cardiac assessment to ensure that the monitor lead placement remained intact.
             The caregiver was to be available the following day for the return of the Holter
             monitoring device

          -  Patient or patient's relative, guardian or legal representative have signed the
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, or Huntington's chorea, Down's
             syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Cushing's syndrome, or uncontrolled diabetes

          -  Cognitive impairment resulting from trauma, injury, or hypoxia

          -  Infection

          -  Mental retardation or dementia or clinically active cerebrovascular disease

          -  Current, clinically significant cardiovascular disease that would limit the patient's
             ability to complete a six-week trial.
