    <measure>Mean Percent Days of Total Shedding (Clinical and Subclinical) as Determined by Type-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Assay for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days in each treatment period (Up to 148 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's study day were classified as either 'shedding' (positive HSV-2 result), 'no shedding' (negative HSV-2 result), or 'unknown' (swabbing not done or assay result not available) confirmed by PCR. If either the daily genital swab or a lesion swab are positive, the day was classified as 'shedding'. Study shedding day was classified as either 'clinical' (investigator-confirmed presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical' (no genital lesions) by the investigator during recurrence visits. Percent of days with HSV-2 shedding was defined for each participant as the percent of days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected by a positive PCR result, i.e., the number of days with HSV-2 PCR shedding divided by total number of days with PCR data, multiplied by 100. Sum of the percent clinical and nonclinical shedding days was reported as total shedding. Mean percent of days with HSV-2 shedding was reported for each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Percent Days Subclinical Shedding (no Genital Lesions Present)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days in each treatment period (Up to 148 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of days with subclinical HSV-2 shedding was defined as the percent of all days with PCR data for which subclinical HSV-2 shedding was detected (shedding in the absence of a genital lesion). Mean percent of days with subclinical HSV-2 shedding was reported for each treatment group. Each participant's study day was classified as either 'shedding' (positive HSV-2 result), 'no shedding' (negative HSV-2 result), or 'unknown' (swabbing not done or assay result not available) confirmed by PCR. If either the daily genital swab or a lesion swab was positive, the day was classified as 'shedding'. Study shedding day was classified as either 'clinical' (investigator-confirmed presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical' (no genital lesions) by the investigator during recurrence visits.</description>

Each participant's study day was classified as either 'shedding' (positive HSV-2 result), 'no shedding' (negative HSV-2 result), or 'unknown' (swabbing not done or assay result not available) confirmed by PCR.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With no Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days in each treatment period (Up to 148 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with no shedding was defined as the number of participants with no HSV-2 shedding detected by PCR divided by the total number of participants with PCR data in the Treatment Period. Each participant's study day was classified as either 'shedding' (positive HSV-2 result), 'no shedding' (negative HSV-2 result), or 'unknown' (swabbing not done or assay result not available) confirmed by PCR. If either the daily genital swab or a lesion swab was positive, the day was classified as 'shedding'. Study shedding day was classified as either 'clinical' (investigator-confirmed presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical' (no genital lesions) by the investigator during recurrence visits.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Genital Herpes Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days in each treatment period (Up to 148 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with at least one genital herpes recurrence was defined as the number of participants with at least one investigator-confirmed genital herpes recurrence divided by the total number of participants with at least one clinic visit in the treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to First Genital Herpes Recurrence (Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 68</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first genital herpes recurrence was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates of investigator-confirmed genital herpes recurrences censoring the data from participants who prematurely discontinue the study at the time of discontinuation.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 148 days</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE include adverse events that result in death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. No SAEs were reported in this study.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Days of Total Shedding (Clinical and Subclinical) as Determined by Type-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Assay for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2)</title>
        <description>Each participant’s study day were classified as either ‘shedding’ (positive HSV-2 result), ‘no shedding’ (negative HSV-2 result), or ‘unknown’ (swabbing not done or assay result not available) confirmed by PCR. If either the daily genital swab or a lesion swab are positive, the day was classified as ‘shedding’. Study shedding day was classified as either ‘clinical’ (investigator-confirmed presence of genital lesions) or ‘subclinical’ (no genital lesions) by the investigator during recurrence visits. Percent of days with HSV-2 shedding was defined for each participant as the percent of days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected by a positive PCR result, i.e., the number of days with HSV-2 PCR shedding divided by total number of days with PCR data, multiplied by 100. Sum of the percent clinical and nonclinical shedding days was reported as total shedding. Mean percent of days with HSV-2 shedding was reported for each treatment group.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Days Subclinical Shedding (no Genital Lesions Present)</title>
        <description>The percent of days with subclinical HSV-2 shedding was defined as the percent of all days with PCR data for which subclinical HSV-2 shedding was detected (shedding in the absence of a genital lesion). Mean percent of days with subclinical HSV-2 shedding was reported for each treatment group. Each participant’s study day was classified as either ‘shedding’ (positive HSV-2 result), ‘no shedding’ (negative HSV-2 result), or ‘unknown’ (swabbing not done or assay result not available) confirmed by PCR. If either the daily genital swab or a lesion swab was positive, the day was classified as ‘shedding’. Study shedding day was classified as either ‘clinical’ (investigator-confirmed presence of genital lesions) or ‘subclinical’ (no genital lesions) by the investigator during recurrence visits.</description>
