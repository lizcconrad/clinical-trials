      Approximately 112 HIV-negative women, aged 18 to 50, will be enrolled in this multicenter
      study at four sites. Volunteers will be randomized to dapivirine (TMC120) vaginal gel or
      matching placebo gel. The volunteers will receive investigational product for a total of 42
      days. Volunteers will be monitored on days 7, 28 and 42 for safety, tolerability and
      compliance.
