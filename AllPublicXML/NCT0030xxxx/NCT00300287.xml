  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is not being conducted in the United States. Key long-term clinical studies have
      shown that people with type 2 diabetes should try to achieve overall blood glucose levels as
      close to normal as possible. The purpose of this study is to gather data on the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to placebo in lowering
      overall blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously
      treated with drug therapy to lower their blood sugar and whose blood glucose levels are close
      to normal.
