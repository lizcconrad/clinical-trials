    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, dose-escalating study to delineate the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TKI258. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be
      performed on all subjects. The eligible subject population consists of subjects who have been
      diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma that is refractory to standard therapy
      or for which no curative standard therapy exists.

          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             study-drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, make the patient inappropriate for this
             study
