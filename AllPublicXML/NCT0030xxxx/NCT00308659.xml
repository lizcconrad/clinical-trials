      Main hypothesis: microbiological diagnossis off severe community acquired pneumonia can be
      performed by non invasive or semi invasive microbiological tools, semi invasive tools
      including protected distal bronchial samplings by the mean of Fiber optic bronchoscopy (FOB).
      A microbiological diagnosis could improve antibiotic therapy efficacy and improve patient's
      outcome.

      These Two strategies have never been prospectivally evauated.

        -  Aim of the study: To evaluate 2 diagnostic strategies: non invasive or semi invasive
           including protected distal bronchial samplings by the mean of Fiber optic bronchoscopy
           (FOB)for the care of patients admitted in intensive care for severe community acquired
           pneumonia and receiving an empirical antibiotic therapy as recommanded by 2001 American
           thoracic guidelines

      Type of study randomized multicentric controlled open study

      Number of patients: 200 patients (100 patients in each group)admitted in ICU for SCAP

        -  Number of center : 5

        -  Clinical strategies under evaluation :

        -  Group A: semi-invasive strategy: FOB within 24 hours after ICU admission

        -  Group B: non-invasive strategy: no FOB within 24 hours after ICU admission

        -  Evaluation criteria:

      Main criteria: Changes in initial empirical antibiotic treatment according to microbiological
      results obtained in each group.

        -  ICU outcome and outcome at day 28

        -  Duration of antibiotic therapy and nimber of days without antibiotics at day 28 after
