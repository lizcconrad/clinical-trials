      Aim: To investigate the therapeutic potential of IL-1Ra in type 2 diabetes.

      Rationale: Since the major defect leading to a decrease in b-cell mass in type 2 diabetes is
      increased apoptosis, therapeutic approaches designed to arrest apoptosis could be a
      significant new development in its management. This approach might actually reverse the
      disease to a degree rather than just palliate glycemia. Based on current thinking, treatment
      with IL-1Ra appears as a promising approach. The prospected effect is blocking of the
      IL-1b-mediated glucotoxicity and thereby to prevent the decline in b-cell mass, together with
      a rapid restoration of b-cell function. FDA approval for IL-1Ra in the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis occurred based on a favourable tolerability profile.

      Methodology: This will be a two-centre (University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland and Steno
      Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Denmark) study. 72 patients will be randomised according to a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which half of the patients are treated with
      IL-1Ra, the other half with saline. The treatment period will last 13 weeks. This time-period
      should be sufficient for reversal of functional glucotoxicity and feasible in terms of
      patient compliance. Whether 13 weeks of treatment will be sufficient to make significant
      changes in b-cell mass in unpredictable. However, blocking b-cell apoptosis, while new islet
      formation and b-cell replication are normal, may initiate enlargement of b-cell mass, which
      may progress beyond the treatment period. Patient evaluation will be performed at start and
      after 4, 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. Following 13 weeks, patients with a fasting plasma glucose
      levels &gt; 8 mM or with a glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) &gt; 8% will be treated with
      insulin. Insulin treatment will not be initiated earlier to avoid interference with possible
      effects of insulin on primary outcome in the period where the largest effect of IL-1Ra are
      expected. To assess effects of IL-1Ra on insulin sensitivity, a subset of 40 patients (20
      IL-1Ra- and 20 placebo-treated) will undergo an euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp as well as
      a muscle and fat biopsy at start and after the end of treatment (13 weeks). The Ethics
      Committee of both centres have already approved the procedure.
