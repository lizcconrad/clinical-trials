  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the usefulness of Microvolt T Wave Alternans (MTWA)
      testing of patients that have had a heart attack and have decreased pumping ability of the
      lower chamber of their heart. MTWA testing is a non-invasive test used to detect the
      likelihood of developing abnormally fast rhythms in the lower chambers of the heart. The
      objective of the study is to prove that if a patient has a positive MTWA test, they will be
      more likely to develop abnormally fast and dangerous rhythms in the lower chambers of the
      heart. The results of the study will help doctors to determine which patients would benefit
      the most from having an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) implanted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of heart attacks

          -  LVEF &gt;0.30 and &lt;= 0.40 as measured by a radionuclide study, angiography or

             Investigational Plan or limit study participation

          -  Patients unable to complete MTWA testing requirements due to current atrial
             fibrillation or flutter

          -  Patients unable to exercise and for which alternative modalities (pacing or
             pharmacological stress) used for MTWA testing are not available

          -  Patients who have experienced an MI within 1 month prior to enrollment
