  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to see if Abraxane, which is a new form of paclitaxel, is safe
      as a replacement form of paclitaxel in dose-dense chemotherapy. This trial will also
      determine if using Abraxane will allow patients to receive treatment every two weeks without
      requiring injects of G-CSF, a white blood cell stimulating growth factor.

      -  Patients will receive regular chemotherapy every 2 weeks for up to 8 cycles
           (approximately 16 weeks total)of treatment. During the first four cycles patients will
           be treated with Adriamycin and Cytoxan, and for the second four cycles they will be
           treated with Abraxane.

        -  Patients will be taught to give themselves injections with either short or long acting
           G-CSF as prescribed by their doctor for the first four cycles of chemotherapy. During
           the last four cycles (while the patient is taking Abraxane) they will not receive G-CSF
           unless they have low blood counts.

        -  If the patient has HER-2 positive breast cancer, they will also receive 52 weeks of
           Herceptin as part of standard cancer care and will begin to receive Herceptin at the
           same time they begin Abraxane (after 4 cycles of adriamycin and cytoxan treatment).

        -  This study involves a series of Quality of Life Questionnaires that will be completed
           prior to beginning study treatment, then again at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 1
           year after starting study treatment.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at the time periods specified.
           Cycle 1-4 Day 1: Physical exam, vital signs, and blood tests. Cycle 5 Day 1: Physical
           exam, vital signs, blood tests, RVG (measurement of heart function) and questionnaire.
           Cycle 6 &amp; 7 Day 1: Physical exam, vital signs, and blood tests. Cycle 8 Day 1: physical
           exam, vital signs, blood tests, questionnaire. Follow-up (6 months and 1 year after
           cycle 1 day 1): questionnaire.
