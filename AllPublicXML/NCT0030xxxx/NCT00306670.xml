  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of response when administering rituximab to
      suppress or eliminate the anti-body in a patient's blood that inhibits the effectiveness of
      their factor replacement product compared to treatment using cyclophosphamide. This is a
      Phase 2/3 study to find out what effects (good and bad) and response rituximab has on a
      patient and their anti-Factor VIII antibodies. Also, to compare the effect (good and bad) of
      the rituximab with cyclophosphamide on a patient and their anti-Factor VIII antibodies to see
      which is better. This research is being done because we do not know which treatment regimen
      (rituximab or cyclophosphamide) is more effective in eliminating or suppressing the
      anti-Factor VIII antibody in patients with acquired Hemophilia A.

      This is a prospective Phase II randomized multi-institutional controlled pilot trial
      comparing the regimen of single agent rituximab with 6 weeks cytotoxic therapy with oral
      cyclophosphamide to eradicate or suppress autoimmune anti-factor VIII antibodies in
      individuals with acquired hemophilia A. Patients will be randomized to receive either of
      these two regimens when their autoimmune anti-factor VIII antibodies prove to be refractory
      to initial upfront immunosuppressive treatment with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (or
      equivalent corticosteroid doses) for 3 weeks. Patients will be randomized to the treatment
      cohorts according to the biostatistical methods.
