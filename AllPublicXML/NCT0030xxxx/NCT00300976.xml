      (Intervention study) The objective of the study is to confirm the superiority of the
      intensive therapy to the conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or
      exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus (DM) by a randomized
      controlled study in patients with type 2 DM.

      (Follow-up study) The objective of the follow-up study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy
      of intensive versus conventional therapy in the effect on mortality and the prevention of the
      incidence or exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus through a
      post-intervention follow-up research conducted after the multi-center, open-label, randomized
      parallel-group study comparing the efficacy of intensive versus conventional therapy in type
      2 diabetic patients.

      intensive therapy to the conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or
      exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus by a randomized controlled
      study in patients with type 2 DM. The primary outcome measure is occurrence of myocardial
      infarction, coronary bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke,
      carotid endarterectomy, percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty, carotid artery
      stenting, or death.

      post-intervention follow-up research conducted after the multi-center, open-label, randomized
      parallel-group study comparing the efficacy of intensive versus conventional therapy in type
      2 diabetic patients. The primary endpoint is identical to that in the intervention study. In
      addition, overall survivalall-cause mortality will be evaluated as a key secondary endpoint.

        despite treatment with any of the three regimens given below. Diet and exercise therapy
        alone, Diet and exercise therapy plus 1 oral anti-diabetic drug, Diet and exercise therapy

        (i.e., ARB, ACEI, and long-acting CCB), except where they were receiving these agents for
        other purposes than blood pressure lowering 11. Those with more serious retinopathy than
        proliferative retinopathy 12. Renal failure (serum Cr: 2.0 mg/dL in men; 1.5 mg/dL in
        women) 13. Those with a history of cardiac failure or those with cardiac failure 14. Those
        who were pregnant or potentially pregnant 15. Those who met any of the following criteria

        16. Those judged by the physician in charge to be ineligible for study entry

        (Follow-up study)

        Inclusion criteria:

        Of the subjects in the randomized controlled study comparing intensive therapy and
        conventional therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (J-DOIT3), those who provide written
        informed consent to participate in the follow-up study will be enrolled regardless of
        completion or discontinuation from the randomized controlled study (If the subject is
        unable to provide informed consent for any reason, consent from his/her legal
        representative is allowed).
