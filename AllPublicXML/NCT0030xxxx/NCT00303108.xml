    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of intolerable toxicity, whichever came first, assessed up to 54 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date.
Progression is defined as appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of &quot;non-target&quot; lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the Treating Physician should prevail, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel.</description>

    <measure>1-year Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>OS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has metastatic breast cancer with documented HER2- or HER2+ (IHC3+ or FISH+) disease

          -  Has measurable MBC, with at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST criteria (see Section
             10). Irradiated lesions cannot be used to assess response but can be used to assess
             progression.

          -  Has had no prior treatment with Doxil or carboplatin; may have had adjuvant Herceptin
             if treatment was completed more than 1 year prior to study

          -  Has had no adjuvant chemotherapy within 1 year prior to study, but may have received
             prior anthracyclines as adjuvant chemotherapy

          -  For taxane-pretreated patients (adjuvant or metastatic), has had no more than 1 prior
             chemotherapy regimen for MBC

          -  For taxane-naïve patients, has had no prior chemotherapy for MBC

          -  Has had cumulative doses of &lt; 300 mg/m2 prior doxorubicin or &lt; 450 mg/m2 prior
             epirubicin

          -  Has normal cardiac function as evidenced by a LVEF within institutional normal limits
             by multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan. An echocardiogram (ECHO) may be used if
             MUGA is not available, but the same test must be used throughout the study to evaluate
             LVEF.

          -  Has an ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-2 (see Appendix I)

          -  Is a male or female greater than or equal to 18 years of age

             control (eg, abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptives, barrier device with
             spermicide or surgical sterilization) to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study
             and for a period of 3 months thereafter.

             York Heart Association (NYHA; see Appendix IV) Class II or greater heart failure,
             uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, clinically
             significant pericardial disease, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemic or
             active conduction system abnormalities

          -  Has a history of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to a conventional formulation
             of doxorubicin HCL or the components of Doxil

             days

          -  Has evidence of brain metastases requiring steroids and/or radiation or any documented
             leptomeningeal disease

          -  Has a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness, including
             serious infection or history of uncontrolled seizures, CNS disorders deemed by the
             Treating Physician to be clinically significant, precluding informed consent

          -  Has a history of other malignancy within the last 5 years (except cured basal cell
             carcinoma of skin and carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix), which could affect the

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date.
Progression is defined as appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the Treating Physician should prevail, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel.</description>
