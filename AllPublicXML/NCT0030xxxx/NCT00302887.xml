      The aim of this study was to evaluate the short term and one year follow-up results of
      connective tissue manipulation and combined ultrasound therapy (ultrasound and high voltage
      pulsed galvanic stimulation) in terms of pain, complaint of non-restorative sleep and impact
      on the functional activities in patients with fibromyalgia.

      This is an observational prospective cohort study, investigating short and long term results
      of physiotherapy applications in 20 female patients with fibromyalgia. Physical
      characteristics of the subjects were recorded. Intensity of pain, complaint of
      non-restorative sleep, and impact of fibromyalgia on functional activities were evaluated by
      visual analogue scales. All evaluations were performed before and after 20 sessions of
      treatment, which included connective tissue manipulation of the back daily, for a total of 20
      sessions and combined ultrasound therapy of the upper back region every other session. One
      year follow-up evaluations could be performed on 14 subjects.
