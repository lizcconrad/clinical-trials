      The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND)Study is a multi-center
      consortium. The charge of the consortium is to acquire sets of families with
      well-characterized diabetic nephropathy, establish a secure master FIND database, and perform
      a genome scan to identify chromosomal regions linked with diabetic nephropathy.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is undoubtedly a multifactorial disease, and a large proportion of
      patients affected with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy and
      progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD). When poor prognostic factors such as hypertension
      and chronic hyperglycemia are aggressively treated, the rate of progression of diabetic
      nephropathy can be slowed. However, no interventions have been shown to reliably halt the
      progression of diabetic nephropathy. Numerous studies have suggested that genetic
      predisposition to diabetic nephropathy exists, but genes for nephropathy have not yet been
      isolated. It is anticipated that a comprehensive analysis of a large number of uniformly
      phenotyped ESRD families will be necessary to isolate genes for ESRD. Such a database of
      families may not be available at any single institution. The FIND study has established a
      centralized Genetic Analysis and Data Coordinating Center (GADCC) that, together with eight
      participating investigation centers (PICs), three minority recruitment centers, and the
      National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), will use the emerging
      high-throughput genetic technologies to enable identification of diabetic nephropathy
      susceptibility or protection genes. The charge of the consortium is to acquire sets of
      families with well-characterized diabetic nephropathy, establish a secure master FIND
      database, and perform a genome scan to identify chromosomal regions linked with diabetic
      nephropathy. The FIND study population includes participants from European American (EA),
      Native American (NA), African American (AA) and Mexican American (AA) populations.

      Two analytic approaches are utilized in FIND. The Family Study approach involves the
      enrollment of probands, affected or discordant sibling and their affected family members.
      Analytic methods include affected sibling pair (ASP), discordant sibling pair (DSP) affected
      relative pair (ARP), and discordant relative pair (DRP) linkage analyses for the Family
      Study. The Mapping by Admixture and Linkage Disequilibrium (MALD) approach involves the
      enrollment of probands and a population based control for both the AA and MA studies. In
      addition, a spousal control (diad) and when available, a child 18 years or older, will be
      recruited (triad)for the AA MALD study only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the Family protocol, proband must meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes and have
        nephropathy that meets one of the following:

          -  diabetic nephropathy diagnosed from a kidney biopsy and a history of overt
             proteinuria.

          -  ESRD considered due to diabetic nephropathy because

          -  diabetes is present for ≥ 5 years prior to the initiation of renal replacement therapy
             and diabetic retinopathy has been diagnosed at any time; or

          -  diabetes is present ≥ 5 years prior to the initiation of replacement therapy and
             either a 24 hour urine collection contains ≥ 3 gm protein/24 hours or a random urine
             protein (mg/dl)/ creatinine (mg/dl) ratio is ≥ 3.0; or

          -  diabetic retinopathy is present and either a previous 24 hour urine collection
             contains ≥ 3 gm protein/24 hours or a random urine protein (mg/dl)/ creatinine (mg/dl)
             ratio is ≥ 3.0.

          -  nephropathy without ESRD that is considered to be diabetic nephropathy because (a)
             diabetic retinopathy and a 24 hr urine collection with either ≥ 1 gram proteinuria/24
             hours or a urine protein (mg/dl)/ creatinine (mg/dl) ratio ≥ 1.0; or (b) at a time
             when diabetes duration is ≥ 10 years, either a urine collection of ≥ 3 grams
             protein/24 hours or a urine protein (mg/dl) /creatinine (mg/dl) ratio ≥ 3.0.

        African-American patients with chronic renal failure are as MALD cases by meeting criteria
        for diabetic nephropathy, as described for Family probands, or having nephropathy (serum
        creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl) not due to diabetes or known monogenic renal disease.
        Mexican-Americans recruited as MALD cases must meet criteria for diabetic nephropathy as
        defined for the Family probands. Phenotype criteria for probands entered into the Family or
        MALD protocols must be confirmed by medical record review.

        Eligibility of family members and MALD control subjects is based on laboratory tests
        obtained at the time of screening. Entry of a proband with diabetic nephropathy into the
        Family protocol also requires participation of either two living parents or at least one
        full sibling with diabetes. To be enrolled as having nephropathy, the diabetic sib must
        meet one of the following criteria:

          -  renal biopsy consistent with a diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy;

          -  urinary albumin excretion ≥ 30 mg/24hr or a urine albumin (mg/dl)/creatinine (mg/dl)
             ratio ≥ 0.03;

          -  a serum creatinine concentration ≥ 1.6 mg/dl for men or ≥ 1.4 mg/dl for women; or

          -  ESRD. Unaffected sibs are recruited if they have had diabetes for ≥ 10 years, have
             normal serum creatinine and albumin excretion (&lt; 30 mg albumin/24 hours, or a urine
             albumin (mg/dl)/creatinine (mg/dl) ratio &lt; 0.03) and no historical evidence of kidney
             disease.

        The criteria for MALD control subjects differ by ethnic group. For the African-American
        MALD protocol, two different control samples are recruited. First, an adult offspring with
        or without renal disease and the other parent of the offspring, who cannot have evidence of
        renal disease, are collected as controls for African-American probands with either diabetic
        or non-diabetic nephropathy. Together with the probands, this forms a sample of triads
        (offspring and other parent) or dyads (spouse only). A second group of African-American
        control subjects consists of unrelated individuals with diabetes duration ≥ 10 years and
        without nephropathy (as defined above for diabetic sibs). For Mexican Americans, a single
        unrelated control population is recruited with diabetes duration ≥ 10 years but without
        nephropathy (as defined above for diabetic sibs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A. Did not sign the informed consent: refusal to participate. B. Diagnosis not confirmed.
        C. Appropriate siblings not available. D. Judged not likely or unable to follow study
        protocol. E. Ethnicity of parents or grandparent not suitable. F. Spouse not available.
