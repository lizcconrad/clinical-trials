    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib and bortezomib in
      treating patients with advanced cancer. Sorafenib and bortezomib may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib and bortezomib in patients with
      advanced malignancies.

      II. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of sorafenib and bortezomib.

      III. To evaluate the therapeutic antitumor activity of the combination of sorafenib and
      bortezomib.

      IV. To evaluate the effects of sorafenib on the disposition of bortezomib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to
      disease type.

      GROUP I (solid tumors-dose-escalation group): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on
      days 1-21 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of sorafenib and bortezomib until the MTD is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      GROUP II (multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia-maximum tolerated dose [MTD]
      group): Patients receive oral sorafenib at the MTD twice daily on days 3-21 of course 1 and
      on days 1-21 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds
      at the MTD on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months.

    <time_frame>Observed for at least 3 weeks at a given dose level combination</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs include: Hematologic: Grade 4 ANC for ≥5 days, Grade 4 anemia of any duration, or PLT &lt;25,000 of any duration; Renal: Serum creatinine ≥2 times baseline or &gt; 2x upper limit of normal if baseline levels normal; All other non-hematologic toxicities ≥grade 3 as per CTCAE v3.0 except fatigue; Any toxicities that caused dose delay of &gt; 2 weeks of the intended next dose.
MTD is the dose level below the lowest dose that induces DLT in at least one-third of patients (2 of 6 patients).</description>

    <measure>Toxicity as assessed by CTCAE v3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Observed for at least 3 weeks at a given dose level combination</time_frame>
    <description>Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal CTC standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via Common Toxicity Criteria standard grading.
Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by dose level, patient and tumor site will be explored and summarized. Frequency distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses.</description>

Measurable lesions: lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter &gt; 20 mm. With spiral CT scan, lesion must be &gt; 10 mm in at least one dimension. Target lesions (up to 3) should be selected and a sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all will be the baseline sum LD. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesion taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
