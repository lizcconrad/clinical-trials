  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of islet cell transplants for
      the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It has been shown that normal control of blood
      sugar levels can prevent progression of complications (such as kidney disease, nerve damage,
      and vascular disease) from diabetes. This research study is designed to see if normal blood
      sugar control can be achieved by transplanting pancreatic islet cells into your liver, which
      may reduce or eliminate your need for insulin. Patients may qualify to participate in this
      research study if they have type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least five years and meet at
      least one of the following criteria:

        -  Experience hypoglycemic unawareness - Defined as inability to tell when blood glucose is
           low (for example, may not feel symptoms such as shaking, sweating, and rapid heartbeat
           that usually signify that glucose is low)

        -  Have been hospitalized several times in the past year for low blood sugar and/or high
           blood sugar

        -  Have complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, kidney problems, or neuropathy

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Enrolling subjects must have Type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years, complicated
        by at least one of the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin
        management efforts. (Intensive management is defined as monitoring of glucose values at
        home no less than three times each day and by the administration of three or more insulin
        injections each day. Such management must be monitored in close cooperation with an
        endocrinologist or primary care physician, as defined by at least three contacts during the
        previous 12 months. If an endocrinologist did not participate in the ongoing management
        effort during the past year, then an independent endocrinologist must assess the adequacy
        of the management efforts prior to enrollment.) The complicating situations are:

        a. Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic
        symptoms at plasma glucose levels of &lt; 54 mg/dL, b. Metabolic lability/instability,
        characterized by two or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia and which is associated with a
        blood glucose below 54 mg/dl OR two or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis over
        the last year, c. Despite efforts at optimal glucose control, progressive secondary
        complications of diabetes as defined by: i) Retinopathy—a minimum of a three step
        progression using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading system
        44,or an equivalent progression as certified by an ophthalmologist familiar with diabetic
        retinopathy, or ii) Nephropathy—a confirmed rise of 50 µg/min (72 mg/24h) of
        microalbuminuria or greater over at least three months (beginning anytime within the past
        two years) despite the use of an ACE inhibitor, or iii) Neuropathy—persistent or
        progressing autonomic neuropathy (gastroparesis, postural hypotension, neuropathic bowel or
        bladder) or persistent or progressing severe peripheral painful neuropathy not responding
        to usual management (e.g., tricyclics, gabapentin, or carbamazepine).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe co-existing cardiac disease, characterized by any one of these conditions:

               -  Recent myocardial infarction (within past six months), or

               -  Angiographic evidence of non-correctable coronary artery disease, or

               -  Evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam (functional testing is required
                  for all subjects, with a stress echo test recommended for subjects with a history
                  of ischemic disease). Patients unable to perform an exercise stress
                  echocardiogram test will undergo adenosine vasodilator stress test, and if there
                  is a history of bronchospasm, will undergo dobutamine stress test.

          2. Active alcohol or substance abuse-includes cigarette smoking (must be abstinent for
             six months). Active alcohol abuse should be considered using the current NIAAA
             definitions, whereby alcohol abuse is defined by a pattern of drinking that is
             accompanied by one or more of the following situations within a 12-month period:

               -  Failure to fulfill major work, school, or home responsibilities;

               -  Drinking in situations that are physically dangerous, such as while driving a car
                  or operating machinery;

               -  Recurring alcohol-related legal problems, such as being arrested for driving
                  under the influence of alcohol or for physically hurting someone while drunk;

               -  Continued drinking despite having ongoing relationship problems that are caused
                  or worsened by the effects of alcohol.

          3. Psychiatric disorder making the subject not a suitable candidate for transplantation,
             e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression that is unstable or
             uncontrolled on current medication. (A psychological or psychiatric consultation is
             required only if considered necessary by some current indication or history.)

          4. History of non-adherence to prescribed regimens

          5. Active infection including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV, or TB (or under treatment
             for suspected TB)

          6. Any history of or current malignancies except squamous or basal skin cancer

          7. BMI &gt; 26 kg/m2

          8. C-peptide response to arginine stimulation (5 gm I.V.) (any C-peptide ≥ 0.3 ng/mL at
             2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 min post-infusion)

          9. Inability to provide informed consent

         10. Age less than 18 or greater than 65 years

         11. Creatinine clearance &lt;80 mL/min/1.73 m2

         12. Serum creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dL

         13. Macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate &gt;300 mg/24h)

         14. Baseline Hb &lt;10.5 gm/dL in women, or &lt;13 gm/dL in men

         15. Baseline LFT's outside of normal range with the exception of Gilberts Syndrome. (An
             initial LFT test panel with any values &gt;1.5 times upper limits of normal will exclude
             a patient; a re-test for any values between normal and 1.5 times normal should be
             made, and if the values remain elevated above normal limits, the patient will be
             excluded.)

         16. Presence of gallstones (subjects may be eligible two weeks after a laparoscopic
             cholecystectomy)

         17. Portal hypertension, detected by baseline duplex ultrasonography (assessment of
             direction of flow in right, left and main portal vein [antegrade (normal) or
             retrograde (abnormal indicative of portal hypertension)]; hemangioma in liver on
             baseline ultrasonography

         18. Untreated proliferative retinopathy

         19. Positive pregnancy test, intent for future pregnancy or male subjects' intent to
             procreate, failure to follow effective contraceptive measures, or presently
             breast-feeding

         20. Evidence of sensitization on PRA (determined by demonstration of positive results for
             anti-HLA antibodies using solid phase immunoassay with soluble HLA Class I molecules
             as a target, or a general PRA panel with reactivity &gt;20%)

         21. Insulin requirement &gt;0.7 IU/kg/day

         22. HbA1C &gt;12%

         23. Inability to reach the study hospital for transplantation within 24 hrs of
             notification

         24. Untreated hyperlipidemia (fasting LDL cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dL and/or fasting
             triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL)

         25. Treated hyperlipidemia that is uncontrolled (fasting LDL cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dL;
             and/or fasting triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL)

         26. Under treatment for a medical condition requiring chronic use of steroids aa. Use of
             coumadin or other anticoagulant therapy (except aspirin) or subject with PT/INR &gt;1.5

             27. Addison's disease. All subjects should be screened with a basal 8:00 a.m. cortisol
             test. Results less than the lower limit of normal indicate further testing (e.g., a
             Cortrosyn stimulation test) to rule out adrenal insufficiency. Abnormal ACTH
             stimulation test will be an exclusion criterion.
