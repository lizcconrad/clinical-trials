  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous cancer-related pain is difficult to treat. These patients are often prescribed high
      systemic dosages of opioids. Yet, many patients continue to report pain while experiencing
      dose-limiting side effects. An alternative approach to systemic administration is to apply
      topical medications. The advantage of topical application is the potential of achieving good
      analgesia using low dosages with few, if any, systemic side effects. Current clinical data
      indicates, that topically applied morphine has an analgesic effect in patients with severe
      pain and that it may even improve wound healing. The clinical reports so far have been either
      case studies or double blind randomly controlled trials with a very small sample size of
      patients. There is still a great deal of information which is lacking about this modality of
      treatment regarding on the one hand, the mechanism of action and on the other, clinical
      issues. For example, is the mechanism of the effect actually peripheral? What is the adequate
      dose of analgesic medication for different types of skin conditions? Wound healing has not
      been quantified.

      We will apply morphine topically to skin wounds of cancer and evaluate the effect of the
      treatment on pain, side effects, quantify wound healing, quantify morphine and its
      metabolites in blood and urine.

      Should well controlled studies, demonstrate all or any of the peripheral effects of topical
      morphine, clinical application of this treatment modality would be possible. This could
      contribute towards better treatment of these patients, who have pain which is difficult to
      treat and can, at times, be intractable.
