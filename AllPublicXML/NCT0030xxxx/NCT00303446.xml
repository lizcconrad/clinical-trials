      This study will determine if the drug dutasteride can improve weakness, mobility,
      functioning, nerve function, and quality of life in patients with spinal and bulbar muscular
      atrophy (SBMA). Patients with this inherited disease have an abnormal androgen receptor
      protein. The male hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) bind to this abnormal
      receptor, causing damage to nerve cells that innervate muscle and leading to weakness.
      Dutasteride decreases DHT production. Lowering DHT levels may decrease the harmful effects of
      DHT to the nerves and improve strength in people with SBMA.

      Males 18 years of age and older with SBMA who have neurological symptoms and can walk 100
      feet (with or without assistive devices) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a blood test and a review of their medical records and genetic studies.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Blood and urine tests, history and physical examination, assessment of muscle strength

        -  Quality-of-life questionnaire

        -  Tests to assess functional abilities, such walking up steps, keeping the head up while
           lying down, and other measures

        -  Nerve conduction study and motor unit number estimation to assess nerve damage. A probe
           placed on the skin delivers small electrical impulses and wires taped to the skin record
           the impulses.

        -  Quantitative muscle testing to measure strength. The subject pushes and pulls levers
           attached to a gauge. Strength is recorded by a computer.

        -  Medication. Participants are divided into two groups. One group is given the study drug,
           dutasteride; the other receives a placebo (sugar pill). All participants take their
           assigned medication once a day for 24 months.

        -  Follow-up evaluations. Every 6 months for 2 years, participants return to NIH to repeat
           the tests described above to determine the effects of the dutasteride. Nerve and
           quantitative muscle testing is not done at the 6- and 18-month visits.

        -  In addition to their follow-up appointments here at the NIH every 6 months, participants
           will also have blood tests and a physical examination performed after 3, 9, 15 and 21
           months of treatment by the patient's local physician.

      Background:

      Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) or Kennedy's disease is a slowly progressive,
      X-linked motor neuron disease for which there is currently no treatment. It is caused by a
      mutation in the androgen receptor that results in a polyglutamine repeat expansion. Recent
      animal studies have demonstrated that decreasing endogenous androgen levels leads to
      functional improvement and increased survival. Studies have also shown that high levels of 5
      alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to the more potent dihydrotestosterone
      (DHT), are present in the ventral spinal cord, while low levels of this enzyme are found
      within skeletal muscle. Thus, by selectively decreasing levels of DHT with dutasteride, a 5
      alpha-reductase inhibitor, it is hypothesized that there will be a selective protection of
      motor neurons, without the adverse effects of reducing the anabolic effects of androgen on
      muscle.

      Objective:

      This will be a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the safety and
      efficacy of the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in inhibiting the progression of
      neurodegeneration in patients with Kennedy's disease. Natural history data will also be
      obtained from the placebo control arm.

      Study Population:

      We aim to enroll 50 men with genetically confirmed Kennedy's disease.

      Design:

      Our objective is to examine the safety and efficacy of dutasteride given at a dose of 0.5 mg
      a day for 2 years in an outpatient setting. This will be a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial with 25 subjects in each arm. The subjects will be evaluated
      neurologically and endocrinologically every 6 months at the NIH Clinical Center. In addition
      to their clinical visits at the NIH, subjects will also be examined by their primary
      physician after 3, 9, 15, and 21 months of treatment. The primary objective is to examine the
      effects of dutasteride on inhibiting or reversing the rate of progression of weakness as
      measured by quantitative muscle testing. Following informed consent, patients will undergo an
      initial medical history and physical followed by testing of specific neurological and
      endocrinological measures over a two-day outpatient visit. Patients will provide blood
      samples for analysis of hormonal levels and extent of muscle damage every three months. In
      addition, at the initial, one-year, and two-year follow-up visits patients will have nerve
      conduction studies as well as quantitative and functional strength evaluation. Each patient
      will be randomized to the treatment or placebo arm and will be given a 3 month supply of the
      study drug or a matched placebo at each visit. In between clinic visits, the NIH clinical
      pharmacy will send an additional 3 month supply to each subject until the subsequent visit.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measure used will be quantitative muscle testing (QMT). Secondary outcome
      measures include the Adult Myositis Assessment Tool (AMAT), 2-minute walk, a quality of life
      measure (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Version 2, SF-36v2), neurophysiological
      testing (sensory nerve action potentials, and statistical motor unit number estimation).
      Changes in hormone levels (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, estradiol),
      and creatine kinase levels will also be measured and correlated with changes in strength.
      Evaluation of disease severity and course as related to CAG repeat length and androgen levels
      will also be assessed.

      Future Directions:

      The results of this phase II study will assist us in developing a multi-center, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled phase III trial. In addition, natural history data will be obtained from
      the control arm that will be important in future clinical trials of SBMA.

        <description>Quantitative muscle assessment (QMA) was done with a fixed frame dynamometer, a strain gauge tensiometer, and a computer-aided acquisition system. Maximal voluntary isometric muscle contractions were measured twice, the average was calculated, and the results were summed over 22 muscle groups (11 on each side). The total force was scaled for body weight and expressed as percent change from baseline. Measurements were performed at 0, 12, and 24 months. The calculated percent changes at 12 and 24 months are shown.</description>

        <description>Subjects completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Version 2 (SF-36v2), in which they rated their mental quality of life over the preceding 4 weeks. Raw SF-36v2 scores were converted to norm-based scales and component summaries using the scoring code provided by QualityMetric (mean=50, standard deviation (SD)=10), and percent change in the norm-based scale was calculated.</description>
