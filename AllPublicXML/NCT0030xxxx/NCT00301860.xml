      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps
      stop both the growth of cancer cells and the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient,
      they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,
      and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and melphalan, and
      antithymocyte globulin before transplant and cyclosporine and methotrexate after transplant
      may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well donor stem cell transplant, using low-dose
      chemotherapy and antithymocyte globulin, followed by donor white blood cell infusions work in
      treating young patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using a
           reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, in terms of whole blood engraftment rate at 100
           days post transplant, in pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies who are at
           high risk for complications with conventional transplantation.

        -  Determine the feasibility of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), in terms of number of
           patients who receive at least one DLI by 12 months post transplant, in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicities of the conditioning regimen, in terms of 100-day post
           transplant nonrelapse-related death rate, in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of DLI, in terms of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease rate
           and 12-month post transplant nonrelapse-related death rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -6 to
           -2; antithymocyte globulin IV on days -5 to -2; and melphalan IV on days -3 and -2.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
           on day 0. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV beginning on day 5 and continuing
           until blood counts recover.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally
           beginning on day -1 and continuing until at least day 28 and methotrexate IV on days 1,
           3, and 6.

        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI): Patients with mixed chimerism, no acute GVHD requiring
           therapy, and no relapse/progression post transplant at day 90 may receive DLI. At least
           30 days after discontinuation of immunosuppression, patients may receive up to 2 DLIs at
           least 8-12 weeks apart in the absence of GVHD.

      At the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
