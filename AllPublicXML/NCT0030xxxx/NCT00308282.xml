      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      treatment with LY2127399 (in addition to the standard of care treatment, methotrexate) for
      patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Patients will receive three intravenous doses of
      LY2127399 or placebo. Patients will participate in 10 or more visits to the study site, over
      6 months. Evaluation of safety and efficacy will be conducted throughout the study.
