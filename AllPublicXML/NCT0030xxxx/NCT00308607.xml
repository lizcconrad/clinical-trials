      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination therapy with bevacizumab
      (Avastin), dacarbazine and interferon-alfa-2a (Roferon-A) is effective in patients with
      locally advancing or metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been approved for treating metastatic melanoma in the 1970s, and after
      that numerous schedules and dacarbazine-based combinations have been studied in this disease.
      DTIC as a single agent gives a response rate of only 20%, but there have been efforts to
      improve this poor result by using DTIC in different combinations.Treatment of melanoma with
      combination chemotherapy and interferon-α (IFN-α) has given 50-60% response rates,but
      increase in the overall survival time has not been reached in controlled phase III studies.
      Thus, standard reference therapy in treatment of metastatic melanoma still is single
      dacarbazine or its combination with s.c. IFN-α. In addition, new studies with melanoma cells
      in vitro show that dacarbazine causes transcriptional up-regulation of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a potential clinical benefit of combination of DTIC and
      anti-VEGF therapy. IFN-α has been used in adjuvant therapy and in treatment of metastatic
      melanoma. IFN-α exerts its effects through antiproliferative, apoptosis-inducing and
      particularly antiangiogenic effects in addition to immunologic modulation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination therapy with bevacizumab
      (Avastin), dacarbazine and interferon-alfa-2a (Roferon-A) can increase progression-free
      survival and overall survival in patients with locally advancing or metastatic melanoma.
