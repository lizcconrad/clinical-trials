        <description>Menstrual blood loss volume as assessed by the alkaline hematin method for the 90 days before treatment (baseline) and for 90 days under treatment.

A negative value indicates a reduction in blood loss after treatment.</description>

The higher the score, the better the well-being of the patient. The observation phase was the last 4 weeks. The following 6 dimensions were derived from the questionnaire: anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, health, and vitality and the highest possible scores were 30, 18, 24, 18, 18, and 24, respectively.</description>

Patients were asked to indicate their current health state by ticking the most appropriate of 3 statements about each of the questions (ie, no problems, some problems, extreme problems). The best possible answers were (1,1,1,1,1), which equals a valuation score of 1.0. The worst possible answers were (3,3,3,3,3), which equals a score of .594.</description>
