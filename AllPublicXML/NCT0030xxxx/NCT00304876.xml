  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study intensively the bacteriology of feces in C. difficile
      associated diarrheal disease, using a variety of conventional and very up-to-date techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile associated colitis is an increasing problem in hospitals throughout the
      developed world; the number of cases has increased, and the failure to respond to
      conventional therapy has become far more common. The investigators have recently documented
      in the medical literature (Clin Infect Dis, June, 2005; Lancet Infect Dis, August, 2005).
      Possible reasons for failure of treatment include persistence of C. difficile and/or
      imbalance of other bacterial flora in the colon. The bacteriology of fecal flora in C.
      difficile associated diarrhea has not been studied.
