  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -Although IL-2 can shrink tumors in about 20 percent of patients with metastatic kidney
      cancer and in 15 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma, it is not fully known how the
      drug works.

      Objectives:

      -To better understand how IL-2 causes tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic kidney cancer or metastatic melanoma

      Design:

        -  135 patients with melanoma and 110 patients with kidney cancer may be enrolled.

        -  Patients are hospitalized for about 7 days for each treatment. They receive IL-2
           intravenously (through a vein) over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 4 days or 12
           doses. This constitutes one treatment cycle.

        -  Research blood samples are collected daily during the first treatment cycle and for one
           or two days following the last dose.

        -  Patients may be asked to undergo leukapheresis, a procedure for collecting large
           quantities of white blood cells. This involves collecting blood through a needle in an
           arm vein. The blood is directed through a cell separator where the white cells are
           extracted. The rest of the blood (red cells, platelets, and plasma) is returned to the
           patient through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.

        -  About 7-10 days after discharge from the hospital, patients return for a second
           treatment cycle but without research blood sampling.

        -  2 months after therapy, patients are evaluated with scans, and x-rays, and blood tests
           to evaluate the tumor and the effects of the treatment on immune cells.

        -  Patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable may continue treatment (without repeating
           the full set of research blood samples) as long as they benefit from the treatment and
           do not develop unacceptable side effects. Patients who continue treatment are evaluated
           every 2 months for 3 to 4 times and then every 3 to 6 months.

      Background:

        -  Although interleukin-2 (IL-2) was approved as standard therapy by the US Food and Drug
           Administration for metastasis melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, the mechanism of action
           in these patient populations is still not completely understood.

        -  Methods for studying regulatory T-cells and measuring recently discovered cytokines were
           not available during earlier studies of IL-2 administration.

      Objectives:

      - Explore peripheral blood samples of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or melanoma
      receiving high-dose IL-2 to identify serum protein levels and lymphocyte phenotypes that may
      be associated with or predictive of tumor regression.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or melanoma who are greater than or equal to
           18 years of age, with an ECOG of 0 or 1 who have an expected survival greater than three
           months.

        -  Patients with systemic infections, coagulation disorders, or major medical illnesses of
           the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system will be excluded, including patients
           with ejection fractions less than 45% or FEV1 or VC less than or equal to 60% predicted.

        -  Patients must not have had prior therapy within 28 days, previous IL-2 therapy, be
           pregnant, have untreated or clinically significant tumor involvement of the CNS or major
           nerve compression, or have greater than 25% estimated hepatic replacement.

      Design:

        -  Aldesleukin 720,000 IU/kg intravenous bolus over 15 minutes every eight hours for up to
           12 doses will be administered as a cycle of treatment.

        -  Seven to 10 days after discharge, a second cycle of treatment will be administered.

        -  20 mLs of blood for serum and 20 mLs of blood for peripheral blood cells will be
           collected daily during the first cycle of aldesleukin administration and the day
           following the last dose. 20 mLs of blood for serum and 50 mLs of blood for cell
           separation will be obtained on days 2 through 4 following completion of IL-2
           administration. On one of these days, an additional 50 mLs of blood for cell separation
           or a 2 hour apheresis may be substituted.

        -  Approximately two months from the beginning of therapy, a response assessment will be
           performed.

        -  Patients with stable or regressing disease will receive a second complete treatment
           course. Subsequent courses may be administered if there is evidence of on-going tumor
           regression without long-term or irreversible toxicity.

        -  In the first 5 patients of each diagnosis (metastatic renal cell cancer and melanoma)
           the following cytokine levels will be assayed: VEGF, CD40L, FASL, TRAIL, GRO-alpha,
           IP10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15,
           TNF-alpha, TNF-beta; and the following phenotypic markers will be studied: CD3, CD4,
           CD8, CD16, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD56, CD80, CD95, CD107a, CD152, FoxP3, annexin V.

        -  After the first 10 patients have been analyzed, the scope of the tests will be narrowed
           to those which show a response to IL-2.

        -  Initially, a total of 127 evaluable patients with melanoma will be enrolled, with a
           presumed 15% response rate. With the approval of amendment F, a new accrual ceiling of
           200 patients with metastatic melanoma will be established to complete the proposed
           analysis.

        -  A total of 100 evaluable patients with renal cell carcinoma will be enrolled with a
           presumed 20% response rate.

        -  Allowing for a small number of inevaluable patients, a total of 200 patients with
           melanoma and 110 patients with renal cell carcinoma may be enrolled.
