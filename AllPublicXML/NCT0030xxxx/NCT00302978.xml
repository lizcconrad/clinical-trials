  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are interested in investigating the functional brain abnormalities of height phobia.
      Subjects will be have a functional MRI scan before and after a course of treatment with
      behavioral therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of in vivo exposure therapy on the
      functional brain activity of subjects with height phobia using a fear provocation paradigm.
      We expect differential activation of the fear circuitry in height phobics compared to
      non-phobic controls, and that successful behavioral therapy will normalize the heightened
      fear response in height phobia.
