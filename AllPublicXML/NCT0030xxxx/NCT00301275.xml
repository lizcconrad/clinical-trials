    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow.
      These plasma cells produce an abnormal protein called paraprotein / M spike in the serum
      which can be serially monitored to assess the response of tumour on therapy. The paraprotein
      has a heavy chain which can be either IgG, IgA, IgM or IgD and a light chain which can be
      either kappa or lambda.

      At present, these can be assessed by serum and urine electrophoresis (SPE and UPE). These
      techniques are relatively insensitive and poorly quantitative compared with other
      immunoassays for tumour markers.

      The potential of serum free light chain (flc) measurement as a marker for myeloma has been
      recognised for some time. However, development of such assays has proved elusive, primarily
      due to the difficulty in developing assays that are both convenient to use and have the
      required specificity to measure flc in serum. Recently , the assay has been standardised and
      is in use. Its likely that the assessment of flc might be a sensitive marker of documenting
      complete remission in patients with myeloma. The aim of this study is to study the flc in
      patients with myeloma in complete remission (CR) to see if patients have CR documented by
      standard criteria- are the free light chains still positive and if so are they better markers
      of remission. The samples will be collected and tested in batches of 60 each.
