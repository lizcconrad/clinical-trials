    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with rituximab plus sargramostim
      will be more effective than rituximab alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On 29 May 2009, Bayer began transitioning the sponsorship of this trial to Genzyme. As of 29
      August 2009, Genzyme assumed responsibility for the close out of the study. NOTE: This study
      was originally posted by sponsor Berlex, Inc. Berlex, Inc. was renamed to Bayer HealthCare,
      Inc.

      The study was terminated early due to low enrollment; significant changes to the protocol
      would have been required to keep pace with the changing therapeutic landscape of indolent
      lymphoma.

    <measure>Participant Summary of Best Response Across All Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Count of participants' best response within categories defined by the International Working Group (IWG):
&gt; Complete Response (complete disappearance of detectable clinical and radiological evidence of disease),
&gt; Complete Response Unconfirmed (unconfirmed complete disappearance),
&gt; Partial Response (&gt;=50% decrease sum of the product of the greatest diameters in the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses),

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Count of days in which a participant experiences a Partial Response (&gt;=50% decrease sum of the product of the greatest diameters in the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses) or better.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summary of Cost Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer perspective was to be performed. Only direct medical costs for each patient during the study period were to be included for analysis. Costs were to be calculated by multiplying each health care resource unit by the amount reimbursed by a payer. Health care resource utilization units are a way to normalize the quantity of health care provided to each participant so that costs can be compared.</description>
