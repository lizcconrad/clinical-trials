      This study will address the following questions:

        -  Does the use of oestrogen inserted vaginally with an applicator, help with the symptoms
           of faecal (bowel) incontinence in women who are past the age of menopause?

        -  Do women find it easy to use?

        -  Is the treatment safe for the womb lining?

        -  Is there any systemic absorption of the treatment?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Faecal incontinence affects about 5% of women, the most common cause is often cited by women
      as obstetric trauma. However in clinical practice many women report that their symptoms of
      faecal incontinence begin around the same time as menopause. A community survey examining the
      prevalence of faecal incontinence in menopausal women is in progress. If a correlation is
      found between the onset of menopause and the development of faecal incontinence, further
      investigation of effective treatment will be indicated.

      The investigators want to investigate whether vaginally administered oestradiol can alleviate
      or improve symptoms in women who have faecal incontinence after the menopause. This is a
      pilot study.
