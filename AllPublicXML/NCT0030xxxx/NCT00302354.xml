  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, three-period crossover study to examine the
      likeability of a single dose of OROS MPH (CONCERTAÒ 90mg) and a single dose of Long-acting
      MPH (RITALIN LAÒ 90mg). Hypotheses are as follows:

      Hypothesis 1: OROS-MPH (CONCERTAÒ) will be later than SODOS-MPH (RITALIN LAÒ) in its Tmax
      (time to Cmax).

      Hypothesis 2: The subjective feelings of detection and likeability would be greater for
      SODOS-MPH (RITALIN LAÒ) than for an equivalent total dose of OROS-MPH (CONCERTAÒ).

      Our recent work has suggested that the potential euphoriant risk associated with MPH may be
      moderated by the oral delivery system in which a longer delivery system may be safer than the
      immediate release one. OROS-MPH's pharmacokinetic profile uses an increasing delivery of MPH
      over the day (ascending pharmacokinetic curve). It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID
      treatment. Another new long-acting MPH formulation is the spheroidal oral drug absorption
      system (SODAS). SODAS-MPH consists of capsules with two types of beads in a 1 to 1 ratio.
      Evaluating whether different long acting formulations of MPH will differ in their rate of
      onset of MPH action (plasma level) is of high clinical, scientific and public health
      relevance. Since the rate of delivery of MPH is a key factor previously associated with
      detection and likeability of MPH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females. With the exception of women who have
             been post-menopausal for a minimum of 12 months prior to screening and those who have
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, all female subjects must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at both screening and at each admission to the research
             unit, and have used a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least one
             month prior to screening and willing to continue use during the study. Medically
             acceptable forms of birth control include abstinence, hormonal contraceptives,
             diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, intrauterine device, or surgical
             sterilization (including vasectomy of male partner(s).

          2. Eighteen (18) to 45 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Based on medical history, physical examination, and/or lab results, are considered
             healthy and free of any conditions that may interfere with participation in the study.
             Any abnormalities at screening on results of ECG or any laboratory test must be
             determined to be not clinically significant by the investigator.

          4. Agree to not use prescription stimulants (except for the study medication) during the
             study.

          5. Have venous access sufficient for blood sampling as determined by clinical
             examination.

          6. Weigh at least 110 pounds at screening.

          7. Agree and are available to return to the study center for three full-day
             (approximately 14 hours) study visits held five to 30 days apart within a 10-week
             period, and willing to complete all protocol-specified assessments.
