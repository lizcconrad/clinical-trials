  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to look at things that may affect whether or not people who are HIV-infected
      get into medical care and stay in medical care. some of the things that will be examined
      include how drug use, HIV disease severity, mental health, housing, trust, feelings of
      discrimination, social support, relationship with provider, and patient's race and provider's
      race are linked with whether or not people get health care. People who are enrolled in the
      study will be interviewed once, and their medical records will be examined.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the determinants of entry and engagement in HIV
      primary care services for Blacks and Hispanics living in single room occupancy (SRO) hotels
      in Bronx and Manhattan, NY. More specifically, the goal is to examine baseline cultural
      characteristics of the patient, health-related characteristics of the patient, the
      patient-provider relationship, and the impact of community outreach on engagement in health
      care. The objectives are to: examine the association between trust, relationship with
      provider, social support, and health beliefs with engagement in HIV primary care services;
      examine the association between health-related characteristics and engagement in HIV primary
      care services; examine the association of perceived cultural concordance between provider and
      patient with engagement in HIV primary care services; and, explore the relationship between
      community outreach and entry into HIV primary care services.

      We will be recruiting a convenience sample of 500 Black or Hispanic HIV-infected adults
      living in 14 SRO hotels (transitional emergency housing) in the Bronx and Manhattan, NY. We
      will be conducting interviews through auditory computer-assisted self-interviewing (A-CASI)
      technology, using standardized research instruments administered in English or Spanish. We
      will also be reviewing medical charts and records from Citiwide and Montefiore appointment
      databases.

      Understanding barriers to engagement in HIV primary care will lead to development of
      culturally relevant interventions to assist Black and Hispanic persons in entering and
      engaging in HIV treatment. Implementation of these interventions will ultimately help reduce
      disparities in HIV-related healthcare, as well as reduce HIV morbidity and mortality in Black
      and Hispanic populations.
