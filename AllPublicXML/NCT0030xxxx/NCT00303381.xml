          -  Moderately active UC, defined as:

               -  Diagnosis of UC documented by clinical, radiological and endoscopic or
                  histological findings

               -  Proctosigmoidoscopic diagnosis: at least left-sided disease; the extent of the
                  colonic inflammation is to be more than 20 centimeter from the anal verge

               -  A flare in disease activity considered moderate in according to the UCSS during
                  the 14 days before initiation of study medication. Moderate disease is defined as
                  a UCSS between 6 and 10 with a UCSS Physician's Global Assessment less than (&lt;) 3
                  and a proctosigmoidoscopy score of 2 or 3

          -  At least one previous flare-up of UC

          -  Maintenance treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) at a stable dose for the
             management of UC is allowed, but not required. The daily dose of 5-ASA has to be
             stable for at least 4 weeks before Study Day 1 and has to be no more than 3.6
             gram/day. This dose has to be maintained throughout the study. Corticosteroids will
             not be allowed during the study, with the exceptions of inhaled steroids and topical
             dermatological steroids

             urinary Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test within 7 days before Study Day 1. A
