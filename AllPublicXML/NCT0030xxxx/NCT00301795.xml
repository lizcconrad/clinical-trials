  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Oblimersen may help rituximab work better by
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase II trial is studying how well
      giving rituximab together with oblimersen works in treating patients with stage II, stage
      III, or stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (overall and complete response rate) after rituximab +
      oblimersen sodium extended induction therapy in previously untreated cluster of
      differentiation 20 positive (CD20+) follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients.

      II. To determine the time to progression after rituximab + oblimersen sodium extended
      induction therapy in previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of rituximab + oblimersen sodium therapy in previously
      untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patients.

      II. To establish whether the therapeutic effects of the rituximab + oblimersen sodium
      combination are sufficiently promising to warrant evaluation in a subsequent randomized trial
      (in comparison to rituximab alone).

      III. To correlate Fc receptor profiling to response to rituximab + oblimersen sodium in
      previously untreated patients with follicular NHL.

      IV. To determine the relationship between change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) uptake early
      after treatment with rituximab + oblimersen sodium to response rate and time to progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Induction therapy (month 1): Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and
      15-21 and rituximab IV on days 3, 10, 17, and 24 in month 1.

      Extended induction therapy (months 3, 5, 7, and 9): Patients receive oblimersen IV
      continuously on days 22-28 and rituximab IV on day 24 in months 3, 5, 7, and 9.

      Treatment continues for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.
