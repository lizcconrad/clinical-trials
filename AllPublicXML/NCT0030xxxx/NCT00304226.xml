  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population for this current study will include stage 1 and stage 2 hypertensive patients
      who are newly diagnosed or didn't have treatment during the last 3 months and patients who
      are currently treated but uncontrolled on present monotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment with valsartan versus a
      treatment with amlodipine in reaching blood pressure control after 14 weeks of treatment.
