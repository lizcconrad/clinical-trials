  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)are cured with radiation therapy and/or
      combination chemotherapy. However, patients who relapse after attaining a complete remission
      with chemotherapy and those with primary refractory disease have a poor outcome with
      conventional chemotherapy regimens. Treatment results with standard−dose second−line regimens
      produce low complete remission rates and minimal survival benefit. Single institution studies
      have shown better outcome after autologous stem cell transplant in this group of patients
      when compared to historical controls receiving conventional treatment. In this retrospective
      review, we aim to analyze outcome and determine independent prognostic factors which would
      correlate with the long−term outcome of patients with HL who received an autologous stem cell
      transplant in the past at the Royal Marsden Hospital Eligible patients (those on
      current−follow−up) identified from the transplant database will be eligible for the study.

      Accrual of eligible patients currently under follow−up will be performed in clinic at the
      time of next appointment. All patients accrued will give informed consent to participate in
      the study for retrospective case note review, after discussion with a study investigator and
      after receiving a study information sheet. The results of the analysis will be published in a
      peer−reviewed medical journal.
