  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating doses
      of vintafolide (EC145) in participants with relapsed or refractory advanced tumors. The
      primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of
      vintafolide given by intravenous bolus or infusion. The efficacy of the treatment will also
      be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study of vintafolide administered by intravenous (IV) bolus or
      infusion during weeks 1 and 3 of a 4-week cycle to participants with solid tumors refractory
      to current therapies. Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cells via
      a folate vitamin receptor. Experimental evidence shows that the target receptor is
      over-expressed in many human cancers. There are no previous human studies of vintafolide
      treatment; however, lab research (research in test tubes and/or animals) using vintafolide
      has shown activity against tumors in animals. This activity in animal models suggests that
      vintafolide may be useful as chemotherapy against human cancers.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose During Cycle 1 Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 26 in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose that can safely be administered to a patient to produce acceptable, manageable and reversible toxicity. This level was further defined as the dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 participants had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the level below the dose at which ≥2 of 6 participants had DLT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Best Overall Tumor Response: Participants with Folate Receptor Positive Tumors at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor status was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Tumor responses used as a reference the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions using imaging studies. Partial Response was defined as ≥30% decrease in LD. Stable Disease was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage or increase in LD to qualify as either Partial Response or Progressive Disease. Progressive Disease was defined as ≥20% increase in LD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with a Dose-Limiting Toxiciity During Cycle 1 Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 26 in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicity was defined as an adverse event that is likely related to the study medication, and fulfills any one of the following criteria: Grade 2 non-hematological toxicity that fails to recover to a Grade 1 level or Baseline at the time that the next treatment cycle is due (with the exception of alopecia); Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (except for nausea/vomiting without maximal symptomatic / prophylactic treatment); Grade 4 hematological toxicity; Toxicity that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent use of the drug dose or regimen by the general oncology community.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with an Adverse Event Leading to Study Discontinuation During Cycle 1 Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 26 in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward, undesired, or unplanned clinical event in the form of physical signs, symptoms, disease, laboratory or physiological observations in a participant administered the Sponsor's product whether or not related to the use of the product</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Best Overall Tumor Response: All Treated Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor status was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Tumor responses used as a reference the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions using imaging studies. Complete Response was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response was defined as ≥30% decrease in LD. Stable Disease was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage or increase in LD to qualify as either Partial Response or Progressive Disease. Progressive Disease was defined as ≥20% increase in LD.</description>
