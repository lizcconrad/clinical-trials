  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates outreach to HIV-infected people living in unstable housing in New York
      City who are new to CitiWide Harm Reduction. One hundred and fifty people are interviewed
      every 6 months, and their medical records are reviewed every 6 months for a total of 18
      months. The study examines how outreach, case management, housing, drug use, mental health,
      and quality of life are related to people's ability to get into and stay in medical care.

      The study is a prospective cohort study in which 150 newly enrolled HIV-infected participants
      of CitiWide Harm Reduction are followed for 18 months to assess HIV-related health outcomes.
      Data elements include (1)face-to-face interviews focusing on housing, HIV disease severity,
      utilization of health care services, utilization of non-medical services, substance use,
      mental health, and quality of life; (2) medical chart information focusing on CD4 count,
      viral load, and HIV primary care visits; and (3) outreach services. We hypothesize that
      involvement with CitiWide Harm Reduction will improve HIV-related health care utilization and
      outcomes.
