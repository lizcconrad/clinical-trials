  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus infection has clearly been recognized as the cause of cervical cancer.
      Indeed, the infection of the cervix by certain oncogenic types of HPV, if not cleared , can
      lead over time to cervical cancer in women . This study will evaluate the immune response
      induced by the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and the safety of the vaccine.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

      The protocol was primarily amended for the following reason:

      Merck's tetravalent HPV vaccine, GardasilÂ®, has been licensed and is now becoming
      commercially available in an increasing number of countries. Therefore, the study procedures
      were revised to include questions at every visit to determine if subjects have received an
      HPV vaccine outside of the study.
