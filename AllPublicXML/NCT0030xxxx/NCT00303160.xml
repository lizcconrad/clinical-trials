  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study argues that H.pylori infection, by increasing the production of reactive oxygen
      species, increases the utilization of dietary antioxidants(Vit E and Vit C) that serve in
      quenching the free radicals, thus decreasing their serum levels and confounding their
      protective effect against gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been postulated that dietary antioxidants may reduce cancer risk by modulating red-ox
      status, by preventing biological oxidation, and by inhibiting the formation of carcinogen.
      However, supplementation studies and prospective studies have yielded contradictory results.
      In the case of gastric cancer, H.pylori infection, which is known to be associated with a
      higher risk of the disease, results in an increased production of ROS &amp; RNS. As a result
      serum levels of these free radicals increase, exerting a higher demand for dietary
      antioxidants to neutralize them.

      The fact that the relation between serum levels of antioxidants and gastric cancer is more
      consistent than that of dietary intake levels and the disease suggests the possibility of the
      presence of an intrinsic factor that is altering the true relation between dietary
      antioxidants and the cancer. This intrinsic factor, this study argues, is the infection with
      H.pylori.

      H.pylori infection, by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, increases the
      utilization of dietary antioxidants that serve in quenching the free radicals, thus
      decreasing their serum levels and confounding their protective effect against gastric cancer.
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the possibility that H.pylori infection
      alters the bioavailability of the dietary antioxidants: vitamin C, and vitamin E. This
      project will be done in preparation for an etiologic study of dietary antioxidants and
      gastric cancer.
