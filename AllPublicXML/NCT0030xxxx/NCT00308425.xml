    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EC-MPS plus valsartan
      as part of an intensified multifactorial intervention on the reduction of the 12-month rate
      of transplant nephropathy compared with EC-MPS plus standard practice of care in recipients
      of a first cadaver donor kidney transplant given CsA-ME, basiliximab, and short-term
      steroids.

        Inclusion criteria

        1. Male and female patients aged 18 to 70 years 2. Patients receiving a first kidney
        transplant from a cadaver donor, who are scheduled to receive CsA-ME and anti-CD25 antibody
