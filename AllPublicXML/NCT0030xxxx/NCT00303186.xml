  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an economic analysis on the cost of conventional
      therapy as compared to biologic therapy and the direct/indirect costs of disease management
      in patients with refractory psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Primary outcomes are to qualify the
      economic burden of refractory PsA care. The secondary outcomes are to assess efficacy,
      safety, and cost effectiveness of different therapies.

    <measure>Mean Cost Per Participant Per Month at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Overall cost per participant per month was evaluated as part of health economics evaluation to quantify burden of Refractory PsA and its treatment, resources absorbed by the disease and its care into monetary terms. Overall cost was defined as sum of direct and indirect costs (productivity losses). Direct costs included cost of following cost variables: pharmacological treatment; hospitalizations; diagnostic examinations, laboratory analysis and specialist visits; transports.</description>

    <description>Overall cost per participant per month was evaluated as part of health economics evaluation to quantify burden of Refractory PsA and its treatment, resources absorbed by the disease and its care into monetary terms. Overall cost was defined as sum of direct and indirect costs (productivity losses). Direct costs included cost of following cost variables: pharmacological treatment; hospitalizations; diagnostic examinations, laboratory analysis and specialist visits; transports.</description>

    <measure>Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 60</time_frame>
    <description>ICER: ratio of the incremental cost of treatment over the incremental effectiveness. Incremental cost = difference in cost between baseline and month 60. Effectiveness was defined as quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, i.e. difference in Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)- health state profile utility score between baseline and month 60. (EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.)</description>

ASAS 20 = 20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;= 10 units on a 0-100 scale (0=no disease activity; 100=high disease activity) for &gt;= 3 domains, and no worsening in remaining domain.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, Month 60</time_frame>
    <description>PsARC is comprised of 4 clinical improvement criteria: 1 unit (0-5 Likert scale) improvement on the Physician Global Assessment (PGA); 20% (0-100 scale) improvement on the participant assessments; and 30% reduction in the number of tender joints; and 30% reduction in the number of swollen joints. To achieve a clinical response, the participant must improve in 2 of the 4 PsARC criteria, 1 of which has to be the number of tender or swollen joints and none of the 4 scores could worsen.</description>

    <description>Combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body was divided into 4 sections: head, arms, trunk, legs. For each section, percent area of skin involved was estimated: 0= 0% to 6= 90-100%. Severity was estimated by clinical signs: erythema, induration, desquamation; scale: 0= none to 4= maximum. Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each section*area score*weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4); total possible score range: 0= no disease to 72= maximal disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, Month 60</time_frame>
    <description>BASFI is a validated self assessment tool that determines the degree of functional limitation in AS. Utilizing a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0-10 (0 = easy, 10 = impossible), participants answered 10 questions assessing their ability in completing normal daily activities or physically demanding activities. The BASFI score is a sum of the scores of the 10 questions. Total possible score range: 0-100, where higher score referred to higher impairment in the functional ability.</description>

The final BASDAI score averages the individual assessments for a final score range of 0-10.</description>

    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Index (BASRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, Month 60</time_frame>
    <description>BASRI- Radiographs of participants with AS were scored using the New York criteria for the sacroiliac joints on a scale of 2 to 4, the lumbar and cervical spine on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 = normal, 1 = suspicious, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe). These 3 scores were added together to produce the BASRI-spine (BASRI-s) score (range 2 to 12). Similarly, hip joints were scored on a scale of 0 to 4 to give BASRI-hip (BASRI-h). Sum of BASRI-s and BASRI-h produced BASRI-total (BASRI-t) score; total range 2 to 16, higher score represented worse health state.</description>

        <title>Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER)</title>
        <description>ICER: ratio of the incremental cost of treatment over the incremental effectiveness. Incremental cost = difference in cost between baseline and month 60. Effectiveness was defined as quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, i.e. difference in Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)- health state profile utility score between baseline and month 60. (EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.)</description>

        <description>BASRI- Radiographs of participants with AS were scored using the New York criteria for the sacroiliac joints on a scale of 2 to 4, the lumbar and cervical spine on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 = normal, 1 = suspicious, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe). These 3 scores were added together to produce the BASRI-spine (BASRI-s) score (range 2 to 12). Similarly, hip joints were scored on a scale of 0 to 4 to give BASRI-hip (BASRI-h). Sum of BASRI-s and BASRI-h produced BASRI-total (BASRI-t) score; total range 2 to 16, higher score represented worse health state.</description>

        <description>Radiographic score based on wassenberg consisted of 2 sub-scores, proliferation score (PS) assessing bone proliferation and destruction score (DS) assessing joint surface destruction. Score range for PS and DS was 0 to 160 (where higher score represented higher bone proliferation) and 0 to 200 (where higher score represented higher destruction), respectively. Total score = sum of PS and DS (range 0 to 360); higher score represented worse state.</description>

Each item scored on 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered.

        <title>Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D)- Health State Profile Utility Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. It assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
