  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae are bacteria which normally live in the upper respiratory tract of
      humans. However, these bacteria can also cause severe infectious diseases such as pneumonia,
      septicemia and meningitis. Elderly subjects are especially vulnerable to these infections,
      and the diseases can result in death. The currently available licensed Streptococcus
      pneumoniae vaccine is recommended for prevention of pneumococcal diseases in individuals over
      the age of 65. However, the antibody level elicited by this vaccine, is not always
      satisfactory in elderly people. To overcome the problem, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals is
      currently developing candidate vaccines that are hoped to work better than the currently
      available vaccines. As a first step in this development, the present study is being conducted
      in order to evaluate the immune response to the currently marketed vaccine.

    <textblock>
      Since influenza vaccination is recommended in the age range of the study population, Fluarix™
      (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) vaccine will be offered free of charge for the study period (3
      consecutive years), to be used by Investigators according to national vaccination
      schedule/practice.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned
