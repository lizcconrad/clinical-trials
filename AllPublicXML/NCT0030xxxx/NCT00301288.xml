    <textblock>
      Patients with aggressive Non−Hodgkin−lymphoma treated at first diagnosis with chemotherapy
      alone or combined chemo-radiotherapy can achieve high response rates. However, patients with
      relapsed lymphoma still have a poor prognosis. High dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the treatment of choice for these patients. An
      ASCT allows patients to receive much higher doses of chemotherapy than usual, to improve the
      chances of curing the disease. The high−dose of chemotherapy destroys the cells in the
      patients bone marrow and then the patients own cells from either the bone marrow or
      peripheral blood are used to rescue the patient from intensive treatment. High−dose
      chemotherapy with autologous stem cell (either bone marrow or peripheral blood)
      transplantation is used in the treatment of Intermediate/High grade NHL with poor risk
      disease and in second remission at the Royal Marsden Hospital.

      The purpose of the present analysis is to determine independent prognostic factors correlated
      with the long−term outcome of patients with NHL who received an ASCT between January 1991 and
      June 2005. Accrual of eligible patients currently under follow−up will be performed in clinic
      at the time of next appointment. All patients accrued will give informed consent to
      participate in the study for retrospective case note review, after discussion with a study
      investigator and after receiving a study information sheet. The results of the analysis will
      be published in a peer−reviewed medical journal. This will include patients treated at the
      royal Marsden Hospital only.
