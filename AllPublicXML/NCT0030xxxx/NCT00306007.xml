    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the reliability, validity, and acceptability of the
      London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) in a U.S. population of women. The researchers
      hypothesize that the LMUP will be acceptable to a U.S. population and will be reliable and
      valid.

      The concept of &quot;unplanned pregnancy&quot; is used frequently in health research and policy. The
      majority of tools used to assess unplanned pregnancy planning have not been validated.
      Recently the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) has been developed and validated.
      The LMUP had been found to be valid and reproducible, but has not been studied outside of the
      United Kingdom. If we are able to validate this measure in a U.S. population, its use in
      studies will improve the quality of data about family planning in U.S. women.
