  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Binding Potential in subjects with
      ADHD and adults without ADHD: the intent being to demonstrate that C-11 Altropane PET can be
      used to differentiate adults with ADHD from healthy control subjects.

      This protocol seeks to replicate and extend our investigation of DAT binding in adults with
      ADHD with specific aims:

        1. To examine dopamine transporter (DAT) receptor binding potential in adults with ADHD,
           using PET scanning with 11C altropane as the ligand. We hypothesize that compared to
           adults without ADHD, adults with ADHD will have greater DAT binding that will not be
           accounted by psychiatric comorbidity or age.

        2. To examine the relationship of DAT binding to clinical features of ADHD. We hypothesize
           that DAT binding will be positively correlated with a) severity of ADHD symptoms and b)
           neuropsychological and interpersonal dysfunction.

        3. To examine the relationship between DAT binding and genetic risk factors. We hypothesize
           that DAT binding will be specifically associated with homozygosity of the DAT (480) gene
           in adults with ADHD and not with other ADHD-associated genetic markers (e.g., DRD4-7,
           D2, DBH).
