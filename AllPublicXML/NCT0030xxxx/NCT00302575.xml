  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine whether improved integration between the
      community supervision system and outpatient addiction treatment system can improve treatment
      adherence, drug use and public safety outcomes among drug-involved inmates re-entering the
      community.

      The target population consists of male and female parolees with a history of substance abuse
      treatment who are at moderate-to-high-risk of recidivism. They will recruited from in the
      criminal justice system and/or transitional residential drug treatment within one or two
      months of release or at the time they first report for parole supervision.

      Participants from six states (KY, OR, RI, CT, VA, DE) will be randomized into the Step'n Out
      condition (integration of community supervision and addiction treatment with behavioral
      management) or a comparison condition including traditional community supervision and
      addiction treatment. Research interviews at baseline, and 3 and 9 months after release from
      confinement will assess study participants' outcomes.

      The Step'n Out intervention will produce significantly better outcomes than the standard
      referral condition with respect to: recidivism rates (revocation, rearrest on a new charge,
      reconviction, reincarceration), as assessed 3 and 9 months after the end of the intervention;
      treatment participation (i.e., proportion of planned sessions attended, proportion of planned
      days retained in treatment, type of discharge [successful completion, transfer to another
      program, elopement, administrative discharge, return to custody], as assessed after the end
      of the intervention; self-reported drug use, criminal activity, and psychosocial functioning,
      as assessed 3 and 12 months after the end of the intervention; cost-effectiveness;
      collaboration between the supervision officer and treatment counselor ; and therapeutic
      alliance with the clients.
