  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed phase II trial will investigate the combination of irinotecan, carboplatin and
      bevacizumab along with radiation in the treatment of patients with limited-stage SCLC. This
      study differs from our &quot;maintenance&quot; bevacizumab trial in that bevacizumab will begin with
      the initial chemotherapy treatment. Irinotecan/platinum regimens are emerging as standard
      treatments for patients with extensive-stage disease. Adding a novel minimally toxic agent to
      this regimen up front may further enhance this doublet's efficacy without contributing to
      toxicity. This trial will be one of the first clinical trials to evaluate a combination of
      targeted therapy and chemotherapy in the up front treatment of a common solid tumor.

      Eligible patients will receive 4 courses of irinotecan, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.
      Radiation therapy will begin concurrently with the third course of systemic treatment. The
      intervals between chemotherapy courses will be 28 days.Patients will be completely restaged
      approximately 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy prior to beginning treatment with
      maintenance bevacizumab. Those with progressive tumor or serious toxicity will come off
      study. Those with stable disease or objective tumor responses will continue treatment with
      restaging every 12 weeks for a minimum of 6 cycles (6 months).

        -  Induction chemotherapy regimen Irinotecan: 60mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, and 15 Carboplatin:
           AUC=4 day 1 only Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV days 1, 15 Cycles are repeated every 28 days
           for four courses

        -  Radiation therapy 1.8 Gy, single daily fractions, concurrently with the third course of
           chemotherapy e to a total dose of 61.2 Gy (34 fractions). Patients obtaining complete
           remission or near complete remission will also receive prophylactic whole brain
           radiotherapy, given within one month after all therapy is completed (total dose 24Gy in
           2Gy daily fractions).

        -  Maintenance Bevacizumab Bevacizumab alone at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV days 1 and 15 each
           cycle, for a maximum of 6 additional cycles (6 months) with restaging every 12 weeks.
