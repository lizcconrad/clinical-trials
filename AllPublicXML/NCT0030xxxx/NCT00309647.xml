  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the leading contender for the next pandemic of influenza is H5N1, a strain of avian
      virus. Prevention and control of a pandemic will depend on the rapid production and worldwide
      distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. Candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines must be
      developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the most optimal formulation and the
      best vaccination schedule.This study is designed to test in healthy adults aged between 18-60
      years the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one and two administrations of a candidate
      pandemic H5N1 vaccine formulated from Whole Virus. The vaccines contain different antigen
      doses. For each dose, adjuvanted vaccine will be compared to the plain vaccine in order to
      detect the optimal formulation for immunization against the H5N1 influenza strain.
