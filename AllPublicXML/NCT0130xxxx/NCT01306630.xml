  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study of tivozanib administered in
      combination with capecitabine. During the dose-escalation portion, sequential cohorts of
      subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in order to establish the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is not reached, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be
      determined. In the expansion cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast or
      colon cancer will be enrolled at MTD (or RP2D) to further evaluate safety and activity of
      this combination in these tumor types.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of orally administered
      tivozanib in combination with capecitabine to approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid
      tumors and, in the expanded MTD cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast
      or colorectal cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic, and antineoplastic
      activity. The number of cohorts evaluated and the maximum doses to be administered will
      depend upon the observed tolerability. Dose level &quot;0&quot;, tivozanib HCl 1.5 mg and capecitabine
      1000 mg/m² BID, is the starting dose level. Once assigned to a cohort, each subject will
      continue to be treated at the same dose level and schedule throughout the course of the
      study.

    <description>Disease and response assessments will be determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.0). Disease assessment is to include disease classification, tumor marker assessments, and diagnostic imaging / measurement of marker lesions.
