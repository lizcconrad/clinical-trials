  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial to test the usefulness of a brief intervention to
      improve adherence to antidepressant medication prescribed to older adults in a primary care
      setting. Study will be conducted at Weill Cornell and University of Michigan.

    <textblock>
      The intervention is a brief, psychosocial intervention designed to be an adjunct to
      pharmacotherapy prescribed by a primary care physician. It includes psychoeducation, problem
      solving and development of goals and a personalized adherence strategy. The intervention
      includes three 30 minute sessions during the first 6 weeks of treatment and a follow-up phone
      call two weeks later.

    <time_frame>12 week Follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants randomized to the TIP intervention will be significantly more likely to be adherent (take more than 80% of prescribed doses) to antidepressant treatment at 6-week follow-up (immediately after the intervention is completed) and 12-week follow-up (6 weeks after intervention is completed) as compared to older adults randomized to the Treatment as usual control condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants randomized to the TIP intervention will have a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms (on the HDRS) from baseline to the 6-week, 12-week and 24-week follow-ups than older adults who are randomized to the treatment as usual control condition.</description>

    <description>The TIP program is a brief, individualized intervention designed as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for depression prescribed by a primary care physician. The key to the intervention is the involvement of the older adult in creating an adherence strategy tailored to his/her barriers and needs.</description>
