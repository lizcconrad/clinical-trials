    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, multi-center trial to demonstrate an
      inequality between IVUS-guided versus angiography-guided implantation of everolimus-eluting
      stents(EES) at long lesions(&gt; 28 mm) in clinical outcomes at 12 months as a primary objective
      and safety of 6- month dual antiplatelet therapy following EES implantation in comparison
      with a 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy.

      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of IVUS guidance on the
      clinical outcomes after implantation of DES at long lesions &gt; 28 mm.
