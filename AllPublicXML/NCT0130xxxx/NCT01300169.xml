  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of new clinical intervention (the
      &quot;Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality--CAMS&quot;) versus enhanced care as usual
      for suicidal Soldiers who are seen at outpatient mental health clinics at Ft. Stewart GA.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial of 148 suicidal active-duty US Army Soldiers.
      Participants were randomized to on-site providers who were trained in the Collaborative
      Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) vs. providers doing their own routine
      care--referred to as Enhanced Care as Usual (E-CAU) within an outpatient military treatment
      center. The CAMS Rating Scale (CRS) was used to reliably verify fidelity between treatment
      conditions and the adherence by CAMS providers to the model. Participants received informed
      consent to be randomly assigned to treatment arm and were ask to complete study assessments
      at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the start of treatment. Recruitment is
      complete and all study assessments were completed as of March 2016. The study is in a second
      year of no cost extension; outcome data analyses and moderator analyses are currently
      underway to develop manuscripts for submission to peer-review scientific journals.
