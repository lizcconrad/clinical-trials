  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, the sponsor conducted an observational study, entitled as &quot;Nationwide Assessment of
      Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Blood Pressure, Blood Lipid, and Blood Glucose, in Chinese
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes - 3B Study &quot; which was to evaluate the level of cardiovascular
      diseases (CVD) risk factor control and its regional difference in China. As a continuation,
      this extension of the 3B Study is designed to assess the incidence of cardiovascular events,
      cardio-renal events, and other microvascular complications, in 1, 2 and 3 years in patients
      with type 2 diabetes and with high risk of (CVD) with or without existing or history of
      coronary artery diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited by its cross sectional design, 3B study was not be able to provide any information on
      how various patterns of treatment and prescribing behaviors would impact the outcomes of
      prevention of cardiovascular and cardio-renal diseases in type 2 diabetes longitudinally.
      This information, however, would be crucial in better guiding the real world medical practice
      and maximizing the effectiveness of medical treatment for better controlling cardiovascular
      risk factors.

      The 3B Extension study is thus designed to extend the 3B study by continuing to follow up on
      enrolled patients for 3 years. The 3B Extension study is expected to demonstrate the clinical
      outcomes of nationally representative type 2 diabetes patients who are treated by
      endocrinologists, cardiologists and nephrologists separately in all tiers of hospitals, as
      measured by diabetes progression, incidence of cardiovascular complications, and incidence of
      microvascular complications. It will be the first study of this scale in China based on its
      exclusivity, extensiveness, and the level of government and national thought leaders'
      support. It will be conducted in collaboration with the advisory board of China
      Cardiometabolic Registries (CCMR).
