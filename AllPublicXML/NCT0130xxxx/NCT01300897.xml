  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback therapy improves bowel symptoms and anorectal function in patients with
      dyssynergic defecation, however its mechanism of action is not known. The investigators
      hypothesize that biofeedback therapy enhances gut-brain-gut communication by altering
      cortical processing of information and improving cortically mediated neuromuscular function
      of the gut. However, in order to better understand these mechanisms in patients, the
      investigators need to examine and establish normative data and compare findings with healthy
      subjects. The investigators specific aims are to examine and evaluate the following 40 normal
      subjects; (1) To evaluate the afferent cortical evoked potentials in response to the
      electrical stimulation of the anorectum and (2) To evaluate the corticofugal tracts
      (efferent) by recording the anal and rectal electromyographic responses following noninvasive
      lumbosacral and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

    <description>Measurements &amp; Analysis: The latency, inter-peak latency and amplitude of each component of the cortical evoked potentials will be averaged to obtain group mean data.
Statistical Analysis: The paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to compare the latencies.
Lumbosacral and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Data and Statistical Analysis: Mean latency and mean amplitude for each individual will be calculated.</description>
