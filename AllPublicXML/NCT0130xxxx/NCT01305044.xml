  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons over age 65 years constitute a large and growing population of cancer survivors.
      Available data indicate that both short- and long-term female breast cancer survivors report
      more limitations related to strength and mobility than women with cancers of other sites and
      women without a personal history of cancer. Further, better mental health among breast cancer
      survivors has been shown to protect against physical decline and overall quality of life. The
      combination of mental and physical interventions may result in substantial improvements in
      quality of life. Tai Chi Chih (TCC), a form of mind-body exercise, is one such intervention.
      TCC may be particularly suited toward elderly breast cancer survivors with impaired physical
      and/or mental functioning, yet despite its increasing popularity and benefits in healthy and
      diseased populations, its benefits have never been scientifically evaluated in this
      population. The overarching goal of this study is to conduct preparatory work regarding the
      effects of TCC on quality of life and physical function that will underpin future definitive
      trials of TCC in elderly cancer survivors. As part of this 12-week trial, participants will
      be randomized to a TCC or a health education control group (HEC). Establishment of meaningful
      interventions that facilitate a more positive cancer survival experience in old age is an
      important issue; there are substantial public health and clinical benefits should a TC
      intervention be successful in this patient population.

    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36v1 Health Survey assesses quality of life and produces mental and physical component summary scores, with a score range of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item perceived stress scale produces a summation score. Scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating more stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of Events Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>13-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Event Scale assesses cancer-specific distress. Each item is scored 0 (not at all), 1 (rarely), 3 (sometimes)or 5 (often), with the higher scores reflecting more stressful impact. It has a total score and two subscales (avoidance &amp; intrusion). The two subscales are scored by summing their corresponding items and the total score is the sum of two subscales. The scores for the intrusive subscale range from 0 to 35, and scores for the avoidance subscale range from 0 to 40. The Total Score ranges from 0-75, with higher scores reflecting more stressful impact.</description>

    <time_frame>13-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Five-Facet Mindfulness questionnaire produces a total score and five facet subscales (observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, &amp; nonreactivity). These are summation scores, and the scores range from 8 to 40 (except for the nonreactivity facet which ranges from 7 to 35). Higher scores indicate more mindfulness. The Total Score ranges from 39-195, with higher scores indicating more mindfulness.</description>

    <time_frame>13-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Five saliva samples (awakening, 30 minutes after awakening, noon, 5pm, &amp; 10pm) were collected on a weekend day at one week after class completion. Cortisol was measured in nmol/L. Cortisol AUC was calculated using the five timepoints with the trapezoid rule. The groups were compared at post-intervention on their log transformed cortisol AUC controlling for baseline cortisol and reported as adjusted means. Four participants with high cortisol profiles across the five collection times (with suspected contamination from gum bleeding) and participants whose collection time was beyond a one hour window were excluded.</description>

    <description>Fasting blood samples were collected in the morning for inflammatory cytokines. Prior to blood draws, we ensured that participants did not experience illness or fever at the time of the blood draw. The assayed cytokines included pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL)-12, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4.</description>

    <description>Tai Chi Chih (TCC), a westernized and manualized form of the ancient TC Chuan, consists of a series of 20 simple, repetitive, non-strenuous movements that involve no physical contact and emphasize a soft, flowing continuity of motion. This form of meditation through movement consists of a standardized protocol that emphasizes slow, fluid, continuous forms that integrate mental concentration, awareness, balance, shifting of body weight, gentle movement, imagery, muscle relaxation and breathing control. TCC was developed for use with elderly persons.</description>

Each item is scored 0 (not at all), 1 (rarely), 3 (sometimes)or 5 (often), with the higher scores reflecting more stressful impact. It has a total score and two subscales (avoidance &amp; intrusion). The two subscales are scored by summing their corresponding items and the total score is the sum of two subscales. The scores for the intrusive subscale range from 0 to 35, and scores for the avoidance subscale range from 0 to 40.

        <title>Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Five-Facet Mindfulness questionnaire produces a total score and five facet subscales (observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, &amp; nonreactivity). These are summation scores, and the scores range from 8 to 40 (except for the nonreactivity facet which ranges from 7 to 35). Higher scores indicate more mindfulness. The Total Score ranges from 39-195, with higher scores indicating more mindfulness.</description>

This form of meditation through movement consists of a standardized protocol that emphasizes slow, fluid, continuous forms that integrate mental concentration, awareness, balance, shifting of body weight, gentle movement, imagery, muscle relaxation and breathing control.

        <description>Five saliva samples (awakening, 30 minutes after awakening, noon, 5pm, &amp; 10pm) were collected on a weekend day at one week after class completion. Cortisol was measured in nmol/L. Cortisol AUC was calculated using the five timepoints with the trapezoid rule. The groups were compared at post-intervention on their log transformed cortisol AUC controlling for baseline cortisol and reported as adjusted means. Four participants with high cortisol profiles across the five collection times (with suspected contamination from gum bleeding) and participants whose collection time was beyond a one hour window were excluded.</description>

        <population>Power calculations indicated that a sample size of 42 would be sufficient to detect 15 point change in SF-36, with 88% power at 5% significance level. Analysis were per protocol because the sample size was too small for imputation techniques and there was no follow-up data on withdrawn participants for intent-to-treat analysis.</population>

            <description>Tai Chi Chih : Tai Chi Chih (TCC), a westernized and manualized form of the ancient TC Chuan, consists of a series of 20 simple, repetitive, non-strenuous movements that involve no physical contact and emphasize a soft, flowing continuity of motion. This form of meditation through movement consists of a standardized protocol that emphasizes slow, fluid, continuous forms that integrate mental concentration, awareness, balance, shifting of body weight, gentle movement, imagery, muscle relaxation and breathing control. TCC was developed for use with elderly persons.</description>
