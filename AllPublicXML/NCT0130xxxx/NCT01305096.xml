  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inversions (specific yoga postures in which
      the heart is higher than the head) and other dynamic and static yoga postures affect heart
      rate variability, oxygen uptake, blood pressure, blood parameters and other objective
      measures of health, and a variety of subjective and objective measures of health in female
      and male individuals in Sweden.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial involving 44 male and females in Sweden will investigate
      whether yoga inversions and semi-inversions and other dynamic and static yoga postures will
      affect the following variables: heart rate variability, oxygen uptake, anthropometric
      variables, common symptoms in general practice, sleepiness, sleep quality and
      recovery/recuperation after sleep, blood pressure, blood lipids, blood proteins, blood sugar,
      salivary cortisol, hand grip strength, relaxation and recovery perceived stress, self-rated
      health, rating of perceived exertion, satisfaction with life, and work-family conflict.

      Participants will be divided into an intervention group and a passive control group. The
      intervention group will participate in six to ten weeks of yoga classes. The classes will be
      held 1-2 times a week for approximately one hour each and will include yoga poses and
      breathing techniques. The control group will not participate in any intervention but will
      conduct their lives as usual.

      The variables will be assessed at baseline; at the end of the intervention; and three, six,
      and twelve months after the end of the intervention.

    <measure>Change in heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of the 8-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the change in this variable over time. The first measurement will be at baseline and the second at the end of the 8-week intervention (main measurement). If and only if there are effects after the 8-week intervention, we will follow up the participants at various intervals to determine how long the effects are sustained. These follow-ups will be conducted 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the end of the intervention.</description>
