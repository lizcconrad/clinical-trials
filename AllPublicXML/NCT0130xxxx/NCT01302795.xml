  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective open label evaluation of Canakinumab (Ilaris) for treatment of
      subjects with pyoderma gangrenosum.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of the study (week 0), all patients will receive one subcutaneous injection of
      150mg Canakinumab. Patients are then going to be examined at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16.

      At 2 weeks, all patients are going to be evaluated for response by Physician's global
      assessment (PGA) of the target lesion. Patients with PGA 0-1 are not going to receive another
      injection at this timepoint, while patients with PGA 2-4 are going to receive another 150mg
      Canakinumab.

      At 4 weeks, in case of PGA 4, patients are going to be offered a first or second line drug as
      an alternative therapy (corticosteroids, cyclosporin A or infliximab, dosage see below
      &quot;Alternative therapy in case of missing response&quot;) and stay within the trial (due to the long
      half-life of canakinumab) until week 8.

      At week 8, patients with PGA 0 receive another 150mg Canakinumab only, and patients with PGA
      4 are not going to receive additional study drug, but are strongly encouraged to attend
      following medical visits for observation until the end of the study and/or switch to a first
      or second line drug as alternative therapy (see below). All other patients with PGA 1-3
      receive the total accumulative dose of Canakinumab that they had received on week 0 and 2,
      namely 150 or 300mg.

      The study duration for each individual is going to be 16 weeks. At week 8 and 16, safety
      laboratory investigations with blood differential (Neutrophil granulocytes, monocytes,
      eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, thrombocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin), AST, ALT, y-GT,
      AP, Bilirubin (total), Creatinine, Na, K, CRP are going to be determined.

    <description>The primary response parameter change of the physician global assessment (PGA) 5-point scale at week 2, 4, 8, 16 as compared to week 0 :
0= Total resolution of target ulcer with no signs of active PG
Almost completely healed target ulcer with only minimal signs of active PG
Evidence of target ulcer healing which involves at least 50% of ulcer/ulcer margin
Evidence of target ulcer healing which involves less than 50% of ulcer/ulcer margin
No evidence of target healing ulcer</description>

    <measure>Change in surface area of the target lesion of pyoderma gangrenosum</measure>

    <description>As secondary parameter, the change in surface area of the target lesion of pyoderma gangrenosum at week 2, 4, 8, 16 as compared to week 0 will be assessed by measuring the two-dimensional surface by tracing the border of the lesions on transparent foil as well as with Canfield photography.</description>

             location

          4. Diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum as confirmed by clinical and histological
             examination (see exclusion criteria). In case of doubt, a steering committee
             consisting of experts of the participating centers is going to evaluate whether
