        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adults, 18 to 49 years of age;

          -  Healthy as judged by the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee and determined by
             medical history, physical examination, vital signs, screening laboratories and medical
             history conducted no more than 30 days prior to study vaccine administration;

          -  BMI of ≥ 18 and ≤ 32;

          -  Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period and ability to attend scheduled visits;

          -  Accessible by telephone on a consistent basis;

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, competence and willingness to provide written,
             informed consent for participation after reading the informed consent form. The
             subject must have adequate opportunity to discuss the study with an Investigator or
             qualified designee;

          -  Showing a HI titer &lt; 1/40 for the swine-origin A/California/07/2009 H1N1-like X-179A
             strain in sera during the screening period;

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, have a negative serum pregnancy test result
             prior vaccination. Female who are post menopausal (no spotting at all) for at least 2
             years will not require a pregnancy test;

          -  If female and capable of childbearing, has been consistently using effective birth
             control for the 28 days prior to vaccination. An example of highly effective birth
             control is oral contraceptives, hormone implants, abstinence (confirmed by
             Investigator), or male condom plus spermicide. All female and of childbearing
             potential, must provide a serum sample for pregnancy screening. Female of child
             bearing potential (except subjects in a same sex relationship) must agree to continue
             employing adequate birth control measures for at least 60 days post vaccination and
             must have no plan to become pregnant for at least 60 days post vaccination;

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness.
        &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

          1. Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study vaccine
             administration;

          2. Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to study vaccine
             administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage
             adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or

          3. Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event
             within one month prior to study vaccine administration;

               -  Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use
                  or drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject
                  incompetent to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety
                  observations and reporting;

               -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency
                  including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B or
                  C, or the presence of lymphoproliferative disease;

               -  Presence of any febrile illness, oral temperature of &gt; 38.0˚C (100.4˚F) within 24
                  hours prior to randomization. Such subjects may be re-evaluated for randomization
                  after resolution of illness;

               -  History of autoimmune disease;

               -  Administration of any vaccine (including any other influenza vaccine) within a 30
                  day period prior to study enrollment, or planned administration within the period
                  from the first vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 21 or within 30 days prior
                  to blood sampling at Day 201. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus and
                  diphtheria toxoids adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the
                  vaccine is not administered within two weeks prior to study vaccine
                  administration. Receipt of any other emergency immunizations (e.g. rabies) will
                  result in a case-by-case review by the medical monitor of continued
                  participation;

               -  Use of any investigational or non-marketed product within 30 days prior to study
                  enrollment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate
                  in any other investigational or marketed drug study while participating in this
                  study;

               -  Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone

                  total, within one month of first study vaccine administration, or any other
                  cytotoxic or immunosuppressant drug within three months of vaccination.

               -  Use of any immune globulin product

               -  Use of high dose inhaled steroids or oral and parenteral high dose steroid
                  medications. Nasal steroids are allowed. Any significant disorder of coagulation
                  or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic
                  anti-platelet medications, e.g., low-dose aspirin [eg&lt;/= 325 mg/day (1 regular
                  adult aspirin) or &lt;/= 81 mg/day (1 baby aspirin)], and without a clinically
                  apparent bleeding tendency are eligible;

                  the past year, prior to randomization;

               -  Have a rash, dermatological condition or tattoos which may interfere with
                  injection site reaction rating;

               -  Have received a blood transfusion within 90 days prior to vaccination;

               -  If female, either known pregnancy or urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
                  (ß-hCG) test results consistent with pregnancy during the screening period and
                  prior to study vaccine administration on Day 0;

               -  Female subjects who are lactating;

               -  Any vital sign abnormalities: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
