  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Sorafenib is a drug that has been approved to treat kidney and liver cancer (hepatocellular
      carcinoma, or HCC) and has been shown to prolong survival in patients with HCC. It works by
      slowing the spread of cancer cells, but it does not fully prevent the cancer from growing
      again. Researchers are interested in combining sorafenib with the experimental drug TRC105,
      which has been designed to block the growth of blood vessels that lead to tumor growth, in
      order to determine whether this drug combination stops tumor growth and reduces tumor size
      better than sorafenib alone.

      Objectives:

      To determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of sorafenib and TRC105 as a
      treatment for hepatocellular cancer that has not responded to other treatments.

      Eligibility:

      Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer that
      has not responded to other treatments, and who are not considered to be candidates for liver
      transplantation. Patients cannot be receiving anticoagulant therapy with the exception of low
      dose aspirin. No history of bleeding problems or peptic ulcer disease.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and
      urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy or provide
      previously collected tumor tissue for study. An examination of the esophagus to look for
      problems with blood vessels will be completed in patients with a history of cirrhosis.

      Participants will receive sorafenib tablets twice every day, in the morning and at night,
      with a full glass of water.

      Participants will receive TRC 105 infusions once every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day
      cycle.

      At each visit during the first cycle, participants will have a physical examination and blood
      tests. Participants will continue to have blood tests and a urine test every cycle to monitor
      the effects of treatment, including tests of kidney function. Participants will have imaging
      studies after every two cycles to evaluate the results of treatment, and may also provide
      tumor samples for study.

      Treatment will continue as long as the tumor does not grow and side effects remain tolerable.

      Background:

        -  Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a
           median survival of 6-9 months. The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) study
           established sorafenib as a standard consideration in this disease and set the bar for
           future studies of systemic therapy.

        -  TRC105 is a chimeric anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody that binds cluster of
           differentiation 105 (CD105), a transmembrane receptor selectively expressed by
           proliferating endothelial cells. TRC105 binds to CD105-expressing endothelial cells and
           mediates growth inhibition, apoptosis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
           (ADCC).

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  Phase I: To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRC105 when given with
           standard-dose sorafenib for HCC.

        -  Phase II:To determine the estimate response rate according to Response Evaluation
           Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for the combination of TRC105 with sorafenib
           in HCC.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC.

        -  Childs-Pugh A or B (7 points) cirrhosis is allowed.

        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection,
           radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation.

        -  In phase I, prior systemic therapy is allowed.

        -  In phase II, prior systemic therapy for HCC (including sorafenib) is allowed.

        -  No history of bleeding varices in previous 1 year (unless subsequent liver transplant).

        -  No anti-coagulation (except low-dose aspirin).

      Design:

        -  TRC105 will be administered intravenously every two weeks, on days 1 and 15 of each 28
           day cycle. Sorafenib will be self-administered twice daily by mouth.

        -  Phase 1: The first part of this study was a standard 3+3 dose escalation phase I study
           with the primary objective of establishing MTD for TRC105 when given in combination with
           standard-dose sorafenib. Sorafenib is taken orally at a dose of 400 mg twice daily.
           TRC105 is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. Patients will be
           restaged including imaging studies to assess for response and progression every 8 weeks.
           The TRC105 dose was escalated in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients up to a maximum of 15 mg/kg
           every two weeks. Intra-patient dose escalation was not allowed.

        -  Phase II: TRC105 will be administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks at the
           recommended phase II dose, 15 mg/kg of TRC105 ever two weeks in combination with
           standard dose sorafenib, defined in phase I. The sample size and interim stopping rule
           will be determined using a Simon optimal two-stage design. The first stage will
           initially enroll 6 evaluable patients, and if 0 of the 6 have a clinical response, then
           no further patients will be accrued. If 1 or more of the first 6 patients has a clinical
           response, then accrual would continue until a total of 23 patients have been enrolled.
           As it may take several weeks to determine if a patient has experienced a response, a
           temporary pause in the accrual may be necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second
           stage is warranted. If there are 1 to 2 clinical responses in 23 patients, this would be
           an uninterestingly low response rate. If there were 3 or more complete responses in 23
           patients (13.0%), this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in
           later trials. Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), the probability of early
           termination is 73.5%.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Stable Disease, Partial Response, and Progressive Disease on Phase I and Phase II of the Clinical Trial</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks, up to 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. To be assigned a confirmed PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.

             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Proteinuria, as demonstrated by a 24-hour protein of greater than or equal to 2000 mg.
             Urine protein will be screened by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC). For UPC ratio
             greater than 1.0, a 24-hour urine protein will need to be obtained and the level
             should be less than 2000 mg for patient enrollment.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, hypertension
             (systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 140, diastolic BP greater than 90), ongoing
             or active systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  No anti-coagulation therapy is allowed with the exception of low-dose aspirin.

          -  No bleeding diathesis.

          -  Patients with a history of bleeding varices in previous 1 year are excluded (unless
             patient has subsequently had a liver transplant. Those with gastric varices or varices
             that are deemed as high risk by the endoscopist should be placed on appropriate
             medical therapy as advised by the gastroenterologist.

          -  History of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis within 6 months of TRC105 administration,
             unless patient has received adequate treatment for peptic ulcer disease and has
             evidence of complete resolution documented by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Mild
             gastritis is allowed.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) greater than 500 msec

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy
             are excluded from this study due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions
             between antiretroviral medications and sorafenib or TRC105. HIV positive patients not
             receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that sorafenib or
             TRC105 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may
             obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to sorafenib or TRC105.

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to human or mouse antibody products

          -  Patients with a history of familial bleeding disorders

          -  Patients with a history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber- Rendu
             Syndrome).

          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding are exclusion factors. Enrolled patients must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry, the duration of study participation and 3 months after the end
             of the treatment.

          -  Patients with unhealed wounds for more than 30 days.

          <description>Hepatitis B virus is a viral infection that affects the liver. Hepatitis C virus is a virus spread by infected blood (e.g. share needles). Crytogenic means the cause of the disease is unknown. Hematochromatosis is an iron disorder in which the body has an excess of iron in the blood.</description>

          <title>Baseline Child Pugh Score</title>
          <description>The Modified Child-Pugh classifies the severity of liver disease according to the degree of ascites, plasma concentrations of bilirubin and albumin, the prothrombin time and degree of encephalopathy. A total score of 5-6 is considered grade A (well-compensated disease); 7-9 grade B (significant functional compromise) and 10-15 is grade C (decompensated disease). NA = not all patients had cirrhosis. You only do a Pugh Score if cirrhosis is present.</description>

          <title>Prior Therapies</title>
          <description>Of note, some patients received more than one prior therapeutic intervention. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is performed to restrict blood flow. Ablation is a procedure to destroy cardiac tissue. Radioembolization is a combination of embolization and radiation therapy to treat liver cancer. Locoregional is a recurrence of cancer at the same original site of disease. Transplant refers to a liver transplant.</description>

DLT criteria included treatment-related grade 3 non-hematological toxicities or grade 4 hematological toxicities occurring within the first 28 days of treatment. Grade 3 electrolyte toxicities to be corrected to Grade 1 or less within 24 hours will be considered dose limiting (proteinuria &gt;3.5g/24 hour will be defined as a DLT). Drug-related Grade 4 hematological toxicity will be considered dose limiting. Toxicity requiring a dose reduction or a delay in treatment for &gt;7 days will be considered dose limiting. Other Grade 3 or higher toxicity related to TRC105 will be considered dose limiting.</description>

        <description>PFS was calculated from the on-study date until date of progression, death, or an event that would render the patient inevaluable for further follow-up (liver dysfunction), or end of study. Probabilities were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progressive disease was measured by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>

        <description>Response is defined as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. To be assigned a confirmed PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
