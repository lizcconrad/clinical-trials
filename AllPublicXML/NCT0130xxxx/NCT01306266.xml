      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of rizatriptan for treating
      attacks of chronic post-traumatic headache.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic post-traumatic headaches develop in about one third of soliders who have had head
      trauma caused by a blast. A wide variety of pain medicines, including rizatriptan, are used
      to treat these headaches in clinical practice. However, the effectiveness has not been
      established by clinical research studies.
