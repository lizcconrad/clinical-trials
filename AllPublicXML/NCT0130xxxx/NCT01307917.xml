  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the most common metabolic disease of childhood. Vascular disease is a leading
      complication of diabetes, and attempts to maintain close glycemic control do not prevent the
      sequelae that claim the lives and quality of life of millions of diabetics each year. Up to
      forty percent of patients with diabetes mellitus ultimately develop diabetic nephropathy, the
      most common cause of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis in the US. Flavonoid-rich
      diets are a promising intervention to prevent the endothelial dysfunction that apparently
      leads to this deadly complication. The mechanisms are still unclear but probably involve
      nitric oxide synthesis. The investigators hypothesize that early maintenance of the integrity
      of renal vasculature will significantly improve the lifelong prognosis for patients with
      diabetes. Flavonoids with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities could be used to
      protect endothelial function, and together with good glycemic control, prevent the
      development and progression of nephropathy. The investigators aims are to:

        1. compare endothelial function by studying reactive hyperemia, nitric oxide, and
           proinflammatory factors in adolescents (12-21 years old) with diabetes versus healthy
           sex- and age-matched control subjects.

        2. identify early markers in urine for vascular endothelial injury.

        3. examine the effects of flavonoids on vascular function, urine nitric oxide, and
           proinflammatory factors in patients with diabetes mellitus.

      Our proposal is the first attempt to use flavonoids to treat endothelial dysfunction as a
      causative factor of nephropathy in a pediatric population with diabetes. The investigators
      plan to recruit 40 adolescents with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus and 40 healthy peers into a
      double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Peripheral arterial tonometry, a noninvasive
      method to assess vascular status, will be employed to study endothelial function in both
      groups. Measurements of renal nitric oxide synthesis will be assayed using a nitric oxide
      chemiluminescence analyzer. Urinary protein microarray analyses will be conducted to assess
      early markers of kidney inflammation. The array is a multiplex sandwich fluorescent
      immunoassay for the simultaneous quantification of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
      IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory
      protein-1-alpha and beta, and RANTES. The initial acute response and effect of 14 days of
      treatment with a flavonoid-rich capsulated supplement will be compared to a placebo. Study
      subjects will return for baseline assessments a week after the final flavonoid supplement to
      evaluate the sustainability of the response. Differences between group means for the measured
      variables before, during, and after the interventions will be tested for statistical
      significance using paired t-tests and nonparametric statistics. Univariate correlations will
      be calculated using Pearson's r.
