    <textblock>
      This pilot project proposes to monitor real-world alcohol use using a novel technology—cell
      phone videorecordings in conjunction with breathalyzer recordings—and to conduct a small
      randomized study of this technology for reinforcing alcohol abstinence. Individuals with
      frequent alcohol use (N = 30) will be asked to carry a study cell phone plus a handheld
      breathalyzer for one month. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: alcohol
      monitoring or alcohol monitoring plus contingency management. In both conditions, research
      assistants will telephone participants on their cell phone an average of 10 times per week to
      request submission of a breathalyzer sample using the video monitoring function on the cell
      phone. Samples will be time and date stamped, and the video containing the breathalyzer
      result will be sent to study staff via the cell phone. Participants will be compensated for
      each video recorded within one hour of receiving the prompt. Participants randomized to the
      contingency management condition will receive the same alcohol monitoring described above,
      and they will also receive reinforcement for each alcohol negative breath sample submitted
      within one hour of the prompt. Data from this pilot project will be useful for (1)
      determining the feasibility of assessing alcohol use in the natural environment via
      breathalyzers and cell phone technology, and (2) estimating effect sizes of a CM intervention
      that reinforces alcohol abstinence using breathalyzers and cell phone technology. In an
      exploratory manner, we will also evaluate the reliability and validity of the video
      monitoring procedure and trends toward changes in psychosocial functioning.

    <description>Research assistants will phone or text participants and request videorecordings of breathalyzer samples up to 21 times per week. Participants will receive compensation for each valid videorecording that occurs within the requested one-hour time frame, and bonus compensation each time all requested videorecordings are submitted within the timeframe over a 7-day period, and/or if &gt;90% of prompts are returned over the study period.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to this condition will receive the same monitoring schedule outlined above, plus the same payment for compliance. In addition, they will receive contingent reinforcement for submission of videorecordings that demonstrate negative breath alcohol samples. For each sample submitted that reads below the cut point, participants will receive vouchers for payment.</description>
