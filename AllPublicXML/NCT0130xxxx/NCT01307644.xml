  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Institutes of Health, &quot;obesity is one of the most daunting health
      challenges of the 21st century&quot;. Approximately 2/3 of all adults are overweight or obese.
      Efforts to abate the growing prevalence of obesity have not been successful. The Strategic
      Plan for NIH Obesity Research proposes preventing and treating obesity through lifestyle
      modification. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based
      intervention framed within the Health Promotion Model (HPM) in facilitating weight loss and
      maintenance through promotion of healthy eating and physical activity among an underserved,
      vulnerable population of overweight or obese rural women aged 40-69. During these years,
      women experience increases in peri- and post-menopausal health risks that are magnified if
      they are overweight or obese. Weight loss will reduce risks and enhance functional status as
      they age. Maintenance of weight loss will be emphasized. The Internet offers a way to reach
      isolated rural women who have limited options for weight loss guidance. PUBLIC HEALTH
      RELEVANCE: Obesity is recognized as a major and growing public health problem. While many
      weight loss programs have been successful in the short term, they have not been successful in
      helping to maintain weight loss.
