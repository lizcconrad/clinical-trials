  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of functional endometrial
      glands and stroma in ectopic locations outside the uterine cavity. The ectopic endometrial
      tissue responds to estradiol and other hormones similarly to the normal endometrium.
      Endometriosis is one of the most common benign gynecological conditions, as many as 5-10% of
      women in the reproductive age may be affected. In addition to pain which may be severe,
      subfertility is one of the typical problems associated with endometriosis and may be present
      in up to 40% of those affected. There is lack of a clear correlation between severity of pain
      and degree of compromised fertility. Different modes of treatment exist. Hormonal treatments
      are based on the suppression of estrogenic action on endometriosis as well as the
      endometrium. Unfortunately, discontinuation of the hormonal treatment typically results in a
      rapid recurrence of the disease. Surgery may alleviate the symptom for different lengths of
      time, however, curative treatment frequently involves hysterectomy with bilateral
      oophorectomy. In order to escape this radical treatment, new targeted therapy in the form of
      novel pharmacological agents would be of crucial importance. Presently, endometriosis can be
      reliably diagnosed only by laparoscopy. Since this is an invasive surgical procedure, new
      diagnostic tools would be warmly welcomed. Furthermore, as the progression of the disease is
      presently impossible to predict, new markers for the &quot;malignancy&quot; of each case are
      desperately needed.

      The aim of the investigators research is to identify expression of endometriosis specific
      RNAs/proteins. Evaluation of expression profiles in samples of endometriosis and endometrium
      of patients with careful clinical and surgical classification of endometriosis as well as
      healthy control women should initially enable to identify novel targets for new therapies and
      biomarkers. Furthermore, combined with an adequate follow up, the study should enable for
      example to identify markers for endometriosis associated infertility as well as cases where
      the disease progresses very rapidly. Different forms of effective treatment may thereafter be
      designed following the identification of such factors.
