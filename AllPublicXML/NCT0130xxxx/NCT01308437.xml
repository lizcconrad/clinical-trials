    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, parallel group comparison of the immunogenicity safety of
      Wockhardt's human insulin and isophane insulin compared with the Novo Nordisk's yeast based
      human insulin products (marketed in USA) in type 1 diabetics.

      There are two phases of the study, which are as follows:

        1. Phase 1 is a comparative phase in which there will be 2 arms (which are described in the
           section below).

        2. Phase 2 is a follow up phase only applicable to Wosulin Arm.

      The study will last for 54 weeks for the patients enrolled in Wosulin arm and approximately
      28 weeks for the patients enrolled in the comparator arm.

      Two hundred and forty two patients will be enrolled considering an estimated dropout rate of
      15% for a sample size of approximately 105 evaluable patients per arm. The total planned
      enrollment period for this study is approximately 3 months (90 days).
