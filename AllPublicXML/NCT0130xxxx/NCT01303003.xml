  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks are increasingly being performed after abdominal
      surgery to provide post operative analgesia. Dexamethasone has demonstrated an ability to
      prolong the effective duration of analgesia in several different peripheral nerve blocks. The
      study will examine, in a blinded, prospective and randomized fashion, whether the addition of
      dexamethasone to TAP blocks similarly prolongs blockade and pain relief. The study will
      compare local anesthetic with and without the addition of dexamethasone in the TAP block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be done in two phases. In the first phase, patients will be randomized to
      receive either 20 cc of 0.125% bupivicaine with or without 2 mg of dexamethasone on each side
      of their abdomen (40 cc and 4 mg in total) and patients who receive the dexamethasone will be
      compared with patients who did not receive it. In the second phase, we will assess whether
      patients can serve as their own controls by adding dexamethasone only to one side of the
      block (one side of the abdomen) and comparing pain relief/efficacy with the contra-lateral
      plain local anesthetic effect. The study will assess pain relief, opioid consumption, level
      of blockade, and operator's prospective assessment of likely efficacy, based on the
      ultrasound visualization of the local anesthetic injection as compared with actual efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patients, between ages 18-85 years old, undergoing Robot-assisted laparoscopic
             prostatectomy by a single surgeon at a single hospital.

          -  Subjects are physically and mentally able to participate in the study.

          -  Subjects are able to give fully informed consent to participating in this study after
             demonstrating good understanding of the risks and benefits of the proposed components
             of the TAP block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstrated hypersensitivity or allergy to local anesthetics or dexamethasone.

          -  Any subject whose anatomy, or surgical procedure, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might preclude the potential successful performance of a TAP block.

          -  Any subject, who in the opinion of the investigator, might be harmed or be a poor
             candidate for participation in the study.
