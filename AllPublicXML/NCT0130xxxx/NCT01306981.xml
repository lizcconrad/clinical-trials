  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of ranibizumab on patients undergoing vitrectomy surgery
      for the complications of diabetic retinopathy.

      Vitrectomy surgery can be difficult and bleeding after the operation can reduce vision for
      patients. Our hypothesis is that injection into the eye of ranibizumab one week before
      surgery will make the surgery easier, reduce complications and improve outcome.

      In this trial, patients will be randomly allocated to receive either ranibizumab injection or
      a placebo injection of saline. Neither the patient, their surgeon, nor the study
      investigators will know which they have received so that a fair comparison can be made.

      The RaDiVit study is a pilot randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      ranibizumab as an adjunct to diabetic vitrectomy surgery.

      Patients with complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy who require vitrectomy
      surgery will be recruited to this study. Baseline tests will be performed, including
      refracted visual acuity, B-scan ultrasound, OCT scanning, colour fundus photography and
      fundus fluorescein angiography. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either ranibizumab
      intravitreal injection or saline subconjunctival injection.

      One week later, surgery will be carried out. The baseline tests will be repeated on the day
      of surgery to examine for any discernible difference between the two groups one week after
      treatment. Surgery will be video recorded and detailed assessments of the operative details
      carried out.

      A vitreous sample and a paired serum sample will be taken at the time of surgery to compare
      levels of ranibizumab and related cytokines.

      Follow up visits will take place at six and twelve weeks. Assessments at that point will
      include:

        -  visual acuity

        -  OCT scan

        -  colour fundus photography and fundus fluorescein angiography
