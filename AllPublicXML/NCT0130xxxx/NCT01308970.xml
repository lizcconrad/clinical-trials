  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if participation in one of three different health
      management groups will elicit genomic and biochemical changes and decrease perceived stress
      levels and symptoms in healthy, stressed adults. The investigators expect that changes in
      self-reported psychological stress and symptoms will be directly linked to changes in
      biological indicators (genomic expression profiles and neuroendocrine and pro-inflammatory
      biomarkers).

      This randomized, controlled trial will determine the relative strength of correlation between
      changes in stress outcome measures (self-report questionnaire, genomic expression,
      biochemical assay) in moderately to severely stressed healthy subjects randomized to one of
      three health education interventions at both end-intervention and at a 6-month long-term
      follow-up. This study will also determine which of the different outcome measures exhibit the
      greatest degree of sensitivity, reliability and consistency at both end-intervention and
      long-term follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Stress is chronic and ongoing with no resolution of the stressors within the timeframe
             of the study, with a minimum prior duration of 6 months.

          -  Able to provide informed consent and to understand written and spoken English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Practice of yoga, meditation, guided imagery or other mind body techniques that elicit
             the RR, once per week for 45 min total or more within the last three months or less.

          -  Any current medical condition that would preclude their safe and effective practice of
             the yoga or meditation interventions.

          -  The presence of bipolar or psychotic disorders, or history of any other DSMIV Axis I
             disorder with active symptoms or treatment within the last 5 years, as determined by a
             structured clinical interview.

          -  Initiation of psychotherapy within 6 months of entering the study.

          -  Serious or unstable medical illness, including serious or unstable cardiovascular,
             hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurologic or hematologic disease.

          -  Patient deemed unable to complete protocol due to cognitive, psychiatric or other
             reasons.

          -  Pregnancy or planned conception over the course of the study (could confound biomarker
             values).

          -  Current use of the following medications: systemic corticosteroids, chronic (i.e.,
             more than 3 days per week) use of anti-inflammatories (e.g., ibuprofen; currently or
             within the last 3 months), immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapies (currently or
             within the last 12 months), and anabolic steroids.

          -  Current (within the last 6 months) psychoactive medications (e.g. antidepressants,
             mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, anxiolytics), with the exception of hypnotics, which
             will be permitted.
