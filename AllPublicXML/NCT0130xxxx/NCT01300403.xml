  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the acute physiological effects of expiration with the glottis
      open in lateral posture (ELTGOL) and Flutter valve in dynamic and static lung volumes in
      patients with bronchiectasis and, secondarily, to study the effect of these techniques in
      sputum production.

    <intervention_name>Flutter valve</intervention_name>
    <description>Flutter valve is a physiotherapy device commonly used for the treatment of pulmonary hypersecretive conditions. The patients is taught to exhale through the device, producing positive expiratory pressure and flow oscillations. In this study the intervention took 15 minutes. During this period the patients were free to cough.</description>

    <intervention_name>expiration with the glottis open in lateral posture (ELTGOL)</intervention_name>
    <description>This technique is a maneuver of slow expiration with the glottis open, with the subject in lateral posture. The patients performed three sets of 10 repetitions in left and right lateral decubitus.</description>

    <description>Patients were instructed to stay comfortably seated during 15 minutes. After this period they were stimulated to cough during a five minutes period.</description>
