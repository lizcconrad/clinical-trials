  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an intra-subject crossover comparative safety study to evaluate the effect of
      intravenous (IV) bolus injection of SonoVue on pulmonary hemodynamics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be divided into two groups based on their baseline mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure. Each subject will receive two injections in randomized order during right heart
      catheterization: one administration of SonoVue and one administration of placebo, either
      SonoVue followed by Placebo or Placebo followed by SonoVue. The purpose is to provide direct
      evidence on the presence or absence of pulmonary hemodynamic effect following IV
      administration of SonoVue versus any effects following IV administration of the same volume
      of placebo.

    <measure>Effects of SonoVue and Placebo on Pulmonary Hemodynamics: Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mmHg) - Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Comparison to baseline to 4 post dose timepoints (1, 4, 7 and 10 minutes post dose)</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 36 subjects were enrolled in this crossover study: 18 (8 randomized to placebo then SonoVue and 10 randomized to SonoVue then placebo) in the Hypertension Group (baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &gt;=25.0 mmHg group) and 18 (10 randomized to placebo then SonoVue and 8 randomized to SonoVue then placebo) in the Normal group (baseline mean PAP &lt;25.0 mmHg group). All subjects in this study were to have systolic PAP recorded within 5 minutes before the first investigational product administration. This parameter was to be measured and recorded again at 1, 4, 7 and 10 minutes after the administration of each investigational product (SonoVue and Placebo). This outcome measure presents the mean change from baseline in systolic PAP measured in mmHg. Baseline is the average of the 2 measurements within 5 minutes prior to first investigational product administration, therefore, applying to both products.</description>

    <measure>Effects of SonoVue and Placebo on Pulmonary Hemodynamics: Diastolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mmHg) - Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Comparison to baseline to 4 post dose timepoints (1, 4, 7 and 10 minutes post dose)</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects in this study were to have diastolic PAP recorded within 5 minutes before the first investigational product administration. This parameter was to be measured and recorded again at 1, 4, 7 and 10 minutes after the administration of each investigational product (SonoVue and Placebo). This outcome measure presents the mean change from baseline in diastolic PAP measured in mmHg. Baseline is the average of the 2 measurements within 5 minutes prior to first investigational product administration, therefore, applying to both products.</description>

    <measure>Effects of SonoVue and Placebo on Pulmonary Hemodynamics: Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (Dyne*Sec/cm^5) - Mean Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Comparison to baseline to 2 post dose timepoints (1 and 10 minutes post dose)</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects in this study were to have pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; measured in dyne x seconds per centimeters to the 5th power) derived from mean PAP (measured in mmHg), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP [mmHg]) and cardiac output (Qp [litres per minute]), each taken 5 minutes prior to the first investigational product administration, calculated using the following formula: [(mean PAP-PCWP) divided by Qp] x 80. Baseline is the last measurement prior to first investigational product administration, therefore, applying to both products. Mean PAP, PCWP and Qp were repeated at 1 and 10 minutes post dose; PVR was calculated.</description>

        <title>Effects of SonoVue and Placebo on Pulmonary Hemodynamics: Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mmHg) - Mean Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>A total of 36 subjects were enrolled in this crossover study: 18 (8 randomized to placebo then SonoVue and 10 randomized to SonoVue then placebo) in the Hypertension Group (baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &gt;=25.0 mmHg group) and 18 (10 randomized to placebo then SonoVue and 8 randomized to SonoVue then placebo) in the Normal group (baseline mean PAP &lt;25.0 mmHg group). All subjects in this study were to have systolic PAP recorded within 5 minutes before the first investigational product administration. This parameter was to be measured and recorded again at 1, 4, 7 and 10 minutes after the administration of each investigational product (SonoVue and Placebo). This outcome measure presents the mean change from baseline in systolic PAP measured in mmHg. Baseline is the average of the 2 measurements within 5 minutes prior to first investigational product administration, therefore, applying to both products.</description>

        <title>Effects of SonoVue and Placebo on Pulmonary Hemodynamics: Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (Dyne*Sec/cm^5) - Mean Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>All subjects in this study were to have pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; measured in dyne x seconds per centimeters to the 5th power) derived from mean PAP (measured in mmHg), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP [mmHg]) and cardiac output (Qp [litres per minute]), each taken 5 minutes prior to the first investigational product administration, calculated using the following formula: [(mean PAP-PCWP) divided by Qp] x 80. Baseline is the last measurement prior to first investigational product administration, therefore, applying to both products. Mean PAP, PCWP and Qp were repeated at 1 and 10 minutes post dose; PVR was calculated.</description>
