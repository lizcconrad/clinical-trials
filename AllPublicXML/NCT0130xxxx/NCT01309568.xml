  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the Quidel Reader
      Influenza A+B test and Quidel Reader with the following sample types: nasal swab,
      nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash. Clinical performance will be based on
      comparison of Quidel Reader Influenza A+B results to cell culture at a Central Reference or
      Alternative Laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to achieve a required minimum of cell
      culture-positive specimens for each sample type, nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and
      nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash.

        -  The 510(k) study will include combined results from all sites and require the following
           for all three sample types: a minimum of 50 fresh positive results for influenza A, and
           30 fresh positive results for influenza B.

        -  The CLIA Waiver submission will include combined results from all sites for a total of
           120 positive specimens for both influenza A and influenza B. The nasal swab will be the
           primary sample type planned for the CLIA Waiver submission. However, depending upon the
           prevalence of influenza, nasopharyngeal swab and/or nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash may
           also be submitted for CLIA Waiver.
