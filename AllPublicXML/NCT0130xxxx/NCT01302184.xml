  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait rehabilitation with treadmill has been reported to be useful in patients with
      Parkinson's disease. In the last years, interest in robotic devices for gait training has
      grew up for patients with different neurological disorders, since they minimize demands on
      physical therapists and may provide a more reliable and constant treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if robotic gait training with Lokomat® can improve
      walking more than conventional gait training with treadmill in patients affected by
      Parkinson's disease.

    <description>Patients of the experimental group were trained at 50% of BWS for 15 minutes and 30% of BWS for 15 minutes on the Lokomat®. Treadmill speed was initiated at 1.5km/h and increased to 3.0km/h by increments of 0.5km/h as tolerated.
A physical therapist supervised the treatment, adjusting treadmill speed and BWS.
Treatment was performed for 3 days/week, for 4 weeks</description>

    <description>Patients of the control group had 30 minutes of treadmill gait training. After having calculated the speed during 6MWT, the patient was trained on a treadmill (RHC770CE - RAM Medical srl). They were trained using 80% of the maximum speed that the patient reached during the test for the first week, 90% for the second week, 100% for the third and fourth week.
A Physical Therapist provided auditory cueing and direct, continuous feed-back to the patient.
Treatment was performed for 3 days/week, for 4 weeks.</description>
