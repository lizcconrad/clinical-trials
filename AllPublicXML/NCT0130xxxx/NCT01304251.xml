      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of short-term fasting on tolerance to
      adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from experimental animals provides strong support for the concept that caloric
      restriction (CR) increases resistance to multiple forms of stress. CR decreases plasma levels
      of growth factors, e.g. insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), thereby diverting energy from
      growth to maintenance. Accordingly, the currently available information suggests that
      short-term fasting protects normal cells against the perils of (high dose) chemotherapy. In
      contrast, cancer cells are not (or less) protected as a result of their self-sufficiency in
      growth signals. This phenomenon is termed Differential Stress Resistance (DSR). DSR reduces
      the severity of side-effects caused by the toxicity of chemotherapy, without interfering with
      its effect on reduction of tumour volume or tumour markers. A recent report, sketching a case
      series of 10 cancer patients, suggests that short term fasting protects against the side
      effects of chemotherapy in humans. Indeed, the majority of patients preferred fasting over
      feeding in preparation of their therapy. This study aims to further evaluate the impact of
      fasting on tolerance to chemotherapy in humans.
