      The target enrollment goal for the trial was to enroll 36 subjects. However due to a
      challenging protocol inclusion/ exclusion criteria, only one subject was enrolled since the
      trial was initiated in June 2011.

      To evaluate the following in participants undergoing coronary artery scaffolding/stenting for
      significant coronary artery disease:

        -  The acute (post-implantation) effect of an implanted bioresorbable vascular scaffold
           (BVS) or metallic drug eluting stent (mDES) on coronary blood flow and physiological
           responsiveness of the target coronary artery

        -  The long-term (2 years) effect of an implanted BVS or mDES on coronary blood flow and
           physiological responsiveness of the target coronary artery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center clinical investigation comparing
           target vessel and non-intervened, self-control vessel within participants and between
           participants undergoing BVS or mDES deployment for the treatment of a single de novo
           native coronary artery lesion

        -  The investigation will include two arms:

             -  Study device (BVS) arm: Abbott Vascular's Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular
                Scaffold

             -  Control device (mDES) arm: Abbott Vascular's Everolimus-Eluting XIENCE V or XIENCE
                PRIME

          7. Participant has evidence of myocardial bridging in the coronary anatomy during the
             angiographic evaluation.
