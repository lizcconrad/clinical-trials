  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apremilast is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have not been previously treated with
      DMARDs.

      Apremilast is proposed to improve signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis (tender and
      swollen joints, pain, physical function) in treated patients.

    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in 6-39% of psoriasis
      patients. The immunopathogenesis of PsA, which mirrors but is not identical to that seen in
      psoriatic plaques, reflects a complex interaction among resident dendritic, fibroblastic and
      endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells attracted to the synovium by cytokines and
      chemokines. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a novel oral agent that modulates multiple inflammatory
      pathways through targeted phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. Therefore,
      apremilast has the potential to be effective in the treatment of PsA.

          <title>Duration of Psoriatic Arthritis</title>
          <description>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic and progressive inflammatory arthritis that, depending on the method of ascertainment, occurs in 6% to 39% of patients with psoriasis. Disease onset typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 55 years and affects both sexes equally. In the majority of patients, psoriasis precedes PsA by several years. The diagnosis of PsA is made on clinical grounds in patients with psoriasis having skin, scalp or nail changes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index [HAQ-DI]) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline value and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 16 are included; Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used.</population>

Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative changes from baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline value and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 16 are included; Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation was used.</population>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). SF-36 domain scores were first calculated to range from 0 to100 and then transformed to norm-based scores (the norm-based scores in the US general population have an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, with higher scores indicating a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>Modified PsARC response is defined as improvement in at least 2 of the 4 measures, at least one of which must be tender joint count or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures:
78 tender joint count,
76 swollen joint count,
Patient global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual Analog scale (VAS), where 0=lowest disease activity and 100=highest;
Physician global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0=lowest disease activity and 100=highest.
Improvement or worsening in joint counts is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 30%, and improvement or worsening in global assessments is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 20 mm VAS.</description>

        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet will be rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest.
The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.
The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI:
Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22</description>

        <title>Change in Baseline in the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) After 16 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global assessment of disease activity.
DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses both the physical and functional consequences of fatigue. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 means &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 means &quot;very much.&quot; The FACIT-Fatigue scale score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting lower levels of fatigue.
A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Score at Week 16</title>
          <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses both the physical and functional consequences of fatigue. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 means &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 means &quot;very much.&quot; The FACIT-Fatigue scale score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting lower levels of fatigue.
A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). SF-36 domain scores were first calculated to range from 0 to100 and then transformed to norm-based scores (the norm-based scores in the US general population have an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 10). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, with higher scores indicating a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Entheses Score (MASES) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score quantitates inflammation of the entheses (enthesitis) by assessing pain at the following entheses (sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone):
1st costochondral joints left/right; 7th costochondral joints left/right; posterior superior iliac spine left/right; anterior superior iliac spine left/right; iliac crest left/right; 5th lumbar spinous process; and the proximal insertion of the Achilles tendon left/right.
The MASES, ranging from 0 to 13, is the number of painful entheses out of 13 entheses.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest.
The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.
The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI:
Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <title>Change in Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global assessment of disease activity.
DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

          <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline dactylitis severity score &gt; 0 (i.e., pre-existing dactylitis) are included; LOCF was used. Participants who did not have sufficient data (observed or imputed) for a determination of response status at Week 16 were counted as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>The EULAR response criteria classify each subject as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual subject’s DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease. Good or moderate response is defined as follows:
Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate EULAR Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>The EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on th DAS-28.
Good or moderate response is defined as follows:
Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2
A Moderate Response is defined as either:
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or,
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score quantitates inflammation of the entheses (enthesitis) by assessing pain at the following entheses (sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone): 1st costochondral joints left/right; 7th costochondral joints left/right; posterior superior iliac spine left/right; anterior superior iliac spine left/right; iliac crest left/right; 5th lumbar spinous process; and the proximal insertion of the Achilles tendon left/right. The MASES, ranging from 0 to 13, is the number of painful entheses out of 13 entheses. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Pre-existing Dactylitis Whose Dactylitis Severity Score Improves From Baseline by ≥ 1 at Week 52</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improved by ≥ 1 after 52 weeks. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Good or Moderate EULAR Response at Week 52</title>
        <description>The EULAR response criteria classify each subject as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual subject’s DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease. A Good response is defined as follows: Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 A Moderate Response is defined as either: an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method</description>
