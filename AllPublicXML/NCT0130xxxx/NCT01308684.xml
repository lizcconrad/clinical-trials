  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of RO5323441 in
      combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In the
      dose-finding part, patients will receive intravenous escalating doses of RO5323441 in
      combination with 10 mg/kg Avastin once every two weeks. In the efficacy-finding part,
      patients will be randomized to receive the established dose (from the dose-finding part) of
      RO5323441 plus Avastin or Avastin alone. Patients in the dose-finding part may continue
      treatment with RO5323441 and Avastin on the study until evidence of progressive disease or
      unacceptable adverse events happen. In the efficacy-finding part, patients will receive study
      treatment until disease progression or death.
