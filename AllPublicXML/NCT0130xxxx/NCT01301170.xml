      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with neck pain will respond
      favorably to a program of manual therapy, directed at the cervical and thoracic spine
      (including thrust manipulation), and exercise, in combination with dry needling, as compared
      to manual therapy, directed to the cervical and thoracic spine (including thrust
      manipulation), and an exercise program alone.

    <description>The needling will take place bilaterally at both the suboccipital region and the paravertebral muscles between C4 and T4. The needling will take place with the patient in the prone position. Following all needle placement, they will rotated clockwise till the point that tension on the needle is felt by the therapist. This will create more tension between the needle and tissue fibers, after which the needles were removed.</description>
