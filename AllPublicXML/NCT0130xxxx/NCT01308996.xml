      The purpose of this study is to evaluate INFUSE® Bone Graft as an alternative to autograft
      for alveolar ridge bone formation in the posterior mandible prior to dental implants. A
      subject must have a defect behind the canine of 2-4 teeth for at least 2 months and be a
      candidate for dental implants.

             alveolar ridge area.

          4. Has a prosthodontic treatment plan in place.

          5. Has no known condition that would interfere with collecting autogenous bone at either
             the tibia or the iliac crest for a bone grafting procedure.

          6. Is 21-75 years of age (inclusive).

          7. If female of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test, is not
             lactating, and agrees not to become pregnant for at least 12 months after surgery.

          8. Is able to comply with all study-related procedures, including exercising good oral
             hygiene.

          9. Is able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has bilateral alveolar ridge defects requiring simultaneous augmentation or a second
             augmentation planned during the course of the study.

          2. Has an active infection at the planned augmentation site.

          3. Has active periodontal disease of Grade III or higher.
