    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of an investigational nasal
      aerosol at two doses compared with placebo nasal aerosol in the treatment of seasonal
      allergic rhinitis in children (6-11 years of age).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) During the Two Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -4 to Day 1 predose), Days 1 (postdose) to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Reflective TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)
2 = moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)
3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the average AM and PM subject-reported rTNSS over the 4 days prior to randomization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) During the Two Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -4 to Day 1 predose), Days 1 (postdose) to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Instantaneous TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the last 10 minutes prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)
2 = moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)
3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the average AM and PM subject-reported iTNSS over the 4 days prior to randomization.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 6 to 11 years of age, as of the Screening Visit (SV)

          -  A documented history of SAR to a relevant seasonal allergen (tree/grass pollen) for a
             minimum of two years immediately preceding the study Screening Visit (SV).

          -  A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one seasonal allergen (tree/grass pollen) known
             to induce SAR through a standard skin prick test.

          -  Other criteria apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other
             clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent nasal biopsy, nasal
             trauma (e.g., nasal piercing) or surgery, atrophic rhinitis, or rhinitis medicamentosa
             (all within the last 60 days prior to the Screening Visit [SV])

          -  History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to
             bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis or influenza,) within the 14 days preceding
             the Screening Visit (SV), or development of a respiratory infection during the Run-in
             Period.

          -  Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or
             routine use of beta-agonists and any controller drug (e.g., theophylline, leukotriene
             antagonists). History of intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of
             inhaled short acting beta-agonists prior to the Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable

          -  Have any conditions that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant
             and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the clinical trial

          -  Other criteria apply

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) During the Two Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Instantaneous TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the last 10 minutes prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)
2 = moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)
3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.
Baseline was defined as the average AM and PM subject-reported iTNSS over the 4 days prior to randomization.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day -4 to Day 1 predose), Days 1 (postdose) to Day 15</time_frame>
        <population>The intent to treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of randomized study medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment. Two enrolled participants were excluded. One was randomized in error and did not receive test medication. The other provided no post-baseline assessment.</population>
