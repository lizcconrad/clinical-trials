  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disease that affects over 2.5 million
      people worldwide. Up to 50% of persons with MS (PwMS) will experience some form of cognitive
      impairment as a result of the disease including disturbances in memory, attention,
      concentration, information processing, and executive functions such as problem solving, and
      self-monitoring. MS-related cognitive impairments negatively affect many aspects of
      functioning and independent participation in everyday life. Thus, PwMS who experience
      cognitive impairments face a wide array of recurring barriers that pose grave challenges to
      carrying out everyday activities while trying to maintain multiple life roles and as they
      age.

      Management of cognitive symptoms can be addressed through rehabilitation which has the
      potential to reduce disability, prevent complications of the disease, and enhance
      participation, independence, and quality of life. Considering the high frequency of cognitive
      impairments in MS and their significant, complex impact on functioning and independence, it
      is critical that cognitive interventions be an essential component of MS rehabilitation.

      The overarching goal of this study is to develop and test a self-management, group-based
      cognitive rehabilitation program designed specifically for PwMS.
