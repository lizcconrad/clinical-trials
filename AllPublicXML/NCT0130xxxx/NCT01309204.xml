      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine
      fixed combination in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) relative to each of its individual
      active constituents instilled concomitantly (Brinzolamide+Brimonidine) in patients with
      open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      This study consisted of 7 visits conducted during 2 sequential phases: the
      screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and a
      treatment phase, which included 4 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, Month 3, and
      Month 6 (or early exit). Following washout of any IOP-lowering medication, subjects who met
      all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits and who had IOP measurements
      within the specified range during this period were randomized to 1 of 2 study drug groups:
      Brinz/Brim or Brinz+Brim.

    <description>Mean Diurnal IOP Change from Baseline at Month 3 (ie, the subject IOP change from baseline averaged over the 9 AM and + 2 h time points at Month 3) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. The study drug was instilled approximately 15 minutes after conducting the 9AM IOP measurement. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, are insufficiently controlled on monotherapy or are currently on
             multiple IOP-lowering medications.

          -  Meet qualifying IOP entry criteria.

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, test positive for pregnancy at Screening
             visit, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods to
             prevent pregnancy throughout the study.

          -  Severe central visual field loss.

          -  Can not safely undergo the initial washout period and discontinue use of all
             IOP-lowering ocular medication(s) for the minimum specified period prior to
             Eligibility Visit 1.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (20/80 Snellen
             equivalent).

          -  Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease.

          -  Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months.

          -  Ocular infection or inflammation within the preceding 3 months.

          -  Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease.

          -  Other ocular pathology.

          -  Intraocular surgery within the 6 months prior to entry.

          -  Ocular laser surgery within the 3 months prior to entry.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

          -  Any other conditions which would make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  Recent use of high-dose (&gt;1 gram daily) salicylate therapy.

          -  Recent, current, or anticipated treatment with any medication that augments adrenergic

          <description>Mean Diurnal IOP Change from Baseline at Month 3 (ie, the subject IOP change from baseline averaged over the 9 AM and + 2 h time points at Month 3) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. The study drug was instilled approximately 15 minutes after conducting the 9AM IOP measurement. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>
