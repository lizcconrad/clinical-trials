      The primary objective of this study is to assess the presence of amyloid in
      non-demented/functionally stable adults with DS as a function of age, dividing the sample
      into amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative groups. We will also obtain baseline cognitive
      measures across a range of areas that are often affected by AD.

      Specific Aim 1: To assess and compare amyloid deposition (with PiB PET) in
      non-demented/functionally stable adults with DS across three age cohorts (30-39, 40-49, and
      &gt;50 years of age).

      Primary Hypothesis 1: At initial assessment, there will be a significantly higher prevalence
      of amyloid-positive (PiB+) subjects in each succeeding age cohort.

      In addition, we will test the following secondary hypothesis:

      Secondary Aim 1: To compare the presence or absence of the apolipoprotein-E4 allele to the
      retention of PiB in various brain areas of the DS subjects.

      Secondary Hypothesis 1: At baseline, subjects who carry at least one Apolipoprotein-E4
      (ApoE4) allele will show a higher prevalence of being PiB+.
