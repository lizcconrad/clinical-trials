    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Success in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Severity at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>PGA assessed severity of overall disease activity in participants. It was performed using a 6-point scale graded from 0 - 5, in which 0 = clear (no plaque elevation above normal skin level), 1 = almost clear (essentially flat with possible trace elevation), 2 = mild (slight but definite elevation of plaque above normal skin level), 3 = moderate (moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges to plaque), 4 = severe (marked elevation with hard, sharp edges to plaque), 5 = very severe (very marked elevation with very hard, sharp edges to plaque). The success in PGA of disease severity was defined as a PGA score of '0 = clear' or '1 = almost clear', with at least 2-grade improvement in PGA from Baseline to Day 84.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of the total body surface area (BSA) involved with psoriasis was measured. Change from Baseline (Day 1) in percentage of BSA at Day 84 was reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 84 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAE and non-SAE.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs were classified according to the severity in 3 categories a) mild =AEs does not interfere with participant's usual function b) moderate =AEs interfered to some extent with participant's usual function c) severe =AEs interfered significantly with participant's usual function and required systemic drug therapy. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 84 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. In this outcome measure, number of mild, moderate and severe TEAEs were reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Local Tolerability Symptoms: Burning/Stinging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Local tolerability in participants was evaluated in terms of presence and absence of burning/stinging symptom and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied. Burning/stinging symptoms were graded on a 4-point scale of 0 - 3 where 0 =none (no stinging/ burning), 1 =mild (slight warm, tingling sensation), 2 = moderate (definite warm; tingling/stinging sensation), 3 = severe (hot, tingling/stinging sensation that caused definite discomfort). Higher scores=Severe symptoms. In this outcome measure, number of participants with none, mild, moderate and severe burning/stinging symptoms were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Local Tolerability Symptoms: Pruritus</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Local tolerability was evaluated in participants in terms of presence and absence of pruritus symptom and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied. Pruritus symptoms were graded on a 4-point scale of 0 - 3 where 0 =none (no pruritus), 1 =mild (occasional, slight itching/scratching), 2 = moderate (constant or intermittent itching/scratching which was not disturbing sleep), 3 = severe (bothersome itching/scratching which was disturbing sleep). Higher scores=Severe symptoms. In this outcome measure, number of participants with none, mild, moderate and severe pruritus symptoms were reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Success in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Severity at Day 84</title>
        <description>PGA assessed severity of overall disease activity in participants. It was performed using a 6-point scale graded from 0 - 5, in which 0 = clear (no plaque elevation above normal skin level), 1 = almost clear (essentially flat with possible trace elevation), 2 = mild (slight but definite elevation of plaque above normal skin level), 3 = moderate (moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges to plaque), 4 = severe (marked elevation with hard, sharp edges to plaque), 5 = very severe (very marked elevation with very hard, sharp edges to plaque). The success in PGA of disease severity was defined as a PGA score of ‘0 = clear’ or ‘1 = almost clear’, with at least 2-grade improvement in PGA from Baseline to Day 84.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Severity</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs were classified according to the severity in 3 categories a) mild =AEs does not interfere with participant’s usual function b) moderate =AEs interfered to some extent with participant’s usual function c) severe =AEs interfered significantly with participant’s usual function and required systemic drug therapy. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 84 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. In this outcome measure, number of mild, moderate and severe TEAEs were reported.</description>

        <description>Local tolerability in participants was evaluated in terms of presence and absence of burning/stinging symptom and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied. Burning/stinging symptoms were graded on a 4-point scale of 0 - 3 where 0 =none (no stinging/ burning), 1 =mild (slight warm, tingling sensation), 2 = moderate (definite warm; tingling/stinging sensation), 3 = severe (hot, tingling/stinging sensation that caused definite discomfort). Higher scores=Severe symptoms. In this outcome measure, number of participants with none, mild, moderate and severe burning/stinging symptoms were reported.</description>
