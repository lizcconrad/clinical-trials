      Background:

      - Varenicline (Chantix ) is a drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      to help people stop smoking. Varenicline is very effective in helping some people quit
      smoking, but is less effective for others. Researchers are interested in conducting more
      in-depth studies into how varenicline works, including its effect on smokers' responses to
      items that may trigger cigarette cravings, in order to develop better smoking cessation
      medications.

      Objectives:

      - To examine the effectiveness of varenicline as an effective medication for tobacco
      addiction by studying its effect on nicotine reinforcement, nicotine-seeking behavior,
      cue-elicited craving, and performance impairment and craving after overnight tobacco
      deprivation.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been smoking at least 10 cigarettes per
      day for at least 2 years.

      Design:

        -  This study will require 12 study visits. Some visits will be brief and other visits that
           involve test sessions will last up to 8 hours. If no sessions are repeated, the study
           will take 26 days. Participants will not be required to attempt to quit smoking during
           this study.

        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,
           blood and urine tests, and other tests as required by the study researchers.

        -  Participants will take two sets of pills during the study: the first set during the
           first 12 days of the study, followed by a 2-day break, then the second set during the
           last 12 days. Some of the pills will contain varenicline, and others will be placebos.

        -  On Day 1 of the study, participants will come to the National Institute on Drug Abuse to
           receive the first set of pills. Participants will take the first pill before leaving.

        -  On Day 8, participants will have a training session that will measure the amount of
           carbon monoxide in the breath. Participants will also complete several questionnaires
           about smoking habits and current mood, and will have a chance to practice the procedures
           they will do in the study.

        -  On Days 9 and 10, participants will have behavioral test sessions that will last 7 to 8
           hours. Day 9 will involve tests of cue response to items that may trigger cigarette
           cravings, and tests of general nicotine cravings over several hours. Day 10 will involve
           tests of general nicotine cravings over several hours, and then tests of
           nicotine-seeking behavior. Participants will be provided with lunch during these all-day
           sessions.

        -  On Day 11, participants will have memory and attention tests, and will provide a blood
           sample. Participants will not be allowed to smoke for 12 hours before the start of the
           next test on Day 12.

        -  On Day 12, participants will provide a breath sample, and will have two sets of memory
           and attention tests before they will be permitted to start smoking again. There will be
           no tests on Days 13 and 14.

        -  Starting on Day 15, participants will repeat the schedule of tests from Days 1 through
           12 with the second set of pills.

      Objectives

        1. To examine several potential mechanisms by which varenicline functions as an effective
           medication for tobacco addiction: a) nicotine reinforcement (forced-choice procedure),
           b) nicotine-seeking behavior (operant response task), c) cue-elicited craving, and d)
           performance impairment and craving after overnight tobacco deprivation.

        2. To validate our laboratory measures by using a medication with known efficacy in the
           treatment of tobacco addiction.

      Study population

      The study will enroll 50 healthy adult smokers to attain 25 completers.

      Design

      The study is a placebo-controlled, crossover design comparing the effects of varenicline and
      placebo.

      Outcome Measures

      During cue-reactivity sessions, primary measures include tobacco craving, mood, and autonomic
      responsivity (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and skin temperature). During
      forced-choice sessions, the primary measure is the percentage of nicotine cigarette puffs
      chosen during choice trials. During operant response sessions, primary measures include
      breakpoint (final ratio completed), total number of responses, and number of cigarette puffs
      earned and taken. During the tobacco deprivation session, primary measures include
      self-reported withdrawal, tobacco craving, mood, and cognitive task performance (accuracy and
      response time).

      Secondary study measures include baseline demographic and smoking history, level of nicotine
      dependence, tobacco craving, and mood.
