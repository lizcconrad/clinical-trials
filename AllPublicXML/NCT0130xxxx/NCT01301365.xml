  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to check whether patients with cystoscopic findings supporting the
      diagnosis of Interstitial Cystitis (IC) have a higher autonomic response (change in blood
      pressure / pulse)than patients without cystoscopic findings.

      checking the changes in blood pressure and pulse rate during the initiation of the anesthesia
      and at the completion of the cystodistension in patient with cystoscopic finding supporting
      IC
