  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a respiratory disorder of sleep characterized by recurrent
      episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction, leading to intermittent oxygen
      deprivation. This results in sympathetic activation and surges in blood pressure, production
      of vasoactive substances, as well as activation of the inflammatory and procoagulant
      pathways. Epidemiological evidence indicates the prevalence of OSA is higher in patients with
      coronary artery disease than in the general population. The investigators recently showed
      that 65.7% and 41.9% of the Singapore patients admitted with myocardial infarction were found
      to have previously undiagnosed OSA and severe OSA, respectively. In a 10-year follow-up
      epidemiological study, OSA was independently associated with a higher prevalence of fatal and
      non-fatal cardiovascular events among the otherwise healthy general population. The
      investigators further showed that in patients who have undergone primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction, OSA was an independent predictor of
      future adverse event rates. Despite the observed association between OSA and adverse
      cardiovascular outcomes, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. In this
      proposal, the investigators aim to elucidate the relationship between OSA and composition of
      coronary atherosclerotic plaques.
