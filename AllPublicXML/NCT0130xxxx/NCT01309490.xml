  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether oral Ribavirin is safe and effective in
      treating patients with solid tumour cancers, that have high levels of the protein eIF4E.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalating, open-label, Phase I/II study of single agent oral ribavirin
      administered daily in solid tumour cancer patients who have failed standard treatments,
      overexpress eIF4E, and have easily accessible disease for serial biopsies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Phase I part of study : Histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer at diagnosis,
             with advanced, incurable disease at the time of screening, who have progressed on or
             are not suitable for standard therapy.

             Phase II part of study: Histologically or cytologically confirmed BC or HNSCC at
             diagnosis, with advanced, incurable disease at the time of screening, who have
             progressed on or are not suitable for standard therapy.

          2. Willing to have a screening biopsy performed from an easily accessible lesion (ex.
             skin, superficial lymph node) AND whose tumour must overexpress eIF4E.

          3. Easily accessible lesion for serial biopsies (ex. skin, superficial lymph node, or
             other easily accessible site).

          4. At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion (based on the RECIST criteria) outside
             the CNS.

          5. ECOG 0, 1, or 2.

          6. Adequate recovery (excluding alopecia) from previous surgery, radiation, and
             chemotherapy.

          7. Adequate wash-out period from last therapy (at least 3 weeks).

          8. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          9. Age ≥ 18 years old.

         10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-HCG)
             pregnancy test within 14 days of starting protocol and must not be breastfeeding. Men
             and women of childbearing potential (including men who have had a vasectomy and women
             who have had tubal ligation) must agree to use two effective means of contraception
             throughout the study and for at least 6 months after completion of protocol.
             Post-menopausal women (defined as 12 or more consecutive months of amenorrhea, or
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the post-menopausal range), or surgically
             sterile women (defined as removal of the uterus or ovaries), do not require methods of
             contraception.

         11. Adequate renal and hepatic function: serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN; AST or ALT &lt; 2.5 x
             ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN if liver involvement with metastases); serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN.

         12. Adequate hematopoietic function: neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L.

         13. Provide written consent after the investigational nature, study design, risks and
             benefits of the study have been explained.

         14. Accessible for treatment and follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic brain metastases.

          2. Active cardiovascular disease as defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
             III-IV categorization.

          3. Intercurrent illness or medical condition precluding safe administration of the
             planned protocol treatment or required follow-up.

          4. Use of any investigational anti-cancer drug within 2 weeks before start of study
             treatment or inadequate recovery from any toxic effects of such therapy.

          5. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          6. Concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy. Bisphosphonates are allowed as
             long as they were started prior to screening (at least 4 weeks before study entry).

          7. Known infection with HIV.

          8. History of other malignancy in the past 5 years. Subjects who have been disease-free
             for 1 year or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer
             or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.
