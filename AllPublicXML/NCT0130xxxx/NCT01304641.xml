    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare rates and risk of primary cardiovascular events among
      elderly patients newly initiating therapy with atorvastatin or simvastatin. The specific
      objectives for this project are to: 1) examine the demographic and clinical characteristics
      of the elderly patients in whom atorvastatin or simvastatin was newly initiated; and 2)
      compare cardiovascular event rates in elderly patients in whom atorvastatin or simvastatin
      was newly initiated.

        This study included commercial health plan members and Medicare Advantage Part D enrollees
        ages 65 years and older with a prescription for atorvastatin or simvastatin filled between
        01 July 2006 and 30 November 2008 (subject identification period). The first observed
        atorvastatin or simvastatin fill during the subject identification period was defined as
        the index drug and the fill date was defined as the index date. A 12-month period prior to
        the index date (defined as the pre-index period) was used for identification of comorbid
        exclusionary conditions. The 12-month period prior to index date was also used for
        assessment of pre-index patient characteristics. Patients were observed for a minimum of 3
        months (following index date) until the earlier of either 1) disenrollment from the health
        plan or 2) 28 February 2009 (post-index period). The pre- and post-index periods in
        combination were defined as the analytic period.
