  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if the effect of oxcarbazepine on chronic
      peripheral nerve pain depends on the supposed mechanism of the pain, ie. if oxcarbazepine
      mainly relieve pain in patients with irritable nerves.

    <description>Pain is rated daily on 0-10 point numeric rating scales. From the daily ratings from week 6 of each treatment period a median value is determined and used for data analysis. The analysis will compare scores between treatments (oxcabazepine vs placebo) and treatment effects (placebo-oxcarbazepine) between groups irritable nociceptor vs non-irritable nociceptors and some other subgroups.</description>
