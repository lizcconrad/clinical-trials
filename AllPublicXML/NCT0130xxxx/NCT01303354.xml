  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of dexamethasone for
      transforaminal epidural steroid injection. A secondary aim of this study is to obtain data on
      the lowest most effective dose of dexamethasone for this treatment and the effective duration
      of effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) have been demonstrated to be an effective
      treatment for radicular pain. Over the last decade, rare but serious complications have been
      reported following transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI). Recent research
      indicates that certain types of corticosteroids containing microscopic particles may be
      responsible for these adverse events. Dexamethasone (DXM) is a non-particulate
      cortico-steroid that has not been implicated in these adverse events. However, there is
      inadequate evidence up to date to support the use of Dexamethasone (DXM) for transforaminal
      epidural steroid injections (TFESI). This study aims to bridge that gap.

    <description>Subjects were specifically assessed for the following adverse events on day-of and one-week post injection: allergic reaction, neurovascular events, pain on injection, paresthesias during the procedure or dysesthesias post procedure, dural puncture, headache, meningismus, neck pain, arm pain, worsening of back pain, worsening of leg pain, facial flusing, mania, insomnia, agitation, hypertension, hyperglycemia. They were also asked to report any other side-effects or complications.</description>
