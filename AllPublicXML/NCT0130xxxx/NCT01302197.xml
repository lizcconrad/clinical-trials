  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, a leading cause of disability in the aging population, increases the risk for
      diabetes, subsequent stroke recurrence, and cardiovascular disease complications. The
      downsizing of private and federal health care resources, along with the anticipated increase
      in stroke rates as our population ages, mandate that alternative strategies be developed to
      reduce the public health burden of stroke. This pilot study may facilitate our knowledge of
      the timing of paretic leg muscle atrophy, fiber type shift, and the progression of worsening
      of glucose tolerance after stroke. Knowledge of the skeletal muscle changes occurring in the
      sub-acute stroke period is essential to create new guidelines incorporating exercise
      rehabilitation, much like cardiac rehabilitation, in order to facilitate and improve the
      health care of veteran stroke survivors.

      The vast majority of cerebrovascular accidents are reported in persons older than 55 years of
      age and occur in over 780,000 persons each year in the U.S. As our adult population ages, the
      number of strokes in the United States is anticipated to double, reaching nearly 1.5 million
      annually by the year 2050. Following stroke, patients remain at continued high risk for
      recurrent stroke with almost a third of them suffering recurrent stroke within 5 years, even
      despite optimal medical management. Age and cardiac disease are among the most important
      longitudinal predictors of cardiovascular health outcomes and survival after stroke. Notably,
      75% of chronic stroke survivors have residual disability emphasizing the need for
      rehabilitation strategies.

      Knowledge of the skeletal muscle changes that occur in the early phases after stroke is
      essential to create new guidelines which incorporate exercise rehabilitation, much like
      cardiac rehabilitation, in order to facilitate and improve the health care of stroke
      survivors.

      Blood samples will be analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Muscle tissue is collected for
      measurements of muscle phenotype. A urine pregnancy test is performed in women of child
      bearing age before CT imaging to exclude pregnant women due to the risk to an unborn fetus.
