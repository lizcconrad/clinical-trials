      The aim of this study is to evaluate the reduced incretin effect observed in patients with
      T2DM in relation to reversibility. The incretin effect will be measured by means of OGTT and
      iIVGTT in 12 women with GDM during pregnancy (third trimester), and again 2-3 months post
      partum. It is anticipated that the incretin effect in patients with GDM is reduced - like in
      patients with other forms of DM. The investigators estimate that approximately 90 % of the
      patients with GDM re-establish a NGT 2-3 months post partum. This particular group of
      patients provides a unique possibility for demonstrating the reversibility of the reduced
      incretin effect in relation to optimal glycaemic control.
