  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder causing impairment in
      movement, behavioral dysfunction and dementia. The movement disorder is mainly characterized
      by chorea (involuntary movements) and a progressive loss of voluntary movement causing a
      substantial functional impairment over time. The study will assess the long-term safety of
      pridopidine and the treatment effects during long-term, open-label treatment.

          -  Patient has completed the HART (ACR16C009) or the PRIDE-HD (TV7820- CNS-20002) studies
             and had remained on IMP during the full on-treatment part of the study (including
             de-escalated patients) or has transitioned from the Open-HART pre-virtualization study
             period.

          -  Patient has the ability to transition from in-person study visits to virtual study
             visits. The first remote visit (RV1) will take place within approximately 30 days
             after the last in-person visit.

               -  Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information
