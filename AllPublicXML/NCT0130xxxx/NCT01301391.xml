      The intent of the study is to assess the antitumor activity of PHA-848125AC in patients with
      recurrent or metastatic, unresectable malignant thymoma previously treated with multiple
      lines of chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical trial design with an early
      stopping rules. PHA-848125AC will be administered to patients with recurrent metastatic
      unresectable B3 thymoma or thymic carcinoma who have received more than one line of prior
      systemic therapy for advanced / metastatic disease. The intent of the study is to assess the
      antitumor activity of PHA-848125AC and ultimately to improve the outcome of the patients. The
      primary end point for this study is a progression free survival rate of 3 months.
