      Purpose: This study is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial testing the
      hypothesis that daily everolimus plus weekly vinorelbine and trastuzumab will be effective,
      safe, and tolerable among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive breast cancer brain metastases. Once enrolled, patients will receive
      everolimus PO daily in combination with weekly intravenous (IV) vinorelbine and trastuzumab.
      Cycles will be repeated every 3 weeks (21 days). At the time of progression, patients will
      come off study.

      Participants: Up to 35 adults over 21 with HER-2 positive breast cancer that has metastasized
      to the brain.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective -To determine the intracranial objective response rate of
      mTOR inhibition (everolimus) in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in the treatment
      of HER2-positive, progressive breast cancer brain metastases as defined via modified RECIST
      criteria.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the intracranial objective response rate of mechanistic target of rapamycin
           (mTOR) inhibition (everolimus) in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab in the
           treatment of HER2-positive, progressive breast cancer brain metastases as defined by
           MacDonald criteria.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab
           and vinorelbine as assessed via the NCI CTCAE version 4.0

        -  To evaluate time to intracranial progression after administration of everolimus in
           combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine as defined via modified RECIST criteria

        -  To evaluate the extracranial objective response rate as determined by RECIST 1.1
           criteria after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and
           vinorelbine.

        -  To evaluate the extracranial time to progression as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria
           after administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine.

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after
           administration of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine.

        -  To evaluate the impact of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine on
           quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast
           (FACT-B) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Brain (FACT-Br) questionnaires.

      Exploratory Objective

      -To evaluate biomarkers in archival tumor tissue samples and correlate with therapeutic
      response to everolimus in combination with vinorelbine and trastuzumab.

      Following Hepatitis B antiviral prophylaxis if required, or following screening and informed
      consent if antiviral therapy is not needed, treatment will be initiated with everolimus PO
      daily in combination with weekly intravenous (IV) vinorelbine and trastuzumab (Days 1, 8, and
      15)

      A cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21 days). Cycles of therapy will be repeated until documented
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal from study for other
      reasons, including death.

The former are summed as is, the latter are reversed in value before adding, such that each domain ranges from 0 to 4 times the number of questions in the domain, with 0 indicating worst and the highest possible value indicating best outcome. Total scores on the FACT-Br subscale range from 0 to 92 with lower scores indicating declining quality of life.

          <description>Anatomic stage for NSCLC is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, and metastases (TNM) system, which is based on:
Size of primary tumor (T) and whether it has grown into nearby areas. Spread to regional lymph nodes (N). Spread (metastasis; M) to other organs of the body. Once the T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined into a prognostic group. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced.</description>

          <title>Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) Score</title>
          <description>Recursive partitioning creates a decision tree that classifies members of a population by splitting it into sub-populations based on several dichotomous independent variables. The process is termed recursive because each sub-population may in turn be split an indefinite number of times.
This includes three classes: Class 1 (patients &lt;65 years, ECOG Performance Status of 0-1, controlled primary tumor, and no extracranial metastases), Class 3 (ECOG Performance Status of 2 or greater), and Class 2 (all others);</description>

Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions

Measurable disease is defined as at least 1 measurable brain lesion accurately measured in at least 2 dimensions (longest diameter) as ≥5.0 mm. Tumor size is the product of the 2 longest bi-dimensional lines.
Complete Response (CR)- Disappearance of all tumor on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least 1 month apart, off steroids for treatment of neurological symptoms, and neurologically stable or improved.
Partial Response (PR)- ≥50% reduction in size of tumor on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least 1 month part, steroids stable or reduced, and neurologically stable or improved.
Progressive Disease (PD)- ≥25% increase in size of tumor or any new tumor on CT or MRI scans, or neurologically worse, and steroids stable or increased due to neurologic symptoms.
Stable Disease (SD)- all other situations Overall Response Rate (ORR) is the sum of partial responses (PRs) and CRs.</description>

        <description>The FACT-Br is a 23-question self-report questionnaire subscale administered with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) which contains concerns relevant to patients with brain tumors . Each question has a value 0-4. For some questions a higher indicates better outcome and others are the opposite. The former are summed as is, the latter are reversed in value before adding, such that each domain ranges from 0 to 4 times the number of questions in the domain, with 0 indicating worst and the highest possible value indicating best outcome. Total scores on the FACT-Br subscale range from 0 to 92 with lower scores indicating declining quality of life. The change from baseline is the difference in scores between the baseline and 9 week assessments.</description>

          <title>Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy- Breast (FACT-B) From Baseline to 9 Weeks of Treatment to Assess Impact of Everolimus in Combination With Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine on Quality of Life</title>
          <description>The FACT-B is a 10-question self-report questionnaire subscale administered with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) which contains concerns relevant to patients with breast cancer. Each question has a value 0-4. For some questions a higher indicates better outcome and others are the opposite. The former are summed as is, the latter are reversed in value before adding, such that each domain ranges from 0 to 4 times the number of questions in the domain, with 0 indicating worst and the highest possible value indicating best outcome. Total scores on the FACT-B subscale range from 0 to 40 with lower scores indicating declining quality of life. The change from baseline is the difference in scores between the baseline and 9 week assessments.</description>
