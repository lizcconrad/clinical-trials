      The objective of this clinical study was to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy
      (effects on appetite scores, food intake) and plasma kinetics of Hoodia gordonii purified
      extract (H.g.PE), when consumed twice-daily for 2 or 15-days.

      A two stage randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, kinetics and efficacy of twice-daily repeat intake of formulated Hoodia
      gordonii purified extract (H.g.PE) (PYM50717) administered twice daily for 2 or 15 days to
      healthy, overweight females aged 18 to 50 years with a body fat of 25-45%.

      Stage 1 (pilot): Placebo controlled, double blind comparison to assess the effect of timing
      of product administration (i.e. breakfast and lunch vs breakfast and dinner).

      Stage 2 (main study): Placebo controlled double blind comparison with product administered
      with breakfast and dinner.

      A total of 64 subjects were included in this study; stage 1: n=15, stage 2: n=49. Treatment
      groups in stage 2 were matched for percentage body fat.

      Stage 1:

        -  H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before
           breakfast and lunch (n = 4).

        -  Placebo product, twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and lunch (n =
           3).

        -  H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before
           breakfast and dinner (n = 5).

        -  Placebo product, twice-daily for two days, 65 minutes before breakfast and dinner (n =
           3).

      Stage 2:

        -  H.g.PE formulated product (1110 mg), twice daily (n=25)for 15 days

        -  Placebo product , twice daily (n=24),for 15 days

    <time_frame>41 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability (Adverse Events (AEs), vitals signs, Electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory assessments) of twice daily consumption of 1110 mg of formulated Hoodia gordonii purified extract (H.g.PE) consumed over a period of 2 or 15 days were assessed up to 41 days after start of the intervention</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of 15-day repeat consumption of H.g.PE</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of twice daily consumption of 1110 mg of formulated H.g.PE during 15-day repeat intake was assessed. Appetite scores, ad libitum energy intake, body weight and body composition were assessed during the 15-day intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of the pharmacokinetics of PYM50057 a marker of the steroid glycosides in H.g.PE</measure>
    <time_frame>41 days</time_frame>
    <description>Kinetic parameters were calculated on Days 5 and 19 based on the individual plasma concentration-time profiles of the steroid glycoside, PYM50057. Maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (tmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), apparent terminal phase rate constant (Kel), absorption rate constant (Ka),the apparent first order elimination rate constant (λz) and the overall apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) were assessed. Samples were taken up to 41 days after start of the intervention.</description>
