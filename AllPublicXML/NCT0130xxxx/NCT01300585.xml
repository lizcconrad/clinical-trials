      The purpose of this study is to test a new method of defining patterns of how breast glands
      are or are not attached to the overlying skin. All patients will have markers placed on both
      breasts and will undergo an MRI. MRI results will be examined to identify the pattern of
      breast gland attachment to the overlying skin. This will help identify patients which may
      benefit from areolar sparing and/or nipple sparing technique and which patients should be
      treated by standard mastectomy.

    <description>Patients who qualify for the study and consent to be included will undergo placement of areola and nipple markers that will be held in place with tape for the duration of the ordered MRI study. The markers consist of latex-free plastic tubing filled with vegetable based hydrogenated oil that is solid at room temperature. This creates a fat density marker that will define the areola but does not interfere with or create artifact onto the underlying tissue. The marker can be placed by the investigator or available MRI technician instructed in marker placement. The patient will then undergo the MRI. The patients participation in the study will end with the MRI.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have one of the following indications for MRI study of the breast - screening for high
             risk without evidence of disease, have existing breast cancer with need for evaluation
             of extent of disease or to rule out additional occult cancer, or to have an equivocal
             mammogram or ultrasound requiring additional information from MRI.

          -  No prior breast surgery including prior excisional biopsies for disease performed with
             surgical technique, breast augmentation, reduction mammoplasty or breast lift with or
             without implants.

          -  Capable of fitting into the MRI machine.

          -  Permission to contact and consent the patient to participate from the investigator(s)

          -  Provide written informed consent and Authorization for Use/Disclosure of PHI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a contraindication to MRI study.

          -  Prior breast surgery - this includes: prior excisional biopsies for disease performed
             with surgical technique, breast augmentation, reduction mammoplasty or breast lift
             with or without implants [Patients may have undergone prior percutaneous (needle)
             biopsy or fine needle aspiration]

          -  Inability to fit into the MRI machine.

          -  Psychological factors that may interfere with successful completion of the study

          -  Refusal to provide written informed consent and/or Authorization for Use/Disclosure of
             PHI
