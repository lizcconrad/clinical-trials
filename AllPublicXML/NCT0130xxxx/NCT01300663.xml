    <textblock>
      Post-surgery complications in women with vulvar neoplasms (vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia
      and vulvar cancer) are still high and an instrument assessing patients self-reported
      post-vulval surgery symptom experiences is missing. The study aims to develop and validate a
      postoperative instrument to assess symptom experiences in women with vulvar neoplasms. In
      this mixed-method project 20 patients were interviewed, a WOMAN-PRO instrument was developed
      and content validity was tested by 6 experts and 10 patients. The instrument's psychometric
      properties and the prevalence of symptoms will be examined in a cross-sectional study in the
      University Hospitals Munich, Freiburg, Berlin, DÃ¼sseldorf, Zurich, Basel, Berne, and the
      Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen (N=150). The goal of this project is that symptom assessment
      becomes a standard component of clinical practice (to promote the early detection and
      treatment of symptoms) and research.
