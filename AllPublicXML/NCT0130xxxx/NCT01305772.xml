  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to identify which cancer-related genes are turned on or turned
      off in order to determine how well a patient will respond to the study drug, panitumumab.
      Panitumumab was added to standard adjuvant or primary radiation therapy. There were subjects
      that receive surgery followed by therapy and subjects that receive radiation therapy without
      surgery.

      Subjects entering this study had locally advanced disease that can be treated with surgery
      and/or radiation therapy. Fresh frozen tumor tissue were available for genomics analysis
      prior to initiating panitumumab therapy. If fresh frozen tissue was not available at time of
      consent, a biopsy was required to participate in this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial was initiated to identify a gene expression signature profile biomarker for
      panitumumab sensitivity in locally advanced, untreated SCCHN. SCCHN expresses or over
      expresses EGFR in &gt;90% of tumors. Panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody
      approved for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressing previously
      treated metastatic colorectal cancer. It competes with endogenous ligands such as epidermal
      growth factor and tumor growth factor-α and blocks stimulation of the EGFR. Preclinical
      experiments have shown that panitumumab has both direct anti-tumor activity and can activate
      a cellular immune response to SCCHN.This study provides the opportunity to better define the
      population of patients that would benefit from EGFR inhibition in SCCHN.

      Patients received single agent panitumumab in a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; design prior to
      definitive surgical or radiation therapy. The decision to treat primarily with either surgery
      or Radiation Therapy (RT) based therapy was based on best medical practice by the treating
      physician per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines at www.nccn.org.

      Response to panitumumab monotherapy before surgery or radiation was evaluated as a continuous
      variable, and a median split of patients will be used to develop a signature of drug
      responsiveness. An Affymetrix chip based gene signature model was then developed by analyzing
      gene expression in panitumumab sensitive versus resistant tumors. Identification of a gene
      expression profile for tumor sensitivity allowed for prospective trials treating patient
      populations enriched for likelihood of clinical benefit from panitumumab therapy. It is also
      possible that a gene signature profile for panitumumab responsiveness identified in SCCHN
      could be used as a biomarker in other epithelial cancers.

      Tumor response as measured by percentage decrease in PET scan standardized uptake value (SUV)
      level or objective evidence of tumor response (by CT scan or direct measurement) was the
      basis for examining the activity of panitumumab by means of identifying a gene expression
      signature that predicted response in this patient population. Therefore, PET scan SUV levels
      was assessed at baseline prior to any treatment. If a baseline PET/CT was obtained and a
      lesion identified with SUV level ≥6, an additional pre-treatment research PET/CT was
      performed after consent (prior to dose #1 panitumumab. A second research PET/CT was also
      obtained after the first dose of panitumumab as part of this research study. If no baseline
      PET/CT had been obtained, a research PET was obtained pre-treatment; if SUV level ≥6 an
      additional research PET was obtained after the first dose of panitumumab.

      All subjects underwent imaging, biopsy and a single dose of panitumumab 9mg/kg IV. Two to
      three weeks after panitumumab, imaging was repeated and a second biopsy was obtained (at
      surgery for surgery patients) and an optional biopsy for patients receiving RT. Subjects
      received 2 additional doses of panitumumab during their standard therapy.

    <measure>Change in Tumor (Primary Tumor and Lymph Node) Response and Progression Between Pre- and Post- Panitumumab Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The aim of this outcome measure was to identify a gene expression signature that predicts response to panitumumab in untreated locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head / neck (SCCHN). Response and progression were evaluated using the largest percentage change among the cases: 1) Pre-panitumumab PET scan activity, and/or; 2) Pre-panitumumab radiologic measurement compared to post-panitumumab measurement and/or; 3) Pre-panitumumab direct measurement of tumor / lymph node compared to post-panitumumab direct measurement of tumor / lymph node. Response and progression were evaluated in this single study using the criteria &quot;changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions were defined&quot; in the same manner as in RECIST 1.1.
No results are reported as only 2 of the 6 subjects had fresh tissue collected after the first dose of panitumumab. The study was amended to remove the biopsy procedure due to the potential risk for the participants.</description>

    <measure>Nine (9) Month Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nine month progression-free survival (PFS) was defined from the time from enrollment to the first date of disease progression or death as a result of any cause. Progression was defined in the same manner as in RECIST 1.1: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5mm (the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Time was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for subjects who were still alive and have not progressed. The 9 month PFS rate is a percentage, representing the fraction of treated subjects who, after 9 months, are disease free or alive.</description>

        <title>Change in Tumor (Primary Tumor and Lymph Node) Response and Progression Between Pre- and Post- Panitumumab Therapy</title>
        <description>The aim of this outcome measure was to identify a gene expression signature that predicts response to panitumumab in untreated locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head / neck (SCCHN). Response and progression were evaluated using the largest percentage change among the cases: 1) Pre-panitumumab PET scan activity, and/or; 2) Pre-panitumumab radiologic measurement compared to post-panitumumab measurement and/or; 3) Pre-panitumumab direct measurement of tumor / lymph node compared to post-panitumumab direct measurement of tumor / lymph node. Response and progression were evaluated in this single study using the criteria &quot;changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions were defined&quot; in the same manner as in RECIST 1.1.
No results are reported as only 2 of the 6 subjects had fresh tissue collected after the first dose of panitumumab. The study was amended to remove the biopsy procedure due to the potential risk for the participants.</description>

        <description>Nine month progression-free survival (PFS) was defined from the time from enrollment to the first date of disease progression or death as a result of any cause. Progression was defined in the same manner as in RECIST 1.1: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5mm (the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Time was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for subjects who were still alive and have not progressed. The 9 month PFS rate is a percentage, representing the fraction of treated subjects who, after 9 months, are disease free or alive.</description>
