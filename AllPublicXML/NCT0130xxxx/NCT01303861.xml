  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on the first step in developing an algorithm for maximizing quit-smoking
      success based on an adaptive approach, which changes treatment from the initial nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT) when that treatment alone may not be sufficient. These NRT
      &quot;non-responders&quot; are switched (in double-blind fashion) before the quit date to receive
      either varenicline alone or varenicline paired with bupropion. Some participants who would
      otherwise have failed at their quit smoking attempt could be &quot;rescued&quot; by switching to
      alternative pharmacotherapies. The proposed study will evaluate the combination treatment
      against varenicline alone in an adaptive trial design

          <description>This group will consist of smokers who, based on smoking behavior, DO NOT respond favorably to pre-cessation nicotine patches (assessed at Session P2). They will receive varenicline.
Varenicline: For the first 3 days after being switched from nicotine patches (occurring at one week before the target quit date), smokers in this group will receive varenicline at a dose of 0.5 mg once per day followed by 0.5 mg twice a day for the remaining 4 days of that week.

Nicotine patches: Nicotine Replacement Therapy Groups:
For smokers with high baseline carbon monoxide (CO): 42 mg/24 h for 2 weeks before the quit date and 3 weeks after the quit date, 21 mg/24 h for 4 weeks, 14 mg/24 h for 2 weeks, and 7 mg/24 h for 2 weeks; or

Varenicline and varenicline in combination with bupropion groups:
