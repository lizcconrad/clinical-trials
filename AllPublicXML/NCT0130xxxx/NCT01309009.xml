      This phase IIa study is designed as a multi-centre, single country, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo controlled study in three parallel groups, with the aim to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Nepadutant given at two oral doses once daily for seven days in comparison to
      placebo in the treatment of infantile colic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infant colic is a functional gastrointestinal disorders which affects up to the 30% of the
      infant population; it is primarily characterised by excessive inconsolable crying starting
      without any apparent cause and lasting for several hours per day.

      Current non pharmacological interventions (e.g. message, restriction in maternal diet in
      breast-feeding infants) and pharmacological treatments (simethicone, antimuscarinic drugs)
      are largely unsatisfactory.

      In animal models, Nepadutant reverse the exaggerated intestinal motility and sensitivity,
      induced by different stimuli, without producing inhibitory effects on these functions at
      baseline, suggesting that Nepadutant could have a therapeutic effect with no interference on
      physiological gastrointestinal transit.

      This phase IIa study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Nepadutant paediatric oral
      solution given once daily at two doses in comparison to placebo.

      The experimental clinical phase encompasses the following periods:

        -  Screening period (no study medication) to be done 7 to 4 days prior to randomisation

        -  Treatment period, lasting seven days with once daily administration

        -  Post treatment period, lasting seven days A safety follow-up visit will be performed
           approximately 1 month after the first administered dose.
