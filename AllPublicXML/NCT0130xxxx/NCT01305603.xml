  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using Magnetic resonance (MR) scanning and ultrasonography the investigators wish to
      investigate, in what way a known volume of local anesthetic injectate will be distributed in
      the transverse abdominis plane (TAP) in young healthy male volunteers. The investigators
      compare the anatomical distribution of the local anesthetic injectate in the TAP when
      performing an ultrasound-guided classical TAP block and a Dual TAP block. The investigators
      also want to compare the spread of anesthetized frontal dermatomes when performing an
      ultrasound-guided classical TAP block and a Dual TAP block.

    <textblock>
      There has been much debate as to what extent the classical TAP block will anesthetize more
      than the frontal dermatomes (TH10-Th12/L1). Some cadaver studies have been performed with
      injection of dye in the classical TAP. However, it is still not clear whether a single
      injection of local anesthetic in the classical TAP block position will reach the more
      cephalad and medial intercostal TAP plexus (Th6-Th9). In this study the investigators use MR
      scanning and ultrasonography to investigate in what way a known volume of local anesthetic
      injectate will be distributed in the transverse abdominis plane (TAP) in young healthy male
      volunteers. The investigators compare the anatomical distribution of the local anesthetic
      injectate in the TAP when performing an ultrasound-guided classical TAP block and a Dual TAP
      block. The investigators also want to compare the spread of anesthetized frontal dermatomes
      when performing an ultrasound-guided classical TAP block and a Dual TAP block.
