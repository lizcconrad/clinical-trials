    <textblock>
      Previous studies have indicated that patient expectations, beliefs and preferences may have
      an impact on treatment outcomes. The KIVIS study was primarily designed to compare two
      effective treatments for knee osteoarthritis (tidal irrigation (medical washout of the knee)
      or intra-articular corticosteroid injection). At study entry any preference expressed by the
      patient for each of the treatment interventions was recorded. This study assessed the effects
      of two treatments given at a single time-point and hence the effects of patient preference
      could be assessed independently of any compliance issues.

    <intervention_name>TI of the knee</intervention_name>
    <description>This was done as a day case procedure under local anaesthetic. The medial patello-femoral approach was used. After full aseptic preparation, the skin and soft tissues were infiltrated with 5e10 ml of 1% lignocaine. The joint was then instilled with a further 10 ml of 1% lignocaine.
After an initial puncture using a scalpel, a 3.2 mm diameter wrist arthroscope was advanced into the joint cavity. Up to 1 l of 0.9% normal saline was then irrigated through the joint: saline was run into the joint until fully distended and then allowed to flow out of the joint in a cyclical method until the aspirated fluid runs clear for at least three successive cycles.</description>
