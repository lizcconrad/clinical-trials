      To examine the safety and toxicity of concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin with the further
      addition of cetuximab experimental treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional radiotherapy (65-70 Gy, 1.8 Gy per day) concurrently with weekly cisplatin
      (40mg/m2) (group A, n=25) or with weekly cisplatin (40mg/m2) and weekly cetuximab 250mg/m2,
      after initial dose of 400mg/m2) (group B, n=25) is applied (in a 1:1 randomization ratio).
      Groups will be matched age, sex, PS, and disease site.

    <measure>Response</measure>

    <description>Complete response (CR) is defined as the total disappearance of radiographic evidence of tumour. Partial response (PR) is defined as the ≥50% reduction in the product of the maximal bidimensional tumour diameters. Stable disease defined any change between +25% and -50% in tumour size, and progressive disease included any increase &gt;25% from baseline or the appearance of any new lesion. We record tumour shrinkage and time to the development of disease progression according to the revised RECIST criteria, v.1.1.</description>
