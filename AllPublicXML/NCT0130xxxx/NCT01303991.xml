      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of Hexaminolevulinate
      based photodynamic therapy in patients with intermediate or high-risk transitional cell
      carcinoma of the bladder.

    <textblock>
      Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is currently treated by transurethral resection (TURB)
      and/or fulguration. However, recurrence and progression rates following endoscopic treatment
      of visible lesions are significant. To prevent recurrent and progressive disease, adjuvant
      intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy are applied. There is also increasing interest in
      new therapeutic strategies such as photodynamic therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged 18 years or above who have given written informed consent.

          -  Patients with intermediate or high-risk superficial bladder cancer, defined as
             low-grade early recurrence within 6 months after local chemotherapy or BCG, primary or
             recurrent high-grade disease (TaG3, TaG3 with CIS or CIS alone) or patients with
             primary T1G3 who are tumour free at second resection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with muscle invasive tumour

          -  Patients with bladder shrinkage

          -  Patients who have received prior PDT for bladder cancer

          -  History of T1G3 disease or other indications for cystectomy

          -  Patient with porphyria

          -  Gross haematuria. (Note: Gross haematuria is defined as a heavy bladder bleed
             resulting in marked amounts of blood in the urine, which may interfere with PDT)

          -  Patients who have received BCG or chemotherapy within three months prior to Hexvix
             instillation, except for a single dose of chemotherapy for prevention of seeding after
             resection

          -  Known allergy to hexaminolevulinate or a similar compound

          -  Participation in other clinical studies either concurrently or within the last 30 days

          -  Women of child-bearing potential.

          -  Conditions associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance
