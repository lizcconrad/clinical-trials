  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Sculptra Aesthetic on the cosmetic
      rejuvenation of the midface complex. The investigators plan to both qualitatively determine
      the restoration of midface architecture as well as quantitatively document the change in
      midface volume by employing three-dimensional (3D) surface imaging which critically analyzes
      volumetric tissue changes. Our hypothesis is that patients who receive Sculptra Aesthetic
      injections will experience significant improvement in facial midface volume restoration.

        -  Measure the midfacial volumetric correction from Sculptra Aesthetic treatment, using
           three-dimensional digital surface imaging

        -  Determine the mean change from baseline in facial contour via quantitative volumetric
           measurements

        -  Correlate volumetric correction with clinical improvement as measured by the Facial
           Lipoatrophy Panel grading system

        -  Correlate the mean volumetric change in midfacial treatment area with the amount of
           product used

        -  Obtain photographs pre- and post-treatment for the purpose of providing a subject visual
           aid during the course of treatment

        -  Collect safety data
