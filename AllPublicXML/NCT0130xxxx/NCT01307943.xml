  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a group program in which participants are taught
      to be mindful or present-focused. MBSR programs consist of instruction in a variety of
      mindfulness meditations including body scan, sitting meditation, mindful yoga, and discussion
      of these practices. Our study purpose is to develop and conduct a pilot mixed-methods
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), combining clinical outcomes, qualitative interviews, and
      brain imaging to assess the impact of the intervention on children with mental health
      challenges.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be a 2 arm controlled clinical trial (CCT) comparing usual care to usual care
      plus MBSR. Participants will be residents of a local inpatient treatment facility for
      adolescents with serious mental health issues. Outcomes the investigators will measure
      include mental health status as well as mindfulness. The investigators will also conduct
      qualitative interviews to assess the personal impact of the intervention on the patients and
      their families. In order to map and measure cognitive changes during MBSR the investigators
      will conduct brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
      Event-Related Potential (ERP) recordings. Through this study the investigators will determine
      if MBSR is helpful to our population.

    <description>Eight MBSR sessions of 2 hrs/week to be held during regular class time plus one 3-hour retreat at the completion of the eight sessions to review and consolidate experience with the various mindfulness practices. The MBSR concepts and techniques will emphasize portability. Participants will be encouraged to find moments throughout their day in which to practice the techniques. The language used to describe mindfulness practices will be accessible to youth. Mindfulness concepts will be linked with tag phrases like &quot;breathing break,&quot; &quot;autopilot,&quot; and &quot;choice points.&quot; Homework will emphasize experiential, concrete tasks (&quot;notice five new things today&quot;; &quot;eat one meal mindfully this week&quot;).</description>

    <description>The control group will be youth receiving therapies and programs already used at the site. The site provides family centered treatment where adolescents take part in therapy from Sunday evening until Friday afternoon. In addition to a structured day and evening schedule, standard treatment includes: Daily group therapy; ii) Medications; iii) Schooling by Edmonton Public School Board teachers; iv) Physical education and recreation; and v) Weekly Multiple Family Therapy.</description>
