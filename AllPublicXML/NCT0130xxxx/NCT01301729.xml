  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Herceptin
      (trastuzumab) in combination with a taxane as first line therapy in participants with
      HER2-positive breast cancer who relapsed after neoadjuvant or adjuvant Herceptin treatment.
      Participants will receive Herceptin (loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously [iv], 2 mg/kg iv
      weekly thereafter) with 6 3-week cycles of either docetaxel (100 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks) or
      paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 every week). Herceptin treatment will be continued until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of informed consent to the date of death or progressive disease (up to 28 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 and was defined as the time from the date when the participant signed the informed consent form (ICF) until death or progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. PFS and associated confidence intervals were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was assessed using RECIST 1.0 and defined as the percentage of participants that achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 % decrease in the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions, no progress in the non-measurable disease, and no new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of PR or CR until the date of PD or death (up to 28 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from when a PR or CR was first documented until the date of documented PD or death. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 % decrease in the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions, no progress in the non-measurable disease, and no new lesions. PD was defined as 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from enrollment to the date of death (up to 28 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after last infusion of the study drug (28 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any adverse medical event that occurred after the participant used the investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other intervention behaviors specified by the protocol in the clinical trial regardless of relationship to the study treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate was assessed according to RECIST 1.0 and defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 % decrease in the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions, no progress in the non-measurable disease, and no new lesions. SD was defined as small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of enrollment until the date of progressive disease (up to 28 months)</time_frame>
