      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging evaluation in men with recurrent prostate cancer
      to select patients who may benefit from directed therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is improved imaging of prostate cancer by positron emission
      tomography (PET) with use of the radiopharmaceutical C-11 Acetate, utilizing state-of-the-art
      PET/CT camera technology and processing algorithms.

      A successful effort will lead to more accurate diagnosis of recurrence in patients with
      prostate cancer to allow for early directed therapy. This study is designed to generate data
      to add to the understanding of the effectiveness of C-11 Acetate, focusing on patients with
      recurrent or persistent disease after prostatectomy or radiation therapy.

      The study is designed to expand on the database of C11-Acetate PET imaging in patients with
      prior definitive therapy for prostate cancer and evidence of biochemical recurrence (post
      therapy rise in PSA), and to evaluate the relationship between detection on C11-Acetate PET
      imaging, PSA (Trigger, Velocity and Doubling Time) and FDG PET imaging.

      Specific questions to be addressed:

        1. What is the yield of current state-of-the-art PET/CT with C-11 Acetate in detecting
           recurrent disease in this patient population?

        2. How does the performance of PET with C-11 Acetate compare with that of PET using F-18
           fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET), Sodium F18 PET bone scans and with that of CT?

        3. What is the optimal imaging protocol in terms of imaging time after injection?
