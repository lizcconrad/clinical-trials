  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of losartan
      potassium 50 mg (L50) + hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (H12.5) + amlodipine besylate 5 mg (A5)
      (MK-0954E). The primary hypothesis is that L50/H12.5/A5 is more effective in lowering mean
      trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment compared to L50+A5
      in Japanese participants with essential hypertension who are not adequately controlled
      following an 8-week treatment with filter period study drug (L50+A5).

    <description>Sitting diastolic blood pressure was measured by automated sphygmomanometer pre-dose on Day 1 (baseline) and at 24 ± 2 hours after the last study drug administration at Week 8. The difference between the baseline and Week 8 assessments was calculated and summarized by treatment arm.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants who experienced at least 1 AE during the 10-week treatment and follow-up period were summarized by study drug received.</description>

Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. Percentage of participants that experienced at least 1 AE that was reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug by the investigator during the 10-week treatment and follow-up period were summarized by study drug received.</description>

    <description>An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor's product that does the following: results in death; is life threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a cancer; is associated with an overdose; is another important medical event. The percentage of participants who experienced at least 1 SAE during the 10-week treatment and follow-up period were summarized by study drug received.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Had Study Drug Stopped Due to an AE</title>
          <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants who had study drug stopped during the 8-week treatment period due to an AE regardless of whether or not they completed the study was summarized by treatment arm</description>
