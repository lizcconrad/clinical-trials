      radiation therapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This study evaluates the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who received treatment
      with stereotactic radiation for early stage lung cancer and who are at high risk for
      microscopic metastatic disease.

      Chemotherapy in the form of cisplatin/docetaxel or cisplatin/pemetrexed will be administered
      approximately six weeks after Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Patients will then
      undergo follow up clinical evaluation and imaging to evaluate treatment response and for
      surveillance.

      A patient population of 65 patients will be required. Enrollment in this protocol is planned
      by multi center involvement in the state of Kentucky as part of the Kentucky Trial Network
      (KTN).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

          -  Histologically diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC, cT1-T3 (&lt;= 5cm) (AJCC 7ed).
             The following histologies are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large
             cell carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine, or non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise
             specified; bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma is a subtype of NSCLC but will be
             excluded from this study because assessment of multifocal disease spread through the
             airways is difficult.

          -  Required CT of the chest and abdomen with contrast unless medically contraindicated
             (evaluating both lungs, mediastinum, liver, and adrenals) and Whole Body Positron
             Emission Tomography (PET) for staging. An integrated PET/Computed Tomography (CT) will
             meet the CT and PET requirements for staging. Images must be read by a trained
             radiologist and performed 8 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. PET imaging must
             allow adequate visualization of the primary tumor, draining lymphatics in hilar and
             mediastinum, adrenals, and skeleton.

        Note: Per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0915 inclusion criteria, patients with
        hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes ≤ 1cm and no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET
        will be considered N0. Patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or
        abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic uptake) may still be eligible if
        directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer.

          -  Deemed medically inoperable by an experienced thoracic cancer clinician for a standard
             lobectomy and lymph node sampling/dissection. Inoperability may be defined utilizing a
             number of criteria. These include any of the following:

          -  Pretreatment Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) &lt; 40% predicted

          -  Postoperative FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted

          -  Exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50% predicted

          -  Severe pulmonary hypertension

          -  Diabetes mellitus with severe end organ damage

          -  Severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease

          -  Decline surgery after evaluation by a thoracic surgeon

        Required laboratory values within 2 weeks of chemotherapy initiation

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 mm3

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3

          -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)- aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN}

          -  Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)- alanine transaminase(ALT) &lt; 5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  For patients assigned to pemetrexed/Cisplatin therapy calculated Creatinine Clearance
             (CrCl) must be obtained within 2 weeks of randomization and calculated CrCl must be &gt;
             45mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary lesion size not within the acceptable criteria

          -  Evidence of regional metastases or distant metastases following appropriate staging

          -  Previous radiation to the chest

          -  Chemotherapy within the previous five years

          -  Previous surgery for this particular lung tumor

          -  Plans for concomitant chemotherapy with radiation

          -  Active systemic or pulmonary infection

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Synchronous primary malignancy or prior malignancy in the past 2 years except for
             invasive malignancy that has been treated definitively and the patient remains disease
             free for &gt; 3 years with life expectancy &gt; 3 years. Previous skin cancers and carcinoma
             in situ treated definitively are acceptable.

          -  Patients assigned to pemetrexed/cisplatin therapy must NOT have squamous cell
             histology

          -  Bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma is excluded because assessment of multifocal disease
             spread through the airways is difficult

          -  Receipt of any other investigational agents or participation in any other
             investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding initiation of study treatment
