      PURPOSE:

      To evaluate the feasibility of a future Nordic intervention trial, including vigorous
      activity and a high intake of whole grain rye, among prostate cancer patients on active
      surveillance.

      Additionally, to investigate effects of the lifestyle intervention according to cancer
      progression, the metabolic profile, inflammation and quality of life among prostate cancer
      patients on active surveillance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present feasibility study it will be established whether it is possible to enroll
      participants for this particular kind of intervention among this particular patient group,
      and if compliance with the intervention is possible to gain by the tools planned: individual
      counselling with a dietician and a physiologist, interviews on diet, exercise tests and
      diaries on diet, exercise and steps taken.

      Furthermore, the investigators will investigate if we are able to detect effects of the
      lifestyle intervention according to cancer progression, the metabolic profile, inflammation
      and quality of life among the participants (24 men) within the short intervention period (6
      months) for this particular feasibility study.

      Biomarkers of effect and compliance are measured in blood, urine and prostate tissue samples.
      Metabolomics and the following biomarkers are measured in blood and urine samples: Alkyl
      resorcinols, enterolactone, tnf receptor 2, e-selectin. ICAM1, IL1-alpha, IL6, triglycerides,
      HDL/LDL, s-insulin, HbA1c, C-peptide, CRP, IGF1, GLP1, cholesterol, cathepsin and glucose.

    <description>Feasibility of an intervention trial is evaluated among Danish men with early stage prostate cancer. Enrollment of participants, possible for this particular type of trial among the particular patient group? Compliance with intervention, obtainable for intervention participants with the tools planned (counseling sessions, exercise programs, supply of rye products, sphygmographs and pedometers)? Does the design minimize drop out? Is the schedule for monitoring, counseling, testing and collection of biological samples efficient and feasible for the research team and for the participants?</description>
