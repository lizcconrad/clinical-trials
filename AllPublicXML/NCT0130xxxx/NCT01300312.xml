  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a fixed dose combination of
      diclofenac and eperisone hydrochloride compared with plain eperisone hydrochloride in
      patients with low back pain.

      This study is an observer-blind, prospective randomized, controlled study to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of fixed dose combination of eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and diclofenac
      sodium 50 mg three times daily with plain eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg three times daily in
      patients with musculoskeletal spasm associated with low back pain. A total of 240 adult
      patients of either sex, 120 patients in each arm, who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be included in this study. The patients will be evaluated at Days 3, 7 and 10
      of the study visit for efficacy and safety. The efficacy evaluation includes objective
      parameters like Finger-to-Floor distance, Lasegue's sign, tenderness of par vertebral
      muscles, lumbar and dorsal hypermyotonia, leg tendon reflexes, need for rescue medication and
      subjective parameters like improvement in lumbar cinesalgia, pain in lower extremities,
      sensory disturbances of lower limb, and Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (PGART).
      Patients will be evaluated for safety on the clinical adverse events reported during the
      study period, sedation on drowsy alert scale and Global Assessment of Tolerability to Therapy
      (PGATT). The patients will also be evaluated for laboratory safety as assessed by measuring
      laboratory parameters for hemogram, renal and hepatic parameters.

    <description>Improvement in the Fingertip-to-Floor-surface Distance [FFD] from baseline on Day 3, Day 7 &amp; Day 10. Finger Floor Distance [FFD] is an index for the mobility of the lumbar spinal cord and is measured as the distance between the finger-tip of the middle Finger to the Floor-surface as determined while standing with the spinal cord flexed with complete extension of knee joint. It is measured in millimeters.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, 3, 7 and 10 of study period</time_frame>
    <description>Lasegue's sign is the lumbar pain [or exacerbation of existing pain] experienced by the patient on passive movement of the legs during flexion of hip joint i.e. passive straight leg raising. It is assessed as either 'Positive' or 'Negative' sign.</description>
