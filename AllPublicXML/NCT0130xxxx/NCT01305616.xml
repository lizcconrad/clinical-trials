  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is mostly a disease of old people and is highly accompanied with cataract.Some of
      these patients may need to perform cataract surgery during the course of glaucoma. But in
      glaucoma patients, the effect of cataract surgery and/or type of implanted intraocular lens
      (IOL) on the results of specific visual field tests, like SWAP, is still not well
      studied.From the past decade, various yellow-tinted IOLs with the speculation of protecting
      the retinal photoreceptors and decreasing the incidence of age-related macular degeneration
      have been introduced.These blue-light-filtering IOLs contain a yellow chromophore that
      filters ultra violet (UV) and a larger part of the high-energetic visible blue-light between
      380 and 500 nm. Based on previous studies yellow-tinted IOLs decrease the amount of light
      transmission to the retina which may theoretically affect perimetry results. This might be
      even more important in patients with glaucoma where the sensitivity of test locations has
      decreased per se.

      Since early diagnosis of glaucoma and its progression is highly dependent on visual field
      results, it is important to evaluate the effect of these IOLs on perimetry, particularly on
      SWAP, in which the blue-light-filtering IOLs might interfere with its findings.
