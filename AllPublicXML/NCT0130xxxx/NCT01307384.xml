      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study designed to obtain
      survival and outcome data on the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System when used
      in primary total hip arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and performance of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular System will be
      confirmed by the assessment of survival and outcome data. Assessments will include standard
      scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records. Data will be used to monitor pain,
      mobility, and survivorship of the Continuum Metal on Polyethylene Acetabular system in
      primary total hip arthroplasty. Metal ion (cobalt, chromium and titanium) and renal function
      (BUN, Creatinine and GFR) levels will be analyzed for a subset of the enrolled study
      subjects.

        Patients from surgeons medical practice who are candidates for primary hip arthroplasty.

        The study population will be comprised of 300 males and females who require primary total
        hip arthroplasty. Subjects will be enrolled at up to 7 clinical sites. Subjects must be
        geographically accessible throughout the study and be willing and able to attend required
        follow-up appointments. Candidates who express interest in study participation will be
        offered informed consent, and eligibility will be determined based upon the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria.

          -  Patient is 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Patient is skeletally mature.

          -  Patient qualifies for primary unilateral or bilateral (simultaneous or staged) total
             hip arthroplasty (THA) based on physical exam and medical history including the
             following:

               -  Avascular necrosis (AVN)

               -  Osteoarthritis

               -  Inflammatory arthritis (i.e., Rheumatoid arthritis)

               -  Post-traumatic arthritis

          -  Patient has no history of previous prosthetic replacement device of any type,
             including surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis, etc. of the affected hip
             joint(s).

          -  Patient has moderate, marked or disabling pain.

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy.

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations as described
             in the Informed Consent.

          -  Patient has participated in the Informed Consent process and has signed the IRB
             approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Anticipated to be non-compliant

          -  The patient has a neuromuscular disorder, vascular disorder or other conditions that
             could contribute to prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure or
             complications in postoperative care.

          -  The patient has a neurologic condition in the ipsilateral or contralateral limb which
             affects lower limb function.

          -  The patient has a diagnosed systemic disease that could affect his/her safety or the
             study outcome.

          -  The patient is known to be pregnant.

          -  The patient has insufficient bone stock to fix the component. Insufficient bone stock
             exists in the presence of metabolic bone disease (i.e., osteoporosis), cancer, and
             radiation. Note: Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) may be used to assess the
             presence of adequate bone stock.

          -  The patient has osteoradionecrosis in the affected hip joint.

          -  The patient has a known sensitivity or allergic reaction to one or more of the
             implanted materials.

          -  The patient has known local bone tumors and/or cysts in the operative hip.

          -  The patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40.
