  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with high cholesterol levels are especially vulnerable and are at high risk for
      early onset coronary heart disease (CHD). Endothelial dysfunction, the earliest phase of CHD,
      is present in children with elevated cholesterol levels as early as 8 years of age. The long
      term objective of this study is to develop dietary interventions for the prevention and
      treatment of endothelial dysfunction in children with common lipid disorders including
      familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH). Increasing
      evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet and ω-3 fatty acids found in fish have
      cardioprotective effects. The specific aims of the study are to: determine whether a
      Mediterranean diet alone or combined with ω-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid)improves
      endothelial function; evaluate the effects of the dietary interventions on lipids and
      lipoprotein subclasses; evaluate the effects of the dietary interventions on biomarkers for
      oxidative stress and inflammation. This study is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that includes 34 children (ages 8-17) treated with the
      Mediterranean diet and ω-3 fatty acid supplements. A dietary educational behavioral
      intervention will be conducted over 6 months with individual counseling and group sessions.
      Endothelial function will be measured noninvasively by high resolution ultrasound of the
      brachial artery at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. This study is unique because it is a new
      intervention designed for children at high risk for early CHD with a dietary component and
      supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids. If effective, this intervention would be broadly
      applicable in the community and lend valuable insight about dietary therapy to prevent the
      progression of CHD in hyperlipidemic children.
