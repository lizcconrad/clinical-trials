      To investigate the effect of early WBVT on neuromuscular control after ACLR.

    <textblock>
      The knee joint position sense, postural control, muscular strength and functional ability
      after anterior cruciate ligament construction (ACLR) are distorted, and even after a period
      of rehabilitation.

      Previous studies had demonstrated that there was improvement in knee joint, postural balance,
      muscle strength and functional outcome in elderly, stroke and spastic patients already. It
      has also been concluded that the balance in elderly, postmenopausal women, Parkinson's
      disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and spastic patients were all significantly improved.
      Some studies showed that the proprioception in osteoarthritis patients significantly improve.
      Knee strength is also one of the aspect being improved.

      However, no studies focus on the early effect of WBVT on knee joint proprioception, postural
      control, muscle strength, knee joint stability and functional ability in ACLR cases. This
      study is to answer this research gap.
