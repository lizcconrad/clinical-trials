  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational study designed to collect early, short- and long-term clinical
      outcomes of the XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft for complex ventral hernia repair. Subjects will be
      expected to attend follow up visits at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To estimate the hernia recurrence rate of complex ventral hernias post repair with the XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft utilizing the component separation technique with several different tissue plane placements of the graft for up to 24 months post surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Any hernia which is identified or confirmed by the investigator in approximately the same position as the hernia repair during any follow up visit after a XenMatrix™ surgical graft has been placed will be considered a recurrent hernia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess perioperative, short-term and long-term complications in subjects with complex hernias repaired with XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft and component separation.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural and device related AEs collected from surgery until 24 months post surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the procedural time for XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft placement with component separation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Procedure time will be defined as beginning when the investigator makes the initial skin incision and ending when the skin closure is completed (skin to skin).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess changes in subject quality of life (QOL) post repair with a XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft with component separation.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in QOL will be assessed from baseline to 24 months utilizing the Short Form-36 (SF-36) version 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess clinical outcomes based on the tissue plane placement of the XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who have their grafts placed in different tissue planes will have their recurrence rate, complication type and frequency examined to determine if there are any gross differences.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be able to undergo study procedures.

          -  Have signed an Informed Consent form (ICF).

          -  Be diagnosed with a ventral or incisional hernia that cannot be closed primarily in
             the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Requires a component separation repair with the use of a biological graft.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is participating in another device or drug study.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy less than 4 years at the time of enrollment.

          -  Any condition in the opinion of the investigator that would preclude the use of the
             XenMatrix™ Surgical Graft, or preclude the subject from completing the follow-up
             requirements.

          -  Any subject with a defect the surgeon feels he/she cannot fully close.

          -  Subjects with a BMI &gt; 50.

          -  Subjects with connective tissue disorders.

          -  Subjects with a history of cirrhosis.

          -  Subjects with renal failure requiring dialysis.

          -  Subjects on or suspected to be placed on chemotherapy or systemic immunosuppressive
             medications during any part of the study.

          -  Transplant recipients.

          -  Subjects taking corticosteroids for &gt;6 months (pre or post surgery).

          -  Any bowel leak or infection that would preclude the use of the XenMatrix™ Surgical
             Graft in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  The subject lives approximately 2 hours away from the study site and compliance with
             follow up requirements will be difficult in the opinion of the investigator.
