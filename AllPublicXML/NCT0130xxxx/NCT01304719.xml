  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol aims to examine the effects of a computer-based intervention used in
      conjunction with existing Healthy Families America (HFA) home visitation programs on the
      challenges related to participant enrollment, retention, and motivation as well as parent and
      child outcomes.

      The present study aims to determine whether a computer-based intervention can provide
      augmentation of home visiting services to decrease the risk of child maltreatment. The
      computer-based software includes modules on motivation, Cognitive Retraining, and elements of
      the ecobehavioral SafeCare approach. A total of 420 mother-infant dyads from four Healthy
      Families America (HFA) sites will be randomly assigned to either treatment as usual,
      software-supplemented home visitation, or community control conditions. For families in the
      software-supplemented condition, home visitors will present the software to parents via a
      Tablet PC during regular home visits. All parents will be followed-up at 6, 12, and 18 months
      by independent and blinded research assistants. Parents are evaluated for maltreatment and
      maltreatment risks as measured by self-report, home visitor report, blinded independent
      observers, and statewide CPS data. If validated, the proposed intervention can provide
      augmentation of home visiting services with unprecedented ease of dissemination, at
      negligible additional cost, and with limitless potential for further development.
