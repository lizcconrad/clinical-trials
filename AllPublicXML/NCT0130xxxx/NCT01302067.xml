  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to confirm if 8mg of fesoterodine is more effective in reducing
      overactive bladder symptoms than 4mg of fesoterodine. In addition the study is designed to
      assess if the higher dose reduces the overall effect of overactive bladder on the subject's
      daily life more than the lower dose. The study also assesses the side effects and safety of
      the two doses.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PPBC: a self-administered, single-item, questionnaire that asks participants to describe their perception of their bladder-related problems. The PPBC assessment is rated on a 6-point scale: 1=no problems at all, 2=some very minor problems, 3=some minor problems, 4=moderate problems, 5=severe problems, 6=many severe problems. Improvement is defined as negative change from baseline.</description>

    <description>UPS: single-item, self-administered validated questionnaire. Participant answered: &quot;Which of the following would typically describe your experience when you have a desire to urinate?&quot; on a 3-point scale, 1=usually not able to hold urine; 2=usually able to hold urine (without leaking) until I reach a toilet if I go to the toilet immediately; 3= usually able to finish what I am doing before going to the toilet (without leaking). Change = observation minus baseline. Results categorized as Deterioration (Negative change); no change (Score change=0); improvement (Positive change).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>OAB-q: a self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire that assesses how much the participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated by participant on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Symptom bother score derived as sum of scores for questions 1-8; lowest possible raw score: 8; highest possible score: 48. Data analyzed based on transformation of the score to a 0 to 100 scale [(Actual total raw score - lowest possible value of raw score)/range]*100. Higher scores values indicative of greater symptom bother.</description>

Null hypothesis: mean change from BL in the number of UUI episodes per 24 hours in the 8mg group was same as 4mg group at Week 12.

        <description>OAB-q: a self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire that assesses how much the participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated by participant on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Symptom bother score derived as sum of scores for questions 1-8; lowest possible raw score: 8; highest possible score: 48. Data analyzed based on transformation of the score to a 0 to 100 scale [(Actual total raw score – lowest possible value of raw score)/range]*100. Higher scores values indicative of greater symptom bother.</description>

        <description>OAB-q: self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire, assesses how much participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Questions 9 to 33 constitute HRQL, includes domains: concern, coping, sleep, and social function. HRQL domain and total raw score derived as sum of scores. Transformed score range 0 to 100 (Total HRQL or domain) = [(Highest possible raw score-Actual total raw score)/Raw score range]*100. Higher transformed scores indicative of better HRQL.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL)-Social Interaction Domain and Total Score of Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) at Week 12.</title>
          <description>OAB-q: self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire, assesses how much participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Questions 9 to 33 constitute HRQL, includes domains: concern, coping, sleep, and social function. HRQL domain and total raw score derived as sum of scores. Transformed score range 0 to 100 (Total HRQL or domain) = [(Highest possible raw score-Actual total raw score)/Raw score range]*100. Higher transformed scores indicative of better HRQL.</description>
          <population>The FAS included all participants who took at least 1 dose of assigned study drug and had at least 1 BL or post-BL efficacy assessment. The analysis included participants with non-missing change from BL value at Week 12.</population>
