  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      of LUSEDRA® administered as a continuous infusion or bolus compared with continuous infusion
      of propofol injectable emulsion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacokinetic/
      pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between PK-Bispectral Index (BIS) and PK-Modified
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores following administration of
      LUSEDRA, administered as a bolus or by continuous infusion, with that of propofol injectable
      emulsion administered by continuous infusion, using compartmental modeling. The clinical
      practice of sedation spans an entire continuum of sedation, only a portion of which is
      currently addressed by the currently approved dose which is intended to provide a moderate
      level of sedation. Another goal of the current study is to support potential follow-up
      indications for fospropofol disodium, such as prolonged sedation in the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) and induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, which require higher doses. If
      successful, the data from this study would allow a direct comparison of propofol doses,
      delivered as fospropofol disodium or as propofol injectable emulsion, that provide the same
      sedation effect and directly compare concentration-effect relations of propofol liberated
      from fospropofol disodium with that delivered as propofol. The doses and infusion times for
      fospropofol disodium and propofol in this study were selected based on simulation results
      using an established PK/PD model developed from historical data. Data collected in the
      current study will be used to further refine the existing PK/PD model. To enhance the
      robustness of that model, the study design includes changes in dose over the duration of
      sedation in the three treatment groups.
