  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to primarily assess the effect of aliskiren on albuminuria in patients
      with non-diabetic nephropathy when treated with ramipril and volume intervention.

    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two 24-hour collections of urine were to be made at each study visit. The arithmetic mean of the two collections were planned to be used in the calculation of summary statistics and the statistical analyses.</description>

    <measure>Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At study entry, blood pressure (BP) was measured in both arms. If there was a clinically relevant difference in readings between arms (≥ 10 mmHg in systolic BP and/or ≥ 5 mmHg in diastolic BP), the arm with higher BP reading was used. If there was no clinically significant difference between arms, the non-dominant arm was used through out study. Systolic blood pressure were assessed after the patient rested quietly in the sitting position for at least 3 minutes. For each sitting assessment, blood pressure was assessed at least 3 times. From these assessments, msSBP was calculated. All BP measurements were to be performed on the same arm.</description>

    <description>All patients had to visit the main center for renal function measurements. The measurements were performed using the constant infusion method with I-iothalamate (IOT) and I-hippuran. GFR was calculated as the urinary clearance of IOT.</description>

If there was a clinically relevant difference in readings between arms (≥ 10 mmHg in systolic BP and/or ≥ 5 mmHg in diastolic BP), the arm with higher BP reading was used. If there was no clinically significant difference between arms, the non-dominant arm was used through out study. Systolic blood pressure were assessed after the patient rested quietly in the sitting position for at least 3 minutes. For each sitting assessment, blood pressure was assessed at least 3 times. From these assessments, msSBP was calculated. All BP measurements were to be performed on the same arm.</description>
