      The main objectives of this study is to measure the composition of five common types of dates
      (Fara'd, Lulu, Abu ouma'n, Dabbas and Khalas) and to calculate their Glycemic Indices (GI) of
      these dates tested in healthy and diabetic subjects. Thirteen healthy volunteers and ten
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the study.

      The dates' flesh composition analysis showed that the dates contain a high percentage of
      carbohydrate (total sugars, 65-68%).

      The measured mean glycemic indices of the dates among healthy individuals were 54.0, 53.5,
      46.3, 49.1 and 55.1 for Fara'd, Lulu, Abu Ouma'n, Dabbas and Khalas, respectively.
      Corresponding mean glycemic indices among individuals with type 2 diabetes were very similar
      46.1, 43.8, 51.8, 50.2, and 53.0. Thus the tested five varieties of the dates are classified
      as low glycemic index food items.

      The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has transitioned rapidly over the last 40 years. This has lead
      to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemia,
      hypertension, prediabetes and diabetes. Daily consumption of dates is the norm.The main
      objectives of this study is to measure the composition of five common types of dates (Fara'd,
      Lulu, Abu ouma'n, Dabbas and Khalas) and to calculate their Glycemic Indices (GI) of these
      dates tested equally in healthy and diabetic subjects. Thirteen healthy volunteers and ten
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the study. The dates' flesh
      composition analysis showed that the dates contain a high percentage of carbohydrate (total
      sugars, 65-68%).

      The measured mean glycemic indices of the dates among healthy individuals were 54.0, 53.5,
      46.3, 49.1 and 55.1 for Fara'd, Lulu, Abu Ouma'n, Dabbas and Khalas, respectively.
      Corresponding mean glycemic indices among individuals with type 2 diabetes were very similar
      46.1, 43.8, 51.8, 50.2, and 53.0. Thus the tested five varieties of the dates are classified
      as low glycemic index food items with potential health benefits for healthy and diabetic
      individuals alike.
