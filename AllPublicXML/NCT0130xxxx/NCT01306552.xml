      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined parent-student
      program for smoking prevention in 7th graders in Berlin schools.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hazardous health effects of smoking and second hand smoke are well known and published.
      Despite wide spread tobacco prevention campaigns and initiatives, the proportion of children
      and adolescents who smoke remains high, especially in Germany. Current research indicates
      that comprehensive strategies, especially with a parental involvement component, appear to be
      the most effective school-based smoking prevention programs.

      A popular smoking prevention program in the city of Berlin is the Karuna interactive show
      jumping course &quot;Still smoking or already alive?&quot; (&quot;Rauchst du noch oder lebst du schon?&quot;
      Mitmach - Parcours). This parcours was designed to teach facts about smoking and its
      health-damaging effects, its negative effects on physical appearance, to promote
      communication and to enhance participants' awareness of social pressure and their
      self-efficacy to deal with these situations. No study to date has evaluated its effectiveness
      in reducing smoking rates among participating students. The study aim is to test the
      effectiveness of an interactive combined student-parent intervention in 7th graders regarding
      the reduction of smoking rates among secondary school children aged 12-15 compared to no
      smoking prevention intervention using self-reported questionnaires. In addition, it will be
      tested whether the program that involves the combination of a student and a parent
      intervention is more effective in the reduction of smoking rates in comparison to a program
      without a parental intervention.

In addition, we will assess the acceptability of the program components.
Other secondary outcomes include:
Percentage of 7th graders that started smoking during the study period.
Percentage of 7th graders that stopped smoking during the study period.
Percentage of 7th graders that are smoking less at the 2 year assessment compared to baseline assessment.
Percentage of 7th graders that are smoking more at the 2 year assessment compared to baseline assessment.</description>

    <description>Schools randomized to intervention only (arm 1) will agree to visit the smoking prevention parcours offered by KARUNA e.V. (&quot;Rauchst Du noch oder lebst Du schon?&quot;).
One school class of students will visit the parcours once during a school day. The parcours takes approximately 3 hours to complete. The parcours consists of 7 interactive stations where a class of students learns about differences between smokers and non-smokers in terms of health status such as atherosclerosis prevalence, loss of smell or lung capacity and aging. Students also learn about the toxic ingredients in cigarettes. Each station includes a quiz to complete by each group of students. At the end of the parcours, a moderator will announce which group of students accumulated the most points. For more information on the contents of the parcours see http://www.karuna-prevents.de/index.php.</description>

    <description>Schools randomized to the student-parent intervention arm also will agree to visit the KARUNA e.V. smoking prevention parcours. In addition, the schools will agree to have one parents' night presented by trained health coaches informing parents about smoking prevention topics in youth during the school year. Trained health coaches will give an evaluated smoking prevention presentation for parents at the parents' nights at the end of the first school year. Also, participating parents will receive information about successful ways to prevent smoking and promote smoking cessation in their children once by mail.</description>
