  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of our study is to examine characteristics of bacteria that are
      discovered in urine from pediatric patients that utilize either LoFric® or non-LoFric®
      catheters for self intermittent catheterization. The investigators hypothesize that the
      hydrophilic nature of the LoFric® catheter will alter the microbial environment and reduce
      clinically significant urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic bladder compared
      to a similar population using standard catheters.

      Secondary outcomes will be comparing the incidence of clinical urinary tract infections
      between patients that use standard catheters and those that use LoFric catheters.

      Lastly, patient satisfaction using LoFric catheters compared to standard catheters will be
      assessed.

      The investigators will randomize patients with neurogenic bladder into 2 groups after the
      have been matched for age, gender and mobility.

      The first group will continue with their current intermittent catheterization system (a
      non-LoFric® catheter) while the second group will receive sufficient LoFric® catheters to
      complete the study. The investigators will collect the urine at the start of the study, and
      then at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months and sent for culture. If a child develops a urinary tract
      infection, the investigators will have the patient collect the urine and the urine will be
      cultured and the organism will be identified.

      Using an existing bladder cell line, the investigators will inoculate the bladder cells with
      any bacteria that grows from any sample and then determine the interleukin-6 response of the
      bladder cell line following inoculation with the bacteria. This will determine if the
      initiate a high or low cytokine response which the investigators have correlated to clinical
      risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection

      The investigators will provide a patient satisfaction survey at the start of the study, prior
      to randomization and at the completion of the study to determine satisfaction with LoFric®
      catheters.
