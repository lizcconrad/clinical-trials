    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to estimate the effect size of a contingency management
      procedure that reinforces walking at rates consistent with the American College of Sports
      Medicine recommendations of 10,000 or more steps per day in older adults. We expect that
      participants randomized to the contingency management intervention will increase walking to a
      greater degree than those assigned to a standard care condition.

    <description>Participants assigned to this condition will be instructed to wear a pedometer daily and scheduled for weekly meetings over for the next 12 weeks. Each week, they will be congratulated if they walked the target goal on any days, and encouraged to meet the goals for the upcoming week. However, they will not receive any tangible reinforcement for walking. The meetings will be brief (about 15 minutes) and will include discussions and handouts related to the health benefits of walking.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to this condition will be asked to wear a pedometer daily and scheduled for weekly meetings over for the next 12 weeks. The meeting duration and structure will be similar to that in the standard treatment condition including the handouts, with one exception. Participants in this condition will earn tangible reinforcement in the form of prizes for walking the target number of steps per day.</description>
