    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to test whether a long-term exercise program in
      sedentary Veterans with diabetes will produce sustained improvement in mobility performance
      and physical activity. In this proposed research, 240 sedentary older adult diabetics (aged
      60 and over) will be randomly allocated into a customized, primarily home-based,
      functionally-oriented exercise program with nurse support intervention (I) group versus a
      flexibility and toning, health education control (C) group, and test outcomes in functional
      mobility and physical activity at 4 weeks, 6 months and one year. This research can lead to
      an exercise/PA enhancement program that can coordinate with VA outreach programs, targeting
      older Veterans who are not in the immediate vicinity of a major VA site. Ultimately, this
      should create a model to which physicians and other providers could refer comorbid diabetes
      patients.

      The goal of the proposed research is to test whether a long-term exercise program in
      sedentary Veterans with diabetes will produce sustained improvement in mobility performance
      and physical activity. To facilitate adherence to a long-term program, the investigators plan
      an individualized, home exercise/physical activity (PA) enhancement program with behavioral
      support. The rationale for this program is based on: 1) the feasibility of a previously
      funded VA RR&amp;D controlled trial (led by the present research team) in sedentary older adults
      with diabetes that improved mobility performance, specifically usual gait speed; 2) the need
      for longer term and functionally-relevant interventions (specifically mobility-oriented) for
      older adult diabetics; 3) the potential to use telephonic nurse support to assist in
      overcoming barriers to exercise and in dealing with intercurrent illness, factors that are
      key in this comorbid patient group; and 4) the potential to increase the focus on objectively
      measured physical activity. In this proposed research, 240 sedentary older adult diabetics
      (aged 60 and over) will be randomly allocated into a customized, primarily home-based,
      functionally-oriented exercise program with nurse support intervention (I) group versus a
      flexibility and toning, health education control (C) group, and test outcomes in functional
      mobility and physical activity at 4 weeks, 6 months and one year.
