    <time_frame>0-10 minutes after dextrose bolus on Day 3 postdose</time_frame>
    <description>On Day 1 of each treatment period, all participants (healthy or with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) received a single subcutaneous dose of either LY2189265 or placebo. On Day 3 of each treatment period, participants underwent a 6-hour insulin infusion, followed by an intravenous (IV) dextrose 50% bolus to stimulate insulin secretion. Three hours later, participants were administered a second dextrose bolus, followed by an infusion of 20% dextrose and, 15 minutes after the start of the 20% dextrose infusion, a 1-mg glucagon bolus was administered. Maximum plasma insulin concentration from 0 to 10 minutes (INSCmax[0-10]) following the first dextrose bolus (the first phase response) was corrected for baseline, where baseline was the mean of the insulin concentrations obtained between -30 and 0 minutes relative to the first dextrose bolus.</description>

On Day 3 of each period, participants received a 6-hour (hr) insulin infusion, followed by an intravenous (IV) dextrose bolus (50% dextrose bolus, 0.3 gram/kilogram [g/kg] over approximately 2 minutes [min]). Three hr later, a 2nd IV dextrose bolus 25 g of 50% dextrose or a suitably adjusted dose according to glycemic status (20 g of 50% dextrose for participants with 3-hr glucose between 5.2 and 10 millimole/liter [mmol/L] or 15 g of 50% dextrose for participants with 3-hr glucose &gt;10 mmol/L) was administered, followed by a 20% dextrose at the set infusion rate of 600 milliliter/hr [mL/hr] for 35 min. Fifteen min after the start of the 20% dextrose infusion, an IV 1-mg glucagon bolus was administered.
There was a washout period of ≥28 days between Periods 1 &amp; 2.</description>

        <title>Maximum Insulin Concentration (Cmax) - First Phase Response</title>
        <description>On Day 1 of each treatment period, all participants (healthy or with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) received a single subcutaneous dose of either LY2189265 or placebo. On Day 3 of each treatment period, participants underwent a 6-hour insulin infusion, followed by an intravenous (IV) dextrose 50% bolus to stimulate insulin secretion. Three hours later, participants were administered a second dextrose bolus, followed by an infusion of 20% dextrose and, 15 minutes after the start of the 20% dextrose infusion, a 1-mg glucagon bolus was administered. Maximum plasma insulin concentration from 0 to 10 minutes (INSCmax[0-10]) following the first dextrose bolus (the first phase response) was corrected for baseline, where baseline was the mean of the insulin concentrations obtained between -30 and 0 minutes relative to the first dextrose bolus.</description>

        <title>Insulin Area Under the Curve (AUC) - Second Phase Response</title>
        <description>On Day 1 of each treatment period, all participants (healthy or with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) received a single subcutaneous dose of either LY2189265 or placebo. On Day 3 of each treatment period, participants underwent a 6-hour insulin infusion, followed by an intravenous (IV) dextrose 50% bolus to stimulate insulin secretion. Three hours later, participants were administered a second dextrose bolus, followed by an infusion of 20% dextrose and, 15 minutes after the start of the 20% dextrose infusion, a 1-mg glucagon bolus was administered. Area under the plasma insulin concentration time curve from 10 to 180 minutes (INSAUC[10-180]) following the first dextrose bolus (the second phase response) was corrected for baseline, where baseline was the mean of the insulin concentrations obtained between -30 and 0 minutes relative to the first dextrose bolus.</description>
