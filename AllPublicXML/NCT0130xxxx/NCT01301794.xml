  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High levels of triglycerides is a common abnormality found in patients with diabetes and also
      cardiovascular disease, and may contribute to the risk for both. Omega 3 fatty acids, as
      found enriched in fish and also in the commercial agent called Lovaza lower triglyceride
      levels. Prior work from the investigators group demonstrated that an enzyme responsible for
      the break down of triglycerides - lipoprotein lipase - generates molecules that can activate
      a specific nuclear receptor known as PPAR-alpha. This study investigates the hypothesis that
      taking Lovaza shifts the specific fatty acid content of triglyceride containing lipoproteins
      and increases the ability of those lipoproteins to activate PPAR-alpha.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate changes in lipid and other metabolic parameters as well as the
      ability of isolated lipoproteins to activate PPARs in the presence or absence of lipoprotein
      lipase in a cohort of normal healthy individuals with modest hypertriglyceridemia before and
      after a course of Lovaza.

    <measure>Changes in lipoprotein metabolite content and their ability to activate PPAR-alpha in an established cell culture system.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Enrolled subjects will serve as their own controls and will be studied at baseline and after 3 months of Lovaza. The primary endpoint will test changes in lipoproteins as a function of their content and ability to activate PPAR-alpha in standard transfected cell culture systems.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will also be studied before and after Lovaza for changes in lipid profile and c- reactive protein</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in plasma markers of diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma markers of diabetes will be measure before and after Lovaza treatment for 3 months, specifically glucose and A1C levels</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in plasma markers of liver function</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma levels of liver function tests, specifically ALT and AST before and after 3 months of Lovaza.
This is not a safety issue since elevated triglycerides can cause increased liver function tests and fish oil (like Lovaza) can lower triglyceride levels and hence ALT and AST levels.</description>
