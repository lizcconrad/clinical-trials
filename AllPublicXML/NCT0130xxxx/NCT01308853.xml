  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective is to develop an injection technique for placement of the implant posterior to the mammary gland. This will be documented through MRI 1-5 days after the injection and evaluated by the Expert Group 6 weeks after treatment.</measure>
    <description>Inclusion was made in steps, each step incl. treatment of 2 subjects at each of the 2 sites (1 group). The subjects were followed-up with MRI 1-5 days after the injection. Before the next group of 4 subjects were treated, the Expert Group evaluated the 6-week follow-up results of the previous group. The injection procedure was, if necessary, changed in accordance with specifically pre-defined parameters.The aim of the step-wise inclusion was to refine the injection procedure through implant placement assessment, and to evaluate safety and the esthetic results prior to treating the next group.</description>
