  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective, multicenter study is designed to collect tumor characteristics as well as
      treatment data from patients diagnosed with primary or recurrent squamous cell cancer of the
      vulva with emphasis on indication and application of radio- and chemotherapy. Application of
      chemotherapy in primary treatment of vulvar cancer is rare; the study collective is therefore
      extended to relapsed disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with primary squamous cell cancer of the vulva &gt; stage Ia who were diagnosed and
      received treatment between 1998 and 2008 at the participating centres will be included in the
      study. Furthermore patients with recurrent disease diagnosed and treated at the participating
      centres during the same time period can be included given that they not only underwent
      surgical excision for treatment.

      For centers with restricted resources for data entry an alternative study collective was
      defined:

      All Patients with primary or relapsed squamous cell vulvar cancer receiving radio- and/or
      chemotherapy for treatment at the participating centres between 1998 and 2008 will be
      included in the study. This also includes node negative patients receiving radio/chemotherapy
      for other reasons.

      The participating centers themselves have to decide which study collective they are
      documenting, dependent on their available resources.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with primary squamous cell vulvar cancer except stage Ia disease regardless
             of the received treatment

          2. Patients with recurrent squamous cell vulvar cancer, if the relapse was not only
             treated with a surgical excision.

          3. Or alternatively, dependent on the decision of the participating center:

             -Patients with primary or relapsed squamous cell vulvar cancer receiving radio- and/or
             chemotherapy for treatment regardless of nodal involvement.

          4. Patients who were diagnosed with and treated for primary or relapsed vulvar cancer
             between 1998 and 2008

          5. Women aged â‰¥ 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with benign or precursor lesions (VIN - vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia) of
             the vulva

          2. Patients with non-squamous neoplasia of the vulva (e.g. melanoma)

          3. Patients with verrucous vulvar cancer

          4. Patients with relapsed squamous cell vulvar cancer only receiving surgical excision
             for treatment.

          5. Patients with secondary cancers if those interfered with the treatment of vulvar
             disease
