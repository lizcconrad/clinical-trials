        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prehypertensive: Having systolic BP between 120 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP
             between 80 to 89 mmHg during screening visit. BP will be measured manually tree times
             at 10 minutes interval after subjects sit quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair.
             The average of last two BP measurements will be taken into consideration.

          -  Male or female of Caucasian or African-American origin.

          -  No history of any major past and current medical illness (such as diabetes, renal
             disease, liver disease etc.)

          -  Not taking any medication that affects blood pressure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HbA1C &gt; 7.0 % during screening visit.

          -  Serum potassium &gt; 5.5 mEq/L during screening and/or any testing visit due to risk of
             developing hyperkalemia.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/100 ml and/or creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min* (Glomerular
             Filtration Rate Estimate by Abbreviated MDRD Study Equation)35 during screening and/or
             any testing visit due to risk of developing renal dysfunction.

          -  Female having positive pregnancy test during screening and/or any testing visit.
