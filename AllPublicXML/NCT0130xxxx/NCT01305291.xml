    <textblock>
      Emerging research suggests fiber, particularly digestion-resistant maltodextrins such as
      Fibersol-2, may impact satiety, by decreasing hunger, prolonging satiation, and/or increasing
      satiety signals from the gut. This research aims to determine whether or not Fibersol-2 may
      impact satiety, by decreasing hunger, prolonging satiation, and/or increasing satiety signals
      from the gut.

    <description>On the day before the test, subjects need to consume their evening meal before 9 pm, and fast until the start of the test the next day.
The evening meal will be a standardized meal for all subjects (11).
They are allowed to consume water up until 1 hr before the test.
Before the start of the test a cannula will be inserted into the ante-cubital arm vein for use of repeated blood sampling (11).
The beverage will be consumed at 10 am.
Blood samples will be taken at specified time points prior to after the treatments.</description>
