      The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of 1gram/day intravenous pulses of
      methylprednisolone on 3 consecutive days in Behcet's patients with ocular involvement. A
      total of 34 Behcet's patients referring to Behcet's clinic in Shariati hospital whose problem
      was confirmed with new international criteria of Behcet's disease (ICBD) will be randomly
      assigned into one of the two equal groups of intervention or control. Behcet's patients are
      those with ocular involvement who were under the same cytotoxic treatment with
      cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. For the patients in the intervention group, intravenous
      infusion of 1000 mg methylprednisolone in 100cc D/w 5% or 100cc D/w5% on 3 consecutive days
      will be added to treatment diet. Then treatment will begin with oral prednisolone, 0.5 mg/kg.
      After that, all the patients were followed up with no other therapeutic intervention by study
      group. The patients will be visited every 2 months by an ophthalmologist and study group for
      6 months in 3 settings. To estimate the ocular inflammation of patients, we use visual
      acuity, retinal and ocular posterior chamber inflammation index.
