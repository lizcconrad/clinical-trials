      This phase I trial will use the combination of irinotecan and BKM120 in patients with
      advanced colorectal cancer who have failed on or have become intolerant of at least one line
      of therapy for advanced colorectal cancer and who are candidates for irinotecan therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved in the last two
      decades, the overwhelming majority of these patients will still succumb from this disease. It
      is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. We have witnessed
      significant leaps in understanding colorectal cancer carcinogenesis as well as in
      identification of a number of prognostic and predictive factors associated with this
      malignancy. With the use of combination chemotherapy and the addition of targeted agents, the
      median survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved from 4-6 months with
      supportive care to over 2 years.

      Molecularly directed therapy for cancer holds promise to a more personalized approach to
      treating cancer. Increase understanding of tumorigenesis has resulted in the identification
      of promising targets of therapy for more strategic approach to treatment of this malignancy.
      However, even with the development of molecularly directed treatment, the therapy for
      advanced colorectal cancer remains to be primarily palliative in nature to majority of
      patients. There is definite need for a more effective therapy, agents with more acceptable
      toxicity profiles, and drugs that could be administered without significant demand on time
      and activity for individual patients receiving these drugs.

      This is a phase I trial of the combination of irinotecan and BKM120 in patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer who have failed on or have become intolerant of at least one line of
      therapy for advanced colorectal cancer and who are candidates for irinotecan therapy. This
      study will attempt to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose of the combination of irinotecan
      and BKM120.

             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (eg age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 8 days
             after stopping treatment and for additional 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation.
             Highly effective contraception is defined as: true abstinence: Periodic abstinence
             (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
             absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised
             male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

          -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b): Placement of an intrauterine
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or
             Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository; Oral contraception, injected or implanted
             hormonal methods are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of
             hormonal contraceptives.

          -  Fertile males must use condom during treatment, for 8 days after stopping treatment
             and for additional 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation and should not father a
             child in this period.

          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell skin carcinoma
             or excised cervical carcinoma in situ

          -  Previous treatment with Irinotecan who have definite progression on Irinotecan.
