  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excelsior Medical has developed SwabCap™, a luer access valve disinfection cap. The SwabCap™
      provides passive disinfection of valve top and threads without activating the luer access
      valve. This product promotes technique standardization and compliance in cleansing of the
      luer access valve prior to access. It acts as a physical barrier from touch and airborne
      contamination for up to 96 hours. This product has been endorsed and will be adopted for use
      at NorthShore University HealthSystem as a quality improvement initiative. This research
      study protocol is designed to confirm the anticipated benefit of this change in practice at
      NorthShore during the planned implementation and use.

      If the product performs as it has been designed to, the baseline rate of hub and subsequently
      intraluminal contamination will be diminished, thereby protecting patients with central lines
      from bloodstream infections due to contaminated hubs.

    <description>For the research project, we will monitor the colonization of access port colonization in routine as well as SwabCap™ cared for lines as follows:
Specimen sampling will be done by obtaining one specimen of 1.0 mL of aspirate will be withdrawn from each unused catheter lumen during first morning rounds in a separate syringe; then placed in a epdiatric Isolator tube.</description>
