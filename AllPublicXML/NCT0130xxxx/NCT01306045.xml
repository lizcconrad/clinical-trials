  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The current standard of care for advanced lung cancer and cancers of the thymus consists
      primarily of chemotherapy treatment. The drugs used for chemotherapy depend on the
      classification of the cancer in different categories that are based on the appearance of the
      cancer in the microscope. Though this approach has been proved to be useful in some ways, the
      survival rates of individuals with lung cancer and cancers of the thymus are still very poor.
      Recent research has shown that several genetic abnormalities play an important role in the
      development and growth of lung cancer and cancers of the thymus, and that it is possible to
      improve treatment success rates with drugs that specifically target some of the abnormal
      genes. Researchers are interested in determining whether it is possible to analyze the genes
      of patients with lung cancer and cancers of the thymus in order to provide personalized
      treatment with drugs that target the specific gene abnormalities.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of genetic analysis in determining targeted therapy for
      individuals with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and thymic
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with either lung cancer or a
      cancer of the thymus that is not considered to be curable with the use of surgery or
      radiation therapy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination,
           blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy
           or provide previously collected tumor tissue for study.

        -  Based on the results of the tumor biopsy study, participants will be separated into
           different treatment groups:

        -  Participants with EGFR gene mutation will receive a drug called erlotinib, which
           inhibits a protein called EGFR that is thought to be a key factor in the development and
           progression of some cancers.

        -  Participants with KRAS, BRAF, HRAS, or NRAF gene mutations will receive a drug called
           AZD6244, which inhibits a protein called MEK that is thought to be a key factor in the
           development and progression of some cancers.

        -  Participants with PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN gene mutations will receive a drug called
           MK-2206, which inhibits a protein called AKT that is thought to be a key factor in the
           development and progression of some cancers.

        -  Participants with KIT or PDGFRA gene mutations will receive a drug called sunitinib,
           which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the development and
           progression of some cancers, including kidney cancer.

        -  Participants who have ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification will receive a drug called
           lapatinib, which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the
           development and progression of some cancers, including breast cancer.

        -  Participants who do not have any of the genetic abnormalities described above will be
           offered different options for treatment, including standard of care chemotherapy or
           treatment with investigational agents in a different research protocol.

        -  After 6 weeks of treatment, participants will have imaging studies to evaluate the
           status of their cancer. Treatment will continue as long as participants tolerate the
           drugs and the disease does not progress.

        -  Participants who benefit from the first treatment but eventually develop resistance and
           progression of their cancer will be offered the chance to have a second tumor biopsy and
           undergo a different treatment for their cancer.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  A better understanding of the genetic make-up of the individual tumor may offer
           potentially improved therapies. This approach may also give rapid access to response
           data in patients with sometimes rare genetic abnormalities.

        -  In addition, it will allow us to test targeted therapies in a select population of
           patients that is more likely to have a favorable response based on their molecular
           profile and the specific mechanism of action of the drug being tested.

        -  This approach will also speed up drug development and potentially approval, and rescue
           an otherwise ineffective drug candidate for the specific subgroup that can benefit.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility of the use of tumor s molecular profiling and targeted
           therapies in the treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small
           cell lung cancer (SCLC) and thymic malignancies.

        -  To estimate the response rate of molecular-profile directed treatments in NSCLC, SCLC
           and thymic malignancies patients.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced lung cancer or thymic malignancies for
           whom surgical resection with curative intent is not feasible.

        -  Patients must either have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for

      molecular profiling or have paraffin embedded tissue blocks suitable for molecular

      profiling analysis.

        -  Individuals are eligible for EGFR germline mutation testing if they have:

        -  a personal history of invasive lung cancer or one of the pre-invasive histologies

      associated with the development of lung cancer and more than two affected family

      DESIGN:

        -  All patients will have their tumors undergo molecular profiling. Based on these results
           and on other eligibility criteria, the patients will be offered enrollment into
           different targeted therapy arms.

        -  At the NCI site only, individuals eligible for EGFR germline mutation will undergo
           testing for germline mutations affecting the EGFR gene; if a mutation is detected, their
           first-degree relatives would be invited to undergo testing for the index germline
           mutation found in the proband and appropriate follow-up on trial.

        -  Effective with Amendment I, the participating site, OHSU, will discontinue new
           enrollments and data entry for existing patients on the NOS arm on this protocol in
           favor of the OHSU protocol L8639, Personalized Cancer Medicine Registry. The data from
           these patients will be included with the data from 11-C-0096 (8639) NCI patients at the
           time of publication. Any OHSU patients who are eligible for a treatment arm will
           continue to be enrolled and followed per protocol.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIAL ENROLLMENT:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, SCLC and thymic malignancies
             for whom surgical resection or multimodality therapy with curative intent is not
             feasible. For patients with Stage III NSCLC, who can be encompassed by a radiation
             port, definitive XRT should have been performed first when possible.

          -  Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for EGFR germline mutation testing but
             who do not have advanced cancer as defined in 3.1.1 may enroll for EGFR germline
             mutation testing only and will not be eligible for the treatment or NOS arms.

          -  Patients with advanced cancer must meet one of the following criteria (does not apply
             to firstdegree relatives or individuals with pre-invasive histology enrolling only for
             EGFR germline mutation testing):

               -  Patients must have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for
                  molecular profiling

        OR

        -Patients must have enough and adequate archival material from a previous biopsy to perform
        molecular profiling analyses. The adequacy of the material provided will be determined by
        the principal investigator in conjunction with the laboratories performing the molecular
        profiling analyses

        OR

          -  Patients must have previously undergone a successful molecular profiling of their
             tumor with mutation analysis of the genes described in section 5.2, as part of this
             protocol (crossover patients) or other molecular profiling protocols such as the Lung
             Cancer Mutation Consortium protocol among others.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who have had major surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior
             to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or other medications
             for the treatment of their malignancy.

          3. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain
             metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 1 week after the end of
             brain radiation may be enrolled to undergo molecular profiling at the discretion of
             the principal investigator. In addition, brain metastatic disease should be stable for
             at least 4 weeks, before the patients can be enrolled in any of the experimental
             treatment arms.

          4. Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their
             ability to swallow and retain tablets are excluded.

          5. Any uncontrolled medical illness that precludes the patient from undergoing a biopsy
             for molecular profiling and / or receiving treatment under one of the experimental
             arms of the study should be excluded. These conditions include but are not limited to:

               -  Ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III or IV as
                  defined by the NYHA functional classification system (see Appendix D).

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Cardiac arrhythmia

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes

               -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
                  with study requirements.

          6. Patients with QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than 500
             msec) or other significant ECG abnormalities are excluded.

          7. Caution should be used if patients are required to use a concomitant medication that
             can prolong the QT interval and efforts should be made to switch to a different
             medication before the patient begins treatment under an experimental arm. See Appendix
             E for a table of medications with the potential to prolong the QTc interval. A
             comprehensive list of agents with the potential to cause QTc prolongation can be found
             at: http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/bycategory.cfm

          8. The eligibility of patients taking medications that are potent inducers or inhibitors
             of that enzyme will be determined following a review of their case by the Principal
             Investigator. (A list of potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors can be found in Appendix
             F). Every effort should be made to switch patients taking such agents or substances to
             other medications before they begin treatment with one of the experimental drug
             included in this protocol, particularly patients with gliomas or brain metastases who
             are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents. A comprehensive list of medications
             and substances known or with the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib
             through CYP3A4 is provided in Appendix F.

          9. Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the
             investigator.

         10. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because many of the FDA approved agents
             and investigational agents in this trial have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated in this protocol. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
