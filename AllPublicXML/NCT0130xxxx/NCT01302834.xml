      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more
      effective with cisplatin or cetuximab in treating oropharyngeal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying radiation therapy with cisplatin or cetuximab to
      see how well it works in treating patients with oropharyngeal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether substitution of cisplatin with cetuximab will result in comparable
           5-year overall survival.

      Secondary

        -  To monitor and compare progression-free survival for &quot;safety&quot;.

        -  To compare patterns of failure (locoregional vs distant).

        -  To compare acute toxicity profiles (and overall toxicity burden).

        -  To compare overall quality of life (QOL) short-term (&lt; 6 months) and long-term (2
           years).

        -  To compare QOL Swallowing Domains short-term and long-term.

        -  To compare clinician-reported versus patient-reported CTCAE toxicity events.

        -  To explore differences in the cost effectiveness of cetuximab as compared to cisplatin.

        -  To explore differences in work status and time to return to work.

        -  To compare patient-reported changes in hearing.

        -  To compare CTCAE v. 4 late toxicity at 1, 2, and 5 years.

        -  To evaluate the effect of tobacco exposure (and other exposures) as measured by
           standardized computer-assisted self interview (CASI) on overall survival and
           progression-free survival.

        -  To pilot CASI collection of patient reported outcomes in a cooperative group setting.

        -  To determine whether specific molecular profiles are associated with overall or
           progression-free survival.

        -  To investigate associations between changes in serum biomarkers or HPV-specific cellular
           immune responses measured at baseline and three months with overall or progression-free
           survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to T stage (T1-2 vs T
      3-4), N stage (N0-2a vs N2b-3), Zubrod performance status (0 vs 1), and smoking history (≤ 10
      pack-years vs &gt; 10 pack-years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once
           daily on days 1-4 and twice daily on day 5 weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also receive
           high-dose cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 22.

        -  Arm II: Beginning 1 week prior to IMRT, patients receive cetuximab IV over 2 hours.
           Patients then receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 7 weeks. Patients undergo
           IMRT as in arm I.

      Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected at baseline and may also be collected at 3- and
      6-month follow-up visits for correlative studies.

      Patients may complete quality-of-life questionnaires and risk factors for head and neck
      cancer surveys at baseline, periodically during study, and at follow-up for 1 year.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1-3 months, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
