    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female and between the ages of 18 and 80 years old, inclusive.

          -  Subject requires a primary total knee replacement and is considered by the
             Investigator to be suitable for the specific knee prosthesis identified in the
             protocol.

          -  Subject has given voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this clinical
             investigation and has authorized the transfer of his/her information to DePuy

          -  Subject, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, is able to understand this
             clinical investigation, and co-operate with investigational procedures.

          -  Subject, who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are suitable for
             implantation using TruMatch™ instrumentation. For example, no femoral nails/bone
             plates that extend into the knee, ie. within 8cm of joint line; no metal device that
             could cause CT scatter about the knee and no deformities greater than 15 degrees of
             fixed varus, valgus, or flexion contracture are consistent with TruMatch™
             instrumentation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The Subject is a woman who is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The Subject has participated in a clinical investigation with an investigational
             product in the last 3 months.

          -  The Subject is currently involved in any personal injury litigation, medical-legal or
             worker's compensations claims.

          -  The Subject has previously had a prosthetic knee replacement device (any type) of the
             affected knee.

          -  The Subject requires simultaneous bilateral total knee replacements.

          -  The Subject had a contralateral TKA and that knee was previously entered in the study.

          -  Subject in whom the surgeon intends to implant a knee prosthesis that is not in the
             PFC Sigma primary knee system.

          -  Subject who has inflammatory arthritis.

          -  Subject who has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥ 40. (Please see Table 2-1: Definition of
             Terms, for BMI definition and calculation formulas).

            <groups_desc>The null hypothesis was no difference in skin-to-skin time. The alternative hypothesis was that the TruMatch group time was less than the conventional group. Statistical power was anticipated to be 86% with 40 enrolled subjects based upon a Cohen's D effect size of 1. The Sponsor had difficulty identifying and recruiting sites suitable for participation. The statistically required sample size (N=40) was therefore not obtained, causing the group comparison to be statistically underpowered.</groups_desc>

TruMatch® is a pair of custom-made cutting blocks that allow distal femoral and proximal tibial cuts to be made according to a predefined surgical plan. The inner surface of the femoral block is manufactured to match the geometry of the patients' distal femur.
