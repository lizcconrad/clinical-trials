    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment for advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma 6-8 cycles of ABVD
      chemotherapy-this cures 70-80% patients. Those not cured after 8 cycles of ABVD have a poor
      outcome (&lt;10% survival). More intensive chemotherapy like Escalated BEACOPP (EB) achieve
      higher cure rates have more side effects. Hence the investigators propose to use Interim PET
      CT scan (done after 2 cycles of ABVD) for early identification of poor responders (it is
      known that those with interim PET positive disease have a cure rate of less than 10-15% if
      continued with ABVD alone) and to use EB selectively in this population in an attempt to
      improve treatment outcomes - at the same time to limit side effects of therapy.

      Thus, this study is an attempt to improve the outcome in the small subset of poor responders
      to ABVD chemotherapy by the early use of Escalated BEACOPP chemotherapy

    <description>Escalated BEACOPP chemotherapy will be delivered for those patients who are interim PET CT positive after 2 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy. The patients will receive 2-4 cycles of Escalated BEACOPP once in 3 weeks. The cycles will be delivered as follows:
Bleomycin 10mg/m2 IV in day 8, Etoposide 200mg/m2 Day 1 to Day 3, Adriamycin 35mg/m2 on Day 1 IV, Cyclophosphamide 1200mg/m2 on Day 1 IV, Vincristine 1.4mg/m2 on Day 8 IV, Cap Procarbazine 100mg/m2 Day 1 to Day 7 PO, T Prednisolone 40mg D1-D7 of a 21 day cycle. With Inj Mesna 400mg/m2 0, 4 and 8 hours on the day of Cyclophosphamide Inj G-CSF will be started routinely from Day 9 till recovery of Absolute neutrophil counts ≥5000/cmm or Total WBC counts≥ 8000/cmm</description>
