    <description>Evaluate statistical significance between pre-transplantation and 24 weeks after in:
Child-Pugh score
albumin
serum fibrosis markers
Transient Elastography (TM)

SF-36v2(TM) Health Survey.
Because advanced liver cirrhosis is a progressive condition itself, treatment efficacy is defined by &quot;improvement&quot; and &quot;no change&quot; in the indicators listed.</description>
