      The aim of this study was to determine if the addition of ketamine reduces
      remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, improves its analgesic effect, inhibits IL(interleukin)-6
      and IL-8 (inflammatory cytokines), and stimulates IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are very effective in pain relief, but they might lower pain threshold, making the
      patient more sensitive to a pain stimulus, a condition known as hyperalgesia [Angst; Clarck,
      2006]. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is usually defined as a reduction in nociceptive
      thresholds in the peripheral field of the sensitized fibers [Koppert et al., 2003], and it is
      associated with increased pain and higher demand for postoperative analgesia [Guignard et
      al., 2000]. This phenomenon adversely impacts pain control, and has been suggested to occur
      in the peri-operative context, especially associated with the use of remifentanil, a
      short-acting opioid [Guignard et al., 2000].

      Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hyperalgesia phenomenon, but the most
      important seems to be the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [Célèrier et
      al., 2000]. Ketamine is a NMDA receptor antagonist that has been shown to reduce
      postoperative pain and the need for postoperative anesthetics and analgesics. Therefore, it
      is proposed that ketamine could prevent hyperalgesia, resulting in more effective and
      long-lasting postsurgical analgesia [Célèrier et al. 2000].

      The results of studies of low dose of ketamine in the prevention of remifentanil-induced
      hyperalgesia are controversial. Joly et al. [2005] demonstrated a reduction in the
      consumption of opioids and in hyperalgesia assessed with monofilaments. However, Engelhardt
      et al [2008] showed no differences in pain scores or in postoperative opioid consumption.

      In addition, some authors observed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, associated
      with increased pain in mice receiving chronic opioid (morphine) infusion [Johnston et al.,
      2004; Liang et al., 2008]. Also, administration of proinflammatory cytokine inhibitors
      reduced phosphorylation of NMDA receptors [Zhang et al., 2008]. However, no study has
      examined the relationship between the use of remifentanil, the most frequently implicated
      opioid in OIH [Guignard et al., 2000], ketamine (drug capable of inhibiting NMDA-receptors
      and cytokines) [Dale et al., 2012], and the inflammatory response.

      The aim of this study was to determine if the addition of ketamine reduces
      remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, improves its analgesic effect, inhibits IL-6 and IL-8
      (inflammatory cytokines), and stimulates IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) in patients
      submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a procedure with an usually neglected potential
      for postoperative pain and that has been poorly investigated in association with OIH.

    <description>The 300-g filament was used 24 hours after the operation to induce a stimulus and delineate the extent of hyperalgesia from the periumbilical region. The stimulus was started outside the periumbilical region, where no pain sensation was reported, and continued every 0.5 cm until the 4 points of the periumbilical scar were reached (top, right side, left side, and bottom). The first point where the patient complained of pain was marked. If no pain sensation was reported, the stimulus was terminated 0.5 cm from the incision. The distance of each point from the surgical incision was measured, and the sum of the distances of the points was determined.</description>

          <title>Ketamine</title>
          <description>A cardioscope, a capnograph, a pulse oximeter, and a noninvasive blood pressure meter were used to monitor the patients. Propofol (2-4 mg/kg), 1 μg/kg remifentanil, and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) were administered for intubation. Atracurium was titrated to maintain muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil, 0.8% isoflurane, and 50% oxygen without nitrous oxide. Infusion of the solutions was continued until skin closure.
The patients in group ketamine received remifentanil (0.4 μg/kg/min) and ketamine (5 μg/kg/min). Neostigmine was used for antagonizing the neuromuscular block.</description>

            <description>A cardioscope, a capnograph, a pulse oximeter, and a noninvasive blood pressure meter were used to monitor the patients. Propofol (2-4 mg/kg), 1 μg/kg remifentanil, and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) were administered for intubation. Atracurium was titrated to maintain muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil, 0.8% isoflurane, and 50% oxygen without nitrous oxide. Infusion of the solutions was continued until skin closure.
The patients in group saline received remifentanil (0.4 μg/kg/min) and saline solution. Remifentanil was administered as necessary until skin closure. Neostigmine was used for antagonizing the neuromuscular block.</description>

        <description>The pain threshold was assessed using six von Frey monofilaments (0,05 g; 0,2 g; 2 g; 4 g; 10 g e 300 g) in thenar eminence in the preoperative period. The use of different von Frey monofilaments, starting with the lightest and ending with the heaviest, was separated by at least 30 seconds to reduce any anticipated responses due to a new stimulation that was performed too soon after the preceding stimulation. Three assessments were made for each monofilament, and this was considered positive when the patient responded to two of the determinations for each monofilament.</description>

Propofol (2-4 mg/kg), 1 μg/kg remifentanil, and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) were administered for intubation. Atracurium was titrated to maintain muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil, 0.8% isoflurane, and 50% oxygen without nitrous oxide. Infusion of the solutions was continued until skin closure.
The patients in group ketamine received remifentanil (0.4 μg/kg/min) and ketamine (5 μg/kg/min). Remifentanil was administered as necessary until skin closure. Neostigmine was used for antagonizing the neuromuscular block.</description>

        <title>Extension of Hyperalgesia</title>
        <description>The 300-g filament was used 24 hours after the operation to induce a stimulus and delineate the extent of hyperalgesia from the periumbilical region. The stimulus was started outside the periumbilical region, where no pain sensation was reported, and continued every 0.5 cm until the 4 points of the periumbilical scar were reached (top, right side, left side, and bottom). The first point where the patient complained of pain was marked. If no pain sensation was reported, the stimulus was terminated 0.5 cm from the incision. The distance of each point from the surgical incision was measured, and the sum of the distances of the points was determined.</description>

Propofol (2-4 mg/kg), 1 μg/kg remifentanil, and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) were administered for intubation. Atracurium was titrated to maintain muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil, 0.8% isoflurane, and 50% oxygen without nitrous oxide. Infusion of the solutions was continued until skin closure.
The patients in group ketamine received remifentanil (0.4 μg/kg/min) and ketamine (5 μg/kg/min). Remifentanil was administered as necessary until skin closure. Neostigmine was used for antagonizing the neuromuscular block.</description>
