  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the level of symptomatic and psychosocial remission
      of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in standard clinical practice as
      a function of the degree of adherence to antipsychotic treatment. The secondary objectives
      are to study the level of community integration of the patients included in the study, and
      its influencing factors, to analyze the role of various sociodemographic factors, factors
      related to the course of disease and the psychopathological status of the patient in
      community integration and remission, to analyze the potential predictors of a favorable
      course (symptomatic and psychosocial remission) and a poor course (no symptomatic or
      psychosocial remission), to assess the impact of treatment adherence on the change in the
      functional and community integration status of patients (based on the occupation,
      independence level, and degree of disability variables), to assess the significance of
      premorbid (academic and social) adjustment in the symptomatic and functional remission and
      the community integration status of patients and to correlate the level of insight to the
      remission and integration status of patients.

      This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional observational, cohort
      epidemiological study conducted in the outpatient mental health facility setting in patients
      with schizophrenia. The inclusion of two patient cohorts is contemplated, recruited in mental
      health facilities. One cohort will involve patients estimated to have inadequate adherence to
      antipsychotic treatment, while the other will consist of patients with adequate adherence to
      such treatment. N/A
