    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open-label trial of maintenance Vigil™ autologous tumor cell vaccine.
      Tumor will be harvested at the time of surgical debulking (standard of medical care).
      Subsequently, patients achieving clinical CR following primary surgical debulking and doublet
      chemotherapy will be stratified for i) surgical stage (Stage IV or suboptimal debulking (&gt;1
      cm residual) Stage III disease versus Stage III patients with optimal debulking (&lt;1 cm
      residual)) and ii) post-op chemotherapy, pre-vaccine CA-125 &gt;10 ≤ 20 U/mL versus 0≤10 U/ml.
      (Note: patients with Stage IIIc ovarian cancer will be additionally evaluated as a subset
      using descriptive statistics only). Patients will receive 1.0 x 10^7 cells / intradermal
      injection of gene transfected autologous tumor cells, Vigil™ once a month for up to 12 doses
      as long as sufficient material is available. Enough harvested tissue to provide a minimum of
      4 monthly injections will be required for entry into the study. Hematologic function, liver
      enzymes, renal function and electrolytes will be monitored monthly. Immune function analysis
      including ELISPOT analysis of cytotoxic T cell function to autologous tumor antigens will be
      monitored at (≤24 hours before) tissue harvest, ≤24 hours before the first cycle of
      chemotherapy (post debulking), ≤24 hours before the third cycle of chemotherapy (post
      debulking), baseline (screening), prior to Vigil™ injection Months 2, 4, 6 and at EOT. The
      dates of the last dose of chemotherapy and the administration of Vigil™ vaccine #1 will be
      recorded. Treatment will be continued until disease recurrence or exhaustion of the patient's
      vaccine supply. If ≥ Grade 2 toxicity by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (excluding Grade 2
      fever ≤ 24 hours and Grade 2 and 3 injection site reactions) develops related to study
      treatment the vaccine dose will be reduced by 50% and continued on a monthly basis. If a
      single patient develops ≥ Grade 3 toxicity (other than injection site reaction) related to
      study treatment the trial will be placed on hold for reevaluation of design in discussion
      with FDA. During this hold, no new subjects will initiate dosing, but subjects already being
      dosed may continue dosing as scheduled if deemed clinically appropriate by the PI.

    <textblock>
      Despite a gradual improvement in their overall survival over the past decade, approximately
      75% of women with Stage IIIC ovarian cancer who achieve a complete clinical response will
      relapse as will 50% of those achieving pathologic complete response at a median time of 18-24
      months. Phase III studies of both maintenance and consolidation therapeutic interventions
      have not translated into an overall survival advantage. Preliminary studies of immunotherapy
      in patients with ovarian cancer suggest target accessibility (potential immunogenicity) to
      immune mediated approaches. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer
      vaccines, we designed a novel autologous whole cell vaccine, Vigil™, incorporating the
      rhGMCSF transgene and the bifunctional shRNA^furin (to block proprotein conversion to active
      TGFb1 and b2) to 1) address the inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, 2)
      effect antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen→immunogen), 3) enhance effector
      potency, and 4) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune resistance. A Phase I assessment of
      Vigil™ vaccine in 33 advanced solid tumor patients (1 of them being a pediatric patient 15
      years of age) receiving ≥1 vaccination (at a dose of 1.0 x 10^7 or 2.5 x 10^7
      cells/injection/month for a maximum of 12 vaccinations) demonstrated safety of the Vigil™
      vaccine. Furthermore, proof of principle was established in the manufactured vaccines with
      increased mean GMCSF expression post-transfection to 1135 pg/10^6 cells/ml and knockdown of
      furin, TGFb1 and TGFb2 at 78%, 93%, and 95%, respectively). In addition, although a Phase I
      study, the data suggested an overall survival benefit.
