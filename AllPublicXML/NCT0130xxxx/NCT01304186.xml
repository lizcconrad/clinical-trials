  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a computer-based
      tailored information application designed to promote health literacy in persons treated for
      HIV infection. The study hypothesis is that the application will be acceptable and usable for
      persons treated for HIV infection, and will improve their levels of adherence to
      antiretroviral medication treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy is a critically important problem in improving the effectiveness of health
      care interventions. Patient behaviors essential to the successful treatment of HIV infection,
      such as high levels of medication adherence, may depend on patients understanding how to take
      medication, how to solve medication-related problems, and how to cope with medication side
      effects. An approach that has shown promise in promoting behavior change in HIV+ persons is
      the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills (IMB) model. The intervention proposed in this
      application will implement a health literacy intervention based in part on insights about
      behavior change drawn from studies of this model. The purpose of the proposed research is to
      implement this intervention via a computer-based and automated tailored information
      application. Participants will first complete an automated computer-administered self
      interview (ACASI) that will assess medication knowledge, disease knowledge likely to be
      related to motivation, and problem solving skills. Results of this assessment will feed
      forward to an automated training application that provides individually-tailored training on
      these topics. This computer-based program will provide training, test understanding, and if
      necessary reteach and retest. It will also provide printed information for participants to
      take home to provide ongoing prompts. This study will comprise two phases. In the first, the
      program will be developed and tested with potential users to assess its usability and detect
      problems with the wording of materials. In the second phase, participants' health literacy
      and cognitive status will be evaluated, their adherence to a medication for HIV infection
      will be assessed using electronic monitoring, and the effects of the program on their
      adherence will be tested.
