  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a post marketing, observational, retrospective data collection intended
      to gather and record data on patients treated with the ColonRing™ device in routine clinical
      practice at a single center. The data will assist in further evaluating the performance of
      the ColonRing™ device in regards to the creation of a colorectal anastomosis.

      Hypothesis:The performance of the ColonRing™, determined by the rate of complications, will
      be within the acceptable range reported in the literature for alternative treatment
      modalities.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of anastomotic leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>2-mo post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study outcome is the rate of anastomotic leakage. Anastomotic leakage is defined as evidence of a defect in the intestinal wall integrity at the anastomotic site leading to a communication between the intra and extra luminal compartments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of other device related complications and measures during hospitalization and post procedure:</measure>
    <time_frame>2-mo post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The following complications will be examined for relation to the device:
Bleeding. Stricture (either clinical evidence of a stricture or the inability to pass a 12 mm sigmoidoscope through the anastomosis in a procedure that does not include a diversion). Septic complication (including wound infection, pelvic infection, peritonitis, abscess).
Readmission, re-operation, death within two months of the procedure. Extra colonic complications (including urinary infection, urinary retention, DVT, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac, injury to other organs - e.g. spleen, ureter)</description>
