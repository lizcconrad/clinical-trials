      This study will determine the effectiveness of mirtazapine in reducing anxiety in children
      with autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the areas receiving very little attention in Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs)
      is that of anxiety. Anxiety is common in PDD, but has not yet been fully characterized. The
      primary objective of this study is to conduct a preliminary placebo-controlled trial of
      mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety associated with PDDs. We hypothesize that
      mirtazapine will be safe and well tolerated.
