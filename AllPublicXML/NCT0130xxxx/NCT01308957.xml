  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on
      changes in muscle mass, muscular strength and physical function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle mass is a normal consequence of aging in many older adults, worsened by
      chronic illness, poor appetite and diet, and reduced physical activity. The ensuing decline
      in physical function is a major cause of frailty, disability and death. Treatments that can
      reverse or reduce the age-associated loss of muscle mass are therefore much needed. Evidence
      is emerging that consumption of fish or fish oil derived long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) may be important for maintenance of muscle mass and physical function
      throughout the life-span. However, the effect of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass,
      muscle strength and overall physical function is not known. The goal of this study therefore
      is to determine the effect of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength and
      physical function in older adults.

    <measure>Evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in physical function at 24 weeks in older adults only</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate muscle strength by assessing one-repetition maximum strength of upper- and lower-body skeletal muscles, grip strength and isometric and isokinetic force development. We will assess overall physical function using the physical performance tests, which evaluates the ability to perform usual daily activities such as climbing a flight of stairs, walking 50 feet and putting on and removing a coat. These measurements will also be assessed at week 12 in a subset of subjects but the data will not be used as a primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>We will evaluate muscle strength by assessing one-repetition maximum strength of upper- and lower-body skeletal muscles, grip strength, thigh isometric and isokinetic force development and time-to-peak force development during thigh isokinetic exercises.
