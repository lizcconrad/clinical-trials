  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the relationship between ability to do different wheelchair skills and the
      participation and quality of life of wheelchair users in and around their home and community.
      The investigators study hypothesis:

        1. Self-reported capacity of wheelchair skills (ability to do wheelchair skills) is
           strongly related to self-reported participation.

        2. Self-reported capacity of wheelchair skills (ability to do wheelchair skills) is related
           to the average daily distance traveled in their wheelchair.
