  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adding single dose of oral montelukast to the
      standard treatment of systemic glucocorticoids plus short acting beta-2 agonist for treatment
      of acute wheezing provide additional clinical benefit in the emergency room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic corticosteroids and short acting beta-2 agonists are the mainstay treatment of acute
      asthma, however, little data exists regarding use of leukotriene antagonists in acute asthma.
      A few studies in adults have shown that oral montelukast also improved pulmonary function
      when being added to the standard treatment. But in school-age children this clinical benefit
      could not be demonstrated by adding montelukast to the standard treatment of acute asthma in
      emergency room. Moreover in preschool children there are no studies on this topic.

      The investigators hypothesized that addition of single dose of oral montelukast to standard
      therapy in acute moderate to severe wheezing may provide additional benefit in the meaning of
      improvement of pulmonary score and/or proportion of discharge from emergency department in
      preschool-age children.
