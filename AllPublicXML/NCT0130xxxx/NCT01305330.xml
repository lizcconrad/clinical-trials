  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a rising incidence of incidentally detected small renal tumours due to improved
      imaging techniques. Traditionally, patients diagnosed with these small renal masses undergo
      surgery and therefore there is limited data about the natural history of these tumours.
      Several small series have reported that most of these small masses grow slowly and might not
      require early intervention and that only some masses grow rapidly requiring immediate
      surgery. Presently, the investigators have not been able to identify prospectively which
      masses are going to grow slowly. The investigators plan to use computed tomography (CT) and
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) parameters, microsatellite analysis and tissue analysis to
      determine which masses will behave more aggressively. Additionally, the observations on the
      natural history of small renal masses need to be validated with a multicentric and
      systematically followed cohort.

      Hypothesis

      Since most renal cell carcinomas (RCC's) that are now detected by imaging as small renal
      masses, grow slowly and remain asymptomatic for years, we hypothesize that:

        -  Small RCC's that are destined to metastasize do so early or after they reach a larger
           size

        -  Delayed surgical treatment of asymptomatic, incidentally detected, small RCC's WILL NOT
           have a significant impact on overall survival

        -  The majority of small RCC's MAY NOT need to be treated.

        -  RCC's that are destined to progress can be identified by abnormal perfusion patterns on
           imaging and by their cellular and genomic characteristics on needle biopsy.

    <description>Defined by volume (cm3 ) measured over time (years). Tumour bi-dimensional diameter will be recorded and reported to allow comparison with the literature to date.
