  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of bone marrow
      mononuclear cells (BMMNC) transplantation for diabetic and non-diabetic patients with
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)who have undergone percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stem cells are capable of the important properties of self-renewal and differentiation
      plasticity. Human autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) contain CD34+
      haematopoietic and CD34- mesenchymal stem cells. Both of these cell types may contribute to
      heart muscle repair in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In recent years, a variety of
      clinical trials have explored the hypothesis that BMMNC transplantation may enhance the
      recovery of left ventricular function after AMI. The use of BMMNC is clinically justified and
      ethically unquestionable because no severe side effects have been reported and
      immunosuppressive therapy is unnecessary. More over, our previous work showed that patients
      without diabetes may benefit more from BMMNC transplantation. Thus, the aim of the present
      study was to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC)
      transplantation for diabetic and non-diabetic patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI)who have undergone PCI.
