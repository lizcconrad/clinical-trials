  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective will be to assess the efficacy of the combination of radiation
      therapy with nimotuzumab and cisplatin, as compared to the combination of radiation therapy
      plus cisplatin in the treatment of Uterine Cervical Carcinoma (UCC).

      The secondary study objectives will be safety and tolerability evaluations, to determine
      treatment feasibility and the interim efficacy evaluation according to other parameters
      routinely used in oncology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, and two-arm study.
      The study will be conducted in Brazil and has the purpose of determining the activity and
      safety of nimotuzumab in terms of overall and distant disease-free survival, radiological and
      clinical gynecological examinations, as well as by biopsy, if indicated, progression-free
      survival, local control of long-term disease, frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events,
      frequency of severe treatment-emergent adverse events.

      All participating patients will sign a consent form before they undergo any study-related
      procedure.The eligible patients will have stage IB and IVA uterine cervical carcinoma and
      they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups.

      Randomization and treatment assignment will be performed by a company specifically contracted
      for such purpose and will be per research site and disease stage (IB2 to IIIA versus IIIB to
      IVA), 1:1.
