    <textblock>
      The primary object of this study is to confirm the superiority of tianeptine compared to
      escitalopram on effects that improves subjective and objective cognitive impairments in
      patients suffering from major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Along with depressive symptoms, subjective and objective cognitive impairments are frequently
      complained by the patients with major depressive disorder. Tianeptine acts on glutamate
      system and is known as a promising drug for improving cognitive impairment.

      The present study aims to confirm the superiority of tianeptine compared to escitalopram on
      effects that improves subjective and objective cognitive impairments after a 12-week
      treatment in patients suffering from major depressive disorder.
