  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brittle Cornea Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) type VI are rare collagen-connective
      tissue disorders that predispose affected individuals to the development of perforated
      corneas from the mildest of eye trauma or even spontaneously. Clinical studies evaluating
      riboflavin-corneal crosslinking have found that it dramatically increases corneal rigidity.
      Given the success and safety of riboflavin crosslinking, the investigators believe that it
      can increase the corneal stability in patients affected these disseases, preventing
      perforation. It is furthermore possible, that riboflavin crosslinking will allow corneal
      transplants to successfully be performed on blind eyes that have already perforated and
      opacified. The purpose of the study is to determine whether corneal crosslinking can be
      safely performed on individuals with Brittle Cornea Syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type
      VI.
