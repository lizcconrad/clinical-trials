  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an online database called 'Health Systems Evidence,' which
      contains synthesized research evidence and additional details about this evidence that can
      make it easier for health system policymakers to use the included research evidence. The
      investigators have also developed an e-mail alerting service that brings to the attention of
      health system policymakers any new additions to Health Systems Evidence. This study will
      evaluate whether a &quot;full-serve&quot; version of Health Systems Evidence increases the use of
      research evidence by policy analysts and advisors in the Ontario government as compared to a
      &quot;self-serve&quot; version. The &quot;full-serve&quot; version comprises: 1) access to Health Systems
      Evidence; 2) monthly e-mail alerts about new additions to Health Systems Evidence; and 3)
      access to full-text articles that are cited in Health Systems Evidence. The &quot;self-serve&quot;
      version only provides access to Health Systems Evidence. The investigators will also
      interview study participants to obtain feedback about Health Systems Evidence, including how
      helpful it was in their work, why it was helpful (or not helpful), what aspects were most and
      least helpful and why, and recommendations for improving it.

      Background Health system policymakers need timely access to synthesized research evidence to
      inform the policymaking process. No efforts to address this need have been evaluated using an
      experimental quantitative design. The investigators developed an evidence service that draws
      inputs from Health Systems Evidence, which is a database of policy relevant systematic
      reviews. The reviews have been: 1) categorized by topic and type of review; 2) coded by the
      last year searches for studies were conducted and by the countries in which included studies
      were conducted; 3) rated for quality; and 4) linked to available user-friendly summaries,
      scientific abstracts, and full-text reports. The goal is to evaluate whether a &quot;full-serve&quot;
      evidence service increases the use of synthesized research evidence by policy analysts and
      advisors in the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) as compared to a
      &quot;self-serve&quot; evidence service.

      Methods/design: The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT),
      along with a follow-up qualitative process study in order to explore the findings in greater
      depth. For the RCT, all policy analysts and policy advisors (n=168) in a single division of
      the MOHLTC will be invited to participate. Using a stratified randomized design, participants
      will be randomized to receive either the &quot;full-serve&quot; evidence service (database access,
      monthly e-mail alerts, and full-text article availability) or the &quot;self-serve&quot; evidence
      service (database access only). The trial duration will be ten months (two-month baseline
      period, six-month intervention period, and two month cross-over period). The primary outcome
      will be the mean number of site visits/month/user between baseline and the end of the
      intervention period. The secondary outcome will be participants' intention to use research
      evidence. For the qualitative study, 15 participants from each trial arm (n=30) will be
      purposively sampled. One-on-one semi-structured interviews will be conducted by telephone on
      their views about and their experiences with the evidence service they received, how helpful
      it was in their work, why it was helpful (or not helpful), what aspects were most and least
      helpful and why, and recommendations for next steps.

    <description>The investigators will use the theory of planned behaviour to measure participants' intention to use research evidence. Using a manual designed to construct measures based on the theory, colleagues have developed and sought preliminary feedback on a data-collection instrument by first assessing face validity through interviews with key informants and then pilot testing it with 28 policymakers and researchers who completed it after participating in a knowledge translation intervention. In addition, colleagues found the data-collection instrument to have moderate test-retest reliability.</description>

    <description>Health Systems Evidence (HSE) contains over 1400 research syntheses about governance, financial and delivery arrangements within health systems and about implementation strategies relevant to health systems. The syntheses have been: 1) categorized by topic, type of synthesis, and type of question addressed; 2) coded by the last year in which searches for studies were conducted and by the countries in which included studies were conducted; 3) rated for quality; and 4) linked to publicly available user-friendly summaries, scientific abstracts, and full-text reviews. We identified systematic reviews in HSE that are not accessible to study participants and developed a mechanism to reimburse publishers for full-text downloads of these reviews.</description>
