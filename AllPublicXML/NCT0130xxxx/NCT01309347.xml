      The purpose of this study is obtain prosthetist's feedback on the novel conformable socket
      material developed by Infoscitex, and determine if it is a viable alternative to current
      prosthetic socket liners. During this task, the research team will travel to the prosthetists
      locations to have them evaluate the socket system by examining the material and providing
      their professional opinions and feedback with regard to comfort and fit for the amputee, its
      ease of use, and breathability.

    <textblock>
      Modern prosthetics have improved significantly with regards to control and functionality, but
      the fit of the residual limb within a prosthetic socket is a primary concern for many
      amputees. A poor fit can lead to skin irritation, tissue breakdown, and pain. The volume of
      the residual limb of an amputee changes throughout the course of a day and throughout the
      year. Volume fluctuation within the socket can lead to issues for the amputee, including
      decreased comfort, increased shear forces, increased pressure on bony prominences, as well as
      a poor gait pattern. An uncomfortable or non-performing socket/residual limb interface
      decreases user compliance with the prosthetic and therefore decreases the activity level of
      amputees who want to remain active in their civilian and military lives.

      The investigators are developing a multilayered socket that takes advantage of a novel
      braided material for strength and passive conformability with thin layers dedicated to wearer
      comfort. This new socket provides ultimate fit for improvement in the performance of the
      prosthesis. The socket adapts itself to the changing physical shape of the residual limb as
      the prosthesis is worn. The adaptation is a natural result of the material properties, so is
      done passively and in real time. The materials are lightweight, breathable, and ultrasound
      transparent, allowing the prosthetic to function in a variety of environments.

      This study will be undertaken to have six prosthetists evaluate the material, where they will
      be asked to complete a questionnaire and give their opinions regarding the material. This
      will inform design changes for the material.
