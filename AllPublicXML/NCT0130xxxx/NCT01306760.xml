  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this research is to ascertain whether Ketamine would be a more effective
      anaesthetic for Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) than the standard anaesthetic. In doing so
      the investigators aim to examine the effect of ketamine on ratings of depressive symptoms,
      the number of required ECT treatments, and the effect of this anaesthetic on memory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to WHO statistics, depression is amongst the leading causes of disability
      worldwide. In its more severe forms, it can be life threatening. The most severe forms of
      depression, or those that fail to respond to chemical treatment are treated with
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The treatment is highly effective, and undoubtedly saves
      lives, but a range of factors, including side effect profile, the necessity for extended
      hospital care, and stigma, restricts its use.

      A recent study has shown that patients who receive ketamine as the anaesthetic for ECT
      experience an earlier reduction in depressive symptoms and have a greater reduction in
      depressive symptoms than those receiving propofol (Okamoto et al., 2009). However, in this
      study eight ECT treatments were given to all participants so it is unknown whether ketamine
      could have reduced the number of treatments required. Overall, these studies suggest that as
      well as being a neuroprotective agent; ketamine may also have an antidepressant effect. Given
      these findings it is hypothesized that the use of ketamine in ECT treatment may reduce the
      number of ECT sessions required due to this drug's effects on depression ratings.

      Our main research question is whether the use of ketamine as the anaesthetic for ECT
      treatment for depression improves the treatment outcome with respect to speed of response and
      reduction in side effects when compared to conventional anaesthesia.

    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4th treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be change in depressive symptoms after the fourth ECT treatment. This will be assessed by the change in MADRS and 17-item HDRS scores between start of treatment and this timepoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive side-effects</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the spatial recognition test from the CANTAB battery. This test was chosen as previous research has shown that this test is most sensitive to anterograde memory impairments associated with ECT. By administering this test before, during (after 4th treatment) and after treatment (immediately following and at 1 month follow-up) we will be able to determine whether ketamine can reduce the anterograde memory dysfunction as compared to propofol.</description>

    <description>The secondary measure of treatment efficacy will be assessed by the change in MADRS and 17-item HADRS scores immediately after treatment and at 1 month follow-up. Secondly, this will be assessed by the number of treatments required to achieve remission of symptoms, as judged by treating clinicians. By monitoring the number of treatments required we will be able to assess whether ketamine can reduce the number of ECT treatments required.</description>
