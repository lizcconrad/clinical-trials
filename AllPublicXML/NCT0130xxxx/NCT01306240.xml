  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Term and near term newborns can present acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Surfactant
      treatment has been shown effective in reducing mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment
      durations in the preterm newborn. Whether surfactant treatment is beneficial for term and
      near term newborns is unknown. The purpose of this study is to compare surfactant treatment
      vs. nasal continuous positive airways pressure in the newborn between 35 and 41 weeks of
      gestation with RDS within the first 24 hours of life. The study's primary endpoint is
      &quot;survival with no oxygen treatment at 72 hours of life&quot;. The secondary endpoints are: death,
      surfactant treatment, pneumothorax, secondary infections, pulmonary hypertension, inhaled
      nitric oxide treatment, fluid loading treatment, vasopressive amines treatment, mechanical
      ventilation duration, nCPAP treatment duration, Oxygen treatment duration, Oxygen treatment
      at 28 days of life, hospitalization duration and treatment strategy cost.

      Newborn between 35 and 41 weeks of gestation with RDS within the first 24 hours of life,
      treated with nCPAP and a FiO2 ≥ 30% are eligible. Randomisation is stratified by centre and 2
      age groups (35-36 weeks of gestation and 37-41 weeks ogf gestation). One arm will receive
      surfactant treatment after tracheal intubation. The second arm will continue nCPAP. A rescue
      treatment is used in the second arm if FiO2 &gt; 60%. In each arm the newborn is weaned from
      mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment as soon as possible. The primary outcome of the
      study is the success of the procedure defined as &quot;survival without any oxygen treatment&quot; at
      72 hours of life.
