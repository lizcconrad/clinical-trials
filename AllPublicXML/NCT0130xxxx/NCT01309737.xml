    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Score of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear' at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of body surface area (BSA)&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Body Surface Area (BSA) With Psoriasis at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Body regions are assigned specific number of handprints with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 handprints), upper extremities = 20% (20 handprints), Trunk (including axillae and groin) = 30% (30 handprints), lower extremities (including buttocks) = 40% (40 handprints)]. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Score of ‘Clear’ or ‘Almost Clear’ at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

        <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Body regions are assigned specific number of handprints with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 handprints), upper extremities = 20% (20 handprints), Trunk (including axillae and groin) = 30% (30 handprints), lower extremities (including buttocks) = 40% (40 handprints)]. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 90 response was defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 4 and 16</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item general dermatology questionnaire that assess health related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment). The DLQI item response options are rated by the participant from 0 (not at all/not relevant) to 3 (very much) with a total score range of 0 (best) to 30 (worst); higher scores indicate poor quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4,16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included participants who were randomized to study and received at least 1 dose investigational drug (CP-690,550 or placebo). Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>

        <population>FAS included participants who were randomized to study, received at least 1 dose investigational drug. Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues.

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) at Week 16</title>
          <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>
          <population>FAS included participants who were randomized to study, received at least 1 dose investigational drug. Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) were participants who were evaluable (had nail psoriasis at Baseline and had at least one measurement during follow up) for this measure.</population>

        <title>Percent Probability of Participants Maintaining Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Score of ‘Clear’ or ‘Almost Clear’ at Week 52</title>
        <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Maintenance of PGA response at Week 52 among participants achieving PGA response at Week 16 is reported. Percent probability and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated based on the product limit estimator in survival analyses. Event is loss of response. Probability of maintaining response is (1-probability of loss of response).</description>

PASI is a composite scoring by investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response = at least 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline.

        <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Median time to achieve a PGA response up to week 16 is reported. The median time to event was estimated based on the probability of event-rate based on life table estimates (not the observed rate as in outcome measure 1). Median time to event is not estimable if the estimated probability of response by Week 16 is less than 50%.</description>

        <title>Time to Achieve Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) Response</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline. The median time to event was estimated based on the probability of event-rate based on life table estimates (not the observed rate as in outcome measure 2). Median time to event is not estimable if the estimated probability of response by Week 16 is less than 50%.</description>

Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). PGA response was defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).</description>

        <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 4 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe). Percentage of participants with each PGA score is reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75) Response</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline. Percentage of participants with PASI 75 response is reported.</description>

        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. Basic characteristics of psoriatic lesions: erythema, induration, and scaling (PASI components) are scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]) according to a 5-point scale: 0 (no involvement); 1 (slight); 2 (moderate); 3 (marked); 4 (very marked). PASI component score range from 0 to 4 and where higher scores indicate greater severity of psoriatic lesions.</description>

          <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Component Scores</title>
          <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. Basic characteristics of psoriatic lesions: erythema, induration, and scaling (PASI components) are scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]) according to a 5-point scale: 0 (no involvement); 1 (slight); 2 (moderate); 3 (marked); 4 (very marked). PASI component score range from 0 to 4 and where higher scores indicate greater severity of psoriatic lesions.</description>
          <population>FAS. Analysis population for &quot;Placebo, CP-690,550&quot; groups included FAS participants who were re-randomized at Week 16 to receive CP-690,550 5 mg or 10 mg. Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues.Here 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. Basic characteristics of psoriatic lesions: erythema, induration, and scaling (PASI components) are scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]) according to a 5-point scale: 0 (no involvement); 1 (slight); 2 (moderate); 3 (marked); 4 (very marked). PASI component score range from 0 to 4 where higher scores indicate greater severity of psoriatic lesions.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

        <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Body regions are assigned specific number of handprints with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 handprints), upper extremities = 20% (20 handprints), Trunk (including axillae and groin) = 30% (30 handprints), lower extremities (including buttocks) = 40% (40 handprints)]. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Body Surface Area (BSA) With Psoriasis at Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Body regions are assigned specific number of handprints with percentage [Head and neck = 10% (10 handprints), upper extremities = 20% (20 handprints), Trunk (including axillae and groin) = 30% (30 handprints), lower extremities (including buttocks) = 40% (40 handprints)]. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of body surface area (BSA)&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI 50 response was defined as at least a 50% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline. Percentage of participants with PASI 50 response is reported.</description>

        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. Basic characteristics of psoriatic lesions: erythema, induration, and scaling (PASI components) are scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]) according to a 5-point scale: 0 (no involvement); 1 (slight); 2 (moderate); 3 (marked); 4 (very marked).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score at Week 8, 16, 20, 28, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis. 'n' signifies participants evaluable at specified time point for each arm.</description>

        <title>Number of Affected Nails</title>
        <description>Nail psoriasis is evaluated by the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Total number of psoriasis affected nails (presence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix / nail bed) were assessed and reported. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants (with baseline nail psoriasis) who were evaluable for this measure.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score at Week 8, 16, 20, 28, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants with baseline nail psoriasis and who were unique in longitudinal model.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 75 (NAPSI 75) Response</title>
        <description>The NAPSI quantifies severity of nail psoriasis by evaluating the presence or absence of psoriatic manifestations on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots on lulunea, crumbling) and nail bed (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil drop [salmon patch dyschromia]). Each finger nail divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and scored for both nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis (range from 0 [absence of psoriasis] to 4 [presence of psoriasis in all 4 quadrants]). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis. NAPSI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in NAPSI relative to Baseline. Percentage of participants with NAPSI 75 response is reported. N(number of participants analyzed) signifies participants (with baseline nail psoriasis) who were evaluable for this measure.</description>

        <title>Itch Severity Item (ISI) Score</title>
        <description>ISI assessed severity of itch (pruritus) due to psoriasis. ISI is a single item, horizontal numeric rating scale. Participants were asked to rate &quot;your worst itching due to psoriasis over the past 24 hours&quot; on a numeric rating scale anchored by the terms &quot;No itching&quot; (0) and &quot;Worst possible itching&quot; (10) at the ends for post baseline time points. Baseline ISI is average of scores on 7 days prior to start of study treatment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 28, 40 and 52</title>
          <description>The DLQI is a general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items that assess health related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment). The DLQI item response options are rated by the participant from 0 (not at all/not relevant) to 3 (very much) with a total score range of 0 (best) to 30 (worst); higher scores indicate poor quality of life. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies the unique participants in the longitudinal model.</description>

        <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score</title>
        <description>HADS: 14-item questionnaire that screens for the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms. There are 7 items comprising the anxiety subscale and 7 items comprising the depression subscale. Each item has response options ranging from 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total HADS score ranges from 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Psoriasis Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire (Ps-HCRU) - Impact of Psoriasis on Work</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Health Care Resource Utilization (Ps-HCRU) questionnaire is a short questionnaire designed to assess healthcare resource use and the impact of psoriasis on work. The second section assesses indirect costs associated with absenteeism due to psoriasis and the impact of psoriasis on productivity at work. Participants (currently employed [Emp]) answered (Yes/No [Y/N]): &quot;Were you absent or on sick leave from work due to psoriasis today?&quot;, and participants (unemployed [UEmp]) answered (Yes/No): &quot;Are you unemployed due to your psoriasis?&quot; Baseline is the latest pre-dose measurement. Week 16 includes all reported log up to Week 16 (excluding Baseline). Data was not analyzed beyond Week 16 as per study team's decision because Week 0 - 16 period was considered sufficient to provide clear reflection of Ps-HCRU endpoint.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included participants who were randomized to study and received at least 1 dose investigational drug (CP-690,550 or placebo). Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues. Here 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Psoriasis Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire (Ps-HCRU) - Healthcare Resource Use Events and Employment Status</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Health Care Resource Utilization (Ps-HCRU) questionnaire is a short questionnaire designed to assess healthcare resource use and the impact of psoriasis on work. The first section assesses direct costs associated with healthcare resource use, and the second section assesses indirect costs associated with absenteeism due to psoriasis and the impact of psoriasis on productivity at work. Percentage of participants reporting healthcare resource use events and employment status, work impacted events due to psoriasis, and absence or sick leave for work due to psoriasis at Week 16 are reported. Data was not analyzed beyond Week 16 as per study team's decision because Week 0 - 16 period was considered sufficient to provide clear reflection of Ps-HCRU endpoint.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included participants who were randomized to study and received at least 1 dose investigational drug (CP-690,550 or placebo). Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues. 'n' signifies participants who were evaluable (answered respective question for this measure) for specified parameter for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Psoriasis Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire (Ps-HCRU) - Psoriasis Affecting Ability to Work</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Health Care Resource Utilization (Ps-HCRU) questionnaire is a short questionnaire designed to assess healthcare resource use and the impact of psoriasis on work.The first section assesses direct costs associated with healthcare resource use, and the second section assesses indirect costs associated with absenteeism due to psoriasis and the impact of psoriasis on productivity at work. Baseline is the latest pre-dose measurement. Participants rate how much psoriasis affected their ability to work by reporting a number from 0 to 10, where 0 means &quot;ability to work was not affected by psoriasis&quot;, and 10 means &quot;ability to work was completely affected by psoriasis&quot;. Data was not analyzed beyond Week 16 as per study team's decision because Week 0 - 16 period was considered sufficient to provide clear reflection of Ps-HCRU endpoint.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included participants who were randomized to study and received at least 1 dose investigational drug (CP-690,550 or placebo). Participants from 1 site were excluded due to GCP compliance issues. Here 'n' signifies participants evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) Score</title>
        <description>The FDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that examine the impact of health-related quality of life issues associated with living with a person with a skin condition (example, emotional distress, personal relationships, reactions of other people, social life, caregiving) over the last month. The FDLQI need to be completed by a family member (for example, spouse or partner, parent) who currently lives with the participant. Each question is scored on a scale from 0 (Not at all/ Not relevant) to 3 (Very much). Total score is calculated by summing the score of each item resulting in a maximum score of '30' and a minimum score of '0'. Higher scores indicate greater impairment to quality of life. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure.</description>
