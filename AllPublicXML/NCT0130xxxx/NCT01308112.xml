  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the presence of Plasmodium infection in parturient
      women who antenatally received a combination of iron-fortified foods with iron supplements
      versus iron-fortified foods only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As per recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), iron supplementation in
      children should be restricted in malaria-endemic areas because of concerns that it can lead
      to an increased burden of malaria. Universal iron supplementation continues to be
      recommended, however, for women during pregnancy and 3 months postpartum. Observational
      studies have shown that iron deficiency in parturient women is associated with a marked
      reduction in the prevalence and density of malarial parasites in the placenta. Plasmodium
      infections in pregnant women have devastating effects on the foetus and neonate, causing low
      birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion,
      stillbirth and neonatal mortality. Based on our previous work, the Kenyan government is
      currently drafting legislation for mandatory iron fortification of industrially milled flour.
      Implementation of the new fortification policy means that pregnant women will receive iron
      through a combination of fortified foods and supplementation. The investigators are concerned
      about the safety of the high iron intake resulting from such a policy.
