    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to end of 12-week Maintenance (Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in the following 9 domain categories: cardiovascular, including falls; sleep/fatigue; mood/cognition; perceptual problems/hallucinations; attention/memory; gastrointestinal tract; urinary; sexual function; miscellaneous. Severity and frequency are rated using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe; major source of distress or disturbance to subject) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent [daily or all the time]) for frequency. The total NMSS score ranges from 0 to 350. A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.</description>

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III is a scale for the assessment of function in Parkinson's Disease. UPDRS Part III measures Motor Function. It consists of 14 items with 27 questions, each ranging from 0 to 4. The sum score for the UPDRS Part III ranges from 0 to 108. A higher score indicates greater disability. A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance in the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale Score: Subdomain Cardiovascular</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to end of 12-week Maintenance (Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in 9 different domains. Severity (ranges: 0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) and frequency (ranges: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk), 2 = Often (1/wk), 3 = Frequent (several times per week), 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time) are rated using a 4-point scale.
The final score is derived from multiplying the severity score and the frequency score.
A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.
The possible min/max final scores per subdomain are calculated as follows:
Range of final score per subdomain: 0 - 12 per question multiplied by the number of questions per subdomain:
Subdomain Cardiovascular (2 questions): range 0 - 24</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance in Total Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) Score</title>
        <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject’s nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in the following 9 domain categories: cardiovascular, including falls; sleep/fatigue; mood/cognition; perceptual problems/hallucinations; attention/memory; gastrointestinal tract; urinary; sexual function; miscellaneous. Severity and frequency are rated using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe; major source of distress or disturbance to subject) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent [daily or all the time]) for frequency. The total NMSS score ranges from 0 to 350. A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance in the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale Score: Subdomain Cardiovascular</title>
        <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in 9 different domains. Severity (ranges: 0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) and frequency (ranges: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk), 2 = Often (1/wk), 3 = Frequent (several times per week), 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time) are rated using a 4-point scale.
The final score is derived from multiplying the severity score and the frequency score.
A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.
The possible min/max final scores per subdomain are calculated as follows:

          <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance in the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale Score: Subdomain Cardiovascular</title>
          <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in 9 different domains. Severity (ranges: 0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) and frequency (ranges: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk), 2 = Often (1/wk), 3 = Frequent (several times per week), 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time) are rated using a 4-point scale.
The final score is derived from multiplying the severity score and the frequency score.
A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.
The possible min/max final scores per subdomain are calculated as follows:
Range of final score per subdomain: 0 – 12 per question multiplied by the number of questions per subdomain:

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance in the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale Score: Subdomain Attention/Memory,</title>
        <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in 9 different domains. Severity (ranges: 0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) and frequency (ranges: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk), 2 = Often (1/wk), 3 = Frequent (several times per week), 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time) are rated using a 4-point scale.
The final score is derived from multiplying the severity score and the frequency score.
A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.
The possible min/max final scores per subdomain are calculated as follows:
Range of final score per subdomain: 0 – 12 per question multiplied by the number of questions per subdomain:
Subdomain Attention/Memory (3 questions): range 0 – 36</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to end of 12-week Maintenance (Day 84)</time_frame>
        <population>This analysis was performed according to the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which is defined as all treated subjects with a baseline and post-baseline NMSS measure, and follows the intention-to-treat principle.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance in the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale Score: Subdomain Sexual Function</title>
          <description>The Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a validated tool for rating frequency and severity of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms is assessed by the investigator in 9 different domains. Severity (ranges: 0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) and frequency (ranges: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk), 2 = Often (1/wk), 3 = Frequent (several times per week), 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time) are rated using a 4-point scale.
The final score is derived from multiplying the severity score and the frequency score.
A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.
The possible min/max final scores per subdomain are calculated as follows:
Range of final score per subdomain: 0 – 12 per question multiplied by the number of questions per subdomain:
Subdomain Sexual function (2 questions): range 0 – 24</description>
