      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Verb Network Strengthening Treatment
      (VNeST) on the ability to produce sentences and connected speech in persons with aphasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States today, and aphasia, a language
      disorder that affects production and comprehension of language, remains one of the most
      devastating aspects of stroke recovery. The most prominent symptom of aphasia is difficulty
      retrieving words, especially in sentence production and connected speech (e.g., telling a
      story, having a conversation). The current project examines the effect Verb Network
      Strengthening Treatment (VNeST), a language therapy, on the ability of persons with moderate
      aphasia to retrieve words in sentences and connected speech. The primary goals of VNeST are
      to 1) increase the specificity of nouns and verbs in sentences, 2) maximize improvement to
      untrained words across a variety of language tasks, and 3) engage and challenge participants
      with salient and relevant treatment materials and activities. Persons with aphasia who are
      enrolled in the study will receive VNeST for 10 weeks for 4 hours per week. Treatment tasks
      involve the retrieval of nouns related to a target verb. For example, for the verb measure,
      participants would come up with people who measure and what they measure (e.g.,
      carpenter/lumber, chef/sugar). They would then answer questions related to why, where, and
      when these things might occur (e.g., for carpenter/measure, they might say &quot;to get the right
      length of board,&quot; (why) &quot;at a construction site,&quot; (where) and &quot;when building a house&quot;
      (where)). Cues and assistance are provided to the participants when they are unable to
      complete any given task. As the participants improve, cues are reduced.

      Prior to treatment, testing will be conducted on participants to establish their abilities to
      retrieve words in the following contexts: 1) naming pictures of objects and actions, 2)
      sentences, and 3) connected speech.

      Participants and a family member or friend (i.e., proxy) will also complete a questionnaire
      about how the participant is able to communicate in everyday tasks (e.g., indicating yes or
      no, providing medical information).

      During the treatment phase, sentence production abilities on items related to treatment will
      be examined in order to determine how word retrieval abilities are changing with treatment.
      After the completion of treatment, all measures examined prior to treatment (including the
      questionnaire) will be re-examined in order to determine whether improvement was observed.
      Additionally, participants will complete testing one more time 3 months after the completion
      of treatment to determine if post-treatment improvements were maintained.

      Finally, an analysis of improvement over time across the treatment phase will be examined in
      order to determine the rate of improvement (or lack of it) over time. All statistical
      analyses will use group data (i.e., group design), but additional examination of improvements
      for each participant (i.e., single subject design) will also be conducted. Thus, the overall
      experimental design is a mix of group and single subject analyses. The findings from this
      study will help to inform aphasia treatment practices and potentially allow for a larger
      study with more participants in a clinical trial.

    <description>This questionnaire (Lomas et al, 1989) was provided to persons who communicated with the treatment participant regularly (e.g., a spouse). They rated how well the participant was able to perform on 16 common communication tasks (e.g., participating in a conversation over coffee). They rated each scenario along a line that spanned between the two extremes of ability, from &quot;not at all able&quot; to &quot;as able as before the stroke.&quot; The line was 100 mm. To score responses, the place where they bisected the line was measured. An average of their responses across the 16 questions was calculated.</description>

          <title>Complete Utterances in discourse</title>
          <description>We elicited 10 discourse responses that included personal information (What you do on Sundays), picture descriptions and procedural information (how to wash dishes) (Nicholas &amp; Brookshire 1993). Each utterance was evaluated against the criteria for complete utterances (containing a subject, verb and object (if required) while ALSO being relevant). E.g., &quot;The woman is something&quot; lacks a main verb and is not fully informative, whereas &quot;The woman is pouring a drink&quot; is complete and relevant to the picture. Percentage of complete utterances relative to total number of utterances was calculated.</description>

          <title>Western Aphasia Battery</title>
          <description>The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised is a standardized aphasia battery which evaluates the severity and type of aphasia. It is a criterion measure that results in an Aphasia Quotient (AQ) (range: 0-100, where lower scores indicate more severe aphasia). An AQ of 0-25 is very severe; an AQ of 26-50 is severe; an AQ of 51-75 is moderate; and AQ of 76 and above is mild. This aphasia quotient considers language production, comprehension and repetition. The score provided here is the mean AQ across participants.</description>

          <title>Communicative Effectiveness Ratings</title>
          <description>This questionnaire (Lomas et al, 1989) was provided to persons who communicated with the treatment participant regularly (e.g., a spouse). They rated how well the participant was able to perform on 16 common communication tasks (e.g., participating in a conversation over coffee). They rated each scenario along a line that spanned between the two extremes of ability, from &quot;not at all able&quot; to &quot;as able as before the stroke.&quot; The line was 100 mm. To score responses, the place where they bisected the line was measured. An average of their responses across the 16 questions was calculated.</description>

            <description>Treatment tasks involve the retrieval of nouns related to a target verb. For example, for the verb measure, participants would come up with people who measure and what they measure (e.g., carpenter/lumber, chef/sugar). They would then answer questions related to why, where, and when these things might occur (e.g., for carpenter/measure, they might say &quot;to get the right length of board,&quot; (why) &quot;at a construction site,&quot; (where) and &quot;when building a house&quot; (where). Cues and assistance are provided to the participants when they are unable to complete any given task. As the participants improve, cues are reduced.</description>

            <title>Verb Network Strengthening Treatment</title>
            <description>Treatment tasks involve the retrieval of nouns related to a target verb. For example, for the verb measure, participants would come up with people who measure and what they measure (e.g., carpenter/lumber, chef/sugar). They would then answer questions related to why, where, and when these things might occur (e.g., for carpenter/measure, they might say &quot;to get the right length of board,&quot; (why) &quot;at a construction site,&quot; (where) and &quot;when building a house&quot; (where). Cues and assistance are provided to the participants when they are unable to complete any given task. As the participants improve, cues are reduced.</description>

        <title>Communicative Effectiveness Ratings</title>
        <description>This questionnaire (Lomas et al, 1989) was provided to persons who communicated with the treatment participant regularly (e.g., a spouse). They rated how well the participant was able to perform on 16 common communication tasks (e.g., participating in a conversation over coffee). They rated each scenario along a line that spanned between the two extremes of ability, from &quot;not at all able&quot; to &quot;as able as before the stroke.&quot; The line was 100 mm. To score responses, the place where they bisected the line was measured. An average of their responses across the 16 questions was calculated.</description>
