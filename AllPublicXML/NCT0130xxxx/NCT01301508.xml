    <measure>Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Baseline (Day 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition.</description>

    <description>ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion.

Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Percentage of participants in whom the active lesion (ointment treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 in ADSI as compared to vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) and, in whom the vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 as compared to active lesion (ointment treated) were reported in this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. The SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study medication and up to the end of study treatment (Day 42) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <title>Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Baseline (Day 1)</title>
        <description>ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant’s atopic dermatitis (AD) affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Decrease From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 28</title>
        <description>ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant’s AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Percentage of participants in whom the active lesion (ointment treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 in ADSI as compared to vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) and, in whom the vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 as compared to active lesion (ointment treated) were reported in this outcome measure.</description>
