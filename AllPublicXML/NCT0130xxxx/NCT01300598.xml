      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous
      transplantation of Adipose Tissue derived Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patient with
      degenerative arthritis.

    <textblock>
      degenerative arthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It is estimated that 26.9
      million Americans 25 years old or older have clinical degenerative arthritis of some joints,
      with a higher percentage of affliction in the older population. Its clinical manifestations
      include joint pain and impairment to movement, and surrounding tissues are often affected
      with local inflammation. The etiology of degenerative arthritis is not completely understood;
      however, injury, age, and genetics have been considered among the risk factors.

      Degenerative arthritis is a progressively debilitating disease that affects mostly cartilage,
      with associated changes in bone. Cartilage has limited intrinsic healing and regenerative
      capacities.

      Due to the increasing incidence of degenerative arthritis and the aging population coupled
      with inefficient therapeutic choices, novel cartilage repair strategies are in need.

      The availability of large quantities of MSCs and their potential for ready chondrogenic
      differentiation after prolonged in vitro expansion have made MSCs the most hopeful candidate
      progenitor cell source for cartilage tissue engineering.

      In the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue and
      cultured, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery.

      It will be stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their
      functions.
