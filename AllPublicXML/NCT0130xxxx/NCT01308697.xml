  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flail chest refers to a section of the rib cage that has broken away from the surrounding
      ribs. Usually, more than one rib is involved, and they are broken in at least two places.
      Flail chest typically is the result of blunt chest trauma. As a result of flail chest, the
      chest wall becomes unstable and dangers of life threatening respiratory failure and hypoxemia
      (lack of oxygen to circulating blood which will lead to organ damage or failure)occur.

      Currently, these injuries are treated non operatively. However, small case series have
      demonstrated that operative management can improve Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay,
      improved pulmonary function and decreased pain leading to decreased duration of mechanical
      ventilation, and the incidence of complications related to this injury.

      This study hopes to provide information on whether a prospective randomized trial is feasible
      by first undertaking a small pilot study to determine rate of recruitment, data collection
      methods, and integrity of study protocol.

      Null Hypothesis 1: Enrollment of subjects with flail chest rib fractures into a prospective
      multi-centre RCT is not feasible and a larger clinical trial is unlikely to be completed.

      The optimum treatment of flail chest rib fractures is currently unknown. The standard of care
      for these injuries at most centers in North America, includes a progressive algorithm of
      epidural anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy. Surgical management of flail
      chest injuries has previously been reserved for refractory cases unable to wean from
      mechanical ventilation or severe chest wall instability. However, the use of surgical
      stabilization of multiple rib fractures has demonstrated substantial improvements in ICU
      length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and the incidences of pneumonia,
      tracheotomy, and reintubation. These results have been reported in small cases series without
      prospective or randomized trial designs.
