  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate effects of smoking on the dopaminergic system by using PET
      tomography with new radioligand, [11C]-(+)-PHNO. Our primary hypothesis is that smoking a
      cigarette will produce dopamine release and this release can be measured using PET imaging
      and the [11C]-(+)-PHNO radiotracer. The secondary hypothesis is that this smoking induced
      dopamine release will be correlated with subjective craving and anxiety ratings.

      This will be a within-subjects study in healthy male and female smokers. There will be one
      within factor condition: Smoking and Non Smoking. Therefore, there will be a repeated measure
      of PET scans using [11C]-(+)-PHNO under two different conditions. Ten subjects (n=5 male and
      n=5 female) included in the study will come on two different days and will have a Smoking or
      Non smoking session performed just before the PET study. Subjective assessments will be
      conducted at each experimental condition.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>[11C]-(+)-PHNO binding potential</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days between PET scans</time_frame>
    <description>The process of imaging requires the injection of a positron-emitting radiotracer (here, [11C]-(+)-PHNO) that binds to the protein of interest (here, dopamine receptor DRD2/3) followed by the measurement of this binding using the PET scanner. Dopamine release increases DRD 2/3 occcupancy which results in decreased radiotracer's binding potential, and vice versa. [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding potential will be measured on two different conditions (Smoking vs. Non-smoking) on two separate days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective reports of craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days between PET scans</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of subjective craving will be assessed prior to and after each condition (Smoking vs. Non-smoking) on two separate days. Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, Tiffany Questionnaire of Smoking Urges, The Urge to Smoke scale, Tobacco Craving Questionnaire, and 21-item Visual Analogue Scale will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective reports of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days between PET scans</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective reports of anxiety will be collected prior to and after each condition (Smoking vs. Non-smoking) on two separate days. State anxiety questions from the Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory will be used.</description>
