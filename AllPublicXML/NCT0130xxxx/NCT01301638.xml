    <textblock>
      Before Daptomycin (Cubicin ®) approved by the U.S. FDA in 2003, There were large-scale
      clinical trials conducted that included more than 1,000 subjects and than Daptomycin got
      complicated skin and soft tissue infections (CSSSI) indication. After 2004, Daptomycin got
      new indications about bacteremia and endocarditis due to success outcomes in the clinical
      trial which included infected in blood flow and endocardial infected patients.

      All subjects in Daptomycin clinical trials are European and American race. It is necessary
      that collecting safety and efficacy data of Daptomycin in Taiwan race. I will intent to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Daptomycin which were used in patients with serious
      gram-positive infections retrospectively. And the outcome could be a reference for Daptomycin
      future using.
