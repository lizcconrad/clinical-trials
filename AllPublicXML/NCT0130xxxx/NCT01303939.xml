  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if glaucoma is associated with neurodegenerative
      changes in areas of the brain other than the occipital lobe. This will help guide the
      direction of further research in the use of neuroprotective agents in preventing or
      controlling such changes. The final goal is to improve the quality of life for patients with
      glaucoma.

      Death of retinal ganglion cells causes loss of neurons in areas other than just the visual
      cortex. These neurodegenerative changes decrease the patient's ability to perform the
      activities of daily living. Tensor-based morphometry analysis of MRI brain scans will reveal
      areas of cortical degeneration in glaucoma patients, and the extent of damage in these areas
      will correlate with their ability to perform vision-dependent tasks, as measured by the
      Assessment of Ability Related to Vision (AARV).

      Patients with glaucoma who were outliers in Assessment of Ability Related to Vision (AARV)
      Study or Assessment of Disability related to vision (ADREV) Study, in that they have poor
      performance-based measure scores despite having midrange visual field scores.

      Mini-Mental State Exam and T-1 weighted MRI brain scan and will be performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with glaucoma who were outliers in Assessment of Ability Related to Vision
             (AARV) or Assessment of Disability related to vision (ADREV), in that they have poor
             performance-based measure scores (â‰¤ 40s) despite having midrange visual field scores
             (mean deviation of -6 to -20).

          -  Age-, gender- and race-matched controls who do not have glaucoma, and who do not have
             loss of vision for any reason other than cataract or refractive error.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any type of neurological disease.

          2. Patients with a cognitive deficit which would affect visual functioning, as revealed
             by the neuro-ophthalmologic examination.
