  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the complications that can occur after a stem cell transplant is called graft versus
      host disease (GVHD). Another complication is that multiple myeloma may come back (relapse).
      In this study, a drug called lenalidomide will be started 1-2 months after a transplant, or
      possibly later depending on recovery of your side effects. Lenalidomide and sirolimus have
      been shown to work together against multiple myeloma. Therefore, lenalidomide will be
      combined with sirolimus with the hope that this will help prolong the amount of time the
      disease is in remission. Researchers hope these steps will help prolong the amount of time
      the multiple myeloma is in remission and will decrease the chance of GvHD.
