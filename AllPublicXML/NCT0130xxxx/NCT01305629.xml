  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study uses a randomized controlled experimental design to evaluate the efficacy
      of a brief intervention using spiritual self schema (3S+) counseling to simultaneously target
      HIV health outcomes, and substance use among alcohol and/or drug dependent HIV positive older
      adults (age 50+), relative to an attention control condition. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either: (1) 12 sessions of 3S+ counseling, adapted for the present study
      to target both non-injection drug use, drinking, and HIV health; or (2) 12 sessions of
      education about HIV health and the associated with alcohol and drug use that will serve as an
      attention-control.

    <description>Participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in viral load, and greater increases in CD4 counts and self-reported adherence than those in the education comparison at the end of the intervention period (4 months). Those in the intervention condition will also maintain greater reductions in viral load, and greater increases in CD4 counts and self-reported adherence than those in the education comparison condition at the three follow-up assessments (4, 8, and 12 months).</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in self-reported days of substance use and severity of dependence than those in the education comparison at at the end of the intervention period (4 months). Those in the intervention condition will also maintain greater reductions in self-reported days of substance use than those in the education comparison condition at the three follow-up assessments (4, 8, and 12 months).</description>

    <description>The Spiritual Self Schema therapy (3S+) intervention will consist of a series of 12 one hour-long sessions delivered individually to participants over a four-month period. The 3S+ approach combines cognitive and behavioral therapy techniques with elements of non-theistic Buddhist philosophy to increase motivation for treatment adherence, alcohol and/or substance use reduction or abstinence and the prevention or reduction of HIV risk behaviors. 3S+ draws from self-regulation theory, self-schema theory, and self-discrepancy theory to assist participants in defining and perceiving their addict self, when their addict self is active, and its resulting negative affect state. 3S+ remediates the &quot;addict&quot; schema by proposing the construction of an alternate and competing schema: the &quot;spiritual self.&quot; This spiritual self schema is compatible with HIV self-care, alcohol and drug use reduction or abstinence, adherence to treatment, and a compassionate life.</description>
