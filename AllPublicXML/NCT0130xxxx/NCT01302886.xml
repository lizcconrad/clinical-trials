  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the antimyeloma effects of BHQ880A in patients with smoldering
      multiple myeloma with high risk of progression to active multiple myeloma. BHQ880 will be
      administered every 28 days in previously untreated patients. Disease assessments will be
      performed monthly and effects on bone metabolism will be assessed by measurement of serum and
      urine bone biomarkers, changes in BMD , and QCT with FEA. Additionally, the PK profile of
      BHQ880 as a single agent and following multiple doses will be obtained.
