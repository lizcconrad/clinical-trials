  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to create images of where and how the amino acid (the
      building blocks of proteins)Tryptophan is processed in normal and abnormal tissue in the
      patient's body. Tryptophan is a normal building block of proteins in the body. Sometimes in
      the case of cancer and other diseases, Tryptophan is processed abnormally, and possible
      treatments for this abnormality are of great interest because of the potential to improve
      cancer care.

      Coordinating Center: Southeast Phase 2 Consortium (SEP2C), Moffitt Cancer Center.

      Research participation involves up to three experimental imaging examination visits in
      radiology: a baseline before the patient starts a cancer treatment, a follow-up a few days
      later, and a later follow up to see how the treatment may affect normal or abnormal
      processing of Tryptophan.

      The research imaging results will be linked with other evidence of the patient's disease, but
      will not effect their care.

    <measure>Occurrence of Detected Changes in Regions of Interest (ROIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in C-11 AMT uptake and localization (measured by SUV) between baseline and approximately 4 days after initiation of treatment. The primary objective is to determine whether such changes can be detected in regions of interest (ROIs) using PET/CT imaging in patients with metastatic breast cancer enrolled in NCI 8461/ MCC16025. The SUV values in identified regions of interest (ROIs) for each patient will be compared over time between baseline and approximately 4 days after initiation of treatment, and after completion of the protocol treatment. The analysis will be largely exploratory and descriptive as the sample size and study design will likely preclude an adequate/definitive statistical conclusion of SUV values between the two time points.</description>

    <description>The experimental examination for this research is the administration by a needle in a vein of Tryptophan labeled with a radioactive tracer (a substance is believed to enhance imaging for easier detection and measurement), Carbon 11, when when the patient has not eaten for five hours. A standard PET/CT scanner is then used to create images of the tracer a few minutes later.</description>
