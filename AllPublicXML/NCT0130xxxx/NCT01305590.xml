  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In anticipation of a pilot study incorporating behavioral economics into the treatment of
      infectious diseases, we will conduct a survey with HIV/AIDS patients at the Ponce Clinic
      (Infectious Disease Program of Grady Memorial Hospital, Emory University School of Medicine,
      Atlanta, GA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are planning a study to improve health outcomes among patients with HIV/AIDS using
      insights from behavioral economics and financial incentives. We will conduct a survey with
      HIV/AIDS patients at Ponce Clinic (Infectious Disease Program of Grady Memorial Hospital,
      Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). The patients will be low-income persons
      living with HIV/AIDS and possessing varying degrees of medication adherence. We want to
      better understand how this particular population would react to commitment devices designed
      to increase medication adherence. We will survey participants to see if they would prefer
      more commitment, in the form of a &quot;Take-Medication-Get-Paid&quot; plan; less commitment, in the
      form of an &quot;Attend-Clinic-Get-Paid&quot; plan; or if they would prefer to designate their own
      levels of commitment.

The study also included 70 individuals in a passive control (PC) arm, who did not receive financial incentives. Individuals in the PC arm were not enrolled in the randomized trial but met basic study eligibility criteria during the same time period.</intervention_model_description>
