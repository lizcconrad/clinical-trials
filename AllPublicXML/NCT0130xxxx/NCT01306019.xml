      Background:

        -  X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) is caused by a genetic abnormality in
           the IL2RG gene that affects the growth and development of immune cells such as white
           blood cells. Individuals with XSCID have difficulty fighting infections, which may lead
           to chronic or severe illness and death. The primary treatment for XSCID is replacement
           of the patient s immune system with a normal immune system through a bone marrow
           transplant. The best outcomes in transplant patients are achieved when the bone marrow
           comes from a sibling, but parents and matching unrelated donors can provide bone marrow
           for transplant as well. However, because these transplant procedures are not always
           effective, researchers are studying gene transfer treatment as an approach to treating
           XSCID.

        -  Lentiviral gene transfer treatment uses good genes to replace defective genes. A
           lentivirus is a virus that has been modified to carry corrected genes into the blood
           through corrected stem cells. By collecting an individual s stem cells and modifying
           them with a lentivirus, the gene-corrected cells can be returned into the blood to help
           produce normal healthy immune cells. Gene transfer treatment with lentivirus vector has
           been used in humans but has never been studied in patients with XSCID.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of lentiviral gene transfer as a treatment for
      children and adolescents with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adolescents between 2 and 20 years of age who have XSCID related to a defect
      in the IL2RG gene and who are not currently under treatment with strong immune-modulating or
      chemotherapy drugs.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and
           urine tests, and bone marrow samples to collect stem cells for the procedure.

        -  Participants will be admitted to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center 11 to
           12 days before receiving gene-corrected blood stem cells.

        -  Participants will receive palifermin for 3 days, followed by busulfan for 2 days.
           Palifermin will help prevent side effects from busulfan, and busulfan will help suppress
           the immune system in preparation for the gene transfer. Participants will have regular
           blood tests during this preparation period.

        -  Participants will receive a transfer of their corrected blood stem cells about 36 to 48
           hours after the second dose of busulfan. The cells will be injected over 5 to 10 minutes
           under close monitoring.

        -  The day after the transfer, participants will have 3 more days of palifermin.

        -  Participants will remain in the hospital for several weeks, possibly as long as 6 weeks,
           while the response to treatment is monitored.

        -  Participants will continue to be monitored for immune function and possible side effects
           after leaving the hospital, and will be followed for up to 15 years after the procedure
           to evaluate the long-term effects of gene transfer therapy. The monitoring will involve
           regular physical exams and blood samples.

      This is a non-randomized clinical trial of gene transfer using a self-inactivating,
      insulated, lentiviral gene transfer vector to treat 13 patients with X-linked severe combined
      immunodeficiency (XSCID, also called SCID-X1) who are between 2 and 40 years of age; who do
      not have a tissue matched sibling who can donate bone marrow for a transplant; who may have
      failed to obtain sufficient benefit from a previous half-tissue matched bone marrow
      transplant; and who have clinically significant impairment of immunity. A patient s own
      precursor cells (also called blood stem cells) that give rise in the marrow to blood and
      immune cells will have been or will be collected from the patient s blood or bone marrow. A
      patient will not proceed to gene transfer treatment in this protocol until there are at least
      3 million blood stem cells per kilogram body weight collected from the patient. At the NIH
      the patient blood stem cells will be collected from either the blood or bone marrow under
      another protocol (NIH protocol 94-1-0073 or a successor approved protocol) that is specific
      for collection of such cells. In most cases the harvested blood stem cells are put into
      frozen storage before use in this protocol. When the patient enrolled in this protocol has
      the required number of blood stem cells harvested, then the patient s blood stem cells will
      be grown in tissue culture and exposed to the lentiviral gene transfer vector containing the
      corrective gene. These gene corrected blood stem cells will be administered by vein to the
      patient. To increase engraftment of the corrected blood stem cells, patients will receive on
      2 days before the gene transfer treatment a chemotherapy drug called busulfan at a total dose
      of 6 mg/kilogram body weight (3 mg/kilogram body weight/daily times 2 days) that is a little
      more than one-third the dose used in many standard bone marrow transplants. Patients will
      also be given another drug called palifermin that helps prevent the main side effect from the
      busulfan that is a type of inflammation the mouth, stomach and bowels called mucositis. After
      this treatment, patients will be monitored to see if the treatment is safe and whether their
      immune system improves. Patients will be followed at frequent intervals for the first 2
      years, and less frequently thereafter so that the effectiveness in restoration of immune
      function and the safety of the treatment can be evaluated.

      XSCID is a genetic disease caused by defects in common gamma chain, a protein found at the
      surface of immune cells called lymphocytes and necessary to their growth and function. XSCID
      patients cannot make T-lymphocytes necessary to fight infections, and their B-cells fail to
      make essential antibodies. Without normal T- and B-lymphocyte function patients develop fatal
      infections in infancy unless they are rescued by a bone marrow transplant from a healthy
      donor. The best type of transplant is from a tissue matched healthy brother or sister, but
      most XSCID patients do not have a tissue matched sibling, and are treated with a transplant
      from a parent who is only half-matched by tissue typing. While a half-matched transplant from
      a parent can be life-saving for an infant with XSCID, a subset of patients fail to achieve
      sufficient long lasting restoration of immunity to prevent infections and other chronic
      problems.

      Recent trials of gene transfer treatments using mouse retrovirus vectors for infants with
      XSCID have been performed and have demonstrated that this type of gene transfer can be an
      alternate approach for significantly restoring immunity to infants with XSCID. However, among
      the 18 infants with XSCID benefiting long term from the gene transfer treatment, 5 developed
      T-lymphocyte leukemia and 1 died of this leukemia. Furthermore, when older children with
      XSCID were treated with gene transfer, the restoration of immunity was very much less than
      seen in the infants. These observations of gene transfer treatments using mouse retrovirus
      vectors to treat infants and older patients with XSCID suggests that safer and more effective
      vectors were needed, and that there also may be a need to give chemotherapy conditioning to
      increase engraftment in the marrow of the gene corrected blood stem cells. Our data and other
      published studies suggest that lentivectors that are derived from the human immunodeficiency
      virus and have the properties of our highly modified vector called CL20-4i-EF1alpha-
      HgammaC-OPT have a reduced interaction with nearby genes and therefore less of a tendency to
      activate genes that may lead to cancer formation. Also, this type of lentivector may work
      better at getting into blood stem cells.

      The study purpose is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of lentiviral gene transfer
      treatment at restoring immune function to 13 XSCID patients who are 2 to 40 years of age, and
      have significant impairment of immunity. Early evidence for effectiveness will be defined by
      appearance and expansion in the circulation of the patient s own gene corrected T-lymphocytes
      with a functional gammac gene and improved laboratory measures of immune function. The
      primary endpoint for efficacy will be at 2 years after treatment, and will include these
      laboratory parameters plus evidence for clinical benefit. Evidence for safety will focus on
      maintenance of a diversity of gene marked cells and no occurrence of abnormal pattern of
      production of blood cells or any leukemia or other cancer. The primary study endpoints for
      all laboratory and clinical measures of efficacy and safety will occur at 2 years after gene
      transfer treatment. However, data collection regarding efficacy will occur at frequent
      intervals during the 2 years leading up to the endpoint analysis, and long term safety and
      efficacy evaluation will continue at intervals during the long term follow-up required by
      regulation in gene transfer treatment studies.
