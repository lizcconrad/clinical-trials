  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mulberry leaf teas or extracts are used as a natural remedy for diabetes in some countries.
      Animal studies have shown some effect of mulberry leaf extract on blood glucose. The purpose
      of this trial is to assess the effect of mulberry leaf extract on type 2 diabetics, by
      measuring blood glucose two hours after eating a meal and taking a capsule containing either
      mulberry leaf extract or a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will participate in a double blind randomized cross over trial for 6 weeks. Four 2
      weeks, half of the type 2 diabetic patients will receive mulberry leaf capsules three times
      per day with meals (made from Mulberry Zuccarin tablets - New Nordic, 400 mg of mulberry leaf
      extract per tablet) and half will receive placebo capsules. Following a one week wash out
      period, the treatments administered to each group will be reversed for the next 2 weeks, and
      data will continue to be gathered for a final wash out week. Patients will keep a diary of
      food, exercise, and fasting glucose each morning as well as at least one 2 hour pc glucose
      each day. Weight, hemoglobin A1C, liver function tests, and renal function tests will be done
      at baseline and at the end of the 6 weeks. As well, blood pressure will be monitored when the
      2 weekly batches of medication are distributed, and at the end of the 6 weeks.

    <description>Mulberry leaf extract (400 mg, Mulberry Zuccarin, New Nordic) or placebo will be administered with meals to type 2 diabetics. Half the patients will receive mulberry leaf extract for the first two weeks and half will receive placebo. Following a one week wash out period, the interventions will be reversed for another 2 weeks, followed by a final wash out period. Subjects will keep diaries of food, exercise, daily fasting glucose, and at least one 2 hour pc glucose per day for the 6 weeks of the trial.
Baseline renal function blood work and urine, liver function blood work, hemoglobin A1C, weight, and blood pressure will be done. These will be repeated at the end of each subject's 6 weeks in the trial. In addition, blood pressure will be checked with the distribution of the each 2 week batch of medications.</description>
