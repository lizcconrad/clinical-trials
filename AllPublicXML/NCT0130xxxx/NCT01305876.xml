  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Assessment Scale for Children (BASC).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year. The classroom teachers filled out the BASC pre- and post-intervention on each participant. This took place June 2009, after the yoga intervention took place. Has been completed</time_frame>
    <description>The BASC was chosen to track the effect of the yoga intervention on classroom behavior. The BASC is a tool tht is frequently used within the school setting to track classroom behavior and overall wellbeing of students. The BASC has been shown to have adequate reliability and validity based on concurrence with similar scales (Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1992). Subscales include anxiety, aggression, attention problems, hyperactivity, conduct problems, depression, withdrawal and social skills.</description>

    <measure>The Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn &amp; Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year. The teachers filled out the SKAMP pre- and post-intervetnion to assess participants focus in class. This took place June 2009, after the yoga interveniton. Has been completed.</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP was used for teachers to assess classroom attention. The SKAMP is a validated teacher observation assessment rating scale composed of 10 items, designed to describe classroom behavior and attention (Gansle et al., 2004; Sharon, Wigal, &amp; Wigal, 2006).The SKAMP is used to monitor interventions and has been shown to be sensitive to change (McBurnett, Swanson, Pfiffner, &amp; Tam, 1997).</description>
