  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain two year follow up data for subjects that received six
      vaccinations of NicVAX in prior phase III studies. No treatment will be administered.
      Anti-nicotine antibody levels and safety data will be collected.

      This study will follow subjects that participated in the NicVAX phase III studies for a
      second year. These predecessor studies, Nabi-4514 (NCT#00836199) and Nabi-4515 (NCT#01102114)
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6 vaccinations of NicVAX or placebo as an aid to smoking
      cessation. The two phase III studies are one year in duration, and subjects who complete
      these studies are eligible to enroll in Nabi-4522. As the phase III studies are ongoing,
      subject assignment to NicVAX or placebo will remain masked. No intervention will be
      administered in Nabi-4522. Subjects will be followed for immunogenicity (anti-nicotine
      antibody level)and for safety.
