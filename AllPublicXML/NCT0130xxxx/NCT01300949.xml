      The Spaeth-Richman Contrast Sensitivity (SPARCS) test is a new method of assessing contrast
      sensitivity. The test is performed on any standard computer with internet access. Patients
      will be tested with SPARCS and with the standard Pelli-Robson contrast test.

      Objective: To test a new method of determining contrast sensitivity that does not require
      visual acuity and tests various areas of the visual field.

      Hypothesis: A method of determining contrast sensitivity that does not require letter
      recognition (as in the Pelli-Robson test) eliminates the confounders of literacy and pattern
      recognition, and will permit a more valid determination of contrast sensitivity.

      Patients will perform SPARCS and Pelli-Robson twice; once each with two separate observers
      for reproducibility and intra-observer reliability. The order of testing will be randomized
      to SPARCS, Pelli, Pelli, SPARCS or Pelli, SPARCS, SPARCS, Pelli.

    <description>If this instrument is a user-friendly, highly specific and sensitive method of determining contrast sensitivity, without influence of acuity, a major advance will be made. It is conceivable that the test could be used for detection of visual disease globally because of ease of operation and availability. Increasing numbers of studies are showing that contrast sensitivity is highly related to patients' ability to perform activities of daily living. It is anticipated that using this technique may become the standard way of assessing visual ability.</description>
