    <textblock>
      Psoriatic nails of patient's right hand were treated using PDL (595 nm) .The pulsed duration
      is 1.5ms, the beam diameter is 7mm, and the laser energy is 8.0 to 10.0 J/cm2. The treatment
      course of pulse dye laser is once monthly for 6 months. Psoriatic nails of both hands are
      treated with Tazarotene cream for 6 months. Clinical efficacy is statistically evaluated
      according to Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score differences between right and left
      hand one month after 3rd and 6th therapy.
