  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims at assessing the influence of octreotide on
      pancreatic fistula or complications following pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with soft
      pancreas. Previously reported trials have included all types of pancreatic resections and
      have include all types of pancreas and have shown no clearcut benefit of octreotide after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Soft pancreas and normal sized duct are the risk factors for
      fistula following PD. This study's focus is on this select group of patients and aims to
      assess the role of octreotide in patients with soft pancreas.
