  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infiltration of the skin with lidocaine is standard practice prior to lumbar epidural
      placement in laboring parturients1. Skin infiltration, although brief, can be very stressful
      and painful for patients.2 This initial discomfort may cause patient anxiety, thus increasing
      the pain and decreasing the satisfaction with the procedure. To reduce this discomfort,
      various topical alternatives have been investigated with varying degrees of success.1-4 Now
      that a topical mixture of lidocaine that is safe and effective is available, the
      investigators would like to determine if it can reduce the pain of skin infiltration in
      particular and epidural placement as a whole.

Both patches appear identical to the physician. The team will then wait for the patient to request an epidural due to labor pain, a minimum of 30 minutes from patch placement and a maximum of 12 hours.</description>
