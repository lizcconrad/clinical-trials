      This research is looking at the effect of biobehavioral factors such as stress and whether
      these factors alter how the body responds to chemotherapy, one of the purposes of this study
      is to determine if the addition of a beta-blocker such as Propranolol (Inderal) is tolerable
      when given with chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      primary peritoneal cancer. An additional purpose of the study is to understand if behavioral
      factors such as depression and anxiety can alter different blood markers that affect tumor
      vascularity. The Investigator wishes to determine whether the use of beta-blocker drugs such
      as Inderal, might alter these behavioral factors by drawing blood prior to and after the
      administration of Inderal as well as giving behavioral questionaires at different time
      points. Beta-blockers are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension, protection of the
      heart after a heart attack, and irregularities in heartbeats. Altering these factors might
      boost the immune system and affect other areas of cancer biology, thereby allowing the
      chemotherapy to be more effective. The significance of this research is that it may help
      improve our treatments of this disease in the future.

    <description>Propranolol 40mg po orally twice daily to begin at least 48 hours prior to surgical debulking. This will ideally be titrated in order to maintain a heart rate between 60 and 80 without hypotension.
After surgery, the patient will resume the propranolol once tolerating clear liquids in the hospital and will remain on them until completion of chemotherapy.
After completion of chemotherapy, the patient will be weaned off the medication over the following two weeks.</description>
