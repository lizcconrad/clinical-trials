    <description>Participants will complete behavioral tasks at each of three visits to assess the effects of stimulation settings on task performance. At each research visit, behavior will be assessed beginning at 1 hour after the stimulation is adjusted to the experimental settings. Stimulation settings will be returned to each patient's treatment levels at the culmination of each visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease that meet criteria for
             treatment of their disease with STN-DBS. Participants will be selected for this study
             without regard for age (provided they are older than 18), gender or ethnic background.

          -  Participants must have undergone subthalamic nucleus DBS surgery and be receiving
             treatment at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, CA

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under 18 years old.

          -  Patients with mini-mental status scores below 26/30.

          -  Patients with known psychiatric disease.

          -  Patients who are too infirm, demented or dysarthric to clearly understand the
             consenting process, task instructions, or to communicate verbally regarding
             participation or non-participation.
