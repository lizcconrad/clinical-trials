  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the treatment burden and excess morbidity and mortality associated with acute infective
      exacerbations in cystic fibrosis, a clear understanding of the mechanisms involved in the
      origins of an infective exacerbation and the response to antibiotics is vital to improving
      long-term outcomes in CF.

      This study will examine 3 areas of interest in CF exacerbations.

        1. Bacterial biodiversity and its clinical significance

        2. The role of bacteria which are able to rapidly mutate (hypermutators)

        3. Inter-bacterial communication and its role in infective exacerbations

      Study Hypothesis 1

      Increased microbiological diversity represents a balanced community of bacteria. The presence
      of a diverse population of bacteria in CF infections therefore predicts a better outcome for
      treatment than when a population consists of a small number of more virulent organisms.

      Study Hypothesis 2

      Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypermutators can mutate much more often than ordinary Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa bacteria. Hypermutators are likely to grow better when the bacteria are under
      stress, such as during antibiotic treatment or during an infection. They are, however, weaker
      organisms because of the multiple mutations they have undergone. Their presence does not
      relate to clinical outcome but may be associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

      Study Hypothesis 3

      Some Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria communicate with each other by secreting and responding
      to chemicals known as quorum sensing (QS)molecules. As well as affecting the behaviour of
      bacteria, these QS molecules can cause inflammation in the lung of CF patients. Selective
      growth of QS-producing organisms can trigger lung exacerbations in CF. If antibiotics kill
      this population of bacteria and QS molecule levels drop in the lung, patients recover from
      infection quickly. Failure to kill these bacteria with antibiotics allow QS molecule levels
      to remain elevated and patients to have prolonged infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will sequentially recruit patients attending our CF centre with an infective exacerbation
      of CF, who are chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      We will record spirometry, blood markers of inflammation, quality of life questionnaires and
      investigate sputum samples for:

        1. Routine microbiology

        2. Bacterial diversity using 16s RNA identification techniques

        3. Relative abundance of P.aeruginosa hypermutators

        4. Levels of quorum sensing molecules

      These observations will be undertaken before commencing intravenous antibiotic therapy, on
      days 7, 10 and the last day of antibiotic therapy. Patients will also be reviewed one month
      after the end of antibiotic therapy where spirometry and a sputum sample will be collected
      for the above investigations.
