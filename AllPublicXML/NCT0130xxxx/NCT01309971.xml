      The purpose of this study will allow us to observe and follow the subjects' treatment from
      DPBRN Prevalence of Questionable Occlusal Caries Lesions Study over a 24 month period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been very few studies regarding questionable lesions, virtually no clinical
      evaluations of the progression of questionable lesions over time, and no studies depicting
      the prevalence of these lesions. Since carious lesions have the ability to arrest and
      possibly reverse, determining how often these lesions are being seen in practice and learning
      more about their characteristics and patient risk assessment are important steps in order to
      manage these lesions without unnecessary surgical intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients needed to have at least one permanent tooth with a questionable lesion. This
             means that subjects were at least 6 years old because that is when the permanent first
             molar typically erupts.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients under 6 years old

          -  patients 6 years old and older who do not have a questionable lesion
