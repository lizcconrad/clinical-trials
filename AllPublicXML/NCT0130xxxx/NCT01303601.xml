  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine may have some antidepressant properties and olanzapine monotherapy has been shown
      efficacy in bipolar depressive episodes in retrospective studies. However, there has been no
      prospective study about the monotherapy of olanzapine. The investigators conducted a
      randomized, placebo-controlled study to test the efficacy of olanzapine monotherapy for
      treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder.

      The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial, with research assessors
      and patients intended to be blind to the intervention status. The staff members performing
      the assessment were not involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention.68 patients
      were randomized to assigned 6 weeks by olanzapine or placebo. Medications were provided in
      double-blind fashion. The assessments include Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale,
      Young Mania Rating Scale, clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, Clinical
      Global Impressions-Improvement scale, response and remission rates, and Treatment Emergent
      Symptom Scale.
