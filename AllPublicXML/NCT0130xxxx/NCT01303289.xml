      The main objective of this trial is the clinical evaluation of a normoproteic diet, when this
      diet is used for total enteral nutrition in geriatric people.

      For 3 months,all the participants in the study will receive only tube feeding: The
      experimental group will receive the commercial preparation to evaluate (T-Diet Plus ®,
      Vegenat SA) and the control group will receive a standard diet (Jevity ®, Abbott
      Laboratories).

      The project includes:

        -  Product tolerance study: gastrointestinal and metabolic complications related to the
           product administration.

        -  The monitoring of the intervention, and clinical and nutritional evaluation of the
           participants, including anthropometry, quality of life related to the health and
           clinical and nutritional status analytical evaluation (hematology and biochemistry).

        -  The determination of the major biochemical variables related to the lipid profile and
           assessment of the antioxidant defense system, and also certain markers of metabolic
           syndrome and associated cardiovascular risk.
