  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging techniques have considerably improved over the last decades and ocular adnexal
      lymphomas (OALs) nowadays can be detected. As major advances in immunophenotyping and
      molecular diagnostics in histology have been achieved offering an accurate diagnosis, the
      investigators would like to introduce that surgical biopsy of an orbital lymphoma becomes
      crucial for the possibility of a correct diagnosis and proper treatment. As radiotherapy
      accomplished great preciseness as well and OALs respond excellently to radiation, this
      therapy should be the treatment of choice in local defined lymphomas instead of blind
      treatment with steroids. Radiation results in great local control rates of 85% to 100%
