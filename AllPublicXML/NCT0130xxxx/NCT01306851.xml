  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anastomotic leak is one of the most feared complications in abdominal surgery. Certain
      control methods have been described but the incidence of that complication remains high and
      is the first cause of mortality in operations where gut anastomosis are performed.

      With the aim to prove that the use of fibrin glue in the gut anastomosis can improve gut
      cicatrization, the investigators started the recruitment of patients to that clinical trial
      in 2007 with the study hypothesis that patients with a gut anastomosis where fibrin glue was
      used, had less anastomotic leaks than that where the fibrin glue was not used.

      The investigators have calculated the number of patients necessaries to have statistical
      significant differences in 200 patients with a rate anastomotic leak expected to be higher
      than 10%.

      The study include all the patients that usually arrive to our surgery department and that are
      expected to have a high risk gut anastomosis: rectal anastomosis, GI anastomosis in the obese
      patient, small bowel anastomosis in the obstructed one and esophageal anastomosis.

      The study is randomized, simple blind where the patient does not know if they are in the
      fibrin glue group or not, and prospectively analyzed. All the clinical and laboratory or
      radiographic finds relative to the occurrence of an anastomotic leak are recorded.
