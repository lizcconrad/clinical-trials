    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized controlled trial of two standard anti-reflux procedures, Nissen
      fundoplication versus gastrojejunal feeding tubes (GJ tubes), in children and adolescents
      with functional and intellectual impairment who have gastrostomy feeding tubes and medically
      refractory or severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This is a pilot study to
      establish feasibility before initiating a multi-centered study.
