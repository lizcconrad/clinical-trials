  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the difference in cardiac strain rate evolution in
      elderly early BC patients treated with (neo) adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy
      compared with a non-anthracycline regimen (Taxotere-cyclophosphamide) CT.

      This study also will compare the serum biomarkers profile during and after the (neo) adjuvant
      CT in both treatment arms, assess whether MRI allows detecting earlier than standard
      echocardiography the signs of cardiotoxicity, during and after adjuvant (neo) CT, assess
      whether brain PET-CT allows detecting regional functional impairment in patients receiving
      CT, evaluate cognitive function before and after (neo) adjuvant CT in both treatment arms,
      evaluate distress and functional autonomy before and after (neo) adjuvant CT in both
      treatment arms, evaluate psychological state and burden of primary caregivers before and
      after (neo) adjuvant CT in both treatment arms, evaluate primary caregivers abilities to
      detect patients' distress and functional autonomy before and after (neo) adjuvant CT in both
      treatment arms, evaluate the short and long-term toxicity profile of the regimens, estimate
      the 10-year risk of relapse and/or death using the Adjuvant!Online tool, and estimate the
      Framingham risk score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease (10-year risk).

      Considering that both anthracycline-based and Taxotere-cyclophosphamide CT have established
      efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of elderly patients with early breast cancer, and the
      paucity of data for early cardiac toxicities with anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy
      compared to non-anthracycline regimen, this is the first randomized study to evaluate early
      cardiac signs based on doppler myocardial imaging (DMI). The results of this study could
      improve the monitoring of the cardiac function of elderly patients candidates to receive
      adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer.

    <description>The primary null hypothesis is that the means are equal versus the alternative hypothesis that the means are different. We plan to perform the comparison using a two-sided Student's t-test with α=5%. The power of the study to detect the difference described below has been set at 90%.
One hundred twenty patients candidate to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant CT for early BC will be randomized 1:1 to receive either epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (EC) or docetaxel (Taxotere) -cyclophosphamide (TC) for 4 cycles.</description>
