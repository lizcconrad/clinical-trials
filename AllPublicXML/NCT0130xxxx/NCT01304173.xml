  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study involving a retrospective review of medical records of adult
      patients who have been treated with intravesical valrubicin for bladder carcinoma in situ
      (CIS) since October 2009.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial treatment for bladder CIS is TURBT followed by intravesical immunotherapy with BCG.
      Valrubicin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-refractory bladder CIS in patients
      for whom immediate cystectomy would be associated with unacceptable morbidity or mortality.
      The recommended course of therapy is 6 doses of 800 mg each administered intravesically once
      a week. While the benefit risk profile of valrubicin has been established in several clinical
      trials, current data on effectiveness and tolerability when used in clinical practice are
      lacking. This protocol outlines a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety
      and tolerability of intravesical valrubicin in the treatment of NMIBC in a clinical practice
      setting.
