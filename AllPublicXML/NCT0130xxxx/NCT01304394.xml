    <description>Practical handling and ease of use were measured with questionnaires and a VAS assessment of the Ped3CB, which was to be compared with the standard practice of the pharmacy or nursing ward at each site.
All AEs were recorded during study treatment through 2 days after the last infusion. Vital signs and adverse events were recorded daily for the 5 days of the study in all patients and during the optional treatment period (an additional 5 days) in preterm newborn infants.</description>

    <description>The Ped3CB is a ready to use, triple-chamber bag containing a sterile, nonpyrogenic combination of amino acids (Primene®, Baxter) with electrolytes, glucose, and lipids (ClinOleic®, Baxter) in separate compartments for intravenous (IV) PN. The dosage, frequency and duration is dependent on patient's weight, age, clinical status as well as addition energy or protein given enterally/orally.</description>

             nutritional needs, and patients in the other groups (term infants toddlers; children)
             were to require PN representing, at baseline, at least 50% of total estimated
             nutritional needs.

             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 6 days or with a severe illness with foreseeable
