  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with overactive bladder are often treated with tolterodine, a medication that helps
      relax the bladder, helping symptoms of urinary incontinence and urinary frequency. Sometimes
      patients do not have a satisfactory response, and may benefit from trying an alternative oral
      medicine. Fesoterodine is related to tolterodine by producing the same active substance that
      acts on the bladder, but potentially at higher and more effective levels. So, a patient who
      has a poor response to tolterodine may still obtain a good response to fesoterodine. This
      study will help find out if this is what happens.

    <measure>Mean Number of Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Episodes Per 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>UUI episodes were defined as those with the urinary sensation scale (USS) rating of 5 in the diary. USS range from 1 to 5: 1. No feeling of urgency, 2. Mild feeling of urgency, 3. Moderate feeling of urgency, 4. Severe feeling of urgency, 5. Unable to hold; leak urine.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>UUI episodes were defined as those with the urinary sensation scale (USS) rating of 5 in the diary. USS range from 1 to 5: 1. No feeling of urgency, 2. Mild feeling of urgency, 3. Moderate feeling of urgency, 4. Severe feeling of urgency, 5. Unable to hold; leak urine.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Micturitions include episodes of voluntary micturition and episodes of Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI). UUI episodes were defined as those micturitions with USS rating of 5 in the diary in participants with UUI at baseline. USS rating 5: Unable to hold; leak urine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturition-Related Urgency Episodes Per 24 Hours at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mean number of micturition-related urgency episodes per 24 hours was calculated as the total number of micturitions with USS rating of greater than or equal to 3 divided by the total number of days that diary data was collected at that visit. USS range from 1 to 5: 1. No feeling of urgency, 2. Mild feeling of urgency, 3. Moderate feeling of urgency, 4. Severe feeling of urgency, 5. Unable to hold; leak urine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PPBC: single-item, self-administered validated questionnaire. Participant answered: &quot;Which of the following statements describes your bladder condition best at the moment?&quot; on a 6-point scale, 1=no problems at all; 2=some very minor problems; 3=some minor problems; 4=some moderate problems; 5=severe problems; 6=many severe problems. Change=observation minus baseline. Results categorized as Deterioration (Positive change from baseline); No Change (scores change=0); Minor Improvement (negative score change in magnitude of 1); Major Improvement (negative score change in magnitude of &gt;=2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Urgency Perception Scale (UPS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>UPS: single-item, self-administered validated questionnaire. Participant answered: &quot;Which of the following would typically describe your experience when you have a desire to urinate?&quot; on a 3-point scale, 1=usually not able to hold urine; 2=usually able to hold urine (without leaking) until I reach a toilet if I go to the toilet immediately; 3= usually able to finish what I am doing before going to the toilet (without leaking). Change = observation minus baseline. Results categorized as Deterioration (Negative change); no change (Score change=0); improvement (Positive change).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Symptom Bother Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>OAB-q: a self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire that assesses how much the participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated by participant on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Symptom bother score derived as sum of scores for questions 1-8; lowest possible raw score: 8; highest possible score: 48. Data analyzed based on transformation of the score to a 0 to 100 scale [(Actual total raw score - lowest possible value of raw score)/range]*100. Higher scores values indicative of greater symptom bother. Change=observation minus baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Domains and Total HRQL Score of Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>OAB-q: self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire, assesses how much participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Questions 9 to 33 constitute HRQL, includes domains: concern, coping, sleep, and social function. HRQL domain and total raw score derived as sum of scores. Transformed score range 0 to 100 (Total HRQL or domain) = [(Highest possible raw score-Actual total raw score)/Raw score range]*100. Higher transformed scores indicative of better HRQL.</description>

        <description>OAB-q: a self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire that assesses how much the participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated by participant on Likert scale 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Symptom bother score derived as sum of scores for questions 1-8; lowest possible raw score: 8; highest possible score: 48. Data analyzed based on transformation of the score to a 0 to 100 scale [(Actual total raw score – lowest possible value of raw score)/range]*100. Higher scores values indicative of greater symptom bother. Change=observation minus baseline.</description>
