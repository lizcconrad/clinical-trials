      This phase I study has been designed to establish the safety, tolerability and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of four separate regimens for patients with metastatic breast cancer:
      dose- escalating BKM120 when combined with capecitabine (Arm A), with capecitabine and
      trastuzumab (Arm C), or with capecitabine and lapatinib (Arm D) and dose- escalating BEZ235
      when combined with capecitabine (Arm B).

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the safety, DLT, and MTD of BKM120 when administered concomitantly with
           capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer (ARM A)

        -  To determine the safety, DLT, and MTD of BYL719 when administered concomitantly with
           capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer (ARM B)

        -  To determine the safety, DLT, and MTD of BKM120 when administered concomitantly with
           capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer (ARM C)

        -  To determine the safety, DLT, and MTD of BKM120 when administered concomitantly with
           capecitabine and lapatinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer (ARM D)

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of BKM120 in combination with capecitabine
           including acute and chronic toxicities

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability ofBYL719 in combination with capecitabine
           including acute and chronic toxicities

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of BKM120 in combination with capecitabine
           and trastuzumab, including acute and chronic toxicities

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of BKM120 in combination with capecitabine
           and lapatinib, including acute and chronic toxicities

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To obtain primary, archived paraffin-embedded tissues to evaluate intrinsic breast
           cancer subtype (i.e., HER2, luminal B, etc.) and other important predictive biomarkers
           (PI3K activating mutations, pAKT, p-mTOR), and explore correlations with therapeutic
           response to BKM120 or BYL719 in combination with capecitabine, with or without the
           addition of lapatinib or trastuzumab

        -  To evaluate the PK profile of BKM120 with concomitant capecitabine

        -  To examine other signaling pathway signatures

        -  To examine drug effect in pre- and post-treatment core biopsy specimens (optional) from
           appropriate patients

        -  To explore patient motivators for enrolling in early phase studies through patient
           interview

      Outline:

      This study is a four-arm multi-center, open-label phase I clinical trial testing the
      hypothesis that the addition of BKM120 to capecitabine (ARM A); the addition of BYL719 to
      capecitabine (ARM B); the addition of BKM120 to capecitabine plus trastuzumab (ARM C); or the
      addition of BKM120 to capecitabine plus lapatinib (ARM D) will be safe and tolerable as
      evidenced by the DLT seen. Following screening and informed consent, treatment will be
      initiated with one of the following:

      ARM A: BKM120 PO daily for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no
      capecitabine is administered during the third week).

      ARM B: BYL719 PO BID for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no
      capecitabine is administered during the third week of the cycle)

      ARM C: BKM120 PO daily for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no
      capecitabine is administered during the third week) plus trastuzumab by intravenous infusion
      on Day 1

      ARM D: BKM120 PO daily for 21 days (3 weeks) plus capecitabine PO BID for 2 weeks (no
      capecitabine is administered during the third week) plus lapatinib PO daily for 21 days.

      The consents are separate documents and the patient and the study team know ahead of time
      which Arm is open and enrolling and can therefore focus their discussion with the patient on
      that ARM.

      Cycles in each arm will be repeated every 3 weeks (21 days). Patients will continue on
      protocol-based therapy until progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or patient
      death.

             -Adults of reproductive potential must be able and agree to use appropriate
             contraception. Double barrier contraceptives must be used throughout the trial by both
             sexes..

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study. Women
             assigned to ARMS AC and D must use highly effective contraception for 16 weeks after
             stopping treatment. Women assigned to ARM A must continue contraceptive measures for 4
             weeks after stopping treatment. Women assigned to ARM B must continue contraceptive
             measures for 5 weeks after stopping treatment. The highly effective contraception is
             defined as either:

               -  True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
                  follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

                    1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel /film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

          -  For ARMs A, C and D, oral contraception (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods
             are not allowed as BKM120 and potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal
             contraceptives. For ARM B, oral contraceptives, injected or implanted hormonal methods
             are not allowed as the sole method of contraception, as BYL719 has not been
             characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with the PK and/or the
             effectiveness of OCs.

               -  Recovered from all reversible toxicities related to their previous treatment
                  (other than alopecia) to ≤grade 1 or baseline

             non-infectious pneumonitis during study, or if ARM C patient with brain metastases
             treated with glucocorticoid is enrolled. Topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled
