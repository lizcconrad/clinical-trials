      The purpose of this study is to compare classical massage and massage based on the tensegrity
      rule in treating people with painful shoulder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The joint system of the shoulder girdle is exposed to frequent overloading, which can cause
      painful shoulder. The therapeutic methods applied in the treatment of painful shoulder
      syndrome include among others oral pharmacotherapy, joint injections, kinesitherapy,
      ultrasound, electrotherapy, laser. Manual therapy, chiropractic and surgery could also be
      used. Attempts have also been made to apply classical massage in treating painful shoulder,
      although it is not often used due to its low effectiveness.This study compares classical
      massage and massage based on the tensegrity rule which is not commonly known.

Before the massage, palpable evaluation of the selected anatomical structures was carried out - to determine which tissues have the greatest sensitivity and which motor organs show increased tension (by pressing the attachment). In all the examined patients, pain of the following muscle attachments were shown:
latissimus muscle of the back
major pectoral muscle
supraspinous and infraspinous muscles
teres minor muscle
serratus anterior muscle
deltoid muscle The decision which muscles and fascias have to be massaged was made on the basis of the performed evaluation. In most cases the above mentioned tissues (together with other motor system organs which are structurally linked to it) were massaged to relax them.
A palpable evaluation of the previously examined points was again performed during the final part, with particular attention paid to painful muscles, in order to analyze the effectiveness of the performed relaxation.</description>
