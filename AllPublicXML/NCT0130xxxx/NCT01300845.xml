  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the most used humidifying system during oxygen therapy is a non heated device with
      weak efficiency and non-proven clinical benefits. This study aims to assess the lack of
      benefits of non-heated humidification compared to no humidification, as regards to the
      comfort of the patient receiving oxygen therapy.
