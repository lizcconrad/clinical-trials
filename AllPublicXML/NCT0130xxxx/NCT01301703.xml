  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pertussis is an acute respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. Rates of recent
      B. pertussis infection between 8%--26% have been reported among adults with cough illness of
      at least 5 days duration who sought medical care. The CDC recommends vaccinating patients
      aged 15 to 64 years old, once in 10 years. Although acellular vaccines such as BOOSTRIX have
      been evaluated in healthy population, the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in patients
      suffering from rheumatic diseases have not been established.

      Study population : 50 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients and 5 healthy controls

      Evaluation : the evaluation will be performed on week 0 and 4-6 weeks later. In terms of
      safety, the patients will be evaluated according to the Disease Activity Index (DAS). Blood
      will be drawn at each visit at tested for humoral response to tetanus and pertussis.
