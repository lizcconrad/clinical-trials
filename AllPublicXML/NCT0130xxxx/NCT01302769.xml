    <description>Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard treatment alone or standard treatment plus ear acupuncture. Subjects will be asked 15 minutes after their treatment to assess their pain on a scale of 0-10. After the subject has left the clinic, phone calls will be made at 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours to assess their pain level, ask about their missed hours from work, and ask the number of doses of ibuprofen taken. Subjects who report back after 48 hours with unimproved sore throat will be instructed to make a same day follow up with the clinic.</description>
