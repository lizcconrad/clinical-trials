    <description>The dosage is individualized depending on the depth of the NLF. The goal is to achieve optimal correction of both NLF with single implantations of Belotero® Basic and Juvéderm® Ultra 3 respectively. Each subject will be injected with Belotero® Basic and Lidocaine containing Juvéderm® Ultra 3 according to a split-face design. The allocation of fillers to the side of the face will be randomized. The randomization method is block-wise with a ratio 1:1 to the groups Belotero® Basic left and Juvéderm® Ultra 3 right, Belotero® Basic right and Juvéderm® Ultra 3 left.</description>
