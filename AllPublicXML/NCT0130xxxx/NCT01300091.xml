      Consumption of medical care and outcome of shoulder pain and disability in primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain and impairment are common in primary health care. The prognosis of several
      individuals consulting for a new episode of shoulder problem is surprisingly poor. The
      objectives are to characterize the consumption of medical care and outcome of shoulder pain
      and disability in primary health care.

      A composite questionnaire consisting of demographic information and ASES questionnaire was
      used to measure the shoulder function. The patients were sent a second questionnaire after
      one year.

        All patients consulting a general practitioner due to shoulder disorder during the
        recruitment period are included. The study population consists of two public health centres
        with a population of 120 000 individuals and two occupational medicine clinics with a
        population of 15 000 individuals. The population of health centres and occupational health
        clinics overlap partially.
