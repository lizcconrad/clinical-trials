  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of ranolazine on ETT (exercise treadmill
      test) exercise duration in four ethnic subgroups with established coronary artery disease and
      risk factor(s) for the metabolic syndrome: Caucasian, African American, Southeast Asian and
      East Indian.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that various ethnic subgroups are at differential risk for both the
      development and progression of coronary artery disease. The East Indian population is one of
      the highest risk populations for coronary artery disease. Much of this increased risk is
      driven by the development and progression of diabetes.

      Recent studies have shown that ranolazine has a favorable effect on glycemic control. In
      addition, it is an effective antianginal and antiarrhythmic agent.

      The investigators propose a pilot study look at the safety, tolerability and efficacy of this
      agent in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk factors for the
      metabolic syndrome from various ethnic backgrounds. In particular the investigators will
      focus on the Caucasian, African American, Southeast Asian and East Indian population.
