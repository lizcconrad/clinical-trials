      Aims:

      Primary objectives

        -  To determine the pathological complete response (CR)* rate of intermittent sunitinib
           administered with combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as systemic therapy for locally
           advanced or systemic NPC.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of intermittent sunitinib administered with
           combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as systemic therapy for locally advanced or
           systemic NPC.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To determine the clinical response rate (RR; complete and partial response)+ of
           intermittent sunitinib administered with combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as
           systemic therapy for locally advanced or systemic NPC.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects (imaging, circulating and tissue) of
           intermittent sunitinib administered with combination cisplatin and gemcitabine as
           systemic therapy for locally advanced or systemic NPC.

        -  To compare the early pharmacodynamic effects (imaging, circulating and tissue) of a
           loading dose of 12.5mg or 25mg sunitinib for 7 prior to administration of systemic
           cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy.
