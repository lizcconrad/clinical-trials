        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients that are 28 days up to 60 months of age at the time of the
             screening visit.

          2. Body weight &gt; or = 2.5 kg.

          3. Parent or legal guardian's written informed consent is required before any assessment
             is performed for patients.

          4. At study entry, patients should have a clinical diagnosis of FCAS, MWS, or NOMID and
             symptoms requiring pharmacological intervention. Prior agreement between the
             Investigator and Novartis for study eligibility is required for patients who do not
             have a molecular diagnosis of NALP3 mutations available (either testing not performed,
             or testing performed but negative) upon study entry. For those patients who have not
             been molecularly tested for NALP3 mutations, molecular testing should be performed
             during the course of the study.

          5. For patients treated with an IL-1 blocking agent (i.e. anakinra, rilonacept), these
             treatments should be discontinued prior to the baseline visit and patients must
             demonstrate active disease prior to treatment.

          6. Patients who are scheduled to receive an immunization, according to their local
             vaccination guidelines, with an inactivated vaccine must be willing to participate in
             the assessment schedule for vaccinated patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Preterm neonates for whom, in the Investigator's judgment, participation in the study
             is not deemed appropriate.

          2. History of recurrent and/or evidence of active bacterial, fungal, or viral infections
             (including HIV).

          3. Patients with immunodeficiency or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.

          4. Live vaccinations within &lt; or = 3 months prior to screening. No live vaccinations will
             be allowed throughout the course of this study and up to 3 months following the last
             dose.

          5. Patients with an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection according to following
             risk factors:

               -  Patients with recent close contact with persons known to have active pulmonary TB
                  disease

               -  Foreign-born patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis

               -  Patients with recent tuberculosis infection (including children &gt; 6 months with a
                  positive PPD test [defined as an induration of at least 10mm])

               -  Patients with end-stage renal disease

               -  Patients with diabetes mellitus

               -  Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy

               -  Patients with hematologic cancers.

          6. Participation in another trial within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives of the
             investigational compound (whichever is longer).

          7. Familial and social conditions rendering regular medical assessment not possible.

          8. Pediatric patients with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1.5 x 10 to the
             9th/l)

          <description>Adverse events (AEs) were defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgement of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed in the safety set population defined as participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Here, ‘n’ signifies participants evaluable for this measure at specified time points for each group, respectively.</population>
