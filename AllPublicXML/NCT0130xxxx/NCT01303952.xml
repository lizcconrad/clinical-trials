             titer (IgM or IgA) &gt;64 at 4°C, positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) when performed
             with polyspecific antiserum, negative (or only weakly positive) anti-IgG, and strongly
             positive with anti-C3d

          -  LDH level &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Clinical symptoms requiring treatment, such as anemia, anemia-related symptoms or
             hemolysis-related symptoms

          -  Sufficient supplementation of iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 prior to treatment
             phase

          -  Patient must be willing and able to give written informed consent;

          -  Patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis at least 14 days prior treatment

          -  Patient must avoid conception during the trial using a method that is most appropriate
             for their physical state and culture

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active aggressive lymphoma requiring therapy or an active non-lymphatic malignant
             disease other than basal cell carcinoma or CIS of the cervix

          -  Liver disease with elevated LDH

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/µL

             investigational agent, device, or procedure within 30 days prior to screening period

          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding, or intending to conceive during the course of the study,
