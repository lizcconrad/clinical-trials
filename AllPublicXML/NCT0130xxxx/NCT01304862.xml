  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mental health treatment disengagement may
      be mitigated by reducing barriers to self-management and enhancing self-management skills.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, more than four million young adults (age 18-25 years old) in the U.S. receive
      psychotropic medication or psychotherapy as treatment for a mental illness. One in every four
      of these young adults will disengage from mental health treatment before significant symptom
      remission is achieved. Mental health treatment disengagement may be mitigated by reducing
      barriers to self-management and enhancing self-management skills. Electronic self-management
      resource training for mental health (eSMART-MH) is an innovative use of avatars−virtual
      persons who tailor responses to users−to improve mental health treatment disengagement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement in Mental Health Treatment: Medical Adherence Medication Module (MAMMM)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medical Adherence Measure Medication Module (MAMMM) is a 7-item scale that will determine the patient's degree of engagement and initiation of mental health treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Illness Stigma: Alienation Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-item four point Likert type scale that asks participants to rate each item from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree); a higher score indicates more mental illness stigma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Health Literacy: In Our Own Voice Knowledge Measure (IOOVKM)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item scale that utilizes a 7-point Likert type scale with responses ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Total scores range from 12-84, with a higher score indicating higher mental health literacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation: Patient Activation Measure (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>13-item measure that assesses the patient's perception of their knowledge, skill, and confidence in self-management behavior. Scores range from 0-100, with a higher score indicating greater patient activation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effective Communication: Patients' Self-Competence Subscale (PSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item five point Likert scale that asks participants to rate items from 5 (important) to 1 (unimportant); a higher score indicates greater perceived self-competence and effective communication with a health care provider.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Severity: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item self-report measure that assesses anxiety and depression symptom severity. The HADS contains separate subscales (7 items each) for depression and anxiety; items are scored on a four point scale from 0-4, and a summative score is generated for each subscale. A cut score of 8 signifies an increased clinical risk for anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility and Acceptability of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess feasibility, the frequency of refusals and incidence of complete intervention doses will be documented. Acceptability will be assessed by utilizing and adapted acceptability scale administered at the final time point.</description>
