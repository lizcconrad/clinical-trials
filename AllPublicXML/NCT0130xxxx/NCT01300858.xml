  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer may be caused by a build-up of genetic defects, or damaged genes within the
      body's cells. When genes are damaged, the body may be unable to produce a group of proteins,
      called cytokines, used by the immune system to fight cancer and some infections. The
      investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains the human gene for the cytokine
      interleukin-12 (IL-12) in a special carrier system designed to enter the cells and help the
      body to produce cytokines.Therefore Therefore, the purpose of the EGEN-001 therapy is to
      attempt to enhance the body's natural ability to recognize and fight cancer cells.

      This multi-center, Phase I/II study will be conducted with an open-label, non-randomized
      design. The study will enroll up to 30 patients who had gone through cytoreductive surgery
      and HIPEC treatment 6-8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients will be treated with EGEN-001 24
      mg/m2 intra-peritoneally (IP) once every week for 12 weeks and then once every two weeks
      until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, but for no more than one year. Patients
      who develop progressive metastases will receive standard chemotherapy concomitant with
      EGEN-001. Hence, the initial EGEN-001 treatment period will be without chemotherapy. The
      standard chemotherapy regimen will be FOLFOX or FOLFIRI administered every 2-3 weeks. Patient
      with progressive disease a second time will be taken off-study. Those who remain
      progression-free will receive EGEN-001 for up to one year.
