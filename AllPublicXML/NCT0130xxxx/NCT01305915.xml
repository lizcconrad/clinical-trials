  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the number of women who survive breast cancer continues to grow, more attention is being
      paid to their quality of life and the disease's long-term effects. The transition from
      patient to survivor, also termed the &quot;re-entry transition&quot;, can be a very difficult and
      stressful time. A brief psychosocial intervention delivered at this important transition time
      may address the challenges that women face at re-entry, facilitating greater adaptation and
      more optimal recovery. The purpose of the proposed RCT is to test the acceptability and
      effectiveness of a single-session group psychoeducational intervention led by a
      multi-disciplinary team on adjustment to survivorship. A randomized controlled trial design
      (RCT) will be used to recruit 440 women attending the breast clinic at Princess Margaret
      Hospital in Toronto. Participants will be recruited while completing their adjuvant
      radiotherapy and those who agree to participate will complete the baseline questionnaire
      package (T0). They then will be randomized to receive either: (1) standard print material
      (CRL group n=220); or (2) standard print material and a single session group
      psychoeducational intervention (INT group n=220). Two weeks following randomization,
      participants in the CRL group will be given the &quot;Getting Back on Track: Life after Treatment&quot;
      booklet (current standard care), which includes information on the new health care team,
      physical side-effects, diet and exercise, emotional and social needs and returning to
      everyday life. Participants in the INT group will receive the same booklet and will also
      attend a 2- hour psychoeducational group session facilitated by a multidisciplinary team.
      Participants in both groups will be asked to complete the questionnaire package again at 3
      months (post-1) and 6 -months (post-2) following the completion of cancer treatment.
      Participants in the INV group will also be asked to rate their satisfaction with the class
      and provide feedback on the content. The proposed intervention will be one of the few
      clinical interventions designed to address the service gap in helping women to make the
      transition from patients to survivors by using a single-session psychoeducational group
      intervention.

    <description>The intervention, entitled Getting Back on Track, is two hours in duration and delivered by a multidisciplinary team representing nursing, radiation therapy, social work, rehabilitation services, and nutrition from the Breast Cancer Clinic at Princess Margaret Hospital. Relying on the content of the Getting Back on Track booklet, clinical experience and the principles of adult education, this team developed scripts for each component of the class.</description>
