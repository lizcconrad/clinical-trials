      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a high-fat meal affects the ability of
      platelet function tests to measure platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of a high-fat meal on assessment of
      clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition in healthy people using platelet function assays.
      Twelve healthy adult subjects will be recruited to take part in this research study. After
      consent is obtained, subjects will be asked to present to the clinical research center after
      a 12 hour fast. A baseline blood sample will be drawn at 8 am, and subjects will then be
      administered a 600 mg dose of clopidogrel. At 12 noon, another blood sample will be drawn to
      evaluate the extent of maximum platelet inhibition in the fasting state. Subjects will then
      be provided a standardized high-fat meal with an additional blood sample at 2 pm to evaluate
      the impact of the high-fat on platelet function assessment.
