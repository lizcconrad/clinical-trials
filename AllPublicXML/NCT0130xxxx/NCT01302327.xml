  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wolfram syndrome, also referred to as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic
      atrophy and deafness) is a genetic syndrome characterized by beta-cell dysfunction and
      apoptosis leading to diabetes, neurodegeneration and psychiatric illness. Accumulating
      evidence indicates that beta-cell failure and neuronal cell dysfunction in Wolfram's syndrome
      results from a high level of ER stress in affected cells. The current treatment of Wolfram
      syndrome is insulin, which fails to prevent the progression of beta-cell failure.

      Several studies showed that GLP-1 analogs are very effective in protecting beta-cells from ER
      stress. Herein, the investigators suggest studying the impact of GLP-1 analogs in the
      treatment of patients with Wolfram syndrome.

      The investigators will Study the effects of GLP-1 analog (Exanatide) on beta-cell function
      and glycemic control of patients with Wolfram syndrome. Evaluation of beta cell function will
      be done by performing meal test and IVGTT test before starting GLP-1 therapy, and after 3
      month of treatment.
