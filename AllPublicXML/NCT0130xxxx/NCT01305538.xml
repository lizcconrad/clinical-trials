        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) as defined as pain present for more than 6
             months after the onset of a herpes zoster skin rash affecting the trigeminal,
             cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions.

          -  Based on patient diary information collected during the Baseline week (day -7 to
             randomization Day 1), patient has completed at least 5 diary entries and has an
             average weekly pain rating of at least 4 on the 11-point pain rating scale.

          -  The patient is able to satisfactorily complete, in the Investigator's judgment, the
             Cognitive Battery.

          -  Male or female, 18-85 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other severe pain that may potentially confound pain assessment.

          -  History of complete lack of response to pregabalin (at least 300 mg qd for 4 weeks) or
             gabapentin (at least 1800 mg qd for 4 weeks).

          -  Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9%

          -  Hemoglobin ≤ 9 g/dL.

          -  Active herpes zoster or known viral infection.

          -  Previous neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy for PHN.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the re-expressed abbreviated
             (four-variable) Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation ≤
             40ml/min/1.73m2.

          -  Patients who have been on a stable dose of anticonvulsant,anticholinergic, antiviral
             medications, nicotine replacements, or any other smoking cessation medications for &lt;4
             weeks prior to randomization. Patients who are on stable doses for =&gt; 4 weeks prior to
             randomization are allowed, however, there should be no adjustments to the dose of
             these medications during study.

          -  Patients currently on more than one drug for treatment of neuropathic pain (low dose
             opioids, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants). Patients are allowed to participate if
             on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization (Day1) and should remain
             stable during course of study.
