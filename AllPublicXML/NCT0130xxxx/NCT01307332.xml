      There are two parts to this investigator sponsored trial (IST):

        1. To perform advanced serial MRI studies on patients initiating alemtuzumab therapy.

        2. To provide serum samples for the University of Southern California (USC) ICAM125
           lymphocyte recovery study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the Central Nervous
      System (CNS). There are many forms of MS; although the majority are Relapsing Remitting
      (RRMS) representing approximately 80% of the cases. The disease appears to be more
      inflammatory in RRMS as manifested by an increase in Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement on MRI and
      an increase in inflammatory bio-assay markers.

      Alemtuzumab; a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 molecule present on T and
      B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes and macrophages; effects rapid and
      sustained lymphocyte depletion and is approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia in many countries under the names CAMPATH or MabCAMPATH.

      There are two parts to this Investigator Sponsored Trial (IST):

        1. To perform advanced serial MRI studies on patients initiating alemtuzumab therapy.

        2. To provide serum samples for the University of Southern California (USC) ICAM125

    <description>Analyzing changes is immune responsiveness may reveal critical information about the mechanisms by which alemtuzumab acts, confirm the importance of specific immune cell types or molecules as targets for alemtuzumab treatment or may also be useful for monitoring drug effectiveness and safety.</description>
