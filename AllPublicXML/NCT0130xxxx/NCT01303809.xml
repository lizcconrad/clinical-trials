  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to standardise and optimise perioperative care for consecutive
      patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss. The investigators will
      compare patients under a standardised perioperative care program to patients who undergo
      routine perioperative in our hospital and determine whether patients who had optimised
      perioperative care went home earlier and had fewer complications.

    <description>The perioperative management of the patients in this arm will be according to a fast-track protocol designed by the investigators. The preoperative component of this program is the same as routine practice. Intraoperative and postoperative components which are different to routine practice are as described in the intervention section. This protocol is based on current literature regarding Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS).</description>
