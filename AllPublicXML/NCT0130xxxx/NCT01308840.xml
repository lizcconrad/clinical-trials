      The purpose of this study is to determine disease response of GEMOX-Panitumumab (GEMOX-P) in
      KRAS/ BRAF wild-type, Stage IV, biliary tract and gallbladder cancer patients who have
      previously not received chemotherapy. This study will also examine the potential toxicities,
      progression-free and overall survival in this population.

    <time_frame>end of cycle 2 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor measurement - same imaging modality used in pre-treatment evaluation - include radiological examination of all areas with affected disease. For pretreatment and at the end of cycle 2 CT scans (chest/abdomen/pelvis) will be used. For all subsequent cycles, CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis will be used every 8 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>time to cancer progression or death</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from study enrollment to date of cancer progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progression was assessed using CT scans and the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria. Progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable Kras and Braf wild-type biliary
             tract adenocarcinoma (bile ducts, hepatic duct, cystic duct, common bile duct, ampulla
             of Vater or gallbladder adenocarcinoma).

          -  Patients with preexisting peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or greater severity
             according to the Common Terminology Criteria of the NCI (version 3.0) are ineligible.

             mg/dL are ineligible.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements,

          -  History of interstitial lung disease e.g. pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or
             evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan.

          -  Known positive test(s) for HIV, hepatitis C virus, acute or chronic active hepatitis B
