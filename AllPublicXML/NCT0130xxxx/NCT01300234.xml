      This is a multi-centre, double blind, double dummy, randomised, controlled study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of TDF 300mg QD versus ADV 10mg QD in Chinese subjects with CHB. This
      study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of TDF 300mg QD over ADV 10mg QD in treating
      Chinese subjects with CHB (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] positive subjects and HBeAg negative
      subjects). It will also provide long-term efficacy and safety data (up to 240 weeks) for TDF
      300 mg administered once daily.

      This is a multi-centre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, controlled study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of TDF 300mg QD versus ADV 10mg QD in Chinese subjects with CHB. Four
      hundred and ninety-four subjects with CHB (200 HBeAg positive subjects and 294 HBeAg negative
      subjects) will be randomised (1:1ratio) to either TDF 300mg QD or ADV 10mg QD treatment arms.
      The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with blood hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) &lt;400copies/mL (Roche COBAS Taqman HBV test) at Week 48 in HBeAg
      positive subjects with CHB and HBeAg negative subjects with CHB. This is a two-part study.
      The first treatment period (baseline to Week 48) will investigate the effects of TDF and ADV
      on safety and efficacy endpoints; dosing will be double-blind. This period will be followed
      by 192 weeks in which all subjects will receive open-label TDF (Week 49 to Week 240).
      Subjects will undergo regular safety and efficacy assessments every 4 weeks for the first 12
      weeks followed by every 12 weeks for a total of up to 5 years.

    <measure>Participants With Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA &lt;400 Copies/Milliliter (mL) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) &lt;400 copies/milliliter (mL) at Week 48 in the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative population was assessed. HBeAg is a viral protein that is secreted by hepatitis B-infected cells. It is associated with chronic hepatitis B infections and is used as a marker of active viral disease and a participant's degree of infectiousness. A positive result indicates that the participant has high levels of virus in the blood and greater infectiousness. Usually, a negative result indicates that the participant has lower levels of virus in the blood and is less infectious.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Histological Improvement at Week 48 Who Had a Baseline Knodell Necroinflammatory Score (KNS) &gt;=2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Histological improvement is defined as a reduction of &gt;=2 points in the KNS with no increase in fibrosis at Week 48 in participants with a Baseline KNS &gt;=2, which was derived from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines for Management of Chronic Hepatitis B (2009) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver Clinical Practice Guidelines Management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (2012). The Knodell scale consists of 5 domains: periportal+/-bridging necrosis (scored as 0 [best], 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10 [worst]); and intralobular degeneration/focal necrosis, portal inflammation, and fibrosis (all scored as 0-4). The necroinflammatory score (0 [best] to 14 [worst]) is the combined score for necrosis (0-10) plus inflammation (0-4; the participant is scored for only one inflammatory condition). Liver biopsy was done at selected sites. Liver biopsy slides within 6 months prior to randomization could be accepted as the Baseline evaluation.</description>

        <title>Participants With Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA &lt;400 Copies/Milliliter (mL) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The number of participants with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) &lt;400 copies/milliliter (mL) at Week 48 in the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative population was assessed. HBeAg is a viral protein that is secreted by hepatitis B-infected cells. It is associated with chronic hepatitis B infections and is used as a marker of active viral disease and a participant's degree of infectiousness. A positive result indicates that the participant has high levels of virus in the blood and greater infectiousness. Usually, a negative result indicates that the participant has lower levels of virus in the blood and is less infectious.</description>

        <description>The log 10 copies/mL reduction from Baseline HBV DNA at Week 48 in the HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative population was assessed. This report includes data up to and including Week 48. Long-term efficacy data (up to Week 240) will eventually be reported. HBeAg is a viral protein that is secreted by hepatitis B-infected cells. It is associated with chronic hepatitis B infections and is used as a marker of active viral disease and a participant's degree of infectiousness. A positive result indicates that the participant has high levels of virus in the blood and greater infectiousness. Usually, a negative result indicates that the participant has lower levels of virus in the blood and is less infectious. Week 96, 144, 192, and 240 data are not yet available, as this report includes data up to and including Week 48.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Histological Improvement at Week 48 Who Had a Baseline Knodell Necroinflammatory Score (KNS) &gt;=2</title>
        <description>Histological improvement is defined as a reduction of &gt;=2 points in the KNS with no increase in fibrosis at Week 48 in participants with a Baseline KNS &gt;=2, which was derived from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines for Management of Chronic Hepatitis B (2009) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver Clinical Practice Guidelines Management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (2012). The Knodell scale consists of 5 domains: periportal+/-bridging necrosis (scored as 0 [best], 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10 [worst]); and intralobular degeneration/focal necrosis, portal inflammation, and fibrosis (all scored as 0-4). The necroinflammatory score (0 [best] to 14 [worst]) is the combined score for necrosis (0-10) plus inflammation (0-4; the participant is scored for only one inflammatory condition). Liver biopsy was done at selected sites. Liver biopsy slides within 6 months prior to randomization could be accepted as the Baseline evaluation.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is Grade 4 (life threatening or disabling).

        <description>The Gilead Grading Scale for Severity of Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities, version 21, September 2011 was used for grading. Serum creatinine: Grade 1, &gt;=133 to 177 micromoles per Liter (µmoles/Liter), Grade 2, &gt;177 to 265 µmoles/Liter, Grade 3, &gt;265 to 530 µmoles/Liter, Grade 4, &gt;530 µmoles/Liter. Serum phosphorus: Grade 2, 0.63 to &lt;0.80 millimoles per Liter (mmoles/L), Grade 3, 0.31 to &lt;0.63 mmoles/L, Grade 4, &lt;0.31 mmoles/L. The normal range for serum phosphorus was 0.8 to 1.45 mmol/L; the upper limit for a Grade 2 abnormality is 0.80 mmol/L. Therefore, no Grade 1 abnormalities could be attributed, as values were contained within the normal range.</description>
