  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the pilot portion of this study is to establish the safety and
      tolerability of an extended treatment break period in patients who have undergone neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy as well as use of systemic therapy during this break.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol aims to continue tumor-directed therapy during the typical &quot;break
      period&quot; in an effort to improve on both local tumor response as well as distant disease
      control. First, the duration from completion of chemoradiotherapy would increase from 6-8
      weeks to 9-11 weeks. As noted above, this may allow for further cell death with resultant
      pathologic downstaging. Secondly, the protocol calls for continued systemic therapy during
      the 9-11 week period, thus allowing continuation of therapies directed towards both the
      primary as well as distant sites of disease. The primary aim of this pilot study would be to
      establish the feasibility of this intensified neoadjuvant approach, especially with respect
      to tolerability of the subsequent pelvic surgery. A subsequent phase II portion will evaluate
      the efficacy of this treatment approach.

    <measure>The primary study endpoint for the phase I portion of this study is to assess surgical complications through the Clavien grading system.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The adverse events will be followed prospectively from the date of surgery for 90 days. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as &gt; grade 3 anastomotic stricture or leak, infection (including pelvic abscess or wound infection), small bowel obstruction, or fistualization. Any other post-operative complication thought related directly to the surgical intervention that is a grade 3 or higher Clavien complication will also be considered dose-limiting toxicity.</description>

    <description>Capecitabine will be delivered concurrently with the radiation therapy, at a dose of 1650 mg/m2 divided in even BID doses. It will only be taken on the days of radiation treatment (Monday-Friday, except for holidays). The A.M. dose of the capecitabine must be taken at least one hour prior to the radiation treatment.</description>

The prescribed fraction dose is 180 cGy; the total radiation dose is thus 5040-5400 cGy. The primary treatment fields will be treated with 25 fractions of 180 cGy/fraction with a &quot;boost&quot; of 3-5 fractions of 180 cGy subsequently delivered.</description>
