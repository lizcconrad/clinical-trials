    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, multi center, Phase I study was to determine the safety
      profile of the oral compound PHA-848125AC administered according to two different schedules
      of administrations to advanced/metastatic solid tumor patients. Objectives of the study were
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose that can be recommended for Phase II
      investigations.

          -  Signed, written IRB-approved Informed Consent

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed or refractory solid tumors for
             which no standard therapy exists

          -  Grade &lt;=1 retinopathy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the past 6 months: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary/peripheral
             artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or
             transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis

          -  Known brain metastases

          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic
             therapy

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol

          -  Known infection with HIV, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C

             severe peripheral vascular disease or diabetic ulcers

          -  Current enrollment in another clinical trial

          -  Patients who have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound,
             biological agent, or formulation (lactose intolerance)

          -  Previous history or current presence of neurological disorders, including epilepsy
             (although controlled by anticonvulsant therapy), Parkinson's disease, multiple
             sclerosis, stroke and cerebellar injury

          -  Gastrointestinal disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or short gut
             syndrome) that would impact on drug absorption

          -  Chronic/intensive use of antacid or H2 receptor antagonists

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or could
             compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the investigator and/or the sponsor.
