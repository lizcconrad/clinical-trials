  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, obesity rate has increased so much in the latest years, that we call it obesity
      epidemic. Overweight could result of an unbalanced energetic balance for years. The person
      who regularly consumes more calories than she expends will find herself with a positive
      energetic balance, which results in a weight gain. A daily overconsumption of only 10
      calories comes with a weight gain throughout one year. A way to avoid this overconsumption is
      to eat food that increases satiety. Satiety can be defined as the time interval after food
      ingestion, during which hunger and desire to eat are suppressed.

      The general objective of the study is to investigate in a pilot study the impact of a
      drinkable yogurt enriched in proteins and fibres on satiety.

      The study will be conducted according to an estimate crossover randomized double-blind and
      include two treatments to drink that will be tested in each one month apart.

        1. Experimental drinkable yogurt enriched in proteins and fibres

        2. Placebo drinkable yogurt (isocaloric and isovolumetric)

      One the eve of the two tests, participants will consume the same meal at dinner time. During
      the test days, participants should arrive between 6:30 and 8:30 and will be isolated in a
      private room suitable for this type of testing. Any reference to time of the day will be
      eliminated until the end of tests. First, participants will consume a standardized breakfast
      which corresponds to about 10 to 15% of energy needs of the day. The food provided at
      breakfast (toast, butter, peanut butter, cheese, orange juice) will be the same in both
      tests. Participants must consume all food within a period of 15 minutes. Two hours after the
      start of the test, participants will receive a snack in the form of yogurt (experimental,
      placebo) they will consume within a period of 5 minutes. Two hours later, participants will
      receive a lunch buffet consists of food ready to eat. The foods present in the buffet will
      have an overall energy value of about 1500 kcal, which exceeds the energy needs of
      participants for this meal. They will be encouraged to consume foods until satiety over a
      maximum of 30 minutes.

      Satiety will be measured by visual analogue scale throughout the test, either immediately
      before breakfast and snack as well as predetermined times thereafter until the lunch.
      Participants will have access to water throughout the test. The weight of food consumed and
      the water intake will be calculated in the absence of the participants and will be used to
      calculate the energy intake at lunch.
