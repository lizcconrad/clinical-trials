    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is amongst the most painful procedures postoperatively, and pain
      management can be a challenge. Different measures have been introduced to manage severe
      postoperative pain int hese patients. Previous studies have investigated gabapentin in acute
      postoperative pain and demonstrated reducted pain, postoperative morphine consumption,
      morphine related side effects, and postoperative pain scores. To date, this analgesia adjunct
      has yet to be investigated in total joint arthroplasty patients.

      The study was submitted to Health Canada and received the letter of no objection. A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The randomization scheme will be prepared
      and will be done by the pharmacy department at McMaster University. Ninety patients
      undergoing primary knee arthroplasty will be recruited from the preoperative clinic.
      Forty-five patients in each population will be allocated to a gabapentin group and the other
      forty-five to a placebo group.
