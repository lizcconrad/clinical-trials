  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Guinea-Bissau focuses its efforts
      exclusively on children below 12 months of age; children who have reached 12 months of age
      are no longer entitled to vaccines through the EPI program. This has affected the measles
      vaccination coverage, approx. 30% of the children in the rural area do not receive measles
      vaccine (MV).

      Studies from the Bandim Health Project (BHP) have shown that MV has a profound impact on
      survival, reducing mortality by approximately 50% - far more than can be explained by
      prevention of measles deaths. Hence, MV seems to have non-specific beneficial effects on
      survival, and the current policy may have important consequences for overall child mortality.

      To test the implications of the current policy of only vaccinating children below 12 months
      of age, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial, in which children will
      receive their vaccines according to the current national EPI policy (National policy) or
      receive MV regardless of age and whether some doses of MV may be lost (MV-for-all policy).

      The investigators hypothesise that among children enrolled after 12 months of age, mortality
      is 50% lower in children randomised to receive MV compared with children randomised to follow
      the national policy and not receive MV.
