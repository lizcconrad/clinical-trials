      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ischemic preconditioning reduces lung
      injury in patients undergoing pulmonary resection.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning is an intervention in which brief ischemia of one tissue or
      organ protects remote organs from a sustained episode of ischemia. It is known that one-lung
      ventilation in patients undergoing pulmonary resection, which may cause acute lung injury.
      The investigators did a single-blinded randomised controlled study to establish whether
      remote ischemic preconditioning reduces lung injury in these patients.

    <description>Remote ischaemic preconditioning consisted of three 5-min cycles of right upper limb ischaemia, induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper arm and inflated to 200 mm Hg, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff was deflated.</description>
