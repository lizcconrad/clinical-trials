    <textblock>
      A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the role of intracoronary
      injection of progenitor cells compared to placebo injection in patients with Dilated
      Cardiomyopathy who have been pre-treated with G-CSF (Granocyte™) injections for 5 days, and
      patients treated with a 5 day course of G-CSF (Granocyte™) injection only compared to placebo
      injection

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic patients with a confirmed diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA
             II-III) attending their local 'Heart Failure clinic' who are on optimal heart failure
             treatment, under supervision from their physician or heart failure nurse specialist,
             and have no other treatment options

          -  Patients who are NYHA II that have been hospitalised with a dilated cardiomyopathy
             related condition

          -  Coronary angiography will be performed where necessary to confirm the diagnosis and
             ensure no other conventional treatment options are indicated

          -  Prior to recruitment to the study patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmia will have
             undergone electrophysiological assessment and appropriate clinical management
             (including implantable defibrillator insertion) where indicated (as per NICE
             guidelines)

             toxicity &amp; chronic uncontrolled tachycardia

          -  Cardiomyopathy in association with a neuromuscular disorder e.g. Duchenne's
             progressive muscular dystrophy

          -  Previous cardiac surgery

          -  Contra-indication for bone marrow aspiration

          -  Known active infection

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV),

          -  Chronic inflammatory disease requiring ongoing medication

          -  Serious known concomitant disease with a life expectancy of less than one year

          -  Follow-up impossible (no fixed abode, etc)

          -  Patients with an irregular heart rhythm (AF allowed if paced in a regular rhythm)

          -  Patients with renal impairment (Creatinine &gt;200mmol/L)

          -  Neoplastic disease without documented remission within the past 5 years
