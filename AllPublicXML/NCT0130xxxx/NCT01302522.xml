  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disabling condition that impairs fundamental abilities, such as
      ambulation, respiration, and toileting. Compromised ambulation is a common, devastating
      impairment following SCI. Yet, despite the fundamental desire to walk, no conventional
      rehabilitation regimen reliably improves ambulation after SCI, and many SCI patients do not
      have reliable transportation access, decreasing community integration and access to needed
      services, including rehabilitation. Little is also known about the subtle neural events that
      may predict motor recovery in incomplete SCI patients. This study will test a novel, safe,
      easy to implement technique that has shown promise in improving gait in incomplete SCI
      patients. The investigators expect that this study will confirm the efficacy of this
      technique, by showing that it increases the speed and efficiency of walking. This outcome is
      expected to produce a therapy that improves outcomes and health, and reduces care costs, for
      community dwelling patients with incomplete SCI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age &gt; 18 years old;

          -  incomplete SCI (ASIA Grade C or D), experienced &gt; 1 year prior to enrollment;

          -  motor grade of &gt; 1 &lt; 3 in the quads, hamstrings, and hip flexors, and ability to
             ambulate with at least a maximal assist;

          -  range of motion in the lower limbs within functional limits;

          -  motor function in at least half of ASIA key lower extremity muscles with strength &lt; or
             &gt; 3/5;

          -  able to ambulate at least 10 meters with 1 person assistance and/or assistive device;

          -  medically stable (ie, no bladder infection; decubiti); (8) stable dosage of
             antispasticity medications for duration of study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  excessive spasticity in the lower limbs as measured by a score of &gt; 3 on the Modified
             Ashworth Spasticity Scale;

          -  excessive pain in the lower limbs as measured by a score of &gt; 5 on a Visual Analog
             Scale or &gt; 8/10 with a clarified scaled picture graph;

          -  moderate to severe osteoporosis, as indicated by the patient's physician;

          -  heterotropic ossification, as indicated by the patient's physician;

          -  psychological conditions that would contraindicate participation in the program and no
             abnormalities of attention, with minimum cognitive capacity present sufficient to
             participate in MP;

          -  fracture or fracture history in the lower limbs (individuals with a remote history of
             fractures may be included at discretion of the study physical therapists at each
             site);

          -  enrolled in any form of rehabilitation;

          -  for subjects to be administered fMRI, implant containing electrical circuitry,
             generating electrical signals, or having moving metal parts, metal pins or plates
             above the waist, orthodontic braces, or other positives on a standard checklist of MRI
             exclusion criteria used by the Radiology Department;

          -  pregnant;

          -  DSM-IV Major Depressive Episode symptom criteria of &gt; 5/9 as exclusion threshold
             instead of CESD;
