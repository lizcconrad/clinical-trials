    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the investigators research is to test the clinical efficacy of the
      TissueLink™ (Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc.) coagulation system in minimizing hemoglobin
      loss intraoperatively. This is a prospective, randomized investigation that will be performed
      at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC). The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of Tissue Link HemoSealing system in minimizing hemoglobin loss preoperatively,
      intraoperatively and postoperatively for patients undergoing multilevel elective spinal
      surgery. Not greater than eighty patients scheduled for elective, multi-level decompression
      and fusion spinal surgery with Dr. William Richardson will be randomized into two groups.
      Unipolar electrocautery will be used for intraoperative coagulation in one group and the
      Tissuelink device plus Unipolar electrocautery in the other. These are frequently performed
      cases with significant blood loss but otherwise low morbidity/mortality that would benefit
      from more effective intraoperative coagulation.

      Very little research exists in the use of TissueLink HemoSealing device in spinal surgery.
      One retrospective study by Snyder et al evaluated hemostatic efficacy of this technology in
      children undergoing surgery for spinal fusion and instrumentation. Although the study
      reported no statistically significant difference in transfusion rates, there was a reduction
      in amount of blood transfused and operative time which was attributed to hemostatic efficacy
      in comparison with conventional wound management during surgery. The surgeons also reported a
      clearer operative field, improving visualization during surgery. Finally, the reduction in
      operative time which they suggested might be due to the use of this new device may reduce
      other complications by diminishing overall anesthesia exposure and blood product
      transfusions. From this initial retrospective study, the authors concluded that the use of
      the TissueLink HemoSealing device in spine surgery may be an effective tool in control of
      intra- and post-operative blood loss and may significantly reduce blood related and operative
      complications. More rigorous research needs to be done to evaluate the efficacy of the
      TissueLink HemoSealing device in hemostasis in the area of spine surgery.

    <description>The primary hypothesis was that use of the Aquamantys coagulation system in addition to unipolar cautery results in less intraoperative Hb loss compared with unipolar cautery alone during multilevel spinal decompression and fusion surgery.Intraoperatively, shed blood will be collected into a Cell-saver device. Surgical sponges will be recovered in a container of citrated normal saline. Prior to processing the salvaged blood from the cell-saver device, hemoglobin concentration (g/dL) and volume (dL) of the salvaged blood will be measured, allowing calculation of hemoglobin loss in grams.</description>

          <description>The primary hypothesis was that use of the Aquamantys coagulation system in addition to unipolar cautery results in less intraoperative Hb loss compared with unipolar cautery alone during multilevel spinal decompression and fusion surgery.Intraoperatively, shed blood will be collected into a Cell-saver device. Surgical sponges will be recovered in a container of citrated normal saline. Prior to processing the salvaged blood from the cell-saver device, hemoglobin concentration (g/dL) and volume (dL) of the salvaged blood will be measured, allowing calculation of hemoglobin loss in grams.</description>
          <population>Based on pilot data, it was estimated that 29 patients per group would provide 90% power with = 0.01 to distinguish such a difference between groups. Therefore, the randomized study was planned for 60 patients.</population>
