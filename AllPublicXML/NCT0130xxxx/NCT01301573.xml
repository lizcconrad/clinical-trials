  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is the long term follow-up of Parkinson's patients
      who participated in a clinical trial in which they received AAV-GAD gene transfer into the
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) region of the brain. Patients will be followed once a year for up
      to five (5) years. The study will monitor and evaluate the long term effects of AAV-GAD and
      provide long term safety information.
