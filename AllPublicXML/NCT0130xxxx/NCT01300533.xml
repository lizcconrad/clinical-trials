  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this Phase 1 clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of BIND-014
      that can be given in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of BIND-014 and define a recommended Phase 2 dose of BIND-014.

      All cycles of therapy will consist of the patient taking BIND-014 intravenously once every
      three weeks or weekly for three out of four weeks.

             abnormalities. Certain conditions are acceptable (e.g., controlled atrial
             fibrillation) if agreed to by Medical Monitor.

          9. Participation in a study of an investigational agent within 30 days prior to
             screening.
