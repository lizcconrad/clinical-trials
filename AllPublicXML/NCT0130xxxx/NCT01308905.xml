  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge about how to best diagnose and treat tumors,
      how tumors affect normal tissue and how treatment of tumors with radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy affect tumors.

      The purpose of this research study is to observe the changes within the tumor cells which may
      improve the understanding of how tumors grow and how they respond to various treatments.
      These changes will be compared with results of the physical examination and scans (CT and
      MRI) that are done as part of clinical care. Images will be made showing the distribution
      throughout the body of substances containing a small amount of radioactive material. This
      procedure is called a PET scan. The radioactive substances (tracer compound) in this study
      are [F-18] FLT.

    <description>Patients will be managed per COG protocol ANBL00B1 (low risk, LR), ANBL0521 (intermediate risk, IR), ANBL0531 (high risk, HR) or other future neuroblastoma studies according to their risk group (risk assignment, treatment schema and protocols are available in COG website). The following is a brief description of the treatment.
Low risk patients: observation only.
Intermediate risk patients: chemotherapy stratified according to risk sub-groups followed by surgical resection.
High risk patients: 6 courses of induction chemotherapy, surgical resection and high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT), involved field radiation and 6 months of Isotrenitoin.
PET scan will be conducted at diagnosis, at the end of the first cycle of treatment and prior to the surgical procedure (resection).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with neuroblastoma or suspected neuroblastoma seen at Children's Hospital
             of Michigan (CHM). Patients need to be 2 years or older to be eligible for the initial
             study

          -  Patients must be 1 day to 21 years old, there is no gender limit.

          -  Diagnosis: All patients with neuroblastoma or suspected neuroblastoma, including newly
             diagnosed and relapsed patients, are eligible for Objective 1. To be eligible for
             Objective 2, patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma verified by histology or
             demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary
             catecholamine metabolites, and have measurable disease after the initial surgery

          -  Female adolescent patients must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of first
             imaging and should not be pregnant

          -  Patients must be able to lie still for the tests, or have no contraindication for
             sedation

          -  Patients or their legal guardian must sign an informed consent indicating that they
             are aware of the investigational nature of this study

          -  A total number of 40-50 patients will be included in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not have a histology diagnosis of neuroblastoma are not eligible for
             the study

          -  Patients whose definite diagnosis after surgery is not consistent with the diagnosis
             of neuroblastoma will be included in the Objective 1 but excluded for Objective 2.
