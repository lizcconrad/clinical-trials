  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meshes-devices using dual-sided mesh technology have been developed for the specific
      indication of small ventral hernias. The design of these meshes allows introduction of a mesh
      of appropriate size to cover the hernia defect, through a small incision. This technique is
      very attractive for the surgeon and the patients because the mesh usually can be introduced
      through a nearly invisible scar in the umbilicus. The avoidance of fixation sutures omits the
      pain related to these sutures. Short-term results and patient satisfaction are very
      favorable, encouraging the surgeons to continue with the technique, although long-term
      results of these meshes in good quality studies are lacking.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy at 12 months after repair of
      small and medium ventral hernias using PVP™. All patients operated between March 2009 and
      February 2011 at the participating centers, will be evaluated and described. Patients will be
      evaluated by clinical investigation, questioning and ultrasound. The investigators' main
      focus will be the incidence of complications related to the use of the device, during the
      first year. Also the investigators look at recurrence rate at 12 months, occurrence of pain
      at 12 months and foreign body feeling. The trial can be seen as a quality control of a cohort
      of patients treated with an innovative mesh device. No sponsoring from the company J&amp;J will
      be asked or accepted.
