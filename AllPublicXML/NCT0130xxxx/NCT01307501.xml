    <textblock>
      ECLIPSE will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation therapy used to treat tumors
      less than or equal to 3.5 cm in patients with pulmonary metastatic disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECLIPSE is a treatment, Phase 1 multicenter, prospective, single arm study with patients
      serving as their own control. This study is to enroll patients who will undergo cryoablation
      of at least 1 metastatic pulmonary tumor that is less than or equal to 3.5 cm. Patients will
      be followed to 5 years post their cryoablation procedure.

      Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of extremely cold
      temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool in the fields of
      general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery (including lung),
      Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology (colon/rectal) and urology
      (kidney).
