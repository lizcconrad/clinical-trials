  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody ipilimumab (MDX-010, BMS-734016), has demonstrated
      anti-tumor activity in a subgroup of patients with Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV
      melanoma (measurable per modified WHO criteria), who have received prior treatment with any
      regimen (non-experimental or experimental), except a CD-137 agonist or a CTLA4 inhibitor or
      agonist and relapsed, failed to respond (CR or PR) or did not tolerate that regimen (Wolchok,
      Neyns et al. 2009; O'Day, Maio et al. 2010). Ipilimumab exerts its therapeutic effect
      presumably by activating T-lymphocytes that infiltrate the tumor mass to destroy the
      malignant cells by mechanisms of cytotoxic cellular interaction. Autologous TriMix-DC vaccine
      can induce a T-cell repertoire that recognizes in a HLA-restricted way the melanoma
      associated antigens MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2, tyrosinase and gp100. Administration of ipilimumab
      together with TriMix-DC vaccine therapy may be a more effective treatment for patients with
      advanced melanoma as compared to either modality alone.

          9. No active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C.

         10. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1;

             protocol includes Women of Childbearing Potential.

         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the
             last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
             minimized. In general, the decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy
             should be determined by discussions between the investigator and the study subject.
             WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal. Post-menopause is defined as:

               -  Amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive months without another cause, or

               -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy
                  (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL.

             Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.

             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

         14. Adequate venous access allowing for a leukapheresis procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of brain metastases on brain imaging (i.e., MRI or contrast CT);

          2. Primary ocular or mucosal melanoma;

          3. Any other malignancy form which the patient has been disease-free for less than 5
             years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          4. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients
             with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive
             sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg,
             Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g.
             Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).

          5. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          6. Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab).

          7. A history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior CD137 agonist or CTLA 4
             inhibitor or agonist, or PD-1 antagonist;.

          8. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the
             management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses);

          9. Concomitant therapy with and need of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g.
             because of a recent thrombo-embolic event or cardiac valve prothesis).

         10. Previous treatment with other investigational products, including cancer
             immunotherapy, within 30 days preceding study recruitment;

         11. Previous treatment in another ipilimumab clinical trial or prior treatment with a
             CD137 agonist, CTLA-4 inhibitor or agonist;

         12. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness.

         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 4.1, who:

               -  are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation
                  of study drug, or

               -  have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

               -  are pregnant or breastfeeding. Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method
                  of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of
                  failure is minimized. Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the
                  importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential
                  risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative
                  pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the pregnancy test is
                  positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be enrolled in the
                  study.

         14. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 8 weeks after ipilimumab is
             stopped.
