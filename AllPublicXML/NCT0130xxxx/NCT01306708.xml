  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adhesive capsulitis is a disease of the shoulder characterized by pain and limitation of
      movement amplitude. It is defined as for etiology, having discordant theories that related it
      to an inflammatory condition or to an algoneurodystrophy process. There is not yet a
      consensus about the best option of treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, where the mechanism of action is the inhibition of
      prostaglandin synthesis. The antidepressants have been increasingly used in the control of
      chronic pain and the major action mechanism to have the analgesic effect seems to be based on
      inhibition of neurotransmitters reuptake noradrenaline and/or serotonin) in nerve cell
      endings. Literature studies associate the practice of the nerve suprascapular blockade with
      anaesthetics to good results of clinical improvement of the pain, however, so far, no
      clinical studies comparing the efficacy of the non-steroidal antiinflammatories or tricyclic
      antidepressants to nervous blockage were registered in the acute treatment of adhesive
      capsulitis.
