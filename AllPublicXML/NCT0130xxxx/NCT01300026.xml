  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase 1, open-label first-in-human study of AMG 319 in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies. This study consists of two parts. The dose
      exploration in part 1, studies cohorts of 3 subjects with relapsed or refractory lymphoid
      malignancies and uses a practical continuous reassessment model [CRM] to guide dose
      escalation and to define the MTD. The dose expansion in part 2 will enroll 20 subjects with
      CLL at a dose no higher than the MTD and further explore the safety, PK, and clinical
      activity of AMG 319 in this patient population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Part 1 (Dose Exploration): Relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancy of the following
        type for which standard treatment does not exist or is no longer effective:

        B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) confirmed by immunophenotype or Non-Hodgkin
        Lymphoma: Low or intermediate grade B-cell NHL, mantle cell lymphoma, non-cutaneous T-cell
        NHL confirmed by histology and/or immunophenotype

          -  Part 2 (Dose Expansion): Subjects must have relapsed or refractory B-cell Chronic
             Lymphocytic Leukemia confirmed by immunophenotype for which standard treatment does
             not exist or is no longer effective.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤ 2

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Men or women ≥ 18 years old

          -  Hematological function, as follows:

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (unless due to disease-related bone marrow
        involvement as documented by bone marrow biopsy, ≥ 0.5 x 109/L) Platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L
        (without a transfusion within 14 days before enrollment) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

        subjects whom the PI and sponsor agree that clinical data suggest an extrahepatic source of
        elevation) Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (&lt; 3.0 x ULN for subjects with documented Gilbert's
        Disease or for whom the indirect bilirubin level suggests an extrahepatic source of
        elevation) Amylase ≤ 2.0 x IULN Lipase ≤ 2.0 x IULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary or disseminated tumor involving the central nervous system (CNS)

          -  A history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in-situ cancer, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no
             evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years

          -  History of allogeneic stem-cell (or other organ) transplantation

          -  Clinically significant ECG changes which obscure the ability to assess the PR, QT, and
             QRS interval; congenital long QT syndrome

          -  QTcF interval &gt; 470 msec

          -  Active or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, determined by serologic tests
