    <textblock>
      Current standard of practice in study institution dictates day of surgery urinary catheter
      removal in general thoracic surgery patients receiving thoracic epidural analgesia. The
      investigators hypothesize that this practice results in low recatheterization rates secondary
      to urinary retention and low urinary tract infection rates.

      Study Design A prospective study design will be utilized as data will be collected in a
      prospective manner and standard of care/current practice will be unaltered in the patient
      population.

      Sampling will include all patients that meet the eligibility criteria from March 01, 2011
      until August 01, 2011 with a goal of forty-five patients.

      Data Collection Protocol

        1. The patient will be interviewed and given information regarding participation in the
           study by Principal Investigator and/or research team prior to surgery. Informed Consent
           Forms will be collected by Principal Investigator and/or research team. Principal
           Investigator and/or research team will collect all data on Data Collection Sheet.

        2. Thoracic epidural will be placed by the anesthesiologist in pre-op per standard
           protocol.

             -  Location of epidural will be documented by Principal Investigator and/or research
                team on Data Collection Sheet. (See Appendix 1)

        3. Prior to surgery, if indicated, an indwelling urinary bladder catheter will be placed
           per pre-operative protocol.

        4. Post-operative documentation of time, type and settings for epidural infusion will be
           documented on Data Collection Sheet.

        5. Post-op eligible patients admitted to cardiothoracic step-down unit will be placed on
           the following protocol:

             -  Thoracic Epidural will be managed by the anesthesia group.

                  -  Any change in prescription or dosing will be documented on the Data Collection
                     Sheet.

             -  If urinary catheter present, will be discontinued at midnight day of surgery, Day
                Zero; the time of discontinuation will be noted on the Data Collection Sheet.

                  -  If micturition occurs, amount and time will be documented on Data Collection
                     Sheet.

                  -  If no spontaneous void by 0800 post-operative day (POD) 1, bladder scanning
                     will be initiated.

                  -  If â‰¥ 400 cc per bladder scanner, the thoracic surgeon, surgeon's nurse or the
                     Principal Investigator will not notified.

             -  Any ordered interventions, the response and re- evaluation will be noted on Data
                Collection Sheet.

                  -  Urinary retention will be defined as &gt; 400 cc and recatheterization (either
                     intermittent or indwelling) will occur.

        6. Data will only be collected during current surgery hospitalization.
