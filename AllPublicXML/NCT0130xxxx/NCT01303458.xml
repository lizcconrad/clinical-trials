  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is aimed to address low-income families' basic social needs (housing,
      food, employment, education, childcare, utilities) within the context of pediatric primary
      care. This project builds upon the PI's prior study at Hopkins which demonstrated a positive
      impact of a similar intervention on pediatric residents' screening and referral to community
      agencies. This study will specifically test whether a further strengthened
      intervention--Basic Needs Surveillance (BNS) protocol-- can lead to greater maternal
      enrollment in community resources and receipt of eligible benefits. In addition, we will
      measure the intervention's impact on maternal well-being, and compliance with well-child care
      (WCC) visits.

      The project will take place at eight community health centers in the Greater Boston Area. The
      centers will be randomized to either an intervention or control site. Mothers who bring their
      infant in for a WCC visit from birth to 6 months will be eligible. They will be followed
      until their child is one year of age. Study subjects will complete two self-administered
      surveys (baseline, follow-up), and one brief telephone interview (when their infant is 9
      months old). Pediatric providers will also be subjects; and will fill out a demographic
      questionnaire at the time of enrollment.

      The BNS intervention will consist of 4 components: 1) WE CARE survey which mothers will fill
      out in the waiting room prior to their child's WCC visits; 2) Family Resource book containing
      1-page information sheets on resources, that providers will have access to in exam rooms; 3)
      a Community Resource Coordinator who will assist families link to available resources, and
      update providers; 4) Training Session which will provide a 1 hr overview of the intervention
      to providers.

      Families attending the control health centers will receive standard of care. Enrolled mothers
      will be offered the intervention at the end of the 12-month follow-up interview. When
      follow-up data collection is complete, the PI will offer the control sites the opportunity to
      implement the BNS protocol.
