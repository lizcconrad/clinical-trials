    <measure>The Covidien Nellcor Respiration Rate Software Shall Determine Respiration Rate Measured as Mean and Standard Deviation With Accuracy That is Non-inferior to Predicate Device.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were monitored for average of 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Mean and standard deviations of respiration rates collected from patients in the hospital settings were compared between Covidien Respiration Rate Software, Transthoracic Impedance and End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Waveforms. Each patient served as its own control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Covidien Nellcor Respiration Rate Software Shall Calculate Respiration Rate With a Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of &lt; 3 Breaths Per Minute Compared With a End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Waveforms, With 95% Confidence.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were monitored on average for 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The data used for analysis consisted of multiple simultaneous measures of RR_TTI, RR_V1.0 and RR_EtCO2 for each subject. Given N sets of simultaneous RR values for each of P patients, the simultaneous RR values were used to calculate a pair of RMSD values for each subject.
The two RMSD values, RMSDRR_V1.0_vs_EtCO2, and RMSDTTI_vs_EtCO2, quantify the mean absolute difference in simultaneous estimates of respiratory rate between RR_V1.0 compared with RR_EtCO2 and RR_TTI compared with RR_EtCO2, respectively for the subjects with 95% confidence of mean ± 3.38 BrPM. The Measure type is Number and represents the RMSD of Covidien Nellcor Respiration Rate Software</description>

          <title>The Covidien Nellcor Respiration Rate Software Shall Calculate Respiration Rate With a Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of &lt; 3 Breaths Per Minute Compared With a End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Waveforms, With 95% Confidence.</title>
          <description>The data used for analysis consisted of multiple simultaneous measures of RR_TTI, RR_V1.0 and RR_EtCO2 for each subject. Given N sets of simultaneous RR values for each of P patients, the simultaneous RR values were used to calculate a pair of RMSD values for each subject.
The two RMSD values, RMSDRR_V1.0_vs_EtCO2, and RMSDTTI_vs_EtCO2, quantify the mean absolute difference in simultaneous estimates of respiratory rate between RR_V1.0 compared with RR_EtCO2 and RR_TTI compared with RR_EtCO2, respectively for the subjects with 95% confidence of mean ± 3.38 BrPM. The Measure type is Number and represents the RMSD of Covidien Nellcor Respiration Rate Software</description>
