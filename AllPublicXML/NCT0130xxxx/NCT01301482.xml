    <description>Ear acupuncture utilizes up to 10 needles (see figure 6). If at any point the subject decides not to continue with the placing of the needles, the acupuncture will cease and the number of points will be documented. The ear Acupuncture points on the right ear include Cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, shen-men, point zero. The ear Acupuncture points on the left ear include Cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, shen-men, point zero (see figures 1-5).</description>
