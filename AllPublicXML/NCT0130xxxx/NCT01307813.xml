  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Overstitch (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Texas) is an FDA cleared product which attaches
      to a standard double channel endoscope. The Overstitch can place sutures under endoscopic
      guidance, with the goal of reproducing standard surgical techniques. These would include
      hemostasis, tissue approximation, anastomosis formation, fixation of intraluminal devices, or
      repair/closure of mucosal or full thickness defects such as perforations or endoscopic
      mucosal resection (EMR) sites. Knot tying of the endoscopically placed sutures is provided by
      an endoscopic cinching device that passes through the channel of the endoscope.

      This feasibility trial will evaluate the ability of the Apollo suturing device (Overstitch)
      to endoscopically place sutures into normal mucosa, and then &quot;tie&quot; the sutures with the
      cinching device. These devices have been utilized effectively in explant, live porcine, and
      human cadaver colon and stomach models. In this treat and resect model, sutures would be
      placed in a segment of colon or stomach that is being surgically removed via open or
      laparoscopic technique for the treatment of benign or malignant disease. The sutures would be
      placed in a segment of normal mucosa remote to the pathology being surgically treated. In
      addition, the sutures will be placed under direct observation via laparoscopic or open
      visualization. After resection of the segment of colon, it will be evaluated grossly for
      level of suture placement, evidence of perforation, and quality of suture approximation with
      the cinching device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the colectomy procedure, the intended proximal and distal margins of resection will be
      determined, and the protocol will proceed only if it is fully determined that the tissue will
      be fully resectable. The overstitch device affixed to a standard double channel gastroscope
      will then be advanced transanally into the segment of planned resected colon, away from the
      area of disease so as to not interfere with oncologic principles or post-resection pathologic
      evaluation. Endoscopic sutures and knot tying cinching elements will be placed, with a limit
      of 15 minutes for the total procedure. The entire procedure will be closely monitored under
      laparoscopic or open surgical visualization. After suture placement, the surgical resection
      will continue as planned. The specimen will then be examined for depth of suture placement,
      evidence of perforation, and quality of the suture approximation with the knot tying element.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient population in this study will be candidates of either sex, over 18' who
             have an established indication for a surgical procedure requiring resection of a
             portion of colon distal to the splenic flexure. This will include both benign and
             malignant diseases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any underlying pathology in the determination of investigator that subject cannot
             undergo scoping

          -  Sutures cannot be placed in segment of bowel that will be included in the surgical
             resection

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded from participating in this protocol
