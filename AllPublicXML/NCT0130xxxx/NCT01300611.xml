  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TXA127 on neutrophil and platelet
      counts in adult patients who have undergone a double cord blood transplant. The study will
      also evaluate the effect of TXA127 on chemotherapy-induced mucositis, an inflammation of the
      mucous membranes in the digestive tract (mouth to anus) and immune reconstitution which helps
      patients fight infections. For patients undergoing CBT, both neutrophil and platelet
      normalization and immune reconstitution can be delayed. TXA127 has shown to be well tolerated
      by patients and appears to induce a rapid production of neutrophils and platelets in the
      bloodstream as well as increase the immune system components. It has also been shown to
      reduce the severity of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

      Cord blood as a hematopoietic stem cell source has multiple advantages. Cord blood is
      normally discarded at birth and can easily be collected and stored. Availability of numerous
      CB banks has resulted in genetically diverse CB units including those from non-Caucasians.
      Once a suitable CB unit is located, confirmatory typing can be quickly performed and a donor
      unit can be shipped to the transplant center. Furthermore, because a CB graft results in a
      lower incidence of graft-versus-host-disease, one or two antigen-mismatched units are
      acceptable for transplantation. Despite these advantages, CB has a significant drawback which
      is that the number of hematopoietic stem cells obtained from a unit of CB is significantly
      lower than from a bone marrow (BM) harvest or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest. Both
      engraftment and immune reconstitution are delayed in patients undergoing CB transplant.
      TXA127 is pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7, a non-hypertensive derivative of
      angiotensin II (which contains the 8th amino acid conferring receptor binding to blood
      pressure receptors). TXA127 has multilineage effects on hematopoietic progenitors in vitro
      and in vivo. The hematopoietic properties demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies
      support the investigation of TXA127 to reduce time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment
      following transfusion of limited number of CD34+ cells.
