  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, pilot-study to evaluate the effect of Interleukin-1
      blockade on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. Subjects will undergo
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and after 2-weeks treatment with anakinra
      (recombinant human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist).

    <measure>Median Interval Change From Baseline in Peak VO2</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Peak VO2 is a measurement of oxygen consumption rate during exercise (milliliters of oxygen per minute). It is calculated by continuous measurement of oxygen consumed during exercise while patients breath through a mask/tube. To account for variability in patient size, the oxygen consumption is divided by patient body weight.
The outcome measure time frame was 14 days. This means that change in peak VO2 was calculated as the difference between peak VO2 at baseline and 14 days. To calculate this change, we used the mathematical process of subtraction (change in peak VO2 = Peak VO2 [day 14] - Peak VO2 [baseline])</description>

    <measure>Median Interval Change From Baseline in the Minute Ventilation and Carbon Dioxide Production (VE/VCO2 Slope)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The VE/VCO2 slope is calculated as the ratio of minute ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). Because these measurements share the same units, the resultant ratio is unitless.
Change in VE/VCO2 slope was calculated as the change in VE/VCO2 slope between baseline and 14 days. We therefore calculated the difference between VE/VCO2 slope measurements that occurred at baseline and at 14 days (change in VE/VCO2 slope = VE/VCO2 slope [day 14] - VE/VCO2 slope [baseline])</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interval Change From Baseline in Heart Failure Symptoms as Measured by Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) is a scale that quantifies patients' ability to perform various tasks. The scale ranges from 0 (unable to perform any tasks) to 58.20 (able to perform all tasks). Higher scores reflect improved activity or improved heart failure symptoms. Lower scores reflect worsened ability or worsened heart failure symptoms.</description>

        <title>Median Interval Change From Baseline in Peak VO2</title>
        <description>Peak VO2 is a measurement of oxygen consumption rate during exercise (milliliters of oxygen per minute). It is calculated by continuous measurement of oxygen consumed during exercise while patients breath through a mask/tube. To account for variability in patient size, the oxygen consumption is divided by patient body weight.
The outcome measure time frame was 14 days. This means that change in peak VO2 was calculated as the difference between peak VO2 at baseline and 14 days. To calculate this change, we used the mathematical process of subtraction (change in peak VO2 = Peak VO2 [day 14] - Peak VO2 [baseline])</description>

        <title>Median Interval Change From Baseline in the Minute Ventilation and Carbon Dioxide Production (VE/VCO2 Slope)</title>
        <description>The VE/VCO2 slope is calculated as the ratio of minute ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). Because these measurements share the same units, the resultant ratio is unitless.
Change in VE/VCO2 slope was calculated as the change in VE/VCO2 slope between baseline and 14 days. We therefore calculated the difference between VE/VCO2 slope measurements that occurred at baseline and at 14 days (change in VE/VCO2 slope = VE/VCO2 slope [day 14] - VE/VCO2 slope [baseline])</description>

          <title>Median Interval Change From Baseline in the Minute Ventilation and Carbon Dioxide Production (VE/VCO2 Slope)</title>
          <description>The VE/VCO2 slope is calculated as the ratio of minute ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). Because these measurements share the same units, the resultant ratio is unitless.
Change in VE/VCO2 slope was calculated as the change in VE/VCO2 slope between baseline and 14 days. We therefore calculated the difference between VE/VCO2 slope measurements that occurred at baseline and at 14 days (change in VE/VCO2 slope = VE/VCO2 slope [day 14] - VE/VCO2 slope [baseline])</description>

        <title>Interval Change From Baseline in Heart Failure Symptoms as Measured by Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)</title>
        <description>The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) is a scale that quantifies patients' ability to perform various tasks. The scale ranges from 0 (unable to perform any tasks) to 58.20 (able to perform all tasks). Higher scores reflect improved activity or improved heart failure symptoms. Lower scores reflect worsened ability or worsened heart failure symptoms.</description>
