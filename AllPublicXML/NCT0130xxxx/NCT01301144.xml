      Background:

        -  Tuberculosis is a disease of the lungs caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis
           (M. tuberculosis). The most popular and least expensive tool used to detect the presence
           of the tuberculosis bacteria is called sputum smears, which is a lab test used to look
           for bacteria in the sputum via a microscope. However, the test s results are not always
           accurate, and the test cannot determine if the bacteria will be resistant to standard
           tuberculosis treatments. The most sensitive test currently available is called sputum
           culture, in which a sputum sample is used to check for the growth of tuberculosis
           bacteria. However, this test takes at least a month to produce accurate results, and
           requires expensive equipment that is not available in many countries where M.
           tuberculosis is found.

        -  The urea breath test (UBT) has been used to detect infection with Helicobacter pylori, a
           bacteria associated with stomach ulcers, by testing individual breath samples.
           Researchers are interested in determining whether breath samples can also be used to
           detect the presence of M. tuberculosis in the lungs of subjects with tuberculosis, and
           to see if tuberculosis treatments are successful.

      Objectives:

      - To assess the sensitivity and specificity of urea breath testing in the diagnosis and
      treatment response of pulmonary tuberculosis.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who either have been diagnosed with tuberculosis or
           are healthy volunteers with no past history of tuberculosis.

        -  The study will be conducted in Bamako, Mali.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve three groups: two pilot groups of individuals who have already
           been diagnosed with tuberculosis, and a primary study group of both healthy volunteers
           and individuals who have been diagnosed with tuberculosis.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well
           as blood, sputum, stool, and urine samples.

        -  First pilot group (one visit):

        -  Participants should not eat, drink, or smoke for at least 1 hour prior to the UBT test.

        -  Participants will provide a baseline exhaled air sample, and then will receive the UBT
           test, which involves a dose of Pranactin -Citric dissolved in water. Additional exhaled
           air samples will be collected at eight time points (10, 20, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and
           240 minutes after the dose).

        -  Second pilot group (one or two visits):

        -  Participants should not eat, drink, or smoke for at least 1 hour prior to the UBT test.

        -  Participants will provide a baseline exhaled air sample, and then will receive the UBT
           test. Half of the participants will receive a dose of bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) prior to
           collection of air samples to see how this affects the results of the UBT test.
           Additional exhaled air samples will be collected at three time points specified by the
           study researchers.

        -  On the following day, participants will return for a second visit to provide three more
           exhaled air samples.

        -  Primary study group (five visits for participants with tuberculosis, two visits for
           healthy volunteers):

        -  All participants will have two visits, following the procedures given for the second
           pilot group. Half will receive a dose of bismuth prior to collection of air samples.

        -  Participants with tuberculosis will have three additional visits (days 6, 10, and 16
           following the first study visit) to provide additional sputum and exhaled air samples to
           monitor the progress of tuberculosis treatment.

      Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that affects the population worldwide, with 9 million people
      being infected every year. It is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity.
      Reports show that a person dies from tuberculosis every 20 seconds worldwide. Current
      diagnostic techniques are either inadequate at detecting TB cases with precision, or they are
      time consuming, expensive, and require laboratory equipment not available in developing
      countries, where the disease is endemic. Furthermore, rates of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB
      are estimated to be over 5 percent of the incident cases globally and extremely
      drug-resistant (XDR) TB rates are on the rise. These statistics highlight the need for new
      and improved diagnostic tools for TB, as well as biomarkers that can quickly detect drug
      resistant organisms or treatment failures to first-line antimicrobials.

      Urea breath test (UBT) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      detection of Helicobacter pylori. It is known that H. pylori possesses a urease enzyme that
      degrades urea in the stomach, producing carbon dioxide (CO (2)), which is then exhaled and
      can be detected in the lungs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis like H. pylori possesses a urease
      enzyme, which converts urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. In a preclinical study, Jassal and
      colleagues demonstrated that TB-infected rabbits convert [(13)C]-labeled urea into
      [(13)C]-carbon dioxide ((13)CO(2)) in a matter of minutes. The (13)CO(2) in exhaled breath
      could be rapidly detected with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer or a small ultraviolet
      (UV) absorbance spectrometer.

      The primary objective of the current study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of
      UBT in the diagnosis and treatment response of pulmonary TB. Secondary objectives are to
      assess the specificity of UBT for M. tuberculosis (UBT-TB) diagnosis in volunteers with and
      without H. pylori infection, examine the benefit of bismuth to make UBT-TB more specific for
      M. tuberculosis, and evaluate the correlation of the labeled (13)CO(2) signal with sputum
      colony forming unit (CFU) counts and the lower limit of signal detection versus CFU counts.
