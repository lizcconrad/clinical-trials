  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) has been shown to be a reliable marker of ovarian reserve. In
      prior studies, tubal ligation has been shown to have an adverse effect on ovarian reserve.
      One theory postulated for this effect is that the ovarian circulation is disrupted by the
      procedure, leading to altered hormone production. In this prospective cohort study, the
      investigators plan to analyze the rates of AMH decline by comparing the following
      contraceptive methods: tubal ligation, Essure placement, and levonorgestrel intrauterine
      devices (IUDs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) has been shown to be a reliable marker of ovarian reserve
      because levels demonstrate a consistent age-related decline and do not fluctuate throughout
      the menstrual cycle. In prior studies measuring markers other than AMH, tubal ligation has
      been shown to have an adverse effect on ovarian reserve.

      The primary aim of this study will be to compare the rates of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)
      decline following tubal ligation, Essure placement, and levonorgestrel IUDs, and then
      identifying any and all differences that these specific contraceptive methods have on the
      changes of AMH rates over time. The secondary aim will focus on analyzing the various types
      of tubal ligation methods (i.e. coagulation, ligation, clips, bands, etc.) to see if
      different techniques result in any difference in the rate of AMH decline. The hypothesis is
      that tubal ligation will result in an accelerated rate of AMH decline as compared to other
      long-term or permanent contraceptive methods.
