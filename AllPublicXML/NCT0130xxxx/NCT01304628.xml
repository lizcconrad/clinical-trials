    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate if single subcutaneous (SC) doses of PL-3994,
      administered to patients with asthma can achieve a clinically meaningful increase in
      pulmonary function (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second: FEV1) while maintaining an
      acceptable safety profile. The study will characterize the bronchodilator effect, dose and
      safety of PL-3994 in a population of moderately severe, stable asthmatics following overnight
      withdrawal of beta-2 agonists.

             device (IUD), (4) condoms with spermicide, or (5) diaphragm with spermicide.

        If the subject had a vasectomy greater than 6 months prior to the screen visit, this will
        also be acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:
