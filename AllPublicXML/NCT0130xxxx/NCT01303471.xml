  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During general anesthesia, two treatments are used : hypnotic and opioid treatment. Opioid
      treatment is used for pain assessment.

      The change in haemodynamic variables and clinical sign are evaluated during anesthesia for
      pain assessment but these changes are not specific every time.

      The main of this study is to investigate the relationship between calculated compartment
      concentration of remifentanil (opioid) and the parameters from HRV (Heart Rate Variability)
      and APV (Arterial Pressure Variability) before a standard noxious stimulation during general
      anesthesia at calibrated hypnosis level.

      Our hypothesis is that nociceptive stimulation would have reproductible effects on HRV, and
      that these effects would be blunted or abolished by by adequate analgesia. The current study
      is thus designed to analyse HRV and APV in patients with stable hypnosis, before and during
      nociceptive surgical stimulation, at different levels of analgesia.

    <description>Analyse of HRV is a widely used, non-invasive technique to assess autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. The typical spectral pattern of HRV includes two main spectral peaks : a low-freqency (LF) region, affected by both sympathetic and parasympathic activity, and a high-frequency (HF) peak centered at the respiratory frequency, which is associated with parasympathetic activity.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in pupil change during noxious stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>pupil size will be monitored and recored using an infrared pupilometry system consisting of a camera, infrared lignt source, video monitor and video processing software, capturing pupil diameter as a real-time analogue signal (rate of 25 Hz). The pupil size variability will be used to estimate pain</description>

    <measure>change from baseline in heart rate during noxious stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>heart rate will be recorded before induction of anesthesia, just before nociceptive stimulation, then every 30 seconds up to the end of the five minutes after nociceptive stimulation. The heart rate measurement will be used to estimate pain.</description>
