  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a group-based exercise and
      educational program for people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) on physical performance and
      disease-self-management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the effectiveness of a program consisting of education to improve disease
      self-management combined with intensive exercises is not clear. In the present study the
      investigators developed a group-based program for people with RA consisting of physical
      exercise to increase physical performance (i.e. aerobic capacity and muscle strength)
      combined with an educational program to improve disease self-management (self-reported health
      status and self-efficacy). The investigators called it the 'FIT program'. The aim of the
      present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the effects of the FIT program on
      aerobic capacity, muscle strength, self-reported health status and self-efficacy, in a
      population of people with RA. The investigators hypothesized that the FIT-program would have
      beneficial effects on physical performance (ie. aerobic capacity and muscle strength) and
      disease self-management (i.e. perceived health status and self-efficacy components) compared
      to a waiting list control group (WLCgroup).

    <measure>Change in VO2 Max, Maximum Oxygen Uptake in ml/Min/kg is the Standard Index of Cardio-respiratory Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, postintervention at 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>maximum oxygen uptake(VO2max, in ml/min/kg)was determined using the Åstrand-Rhyming test.The workload on the cycle ergometer was increased every minute by 25 watts until a steady-state heart rate was achieved. Participants had to sustain cycling for about 6 minutes, the heart rate(HR) was taken every minute. Mean HR of the 5th and 6th minute was registered. With the given workload, observed HR and participants'weight, maximal oxygen uptake can be established using the Åstrand-Rhyming nomogram. Values vary from &lt; 21( sedentary with disease) to &gt; 57 ( very good physical condition).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-efficacy Pain and Other Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, postintervention at 9 weeks,</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy was assessed by the Arthritis-Self-efficacy Scale Dutch version. This arthritis self-efficacy scale contains two sub scales: self-efficacy pain (5 items related to coping with pain, and self-efficacy other symptoms (6 items related to coping with other symptoms, such as depression, fatigue and frustrations.A five-point ordinal scale is used ranging from 'totally disagree' (1) to 'totally agree' (5). We computed a mean score of 11 items ranging from 1-5. A higher score refers to higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-efficacy Function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, postintervention at 9 weeks,</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy function was assessed by the Arthritis-Self-efficacy Scale Dutch version The subscale self-efficacy function contains 8 items related to physical function. A five-point ordinal scale is used ranging from 'totally disagree' (1) to 'totally agree' (5). A mean score of 8 items was computed ranging from 1-5. A higher score refers to higher self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Muscle Strength of the Upper Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, postintervention at 9 weeks,</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength was assessed using a hand-held dynamometer (Microfet, Hoggan health Industries Inc.USA).Maximal voluntary isometric muscle strength of the elbow-flexors, elbow-extensors, was tested and recorded three times for each muscle group. All tests were performed bilaterally. The mean value of three measurements was computed. In addition a sum score of the mean values of the flexors and extensors on both sides for the upper extremity (UE)was computed and taken for analyses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Muscle Strength of the Lower Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, postintervention at 9 weeks,</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength was assessed using a hand-held dynamometer (Microfet, Hoggan health Industries Inc.USA).Maximal voluntary isometric muscle strength of the knee-flexor and knee-extensors, was tested and recorded three times for each muscle group. All tests were performed bilaterally. The mean value of three measurements was computed. In addition a sum score of the mean values of the flexors and extensors on both sides for the lower extremity (LE)was computed and taken for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health Status: Physical Health</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, postintervention at 9 weeks,</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported health status was assessed using the Arthritis Impact-Measurement Scale-2, the Dutch version (Dutch-AIMS2).The questionnaire contains 77 items which represent 5 dimensions: physical functioning, psychological functioning, symptoms, social interaction and role functioning. Responses are recorded on a 5-point scale. All responses were recoded and calculated to a 0-10 scale. Scores were modified according to the number of co-morbidity complaints, as was recommended in the Dutch-AIMS2 manual. A low score indicates better health.</description>

        <description>maximum oxygen uptake(VO2max, in ml/min/kg)was determined using the Åstrand-Rhyming test.The workload on the cycle ergometer was increased every minute by 25 watts until a steady-state heart rate was achieved. Participants had to sustain cycling for about 6 minutes, the heart rate(HR) was taken every minute. Mean HR of the 5th and 6th minute was registered. With the given workload, observed HR and participants’weight, maximal oxygen uptake can be established using the Åstrand-Rhyming nomogram. Values vary from &lt; 21( sedentary with disease) to &gt; 57 ( very good physical condition).</description>

          <title>Change in Muscle Strength of the Lower Extremity</title>
          <description>Muscle strength was assessed using a hand-held dynamometer (Microfet, Hoggan health Industries Inc.USA).Maximal voluntary isometric muscle strength of the knee-flexor and knee-extensors, was tested and recorded three times for each muscle group. All tests were performed bilaterally. The mean value of three measurements was computed. In addition a sum score of the mean values of the flexors and extensors on both sides for the lower extremity (LE)was computed and taken for analyses.</description>
          <population>per protocol,Lower extremity(LE) muscle strength data for one participant(n=1) in the WLC group is missing because knee problems prevented testing.</population>

Scores were modified according to the number of co-morbidity complaints, as was recommended in the Dutch-AIMS2 manual. A low score indicates better health.</description>

The physical exercise part took place in group sessions and consisted of a muscle exercise circuit and bicycle training once a week for sixty minutes, sport once a week for sixty minutes and aqua jogging twice a week for thirty minutes.
The educational part consisted of a weekly sixty minutes session. A multi-disciplinary group of healthcare professionals consisting of a psychologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, dietician and a social worker gave specialist orientated informational advice about how to handle the consequences of RA. Special attention was paid to ensure adjusting the level of each patients activity level to the participants’ actual energy level.</description>
