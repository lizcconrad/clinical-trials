  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety of the vibrating capsule in healthy volunteers first and
      than for constipation relief constipated individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will be followed for safety for 7 days after taking the capsule.

      Constipated individuals will be first followed for 2 weeks and than they will use the capsule
      for 7.5 weeks period. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated.
