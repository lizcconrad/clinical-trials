  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive periods of time spent sitting may be a risk factor for diabetes. Current lifestyles
      encourage large amounts of sitting (sedentary behaviour) through increasing car use,
      computers, and appealing screen-based home entertainment systems. Methods to help change such
      behaviours are now needed, particularly for those with a high risk of developing a chronic
      disease, such as diabetes. The investigators propose to decrease sedentary behaviour in a
      multi-ethnic group of young adults at risk of diabetes through an educational intervention
      (attending a workshop and having prompts). If successful, this could have significant public
      health benefits given the widespread nature of sedentary behaviour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rising prevalence of obesity and sedentary behaviour has lead to an epidemic of Type 2
      Diabetes (T2DM). As the health and economic costs of T2DM continue to increase, there is an
      urgent need for an effective lifestyle intervention to prevent the development of T2DM. Our
      group have previously developed successful structured education programmes: DESMOND improved
      lifestyle, depression, illness beliefs, weight and CV risk in adults with T2DM; PREPARE
      increased activity levels and reduced 2 hour glucose values in people with pre-diabetes.
      Project STAND will assess the effect of theory driven structured education, facilitated using
      automated technology, on sedentary behaviour and health outcomes in young adults at risk of
      T2DM. Participants will be randomised to a control (C) or intervention (I) group, the latter
      given structured education, based on the PREPARE and DESMOND programmes, with the aim of
      reducing sedentary behaviour. The structured education programme will incorporate movement
      technology to facilitate participant feedback and self-monitoring.This will be the first UK
      trial to address sedentary behaviour change in a population of younger adults at risk of
      T2DM. Our results will provide a platform for the development of a range of future
      multidisciplinary interventions in this rapidly expanding high-risk population.
