  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin and pemetrexed combination or carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab are now
      considered as standard treatment in non-squamous cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Both main
      registrative trials are considered positive because they reached their objectives, but within
      them, the Quality of Life (QoL) of patients was not detailed neither has represented as
      primary objective of the studies. It is considered that, together with enhancements that are
      added to the knowledge of the biology of NSCLC, QoL may influence the therapeutic choice if
      one of the associations show to be better tolerated by the patient and favours an
      amelioration of his QoL.

      The study aims primarily to verify the null hypothesis that between the two schemes under
      consideration there is no minimal interesting difference (MID) (i.e. a difference of clinical
      interest) after initial 3 months of maintenance.EuroQ5D (EQ5D) questionnaire total score and
      EQ5D visual analog scale (VAS)are validated and very simple to be administered.The
      statistical hypothesis tests described above are performed with t-test for unpaired data (or
      equivalent non-parametric, pending verification of normality of distribution by Shapiro-Wilk
      test), with alpha error = 0.05 (2-sided). It is assumed that:

        1. about 20% of randomized patients experienced a progression of disease before the time of
           evaluation of the primary endpoint, and that

        2. this eventuality was not significantly different between the two treatments. The total
           sample to be enrolled for this study will then be increased to 118 patients [(49 +49)
           +20%)]
