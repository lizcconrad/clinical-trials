  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Prospective studies of patients with hyperparathyroidism are warranted to determine
      the prevalence of concurrent thyroid disease applying the current standard of pre-operative
      radioscintigraphic and sonographic imaging of the neck. Timely diagnosis and treatment of
      co-existing thyroid disease is advantageous given the well-established increased morbidity
      associated with a second neck exploration. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      prevalence and specific type of thyroid disease in patients with hyperparathyroidism, and to
      determine the frequency with which the presence of thyroid disease alters the treatment plan
      for patients with hyperparathyroidism.

      Research Design: This will be a prospective single arm observational study of up to 200
      military health care beneficiaries over the age of 18 years with primary and secondary
      hyperparathyroidism scheduled to undergo parathyroid resection.

      Methodology: Patients will undergo standard pre-operative imaging of the neck including
      ultrasonography and 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. An operative plan will be developed based
      on the information obtained from history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and
      imaging studies. The number and type of thyroid disease in these patients will be determined
      based on these non-invasive studies (Objective A). A change in the otherwise standard
      treatment will include those patients having partial or complete resections of their thyroid
      glands because: a) the patients would have undergone minimally invasive surgery if not for
      the results of the imaging studies, and, b) the patients who would have undergone 3 Â½ gland
      parathyroidectomy if not for the results of the imaging studies (Objective B).
