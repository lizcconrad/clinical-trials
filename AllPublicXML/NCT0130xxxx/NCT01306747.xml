  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of the Stanford Chronic Pain Self-Management Programme (CPSMP) is tested in a
      randomized controlled trial with enrollment of Danish chronic pain patients. A total of 500
      chronic pain patients is randomized into either an CPSMP intervention group or a control
      group.

      The CPSMP is brief patient education program consisting of 6 weekly sessions. Two trained
      instructors teach a group of 8-16 chronic pain patients about managing pain. The instructors
      are not health professionals but chronic pain patient themselves. The program is highly
      structured and manualized.

      Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of the CPSMP on pain, self-efficacy and
      well-being. Hence we expect the CPSMP to have an effect on various domains.

        1. Symptom reduction - lower self-reported pain in the CPSMP group compared to controls

        2. Illness perception - the cpsmp group will differ from controls in illness perception and
           have higher disease related self-efficacy

        3. Sickness behavior - the cpsmp group will have fewer sick days and lower health care
           utilization (estimated by registerbased data)than controls

        4. Quality of life - the cpsmp group will report higher life satisfaction and less social
           isolation than controls
