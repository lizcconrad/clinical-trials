  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely indicated to treat gastric adenomas and
           early gastric cancer (EGC).ESD is able to obtain en bloc resection of larger specimens.
           However, ESD has more frequent complications (delayed bleeding, ulcer healing, ulcer
           pain, and etc) due to a more complex procedure. To prevent delayed bleeding, to induce
           rapid ulcer healing, and to control the ulcer pain acid-suppressing agents (PPI, H2RA)
           are generally administered. although PPIs are widely indicated as first-line drugs for
           peptic ulcers, PPI drugs are not fully superior to H2RAs or other combination drugs for
           treatment of iatrogenic ulcer healing and delayed bleeding.

        -  Ecabet sodium (ES)is a widely used mucoprotective agent for the treatment of gastric
           ulcers. Recently, one study showed the additional benefits of using ES in combination
           with the PPI after ESD. however, this study did not show the difference of delayed
           bleeding and the benefit of ulcer pain control. thus, our study prospectively evaluated
           the difference of delayed bleeding and the benefit of ulcer pain control after ESD.
