  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) is a molecule that has been implicated in the homeostasis
      of phosphorus. Elevated FGF23 levels are well-documented in patients with Chronic Kidney
      Disease (CKD) and are inversely correlated with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). FGF23
      levels are also predictive of progression of CKD and predict mortality in CKD. Although
      studies in normal individuals suggest that phosphorus intake is related to FGF23 levels, the
      effect of dietary and pharmacologic phosphate restriction on FGF23 levels in patients with
      CKD has never been reported. Our objectives are to determine if phosphate reduction through
      the use of non-calcium based phosphate binder will decrease serum FGF23 levels. The
      investigators will also be investigating associations of elevation in FGF 23 levels with
      commonly encountered co-morbidities in CKD patients such as Coronary Artery Disease, Diabetes
      Mellitus, and Hypertension.
