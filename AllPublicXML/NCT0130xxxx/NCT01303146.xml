  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no effective treatment for late infantile MLD once clinical symptoms are
      evident. METAZYM is a recombinant human arylsulfatase A developed for an intravenous ERT for
      the treatment of late infantile MLD. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of intravenous rhASA treatment in a patient with late infantile MLD who
      had previously received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the
      deficiency of the Arylsulfatase A enzyme (ARSA), resulting in accumulation of galactosyl
      sulfatide (cerebroside sulfate), a major constituent of the myelin sheath. Accumulation of
      galactosyl sulfatides leads to a progressive degeneration of the white matter in the central
      and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) and neuronal degeneration. The late infantile form
      of MLD, which usually is diagnosed in the second year of life, is the most frequent and
      severe form of the disease. The prognosis is severe, leading to vegetative stage or death
      within few years after the diagnosis. There is no treatment for patients affected with this
      early onset form of the disease. In patients with late-onset MLD (juvenile and adult forms),
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can stabilize the cerebral demyelination.
      This treatment is however inefficient in patients with late infantile MLD at a symptomatic
      stage. The overall objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhASA treatment in a
      patient with late infantile MLD who had received HCT at a presymptomatic stage of the
      disease. Patient will receive rhARSA (100 U/kg) intravenously every other week for a period
      of 18 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's legally authorized guardian(s) must provide signed, informed consent prior
             to performing any study-related activities.

          -  The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of MLD as defined by:ARSA activity &lt; 10
             nmol/h/mg in leukocytes prior to HCT; Presence of elevated sulfatide in urine prior to
             HCT

          -  The patient must have a residual level of voluntary function (as judged by the
             investigator), including presence of residual cognitive function (attention, executive
             and visual functions) as well as the presence of residual voluntary motor function in
             one upper or lower limb as a minimum.

          -  The patient must have an age at the time of screening ≥ 6 months
