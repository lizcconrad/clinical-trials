  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will assess the efficacy and safety of Mircera (methoxy
      polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) in clinical practice in patients with chronic kidney
      disease, in pre-dialysis or on dialysis, initiated on Mircera treatment. Data from each
      patient will be collected over 12 months of treatment.
