  <brief_title>Long Term Follow-up of a Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Hepatitis A Vaccine Administered With and in the Absence of DTPaHibIPV, OPV and MMR Vaccines</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase III Randomised, Open, Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Immunogenicity of Concomitant Administration of Virosomal Hepatitis A Vaccine (EpaxalÂ®) With DTPaHibIPV, OPV and MMR Vaccines vs. Non-concomitant Administration in 12-15 Month Old Children. Follow-up: Serological Long-term Follow-up of Subjects for up to 42 Months, 5.5 and 7.5 Years After the Second Dose.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to assess whether the protection afforded by Epaxal
      vaccine co-administered with diphtheria, tetanus, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus
      influenzae type b, and inactivated polio vaccine(DTPaHibIPV), oral polio vaccine (OPV) and
      (measles mumps and rubella) MMR vaccines against hepatitis A was not inferior to the
      protection afforded by Epaxal administered alone. The aim of the follow-up phase is to obtain
      information on the long term protection afforded by Epaxal, and to compare this with an
      alternative hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix).
