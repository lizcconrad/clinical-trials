      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose levels of
      carfilzomib and LBH589 (panobinostat) that can be given in combination to patients with
      myeloma. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      The Study Drugs:

      Carfilzomib is designed to keep cancer cells from repairing themselves. If the cancer cells
      cannot repair themselves, this may cause them to die.

      Panobinostat is designed to slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by
      blocking certain enzymes (proteins produced by cells).

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 4 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled
      in the Phase 1A portion of the study, and up to 56 total participants will be enrolled in
      Phase 1B.

      If you are enrolled in the Phase 1A portion, the doses of carfilzomib and panobinostat you
      receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will
      receive the lowest dose levels of carfilzomib and panobinostat . Each new group will receive
      a higher dose of carfilzomib and/or panobinostat than the group before it, if no intolerable
      side effects were seen. Sometimes, the new dose level for one drug will be raised, while the
      dose level for the other drug will be the same as the dose given to the earlier group. The
      study staff will explain which group you are assigned to. This dose-raising pattern will
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.

      If you are enrolled in the Phase 1B portion, you will receive carfilzomib and panobinostat at
      the highest doses that were tolerated in the Phase 1A portion.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will receive carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle. Carfilzomib will
      be given by vein over about 30 minutes. The study staff will check you for any side effects
      for at least 1 hour after receiving carfilzomib. You will also be given fluids by vein during
      this hour, during every Cycle 1 dose.

      Starting 2 days before your first dose of carfilzomib, you must drink 6-8 cups (8 ounces
      each) of water each day. This is to make sure you are properly hydrated before your first
      dose of carfilzomib. The study staff will tell you how many days you need to drink this much
      water. All study participants will do this during Cycle 1. If the doctor thinks it is needed,
      based on your risk of developing certain side effects, you may need to keep up this hydration
      plan during Cycle 2 and beyond.

      Before each dose of carfilzomib during Cycle 1, and every dose increase, you will receive
      dexamethasone by vein. This drug is given to try to avoid or lessen side effects (such as
      allergic reaction) that may occur when you receive the study drug.

      You will take panobinostat by mouth once a day on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of each study
      cycle. On Days 1 and 8 of each cycle, your panobinostat dose should be taken about 4 hours
      after the end of your carfilzomib infusion.

      The panobinostat capsule(s) should be swallowed by mouth with a glass (8 ounces) of water.
      You should try to take the dose at around the same time each day. If you vomit after taking
      panobinostat, you should not take it again until your next scheduled dose. If you forget to
      take a dose in the morning, you can take it up to 12 hours later. If you miss a dose for more
      than 12 hours, wait until your next scheduled dose. Do not make up missed doses.

      On Day 1 of every new study cycle, you should wait to take your dose until you come to the
      clinic for study tests. Some of the Day 1 tests need to be performed before dosing.

      You need to follow all dosing instructions as written. Do not miss any capsules. You will be
      asked to return all unused study drug in the bottles provided, along with empty bottles, on
      Day 1 of every cycle, starting with Cycle 2. Capsules should not be transferred between
      bottles at any time. Please do not allow anyone else to handle or touch the study drug.

      Maintenance Dosing:

      After 8 cycles of therapy, you may continue receiving carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 15, and 16,
      and panobinostat on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of each cycle, as tolerated, as long as your
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If disease becomes worse during this period, you
      can stay on study and continue receiving carfilzomib on the original dosing schedule (Days 1,
      2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle).

      If you have any unusual symptoms or intolerable side effects at your assigned dose level,
      then your dose may be lowered. If needed, you may also have to stop taking panobinostat for a
      short time, and the side effect(s) will be closely watched by your doctor until they get
      better.

      If you have a history of herpes simplex or zoster, and your study doctor thinks it is needed,
      you will take acyclovir (an anti-viral drug) while on this study. Your doctor will explain
      how often you will need to take this anti-viral drug.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs,
           height, and weight. Your BSA will also be calculated.

        -  Your performance status will be measured.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any symptoms or side effects you
           may be having (including numbness and/or tingling).

        -  You will have ECGs before your dose of panobinostat. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will also
           have ECGs performed about 3 hours after your dose.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Starting in Cycle 2, this routine blood draw will also include a pregnancy test if you
           are able to become pregnant. To keep taking part in this study, the pregnancy test must
           be negative.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected to check the status of the
           disease. This urine will be collected over a 24-hour period. You will be given a
           container for urine collection.

        -  Starting in Cycle 2, part of this urine sample may be used for a pregnancy test for
           women who are able to become pregnant.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn pharmacodynamics (PD) testing. PD testing is
           used to look at how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease. (Cycle
           1 only)

      On Day 1 of each Cycle:

      °Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, which may include genetic
      biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood and may be related to your reaction to the
      study drug.

      On Days 2, 9, and 16 of Cycle 1:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  On Days 9 and 16 only, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for PD testing.

      On Day 5 of Cycle 1, you will have ECGs before and after your dose of panobinostat. You will
      need to wait to take your panobinostat dose until you are told to do so at the clinic.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

      °Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for PD testing.

      On Days 2, 9, and 16 of Cycle 2 and beyond:

      °Your vital signs will be measured.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 and beyond:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-dosing visit.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      Within 30 days after you stop taking the study drugs, you will have an End-of-Treatment
      Visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs. Your BSA will also be calculated.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have an ECG.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects or symptoms
           (such as numbness and/or tingling) that you may have.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected to check the status of the
           disease. This urine will be collected over a 24-hour period. You will be given a
           container for urine collection.

      This is an investigational study. Carfilzomib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain types of multiple myeloma. Its use in this study is investigational.
      Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for
      research purposes only.

      Up to 46 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
