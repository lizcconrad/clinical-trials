      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how to prevent malnutrition in
      children under age 5 years in Intibuca, Honduras. A randomized community trial design was
      used to implement a nutrition program, including a complementary nutrition supplement,
      educational sessions, and growth and health monitoring integrated into the basic primary care
      package, to participants living in communities in the intervention group. Participants living
      in the control group communities will receive the nutrition supplement for one year following
      the study.
