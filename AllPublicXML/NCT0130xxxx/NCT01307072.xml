  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between the surgical outcome of vitreous surgery for proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy and the compliance to ophthalmic follow-up examinations was evaluated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical records of 94 patients that had undergone vitreous surgery for proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and were followed for at least 6 months were reviewed. The
      subjects were divided into three groups; the never-treated group consisting of patients who
      had no previous ophthalmic examination until the first visit when vitreous surgery was
      prescribed; the non-compliant group consisting of patients with a history of missing
      ophthalmic examination over a one year period, and the compliant group consisting of patients
      who had ophthalmic examinations at least once a year. The evaluations included age, gender,
      plasma level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the preoperative examination, presence of
      preoperative panretinal photocoagulation, preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      postoperative BCVA at the final examination, status of the PDR, the numbers of vitreous
      surgeries, and presence of pre- and postoperative neovascular glaucoma.
