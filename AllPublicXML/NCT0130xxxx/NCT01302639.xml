  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are strong indications that (combinations of) polyphenols may be attractive candidates
      in the prevention of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes through modulation of pathways of
      fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that the combination of
      specific polyphenols, with partly distinct mechanisms of action, may have physiologically
      significant effects on fat oxidation through additive or synergistic effects, thereby
      improving body composition, insulin sensitivity and preventing type 2 diabetes. The following
      objective will be addressed in the current study:

      (1) to test short term (3 day) effects of combinations of polyphenols (supplements of EGCG
      either in combination with resveratrol or with resveratrol and genistein) to affect systemic
      lipolysis and fat oxidation during overnight fasted conditions and after ingestion of a high
      fat meal in overweight subjects
