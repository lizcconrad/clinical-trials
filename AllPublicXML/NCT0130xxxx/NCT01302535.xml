      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of yoga on blood pressure and quality
      of life in patients in primary health care diagnosed with hypertension within the last year.
      Another purpose is to examine whether the possible effect on blood pressure differs if
      patients practice yoga in a group lead by a yoga-trainer or receive a few yoga-exercises from
      their doctor to be practiced individually at home.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension is one of the most common diseases in the industrialized world. In Sweden alone
      approximately 1.8 million persons, 25% of the adult population, have hypertension.
      Hypertension is a common diagnosis in primary health care and the costs of investigating and
      treating hypertension and its consequences are considerable. We know that stress can affect
      blood pressure, but it is hard to measure and control.

      Previous studies have separately shown that yoga can reduce levels of cortisol in saliva and
      lower blood pressure. However, few studies have investigated the effects of yoga on
      hypertension and we lack information about the possibility of using yoga in primary health
      care to reduce hypertension.

      If yoga can be used to complement antihypertensive medicines, it could reduce medicine intake
      and thereby possibly reduce side effects and lower medicine costs. It is to be hoped that
      patients will also experience a higher quality of life if they perform yoga on a regular
      basis.

    <description>At the beginning of the study, all subjects will undergo a standardized blood pressure test with an hypertension monitor. After 12 weeks, all subjects in the intervention and control groups will again be requested to attend a blood pressure testing session. Blood samples will also be collected and analysed in the beginning and at the end of the study. Some blood samples will be preserved for future analysis.</description>
