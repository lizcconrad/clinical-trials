      OBJECTIVE: To test a brief intervention designed to improve the cost-effectiveness of care
      provided by medicine housestaff for hospitalized patients.

      HYPOTHESIS: A brief intervention in which medicine residents receive itemized bills for
      recent patients cared for by them, followed by a discussion on approaches to reducing
      unnecessary inpatient costs, can result in significant cost reductions without adversely
      affecting patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed a brief educational intervention with two primary objectives: 1) to increase
      awareness among residents about how their decisions impact the costs of inpatient medical
      care; and 2) to improve the cost-effectiveness of care provided by residents without
      adversely affecting patient outcomes. We hypothesized that a brief intervention in which
      residents receive bills for patients they recently cared for, followed by a discussion on
      approaches to reducing unnecessary inpatient costs, would reduce costs without adversely
      affecting patient outcomes.
