      This double-blind study has two parts for each subject (same population):

      Part A: initial treatment in CL (placebo-controlled):

        -  To assess the efficacy, safety and duration of effect of Azzalure® compared to placebo
           in the improvement of moderate to severe Lateral Canthal Lines.

        -  To assess the subjects' level of satisfaction with the appearance their Lateral Canthal
           Lines compared to placebo.

      Part B: repeated treatment in CL with or without GL (active treatment, up to 1 year):

        -  To assess safety of Azzalure® following repeated administration in the improvement of
           moderate to severe Lateral Canthal Lines.

        -  To assess the safety of Azzalure® when used concomitantly for improvement of moderate to
           severe Lateral Canthal Lines and Glabellar Lines.

        -  To assess the subjects' level of satisfaction with the appearance their Lateral Canthal
           Lines.
