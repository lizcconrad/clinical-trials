      CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Tumor and its therapy have adverse effects on the nutritional status
      of cancer patients, leading to nutritional support. The aim was to study enteral nutrition
      indications, as well as its compliance and the impact on nutritional status.

      DESIGN AND SETTING: Clinical trial, IOP, Unifesp-EPM.

      METHODS: Patients older than 1 year followed during anticancer therapy were included from
      January 2002 to January 2004. They received industrialized oral supplementation - Nutren 1.0
      or Jr (IOS) and were followed on a weekly basis and reevaluated on weeks 3, 8 and 12: at
      these times, if inadequate outcome was observed, tube feeding with the same supplement (TFR)
      was indicated.
