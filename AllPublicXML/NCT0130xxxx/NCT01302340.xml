  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a common chronic condition, with predicted increasing prevalence. Nearly all
      patients with dementia will experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). This causes
      significant burden for the individual patients and their caregivers. Current treatment has
      only modest efficacy and important side-effects. Formulations with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
      (THC), the psycho-active compound of cannabis, are currently being registered for spasms in
      multiple sclerosis and other diseases, and may have beneficial effects on NPS.

      Design Phase II pilot study, multi-center, repeated cross-over, double blinded randomized
      trial. The study consists of two weeks baseline measurements to assure that the
      neuropsychiatric symptoms are stable and six successive treatment blocks of 2 weeks. Each
      treatment block lasts for two weeks and contains two double-blinded drug periods, each
      lasting three days of oral THC or placebo, separated by four day washout periods. After three
      treatment blocks (period A), the dosage of active treatment was increased for the latter
      three treatment blocks (period B). After the two treatment periods, subjects will proceed to
      the extension phase if applicable.

      Study centers The department of Geriatrics from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre
      and the department of Elderly from Vincent van Gogh voor Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg Venray
      (VVG) will participate in this multi center study.

      Participants 20 subjects with dementia and NPS. Intervention Namisol® in doses of twice daily
      0,75 mg tablet (period A) and twice daily 1.5 mg (period B) THC oral tablets. Placebo of
      twice daily 0,75 mg and twice daily 1.5 mg oral tablets Outcome measures Primary outcome is
      NPI score, secondary CMAI, Zarit Burden scale. Other outcomes include vital signs,
      side-effects, physical exam, mobility and pharmacogenetics.

      Visits This study will be assessed fully ambulatory, starting with a 5 hour clinical visit on
      day 1 and 8 of block 1 and a phone call on day 2 and 9 for assessment of Adverse Events.
      Furthermore, the research physician will conduct a weekly home visit weekly during the
      crossover phase for assessment of , among others, the primary outcome measure. These visits
      will all be repeated in period B of the crossover phase.

      During the 6 month open label extension phase, subjects will visit the clinic three times.

    <description>Active treatment consists of THC in tablet form. Patients receive 0.75 mg THC twice daily during the first three treatment blocks (period A) and 1.5 mg THC twice daily during the latter three treatment blocks (period B). Placebo treatment consists of two tablets daily and is matched to the active treatment for taste, color and size. Study medication will be administered at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., by the primary caregiver. These time points are chosen because NPS often occur later on the day, when fatigue and external signals build up to the stress and result in NPS. The order of administration of THC and placebo (1:1) will be determined by randomization per block: THC followed by placebo or placebo followed by THC.</description>
