  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a unilateral vestibular loss often complain of dizziness and imbalance.
      Movement usually increases these symptoms often resulting in patients avoiding these
      movements, causing further limitations in their activities of daily living. Vestibular
      Rehabilitation (VR) involves a series of adaptation and balance exercises to improve symptoms
      of postural stability. There is evidence that stroke patients gain benefit in their
      rehabilitation from using gaming consoles (Nintendo Wii Balance) and we believe that similar
      advantages can be shown for balance patients. We plan a 3 arm study. As there is a
      considerable wait list for VR, the first arm will receive a Wii console and instructions to
      use it on the wait list and during VR. The second arm will receive a Wii console and
      instructions at the end of the waiting list and will use it during VR only and the control
      group will receive no Wii. All will spend the same time on the wait list and will receive
      identical assessments and VR
