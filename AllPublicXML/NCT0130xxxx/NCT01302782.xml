  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to observe whether there is a change in blood glucose
      levels in response to a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) during acute normobaric
      hypoxia (short term low oxygen levels at normal ambient air pressure).

    <description>Subjects will be placed on a Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device (ROBD2) to simulate 3 different altitudes at three separate and distinct time periods (ground, 8,000 feet and 12,000 feet) then obtain c-peptide and 2-hour OGTT to determine blood glucose changes during acute normobaric hypoxia.</description>
