  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NCRI Adult ALL sub-group propose to collaborate with the Dutch/Belgian group HOVON to
      carry out a prospective, non randomised multi-arm study (including a choice of regimen
      intensity) to investigate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of a standardised therapy
      protocol for patients ≥ 60 years old with de novo ALL. The overall aim is define a basic
      standard of care upon which trials of novel therapies will be based in future. The design of
      the study will enable collection of a comprehensive dataset regarding the clinical outcome,
      Complete Response Rate (CR) and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) response rates in a previously
      completely uncharacterised population, thus providing the essential platform for designing
      future randomised advanced phase studies in which new therapeutic approaches and novel
      therapies can be prospectively investigated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will

        1. establish baseline expectations for Event Free Survival (EFS), Overall Survival (OS),
           MRD responses and quality of life measures for older patients of all ages and pre-morbid
           states;

        2. disclose how best to use knowledge of pre-morbid characteristics to apply the
           appropriate intensity of therapy in order to balance the best disease related outcomes
           against quality of life;

        3. establish national standards of care for this patient group;

        4. provide the essential platform for careful design of future randomised advanced phase
           studies of new therapeutic approaches and agents.
