  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate platelet function variations according to the delay since
      last aspirin intake (12 vs 24 hours)in a population of diabetic patients with previous
      Coronary Artery Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have previously demonstrated that there was a time-dependant efficacy of aspirin on
      platelet function. In this study, we investigate platelet function (fundamental research)
      according to the delay since last aspirin intake (12 vs 24 hours)in a population of diabetic
      patients with previous Coronary Artery Disease routinely treated with aspirin. In order to
      eliminate any variation linked to a cumulative dose effect of aspirn, platelet function is
      assessed 24 hours after a single 150 mg aspirin intake or 12 hours after a 75 mg aspirin
      intake given twice per day (corresponding to the same total dose of 150 mg /day). Light
      transmission aggregometry triggered by arachidonic acid 0.5mg/mL (LTA-AA) is the main
      endpoint of the study (intensity and velocity of agregation following exposure to arachidonic
      acid 0.5 mg/ml).

    <description>Type 2 diabetic patients with previous coronary artery disease. All patients are routinely treated with aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coronary artery disease is defined as a previous coronary angiography with at least 1 coronary artery stenosis &gt;50%. Type 2 diabetes is defined as patients with diabetes discovered after 30 years old and insulin was not the first treatment except in case of acute coronary syndrome.</description>
