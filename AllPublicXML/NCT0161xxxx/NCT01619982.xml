  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn 1) if the addition of prophylaxis with vancomycin will
      decrease the rate of cefazolin non-susceptible surgical site infections (SSI), in high risk
      population 2) to develop better understanding of vancomycin and cefazolin pharmacokinetics in
      children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 3) to assess the barriers to vancomycin
      dosing peri-operatively 4) to assess side effects and risks associated with peri-operative
      vancomycin administration. This will allow us to improve patient care by better understanding
      the benefits or the risks of peri-operative vancomycin administration and potentially
      decrease cefazolin-resistant surgical site infections.

      In addition, this study gives us the opportunity to evaluate cefazolin and vancomycin
      pharmacokinetics (pK) on children on CPB.

      The investigators will take blood samples from 20 patients. In 10 patients the investigators
      will do Cefazolin pK analysis and in the other 10 the investigators will do pK Vancomycin
      analysis. For the remainder of 292 patients, only prospective chart review will be done to
      determine the incidence of SSIs.

      This data will be compared with 936 controls who received only Cefazolin pre-operatively as
      prophylaxis for SSI's.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With 100% compliance with the surgical infection prevention (SIP) bundle, the risk of
      surgical site infections (SSIs) has decreased considerably, but is still greater than the
      baseline rate at the best comparison hospital (2.5%). Recent analysis of SSI's in
      cardiovascular surgery patients identified more than half being caused by cefazolin resistant
      gram positive bacteria (methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci- MRSE
      (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus- MRSA). Cefazolin is routinely given pre-operatively as surgical prophylaxis in
      patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Vancomycin is not routinely recommended for
      prophylaxis due to concerns of developing vancomycin resistance, however patients with MRSE
      and MRSA SSIs end up needing additional surgery to remove or replace infected hardware or
      grafts and/or additional weeks to months of intravenous vancomycin therapy. This results in
      significant morbidity to the children and cost to the institution. Several published
      guidelines suggest the use of pre-operative prophylaxis with vancomycin (alone or in
      conjunction with cefazolin) in instances where patients may be at higher risk for infection
      with MRSE or MRSA. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of
      vancomycin to standard pre-operative prophylaxis with cefazolin in selected high risk
      subjects along with the full SIP bundle will decrease the incidence of cefazolin-resistant
      SSI's.

Hypotension requiring treatment
Rash, flushing or Red Man's syndrome
Other changes in vital signs (decrease in baseline 02 sat, increased heart or respiratory rate, elevated body temperature) felt to be associated with vancomycin administration
An event associated with vancomycin administration which results in delay in surgery</description>
        <time_frame>Adverse events to vancomycin will be assessed on each patient in the study during the time the patient is in the operating room (0-&lt;24 hours)</time_frame>
        <population>Only the Cefazolin 25 mg/kg Body Weight and Vancomycin groups were assessed, the Cefazolin 30mg/kg body weight did not receive vancomycin</population>

Vancomycin hydrochloride: Vancomycin 15 mg/kg (max 1.5 gram/dose) will be administered intravenously over 1-2 hours (after completion of cefazolin infusion). Repeat same dose intraoperatively at 8 hours or 12 hours if patient younger than 1 month of age.</description>
