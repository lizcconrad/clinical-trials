  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this real-world comparative effectiveness research (CER) study is to
      reduce disability among older home health patients by treating their pain more effectively.
      To achieve this goal the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of
      a physical therapist (PT) delivered intervention provided to VNSNY home health care patients
      with activity-limiting pain. The intervention is an evidence-based non-pharmacological
      program to reduce pain and pain-related disability that utilizes cognitive-behavioral pain
      self-management (CBPSM) techniques.

      This project will compare the effectiveness of usual care provided to older home health
      patients admitted with activity-limiting pain to usual care plus instruction by PTs in CBPSM
      techniques. The project also will examine differences in the effectiveness of the
      intervention among different race/ethnicity groups and individuals with different pain types,
      as well as the fidelity of intervention-group PTs to the CBPSM program.

      The specific aims of this CER study that will include sizeable numbers of Hispanics,
      non-Hispanic African Americans and non-Hispanic white patients ages 55 and older are: (1) to
      compare the effectiveness of usual care provided to older home health patients admitted with
      activity-limiting pain to usual care plus instruction by PTs in CBPSM techniques; and (2) to
      examine the heterogeneity of CBPSM treatment effects among patients with different pain
      conditions and minority group status.

    <description>The main study intervention is training of the PTs on teams randomized into the intervention group in the evidence-based CBPSM program which has been translated for use in home health care with patients who have activity-limiting pain. The program is designed to be implemented in a manner that allows for maximal integration into routine PT care of home health patients. This will be possible because the CBPSM techniques, together with exercise and other PT techniques that constitute customary PT care, are reciprocally reinforcing. Both treatments (CBPSM and PT) encourage the use of similar behavioral and pain self-management coping skills to enhance behavioral activation, perceptions of self-efficacy, self-control, and personal mastery with regard to the management of pain.</description>
