  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the effect of mindfulness training on the eating behaviors
      and dietary intake of overweight or obese persons. Mindfulness skills training involves
      bringing non-judgmental attention to thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations - including
      hunger and satiety cues. It is hypothesized that as subjects advance through the 8-week class
      series, developing their capacity for mindfulness and in effect learn to pay attention to the
      sensations, assumptions, cognitions, and beliefs that underlie their eating behaviors, that
      their eating behaviors will improve. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that 1)
      there will be significant improvements in the areas of uncontrolled and emotional eating, 2)
      there will be significant decreases in total caloric intake and significant increases in
      fruits and vegetables, and 3) there will be a positive significant relationship between the
      frequency/consistency of mindfulness practice and improvements from baseline to follow-up
      measures.
