  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying whether men being treated for prostate cancer have the same amount of side
      effects from either one of two different external radiation treatments: IMRT or PBT. With
      IMRT, a number of x-ray beams are used to shape the radiation to the prostate. PBT is another
      type of external radiation treatment for prostate cancer that is used in a few centers in the
      United States. Protons are tiny particles with positive charge that can be controlled to
      travel a certain distance and stop. PBT is precise like IMRT, but it uses proton beams
      instead of x-ray beams.

      IMRT and PBT aim to deliver most of the radiation to the prostate cancer while sparing
      surrounding tissues. Both IMRT and PBT have been used in the treatment of prostate cancer and
      are thought to be equally effective at curing prostate cancer. However, both treatments have
      also been shown to cause the potential side effects of radiation, including bowel, urinary
      and erectile problems. It is possible that side effect rates with PBT will be lower, the
      same, or even higher than with IMRT, but this has not been studied well to date. Though both
      of these radiation therapies have been used in the past to treat prostate cancer, there has
      never been a study that compares the effects of these two therapies to see which one has less
      side effects.

      In this research study, we are comparing IMRT to PBT to determine which therapy best
      minimizes the side effects of treatment.

      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, you will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of
      the study groups: IMRT or PBT. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance,
      like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the research doctor will choose which group you will be
      in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group. Randomization makes the
      study better from a scientific point of view because it helps ensure that patients receiving
      IMRT and proton therapy are similar. You will be receiving only one type of radiation, either
      IMRT or PBT throughout your participation in the study.

      Before you begin radiation therapy you will have a pelvic CT scan in order to design your
      radiation treatment. Doctors will use information gathered from these scans to plan the best
      way to deliver radiation to your tumor.

      Both types of radiation therapy will be given once a day for 5 days (no weekends or holidays)
      for up to 9 weeks. Both IMRT and PBT will require that you lie on a table for less than 15
      minutes to obtain your treatment.

      During each visit you will be asked questions about your general health and specific
      questions about any problems that you might be having and any medications you might be
      taking. You will also undergo a physical exam and complete some quality of life
      questionnaires.

      After your radiation therapy you will have follow up visits at 3,6,9,12,18,24,36,48 and 60
      months.
