  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an initial efficacy study of a candidate antimalarial in human subjects with
      uncomplicated malaria caused by the most common and most important parasite in Africa
      (Plasmodium falciparum). This study will enroll 66 adult Malian males with uncomplicated P.
      falciparum malaria and randomize them to treatment with 1750 mg of the investigational drug
      (AQ-13) by mouth over 3 days or the current standard treatment, which is 2 doses of Coartem
      twice daily for 3 days. The hypothesis underlying this study is that AQ-13 will be similarly
      effective to Coartem for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to both
      chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant parasites. Funding Source - FDA Office of
      Orphan Product Development (OOPD).

      This is an initial efficacy study (Phase 2 Proof of Concept Study) of a candidate
      antimalarial in human subjects with uncomplicated malaria caused by the most common and most
      important parasite in Africa (Plasmodium falciparum). This study will enroll 66 adult Malian
      males with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and randomize them to treatment with 1750 mg
      of the investigational drug (AQ-13) by mouth over 3 days or the current standard treatment,
      which is 80 mg of artemether and 480 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. The
      hypothesis underlying this study is that AQ-13 will be similarly effective to Coartem for the
      treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to both chloroquine-susceptible and
      chloroquine-resistant parasites.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome of this study is a comparison of the cure rates of AQ-13 and Coartem for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adult Malian males.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects are followed for 42 days after beginning treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem..</time_frame>
    <description>Cure is defined as a lack of recrudescence within 42 days (PCR-corrected) - no evidence of recurrent infection with the same parasite genotype after reduction of the asexual parasitemia to less than 25% of the admission value by day 3 and clearance of asexual parasites and fever by day 7. Failure is defined as lack of cure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>within 4 weeks of beginning treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) are defined as events possibly related to the study drug(s) as judged by blinded physician observers that occur within 4 weeks of beginning treatment with AQ-13 or Coartem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parasite Clearance Time</measure>
    <time_frame>from the time of beginning treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem to the first of 2 successive negative blood smears</time_frame>
    <description>Blood smears are performed at the time of diagnosis and then (for persons who have been enrolled after providing their informed consent to participate) twice daily until two successive negative smears have been obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to recrudescence of reinfection</measure>
    <time_frame>within 42 days after beginning treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem</time_frame>
    <description>This is the time from the initiation of oral treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem until the reappearance of asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasites on the blood smear.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of antimalarial treatment on the QT (QTc) interval.</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days of beginning treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem</time_frame>
    <description>Previous (Phase 1) studies of AQ-13 in comparison with chloroquine have shown that QT prolongation is greater with chloroquine than AQ-13, does not produce arrhythmias or other definable cardiac AEs and returns to normal (pre-treatment) levels within 2 weeks after treatment. QT intervals will be monitored daily during the 5-7 day inpatient stay and checked again during an outpatient visit in week 2 (on day 14). Although this is identified as a potential safety issue, there have been no definable cardiac AEs with AQ-13 doses up to 2100 mg in the Phase 1 studies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic parameters for AQ-13</measure>
    <time_frame>These studies will continue for the entire 42 day follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>Based on serial blood levels (35 blood level determinations of AQ-13 and its metabolites over the 42 day study period) and urine collections (24 hour collections for the first four days after beginning treatment), it should be possible to define the pharmacokinetics of AQ-13 in febrile patients with uncomplicated malaria and to relate those results to the area under the curve, peak levels, clearance rates, previous data from uninfected subjects in the Phase 1 studies and the clinical outcome of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fever Clearance Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-7 after beginning treatment with either AQ-13 or Coartem</time_frame>
    <description>Body temperature will be measured twice daily with an electronic (digital) thermometer during the 5-7 day inpatient stay. Fever clearance time is defined as the time in hours from beginning treatment with AQ-13 or Coartem until the disappearance of fever for at least 24 hours. This is not a safety issue because patients with hyperthermia will be excluded from participation in this study.</description>
