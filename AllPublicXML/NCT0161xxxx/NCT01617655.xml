  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9
      (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9).

      Primary Objective of the study:

      To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels
      after 24 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of alirocumab in comparison with placebo on LDL-C at other time
           points

        -  To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab

      The maximum study duration was planned to be 89 weeks per participant including participants
      who successfully completed the 78-week treatment period had the possibility to join an
      open-label extension study (LTS13463, NCT01954394) at the end of the treatment period.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 33 centers in 5 countries. A total of 206 participants were screened between June 2012 and May 2013, 99 of whom were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to exclusion criteria met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified according to prior history of myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke, and intensity of statin treatment. Assignment to treatment arms was done centrally using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in a 1:2 ratio (placebo:alirocumab) after confirmation of selection criteria. 107 participants were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>
