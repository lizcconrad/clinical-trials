      This study was advocated by Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy
      of Chinese Medical Sciences in October 2011.

      It was funded by China major scientific and technological specialized project for
      'significant new formulation of new drugs'.

      Dengzhanxixin is kind of Chinese Medicine injection used for treating Ischemic Stroke and
      coronary heart disease in many Chinese hospitals.

      The purpose of this study is to determine adverse drug events or adverse drug reaction in
      large sample size 30,000 patients.

      It is very common that Chinese Medicine Injection used in hospitals in mainland China.
      However safety problems rose in recent years. There could be many uncertain factors influence
      Chinese Medicine Injection in clinical practice.

      Safety surveillance on Chinese Medicine injection is an important problem that needs to be
      sorted out through large sample observational study.

      A registry study for Kudiezi injection safety surveillance with 30000 patients will be
      conducted from April.2012 to December.2014.

      Eligibility criteria Patients who will use Dengzhanxixin injection in selected hospitals

      Data will be collected in three aspects by three different forms as following:

      Form A (green): demographic information ；Form B (pink): adverse drug events/reaction； Form C
      (white): extracted information from hospital information system and laboratory information
      system Form

    <time_frame>The registry procedure will last 3 years only for patients using Dengzhanxixin</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be measured and assessed at the time Dengzhanxixin is administered to them until they discharge. Patients using Dengzhanxixin will be registered on a registration form including disease background, Dengzhanxixin's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side effects of Dengzhanxixin.</description>
