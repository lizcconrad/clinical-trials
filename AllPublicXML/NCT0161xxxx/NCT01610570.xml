  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Mithramycin is a drug that was first tested as a cancer therapy in the 1960s. It acted
      against some forms of cancer, but was never accepted as a treatment. Research suggests that
      it may be useful against some solid tumors, particularly Ewing sarcoma. Researchers want to
      see if mithramycin can be used to treat solid tumors in children and adults. It will be
      tested in different groups of people, including those with a type of Ewing sarcoma that
      contains a chemical called Ewings sarcoma - friend leukemia integration 1 transcription
      factor (EWS-FLI1).

      Objectives:

      - To see if mithramycin is safe and effective against solid tumors and Ewing sarcoma in
      children and adults.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children and young adults between 1 and 17 years of age with solid tumors that have not
           responded to standard treatment.

        -  Adults at least 18 years of age with EWS-FLI1 Ewing sarcoma that has not responded to
           standard treatment.

        -  Children and young adults between 1 and 17 years of age with EWS-FLI1 Ewing sarcoma that
           has not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor tissue samples will be used to
           monitor the cancer before treatment. Individuals with solid brain tumors will not be
           eligible.

        -  Participants will receive mithramycin every day for 7 days, followed by 14 days without
           treatment. Each 28-day round of treatment is called a cycle.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will continue to take the drug for as long as the side effects are not
           severe and the tumor responds to treatment.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Mithramycin, an anti-tumor antibiotic, underwent broad clinical evaluation in solid
           tumors and leukemias in the 1960s and demonstrated activity in some leukemias,
           lymphomas, and solid tumors. In particular, mithramycin was found to have activity
           against testicular cancers and was briefly used in the clinic for this tumor prior to
           the development of the currently used treatment regimen.

        -  The Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) is the second most common malignant bone tumor
           of childhood. There has been very little improvement in overall patient survival in past
           years, particularly for patients with high risk metastatic or relapsed disease.
           Therefore, there is a need for effective novel agents for the treatment of this disease.

        -  Multiple studies have shown that suppressing the expression of EWS-FLI1 effectively
           limits the tumorigenicity of ESFT cells. Laboratory studies have shown that mithramycin
           effectively suppresses the activity of EWS-FLI1 both in vitro and in vivo.

      OBJECTIVES (PRIMARY):

        -  Phase I portion of this study is to: determine the tolerability, toxicity, and the
           recommended phase II dose of mithramycin in children and adolescents with refractory
           extracranial solid tumors.

        -  Phase II portion of this trial is to: determine the objective response rate (complete
           response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Ewing sarcoma to mithramycin in children and
           adults using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria when
           administered at 17.5 microgram/kg over 6 hours once daily for 7 days to be repeated
           every 28 days until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

        -  Phase II portion of this trial to: evaluate if mithramycin inhibits NR0B1 in tumor
           tissue and determine changes in gene expression signature pre-treatment and at steady
           state on day +4 of treatment in patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with
           Ewing sarcoma and EWS/FLI1 fusion transcript with disease amenable to percutaneous
           biopsy.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Phase I Portion: children (greater than or equal to 12 months) and adolescents (less
           than or equal to 17 years) with recurrent or refractory extracranial solid tumors.

        -  Phase II Portion in adults: adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age at
           enrollment) with recurrent or refractory measurable extracranial Ewing sarcoma and the
           EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript.

        -  Phase II Portion in children and adolescents: Once the adult dose is deemed safe,
           children

      (greater than or equal to 12 months) and adolescents (less than or equal to 17 years) with
      recurrent or refractory measurable

      extracranial Ewing sarcoma and the EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript will begin enrollment to the
      Phase II portion.

        -  Participants must meet safety laboratory criteria and prior therapy limitations.

      DESIGN:

      Phase I Portion: Mithramycin will be administered in escalating doses to children and
      adolescents intravenously over 6 hours once daily for 7 days to be repeated every 28 days
      until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The cohort at the recommended dose or
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be expanded up to 12 patients, and attempts will be made to
      enroll 6 patients that are greater than or equal to 12 years of age and 6 patients that are &lt;
      12 years of age to gain experience with a broad age range of patients. A maximum of 18
      evaluable patients will be enrolled on the phase I portion.

        -  Phase II Portion: Using a Simon two stage design, mithramycin will be administered
           intravenously at 17.5 microgram/kg over 6 hours once daily for 7 days to be repeated
           every

           28 days until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression to children and adults with
           Ewing sarcoma with EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript. Up to 24 evaluable patients will be
           enrolled on the phase II portion.

        -  The Phase I and Phase II portions of the protocol will enroll patients simultaneously.

        <title>Time to Progression (TTP)</title>
        <description>TTP is defined as the number of days from enrollment until disease progression, death because of treatment complications, resection of measureable tumor, or last patient follow-up, whichever comes first, assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable disease (SD) is neither shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

        <description>Measurable disease were to be quantified using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis per the RECIST, measuring soft tissue disease. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes. Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable disease (SD) is neither shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

          <description>Measurable disease were to be quantified using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis per the RECIST, measuring soft tissue disease. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes. Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable disease (SD) is neither shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
