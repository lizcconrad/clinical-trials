    <textblock>
      In this study the effect of ipragliflozin on glucose homeostasis in healthy subjects and T2DM
      subjects, and the effect of exposure of ipragliflozin on urinary glucose excretion and plasma
      glucose in T2DM subjects will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will consist of 2 parts. In Part A the effect of ipragliflozin on the glucose
      homeostasis will be investigated and in Part B we will investigate the effect of exposure of
      ipragliflozin on UGE and plasma glucose levels.

      Part A

      This part will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-

      period, 2 treatment crossover design in healthy subjects and in T2DM

      subjects who are drug naïve or washed out for metformin prior to

      admission to the clinical site.

      Part B

      This part will be an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2 treatment

      crossover design in T2DM subjects stratified by baseline HbA1c

      levels (6.0-6.9%, 7.0-7.9%, 8.0-8.9% or 9.0-9.9%).
