  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of our new web-based version of
      the CBT4CBT (Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) program specifically
      designed for alcohol to evaluate its effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling
      at the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit (SATU). The computer-based training program (CBT4CBT)
      focuses on teaching basic coping skills, presenting examples of effective use of coping
      skills in a number of realistic situations in video form, and providing opportunities for
      patients to practice and review new skills while receiving substance abuse treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety alcohol using individuals seeking treatment at the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit
      (SATU) of the Connecticut Mental Health Center will be randomized to (1) standard outpatient
      counseling at SATU (typically consisting of weekly group counseling), (2) standard outpatient
      counseling plus web-based CBT, or (3) web-based CBT4CBT with minimal clinical monitoring.
      Treatments will be delivered over an 8-week period with a six-month follow-up after
      termination of the study treatments. The primary outcome measures will be reduction in
      alcohol use (frequency of alcohol use by time, confirmed by urine toxicology screens and
      breathalyzers). Secondary outcomes will include treatment utilization and cost, several
      measures intended to detect whether web-based CBT4CBT retains key characteristics of
      traditional clinician-administered CBT (e.g., acquisition of coping skills, use of change
      strategies), participant characteristics which will be evaluated as potential moderators of
      outcome, as well as participant satisfaction and treatment credibility.
