    <textblock>
      For type-1 diabetes, the aim of insulin therapy is to keep blood glucose close to normal
      while avoiding hypoglycaemia but this is severely limited by the relative crudeness of
      current insulin delivery in comparison with the physiology of the Î²-cells which secrete
      insulin. Insulin is generally administered by multiple injections MDI with the dose adjusted
      according to eating and exercise. Insulin can now also be administered using a pump (CSII),
      which is a device, roughly the size of a mobile phone and containing sufficient insulin to
      supply both the needs of basal metabolism throughout the day, and the boluses which have to
      cover meals. The use of CSII is expensive compared to injections, but there are important
      potential benefits which include improved glycaemic control, reduced risk of hypoglycaemia
      (low blood sugar) and a more flexible lifestyle and better quality of life. There have been
      no trials in adults that have compared CSII treatment with MDI where the same structured
      training in intensive insulin therapy has been given, so the precise benefit of the pump
      technology is still unclear. There is a need to establish this, and identify patients who
      benefit the most so that the Department of Health can calculate the proportion of adults that
      would benefit from CSII therapy and so ensure that commissioning bodies provide the necessary
      reimbursement. The aim of the trial is therefore to establish the added benefit of CSII
      therapy over multiple injections on glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia in individuals with
      Type 1 diabetes receiving similar high quality structured training (Dose Adjustment For
      Normal Eating:DAFNE) in insulin therapy. Additional assessments will include effects on
      quality of life and cost effectiveness.

      The trial is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial whereby between 40 and 49 type-1
      diabetic, adult volunteers, aged 18 and above, will be recruited per site from 7 secondary
      care centres (Sheffield, Kings College Hospital London, Harrogate District Hospital,
      Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Dumfries and Galloway Royal
      Infirmary and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary). The sites will be required to recruit participants
      to at least 3 CSII DAFNE (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating)courses and 3 MDI DAFNE courses.
      This will mean that in total on the trial, 140 participants are randomised to CSII and 140 to
      MDI. Participants will be recruited through direct approach if already on the waiting list
      for a DAFNE course or through advertisement in various clinics.

    <measure>The proportion of participants reaching the NICE target of an HbA1c level of 7.5% (58mmol/mol) or less</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a measurement of glycosylated haemoglobin which reflects overall blood glucose values over the previous 6-8 weeks(24). This is regarded as the gold standard measure of glycaemic control. There is a strong relationship between HbA1c and the risk of developing long term diabetic complications and it is accepted as a surrogate for long term outcomes in individuals with diabetes.
Since HbA1c can be measured by different techniques we will ensure standardisation by measuring HbA1c in blood samples at a central laboratory.

    <measure>Hypoglycaemia (severe &amp; moderate)</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will record both severe and moderate episodes of hypoglycaemia in participants. This should increase power and identify the ability of CSII to reduce rates of hypoglycaemia. It will also be possible to assess the effects of both, by comparing quality of life measures in those with only moderate hypos, versus those with moderate and severe.

    <measure>Insulin dose</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Some studies have indicated that CSII results in the use of less insulin. We will therefore record participants' self-reported insulin dose at each time point and calculate units/kg body weight.

    <measure>Body weight</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>If CSII treatment results in the use of less insulin, it may have a favourable effect on weight since with less insulin there is a propensity for the body to store fewer nutrients. We will therefore record weight at each time point of the trial.

    <measure>Fear of hypoglycaemia</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hypoglycaemia Fear Scale (HFS) is a well validated psychometric tool assessing participants fear of hypoglycaemia both overall and in terms of behaviour and worry. It has been used to assess the impacts of different hypoglycaemic events such as severe, moderate and mild hypoglycaemic episodes on fear of hypoglycaemia (33). A specific benefit to the HFS is that it may be able to identify participants who are likely to maintain high blood glucose levels, thus aiding understanding of potential reasons for poor glycaemic control.

    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ measures treatment satisfaction which refers to an individual's subjective appraisal of their experience of treatment, including ease of use, side effects and efficacy. Improvements in satisfaction are not necessarily accompanied by improvements in QoL; treatment satisfaction can be high despite diabetes having a negative impact on QoL, which is why it is important to measure both separately.

    <measure>Emotional Wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) measures anxiety on one subscale and depression on another through the use of 7 questions for each characteristic. It is important to measure emotional wellbeing in the trial as participants may find it easier to manage their condition after DAFNE education or with one of the treatments. This might have a substantial effect on their emotional wellbeing that the QoL measures are not sensitive enough to pick up.
