    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a biphosphonate (tiludronic acid, Skelid®,
      Sanofi-Aventis) in the treatment of inner ear involvement in advanced otosclerosis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Otosclerosis is a bone dystrophy localized to middle and inner ears with unknown etiology. It
      principally concerns adult patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Women present with this
      disease 2 times more frequently than men. Family cases are observed in 50% with a dominant
      autosomal transmission and low penetrance (40%). In its early stages, the disease is mainly
      located at the stapediovestibular joint leading to its ankylosis and a conductive hearing
      loss. In its advanced stages, the lesions extend around the cochlea and vestibule, induce a
      sensorineural hearing loss which can progress to severe and profound deafness, and prolonged
      balance disorders. On CT-scan, disease foci show a demineralization. Their density is
      inversely correlated to the hearing loss. In early stage, hearing function is currently
      rehabilitated by conventional hearing aids or surgery. In advanced forms, cochlear
      involvement is not accessible to surgery, and rehabilitation is insured by he hearing aids or
      cochlear implants. Vestibular dysfunction is dealt with by physiotherapy or symptomatic
      treatment. Drugs with anabolic activity in bone, such as sodium fluoride and etidronate
      (first generation bisphosphonate, Didronel ®), appear to reduce the hearing loss and to
      increase the radiological density of disease foci. However, their efficacy is low and poorly
      documented. Their effect on vestibular function is unknown.

      Moreover, ototoxicity has been reported for etidronate. New biphosphonates such as tiludronic
      acid (Skelid ®) have a significantly more potent inhibition of bone resorption and do not
      have an ototoxic effect. They have been used for the treatment or the prevention of
      postmenopausal osteoporosis and in Paget's disease with mild to moderate adverse effects in
      the majority of cases.
