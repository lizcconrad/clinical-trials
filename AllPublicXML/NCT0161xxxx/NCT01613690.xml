    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects age 18 to 70 years of age inclusive.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using two acceptable methods of
             contraception, (e.g., intra-uterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom,
             diaphragm plus condom, etc.), from the time of screening and for the duration of the
             study, through study completion.

          -  Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body
             mass index (BMI) within the range of 17 to 35 kg/m2.

          -  Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study. Understand and sign the written informed consent

          -  For renal insufficient subjects only - Subjects must have stable renal disease without
             evidence of renal progressive disease (for the purpose of this study stable renal
             disease will be defined as no significant change for 12 weeks).

          -  For health subjects only - A serum creatinine within the normal range and an eGFR &gt;80
             mL/min/1.73 m2.

          -  For health subjects only - Matched to at least one renal impaired subjects undergoing
             study by age (±5 years), sex and weight (±10% BMI).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Smokers will be defined as
             any subject who reports tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL. If
             non-smoking subject are too difficult to recruit, smokers may be allowed to
             participate in the study provided they commit to smoke no more than 10 cigarettes/day
             during the days of PK-assessment

          -  For healthy subjects, use of any prescription drugs, herbal and
             fitness/bodybuilding/athletic performance-enhancing supplements, within four (4) weeks
             prior to initial dosing, and/or over-the-counter (OTC) medication, dietary supplements
             (vitamins included) within two (2) weeks prior to initial dosing

          -  Recent (within the last three [3] years) and/or recurrent history of autonomic
             dysfunction (e.g., recurrent episodes of fainting (unless related to water withdrawal
             during dialysis), palpitations, etc).

          -  Recent (within the last three [3] years) and/or recurrent history of acute or chronic
             bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             treated or not treated).

          -  History of multiple and recurring allergies or allergy to the investigational
             compound/compound class being used in this study.

          -  Total WBC count which falls outside the range of 3000-12,000/μL, or platelets
             &lt;100,000/μl at screening.

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
             blot) test result.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
