  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Major depression will become the second most important cause of disability in
      2020. Computerised cognitive-behaviour therapy could be an efficacious and cost-effective
      option for its treatment. No studies on cost-effectiveness of low intensity vs self-guided
      psychotherapy have been carried out.

      AIM: To assess the efficacy of low intensity vs self-guided psychotherapy for major
      depression in the Spanish health system.

      METHODS: The study is made up of 3 phases: 1.- Development of a computerised
      cognitive-behaviour therapy for depression tailored to Spanish health system. 2.- Multicenter
      controlled, randomized study: A sample (N=450 patients) with mild/moderate depression
      recruited in primary care. They should have internet availability at home, not receive any
      previous psychological treatment, and not suffer from any other severe somatic or
      psychological disorder. They will be allocated to one of 3 treatments: a) Low intensity
      Internet-delivered psychotherapy + improved treatment as usual (ITAU) by GP, b) Self-guided
      Internet-delivered psychotherapy + ITAU or c) ITAU. Patients will be diagnosed with MINI
      psychiatric interview. Main outcome variable will be Beck Depression Inventory. It will be
      also administered EuroQol 5D (quality of life) and Client Service Receipt Inventory (consume
      of health and social services). Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 12 months. An
      intention to treat and a per protocol analysis will be performed.

    <description>The following socio-demographic data will be collected: gender, age, marital status (single, married/relationship, separated/divorced, and widowed), education (years of education), occupation, economical level (in relation with Spanish minimum monthly salary that at the moment of the study was 640â‚¬).</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D - Spanish version)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Generic instrument of health-related quality of life. It has two parts: part 1 records self-reported problems in each of five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain is divided into three levels of severity corresponding to no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. Values range from 1 (best health state) to 0 (death). Part 2 records the subject's self-assessed health on a VAS, a 10 cm vertical line on which the best and worst imaginable health states score 100 and 0, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Service Receipt Inventory - adapted (CSRI - Spanish version)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire for collecting information about use of healthcare and social care services and other economic impacts (such as time off work due to illness). The variant used in this study was designed to collect retrospective data on service utilization during the previous months after the last assessment. Data on baseline assess the previous three months before inclusion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>OASIS consists of 5 items that measure the frequency and severity of anxiety, as well as level of avoidance, work/ school/home interference, and social interference associated with anxiety. The instructions orient the respondent to considerate wide range of anxiety symptoms (e.g., panic attacks, worries, flashbacks) when answering the questions, and the time frame is &quot;over the past week&quot;. Respondents select among five different response options for each item, which are coded 0-4 and summed to obtain a total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS consists of 20 items that evaluate two independent dimensions: positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). The range for each scale (10 items on each) is 10 to 50. The instrument's psychometric properties are quite satisfactory. It has a validated Spanish version.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility/expectancy questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is a quick and easy-to-administer scale for assessing treatment expectancy and rationale credibility. Credibility has been defined as how believable, convincing, and logical the treatment is, whereas expectancy refers to improvements that clients believe will be achieved. The aspects that address these two scales relate to: 1) treatment rationale, 2) treatment satisfaction, 3) degree to which I would recommend to a friend who had the same problem, 4) extent to which is considered to be useful in the same case, 6) extent to which the intervention would be considered aversive.</description>
