    <textblock>
      Radioembolisation is a known method for the treatment of liver tumors and or livermetastases.
      Currently small beadlets called microspheres are used that are loaded with the beta radiation
      emitting Yttrium-90. Holmium-166 microspheres have different physical characteristics
      including good visualisation in gammacameras due to the gamma emission. Because of the higher
      specific activity higher radiation doses to the liver will be used compared to the standard
      Yttrium treatment. It is hypothesized that higher doses of irradiation have an improved
      antitumor effect.

        List of inclusion criteria:

          -  1. Patients must have given written informed consent.

          -  2. Female or male aged 18 years and over.

          -  3. Diagnosis of metastatic malignancy to the liver and no detectable malignant disease
             outside the liver or diagnosis of metastatic malignancy to the liver with limited
             disease outside the liver (i.e. liver-dominant disease) defined as the sum of the
             diameters of all metastases in the liver to be more than 200% of the sum of the
             diameters of all soft tissue lesions outside the liver.

          -  4. Patient is not amenable for standard therapies (other than radioembolisation) or
             patient refuses standard therapies for reasons of toxicity

          -  5. Life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer.

          -  6. World Health Organisation (WHO) Performance status 0-2 (see Appendix III).

        List of exclusion criteria:

          1. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated at least 4 weeks prior
             to the date of the experimental treatment and stable without steroid treatment for at
             least 1 week.

          2. Radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks before the start of study therapy.

          3. The last dose of prior chemotherapy has been received less than 4 weeks prior the
             start of study therapy.

          4. Major surgery within 4 weeks, or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             study therapy.

          5. Any unresolved toxicity greater than National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0, see Appendix II) grade 2
             from previous anti-cancer therapy.

          6. Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).

          7. Glomerular filtration rate &lt;35 ml/min, determined according to the Modification of
             Diet in Renal Disease formula.

          8. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alkaline
             phosphatase (ALP) &gt; 5 x ULN.

             syndrome, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease â‰¥2 within
             3 months before entry, or presence of cardiac disease that in the opinion of the
             Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

         11. Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of child-bearing potential).

         12. Patients suffering from diseases with a increased chance of liver toxicity, such as
             primary biliary cirrhosis or xeroderma pigmentosum.

         13. Patients suffering from psychic disorders that make a comprehensive judgement
             impossible, such as psychosis, hallucinations and/or depression.

         14. Patients who are declared incompetent.

         15. Previous enrolment in the present study or previous treatment with radioembolisation.
