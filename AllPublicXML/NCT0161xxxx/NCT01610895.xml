  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of adding a strict low-residue lunch on
      the day before colonoscopy has on clinical efficacy and patient tolerability of bowel
      preparation, with patients receiving split-dose Polyethylene Glycol Based Lavage.

      The primary outcomes will be 1) quality of preparation in cleansing the colon and 2) patient
      satisfaction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients between the ages 18-74 years referred to the Forzani MacPhail Colon Cancer
      Screening Centre (CCSC) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada for colonoscopy will be considered for
      inclusion. During pre-assessments at the clinic, patients are asked to consider a general
      research consent. If they agree to that, then they will be approached for consideration of
      participating in this study and presented with an &quot;Invitation to Participate in a Research
      Study&quot; form ; the study assistant will obtain final consent if they agree. Those not
      interested in participating will simply receive their physician's standard bowel preparation
      protocol. There will be no coercion of any sort. Enrollment of participants will be performed
      with block randomizations of 2, 4, 6 and 8 by using a computer-generated table, with
      allocation concealment maintained through the use of consecutively numbered sealed envelopes.
      Colonoscopists and investigators will be blinded to allocation groups. Patients will be
      allocated to one of two groups: (1) Split dose Polyethylene Glycol Based Lavage (2L + 2L)
      with Standard dietary instructions- a low fibre diet for 4 days prior to colonoscopy and
      clear fluids after a low-fibre breakfast on the day before procedure; (2) Split dose
      Polyethylene Glycol Based Lavage (2L + 2L) with Low Fibre Lunch dietary instructions- a low
      fibre diet for 4 days prior to colonoscopy and clear fluids after a low-fibre breakfast and
      low-fibre lunch on the day before procedure

      A study assistant will assign patients to their group based on the Randomization and instruct
      them on the proper use of their assigned bowel preparation method. Patients will be given a
      tolerability questionnaire, which has been modified from a previously used questionnaire, to
      be completed once their bowel preparation is finished and before coming to the CCSC for the
      colonoscopy (included in the appendix). Patient concerns or questions regarding the
      preparation will be directed toward the study assistant or clinic nurses as opposed to their
      endoscopist, so as to avoid un-blinding the Colonoscopist. The physician performing the
      procedure will then complete an Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale, a validated Simplified Bowel
      Preparation scale and a New Bowel Prep Scale to assess colon cleanliness.

    <measure>Quality of Bowel Cleanliness</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedure is completed (1 hour time). Questionnaires are manually entered by an assistant into the study database on the same day of collection.</time_frame>
    <description>Ottawa bowel prep scale will be done by the Doctor to assess the quality of bowel cleanliness. The right, mid and rectosigmoid colon are each rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). Also a complete 3 point rating for overall colonic fluid is assessed giving an overall score range of 0-14. An excellent preperation should score 0-1, a good preparation 2-4, while scores &gt;4 would indicate progressively worsening bowel preparations. A Simplified overall cleanliness score and a New bowel prep score will be completed and compared to the Ottawa scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire given on the day of pre-screen will be collected on the day of colonoscopy, approximately 3 weeks. Patients are not followed or contacted past the day of colonoscopy.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given an anonymous tolerability questionnaire, which has been modified from a previously used questionnaire, to be completed once their bowel preparation is finished and before coming to the Centre for the Colonoscopy. The tool asks questions of patient satisfaction with preparation, ease or difficulty of completing the preparation and any side effects that have been experienced during the preparation.</description>
