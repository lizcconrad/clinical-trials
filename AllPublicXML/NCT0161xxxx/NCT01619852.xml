  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to investigate a safe and inexpensive strategy to reduce persistent
      post-surgical pain that can affect up to 60% of patients undergoing surgical procedures. It
      also seeks to investigate specific brain changes associated with the development of chronic
      pain. This may lead to the development of more specific and more effective treatments.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Perioperative systemic lidocaine reduces the incidence of chronic pain in patients
           undergoing surgical procedures.

        2. There is a specific brain morphological/function change associated with the development
           of chronic pain.
