  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the objective is to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic carriage of
      S. aureus in patients with ABSSSIs and minor cutaneous abscesses after therapy with either
      linezolid or clindamycin at 40 days after the completion of therapy. Secondarily, the
      investigators will assess the efficacy of linezolid vs. clindamycin in the empiric therapy of
      ABSSSIs and minor cutaneous abscesses, as well as the genotypic spectrum of S. aureus
      isolates causing ABSSSIs or minor cutaneous abscesses and colonization in the target patient
      population before and after therapy. Given the results of a recent study on linezolid and
      vancomycin and the investigator's own experience, it is hypothesized that persistent MRSA
      carriage will be less common after therapy with linezolid for ABSSSIs and minor cutaneous
      abscesses than it is with oral clindamycin.
