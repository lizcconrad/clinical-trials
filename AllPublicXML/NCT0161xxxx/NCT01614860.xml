  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-discharge mortality and re-hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF) affects 15% and
      30% of patients respectively, within 90 days. With over 1 million annual hospitalizations and
      a financial cost exceeding 20 billion dollars, AHF is a major public health burden. Yet no
      AHF therapy to date definitively reduces morbidity and mortality, and in stark contrast to
      heart attack patients, highly rated evidence in guidelines do not exist. Although AHF is a
      syndrome and not one disease, typical treatment of patients hospitalized with AHF suggests
      otherwise. Despite substantial differences among AHF patients, therapy is largely uniform;
      patients receive medicine to help get rid of excess volume and little else. Although decades
      of empirical use support the symptomatic benefits of traditional therapies, outcomes remain
      extremely poor. As opposed to the &quot;one-size-fits-all‟ approach used unsuccessfully to date in
      clinical trials, identification of specific AHF patient sub-groups is critical, so that
      tailored therapies can be developed and tested. Preliminary data suggests that the
      neurohormone aldosterone may be detrimental in AHF patients. Furthermore, this hormone level
      appears to rise during hospitalization. The investigators therefore propose to identify
      specific AHF patient phenotypes associated with high serum aldosterone levels to subsequently
      address the hypothesis that early aldosterone blockade continued throughout hospitalization
      will decrease re-hospitalization and mortality. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize
      that AHF patients with elevated serum aldosterone levels have a distinct phenotype compared
      to those with lower or normal aldosterone levels. Specifically, they will be older, have a
      lower systolic blood pressure, lower EF, worse renal function, higher BNP, and previous
      hospitalization for HF.

    <description>Hypothesis 2.1: The &quot;high aldosterone&quot; phenotypic profile identified in Aim 1 will be associated with high aldosterone levels on initial presentation to the ER in our prospective replication study.
Hypothesis 2.2: AHFS patients with high aldosterone levels on presentation will have increased high-sensitivity troponin release and echocardiographic markers of increased myocardial and atrial fibrosis.
Hypothesis 2.3: Repeat examination at 48 hours after initial presentation will demonstrate lack of improvement in laboratory and echocardiographic biomarkers of congestion, myocyte injury, and fibrosis in AHFS patients with high aldosterone levels, suggesting a time-sensitive component to aldosterone antagonism in AHFS.</description>
