        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ambulatory women over age 60, who are incontinent at least five times weekly for 3
             months despite correction of potentially reversible causes.

          -  urinary incontinence (urge or predominantly urge) by clinical criteria.

          -  able to accurately complete a voiding diary, to perform a 24-hour pad test under
             direction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  significant mental impairment [mini mental status exam (MMSE) â‰¤ 20)

          -  urethral obstruction

          -  history of bladder cancer

          -  spinal cord lesions

          -  multiple sclerosis

          -  pelvic radiation

          -  interstitial cystitis

          -  artificial sphincter implant

          -  expected to have changes in medications/doses during the trial

          -  medically unstable

          -  Patients with factors that could cause transient UI [e.g., current urinary tract
             infection (UTI), acute confusion] will be treated in concert with the subject's
             primary care provider and considered for enrollment if their UI persists.

          -  conditions that require endocarditis prophylaxis (such as heart valve problems or
             bacterial endocarditis)
