      Study Rationale: The purpose of this study is to investigate which pain mechanisms in
      subjects with painful knee osteoarthritis can be affected by the peripheral and central
      actions of etoricoxib as compared to placebo during a 4 week treatment therapy period.

      The present study will utilize a set of quantitative mechanism based pain biomarkers to
      assess peripheral and central pain manifestations in OA and the influence of etoricoxib on
      those individual manifestations in an attempt to understand and explain clinical pain
      alleviation.

      Study Treatment: Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 sequences of treatment: Sequence
      1 (60 mg/day etoricoxib followed by placebo) or Sequence 2 (placebo followed by 60 mg/day
      etoricoxib). The two treatment periods of 4 weeks each are separated by a washout period of
      at least 6 days.

      Primary Objective: To assess which pain mechanisms are modulated by 60 mg daily
      administration of etoricoxib compared to placebo in subjects with osteoarthritic (OA) knee
      pain during two treatment periods of 4-weeks each.

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate if changes in any of the mechanism based experimental pain
      assessment parameters can explain changes in clinical outcome parameters.

      To profile drug responders- versus non-responders based on pain mechanisms involved.

      To investigate if change in inflammatory, bone and cartilage related bio-chemical biomarkers
      can explain changes in either experimental or clinical pain parameters.

             any protocol required procedures.

          2. Male or female between 40 and 75 years of age. Females of childbearing potential must
             have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening.

          3. Body weight &gt;40 kg and &lt;150 kg with a body mass index (BMI) between 19-40 kg/m2
             inclusive.

             of Rheumatology modified clinical classification criteria (Altman et al, 1986) and
             verified radiologically as Kellgren-Lawrence grade I, II or III (Kellgren and
             Lawrence, 1957) at the index knee. The clinical diagnosis of OA will be confirmed by
             the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification of idiopathic OA based
             upon the following criteria (index knee):

               1. Knee pain for at least 14 days per month for the 3 months before study entry.

               2. Osteophytes (with radiographic evidence).

               3. And at least 1 of the following 3 conditions: Age &gt;50, or morning stiffness &lt;30
                  minutes, or crepitus.

               4. X-ray images of the knee joints are available confirming OA. X-ray images older
