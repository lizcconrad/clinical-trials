      temsirolimus in combination with pioglitazone, etoricoxib and metronomic low-dose
      trofosfamide versus dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with advanced melanoma

      Phase I: To determine the dose of temsirolimus to be used in phase II part of the study

      Phase II:

      To determine overall survival Secondary objectives

        -  To evalulate response rate

        -  To evaluate time to progression (TTP)

        -  To evalulate time to partial response (time to PR or better)(TPR)

        -  To evaluate quality of life

        -  To evaluate tolerability and safety
