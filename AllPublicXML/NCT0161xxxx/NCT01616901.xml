    <textblock>
      The decision to extubate a patient after acute respiratory failure is based on clinical
      observation and measurement of pulmonary mechanics. Current extubation criteria(tidal volume,
      respiratory frequency...) lack of specificity. The best way to evaluate and predict patients
      breathing abilities after extubation is to challenge him to a spontaneous breathing trial
      (SBT) with endotracheal tube in place immediately before extubation to predict the patient's
      ability to breathe spontaneously after extubation. The intention is to approximate, while the
      patient is still intubated, the work of breathing that will be required of the patient after
      extubation. Different approaches of ventilatory settings are currently used for the
      preextubation SBT, whether pressure support ventilation (PSV), continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP), or spontaneous ventilation through an endotracheal tube (T piece), all
      supported by literature with different benefits. To the investigators knowledge, few studies
      define which mode of ventilation most closely approximates the work of breathing during
      spontaneous respiration after extubation, and none have studied a specific population of
      obese patient in respiratory weaning. The main objective of the investigators study is to
      determine, between five different SBT, which one is the best to approximate the work of
      breathing of obese patient after extubation.

      Patients : 20 obese patients (defined by BMI over 30 kg/m2) ongoing for spontaneous breathing
      trial and clinically ready for immediate extubation will be enrolled after obtaining their
      consents. Material : An oeso-gastric double balloon catheter will be inserted in order to
      record oesophageal and gastric pressure and to calculate Work of Breathing and Pressure Time
      Product. Pulmonary Volumes will be recorded by a pneumotachograph. Functional Residual
      Capacity will be recorded thanks to the azote double dilution technique used by the Engstr√∂m
      respiratory care station.Study Protocol : When physicians in charge of the patient decided
      that the patient is ready to be weaned and to have a SBT before extubation, the patient will
      be included in the study. Before extubation, patients will be placed under 5 different
      spontaneous breathing trials conditions in the same order : 7 cm H2O continuous positive
      airway pressure, T piece,7 cmH2O of pressure support, 0 cmH20 of pressure support and 7 cm
      H2O pressure support ventilation with 7 cmH20 of end expiratory pressure. Each trial will be
      performed fo 20 min. Between 2 spontaneous breathing trials, and before extubation, patient
      will receive a 10 minutes period of recovery to their respiratory baseline, defined by the
      respiratory settings before the spontaneous breathing trials.The last step, after extubation,
      will consist in recording the data after 15 minutes, when patient's breathing pattern appears
      calm.
