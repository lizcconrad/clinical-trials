  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Trident Tritanium acetabular component of a total hip prosthesis is a new developed
      uncemented acetabular component. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT) the tritanium cup
      will be compared with the Trident HA acetabular component in two equal sized groups. The
      Symax HA coated stem will be used as femoral component in both groups.

      Study Objectives:

        -  The primary objective is to determine the prosthetic migration of the uncemented
           acetabular and femoral total hip components using model based RSA technique

        -  Secondary objectives are on one hand to assess clinical outcome on the other hand
           assessing patient satisfaction in both groups using Harris Hip Score, Oxford Hip Score,
           WOMAC, and EQ-5D questionnaires

        -  Tertiary objective is to assess bone remodeling of the uncemented acetabular components
           and the HA-coated Symax hip stem using QCT derived from usinf F18-fluoride PET in a
           cohort of 12 consecutive patients of this RCT

      A total of 50 patients will be enrolled in this RCT divided into two equal groups. Patients
      have to fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      All evaluations will be done pre-operatively with 2 weeks before surgery, and after surgery
      at 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 1 and 2 years.
