      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving cells called natural killer
      (NK) cells after receiving a chemotherapy treatment and a UCB transplant can improve response
      in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or MM. The safety of this treatment and whether NK cells
      can lessen the risk of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) will also be studied.

      Patients with a disease that is CD20-positive will also receive rituximab on this study.

      The first 3 patients enrolled on this study will not receive NK cells but will receive a cord
      blood transplant.

      UCB and NK cells may be able to kill leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma cells that remain in your
      body after chemotherapy treatment.

      The UCB cells are also designed to increase blood production and strengthen your immune
      system.

      This is an investigational study. Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, melphalan, lenalidomide, and
      the UCB transplant procedure are all FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of CLL. Cyclophosphamide is approved for the treatment of CLL. Fludarabine is
      approved for treatment of refractory CLL. Melphalan is approved for the treatment of multiple
      myeloma (MM) but has been used in transplant conditioning regimens. Lenalidomide is approved
      for the treatment of low risk myelodysplastic syndromes and for MM. Rituximab is approved for
      the treatment of CD20 positive B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (in
      combination with chemotherapy).

      The use of NK cells in patients is investigational.

      Up to 13 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Pregnancy Tests:

      If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (1 teaspoon) pregnancy test within
      10-14 days and 24 hours before taking lenalidomide, and then 28 days after your last dose of
      lenalidomide. Lenalidomide must be discontinued right away if you miss a period, have an
      abnormal pregnancy test, or have abnormal menstrual bleeding.

      Study Drug Administration and Study Procedures:

      Two (2) UCB units have been selected to give to you. If you are enrolled after the third
      patient is enrolled, one of the selected units will have NK cells separated out from it. The
      NK cells are separated from the UCB unit using a machine called the CliniMACS system. This
      machine uses certain kinds of cells and antibody-coated magnetic beads to separate the NK
      cells. The separated NK cells will then be &quot;grown&quot; to increase their numbers before they are
      given to you. The drug aldesleukin (interleukin-2) will be added to the NK cells in attempt
      to improve their function. The aldesleukin will be washed out of the NK cells before they are
      given to you. The second UCB unit will be given to you without any NK cell separation.

      For UCB transplant schedules, the days before the transplant are called minus days (Day -2,
      Day -1, etc.). The day of the transplant is called Day 0. The days after the transplant are
      called plus days (Day +1, Day +2, etc.).

      You will receive 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatments that will be chosen by your doctor. The
      treatment will be selected based on your disease status.

      Treatment Plan #1:

      On Day -8, you will be admitted to the hospital and you will begin receiving fluids by vein
      to hydrate you. The fluids will be given as a continuous (non-stop) infusion until you leave
      the hospital. If your disease is CD20-positive, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day
      -9. Your study doctor will discuss this with you.

      On Days -8 through -2, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day. The capsules should
      be taken at around the same time every day with a cup (8 oz. ) of water. Do not break, chew,
      or open the lenalidomide capsules. If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you
      remember on the same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular
      dose the next scheduled day. Do not double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose.
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical
      care if needed and contact the study staff right away.

      If your disease is CD20-positive, you will receive rituximab by vein over about 6 hours on
      Day -8.

      On Days -7 through -4, you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 1 hour.

      On Day -4, you will receive melphalan by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Day -2, you will receive the NK cells by vein over about 30 minutes (first 3 patients will
      not receive the NK cells).

      On Day -1, you will not receive any study drugs or NK cells.

      On Day 0, you will receive the UCB transplant.

      Treatment Plan #2:

      On Day -8, you will be admitted to the hospital and you will begin receiving fluids by vein
      to hydrate you. The fluids will be given as a continuous (non-stop) infusion until you leave
      the hospital. If your disease is CD20-positive, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day
      -9. Your study doctor will discuss this with you.

      If your disease is CD20-positive, you will receive rituximab by vein over about 6 hours on
      Day -8.

      On Days -7 through -4, you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 1 hour.

      On Day -7, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours and mesna by vein over 30
      minutes. Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by
      cyclophosphamide.

      On Days -7 through -2, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day. The capsules should
      be taken at around the same time every day with a cup (8 oz. ) of water. Do not break, chew,
      or open the lenalidomide capsules. If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you
      remember on the same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular
      dose the next scheduled day. Do not double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose.
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical
      care if needed and contact the study staff right away.

      On Day -3, you will receive total body irradiation (TBI). TBI involves the delivery of high
      doses of radiation designed to destroy cancer cells and/or lower the immune system in order
      to lower the risk of the body rejecting the new stem cells.

      On Day -2, you will receive the NK cells by vein over about 30 minutes (first 3 patients will
      not receive the NK cells).

      On Day -1, you will not receive any study drugs or NK cells.

      On Day 0, you will receive the UCB transplant.

      Supportive Drugs:

      You will be given drugs to help prevent side effects. The study staff will tell you about
      these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      Starting on Day 0, you will begin receiving filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the
      skin 1 time every day until your white blood count begins to recover. Filgrastim is designed
      to make white blood cells grow. This may help to fight infections.

      Starting on Day -2, you will begin receiving tacrolimus by vein as a non-stop infusion until
      you are able to take it by mouth. You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day for
      about 6 months. After that, your tacrolimus dose may be reduced if you do not have GVHD. Your
      doctor will discuss this with you.

      Starting on Day -3, you will begin taking mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) by mouth 3 times a day
      with food. If you are not able to take the tablet by mouth, you will receive MMF by vein over
      2 hours, 2 times a day. If you do not have GVHD at Day 100, the dose of MMF will be reduced.
      If you miss a dose of MMF you should tell your study doctor. You should not try to make up
      the dose later.

      Study Tests:

      You will stay in the hospital for about 2-4 weeks after the UCB transplant. While you are in
      the hospital, you will be checked for any side effects you may have and blood (about 2
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests whenever the doctor feels it is necessary.

      After you are released from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to be monitored
      for infections and other transplant-related side effects until about Day 100. During this
      time, you will return to the clinic 1 time each week and the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 4 weeks after the transplant (around Day 42), the following tests and procedures will
      be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for side effects,
           including GVHD. The blood will also be used to check how the UCB is being &quot;received&quot; by
           your body.

      At about 3, 6, and 12 months after the UCB transplant, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests and to check for
           side effects, including GVHD. The blood will also be used to check how the UCB is being
           &quot;received&quot; by your body.

        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be
           having.

        -  You may have a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the disease if the doctor
           thinks it is necessary. To collect a bone marrow biopsy, an area of the hip or other
           site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn
           through a large needle.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed the 12-month study
      visit.

      You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if
      your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if you are unable to follow the study
      directions. You will also be taken off study if you are unable to receive the UCB transplant,
      if you need medical treatment that is not allowed in this study, or if you have any
      infections.

      You must talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. It may be
      life-threatening to leave the study after you have started receiving study drugs but before
      you have had the UCB transplant.
