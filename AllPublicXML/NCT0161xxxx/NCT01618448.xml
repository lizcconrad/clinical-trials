      Interventional, phase III, 2-arm parallel group, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized
      1:1, double-blind study, comparing Tolvaptan and placebo in hospitalized HF patients with
      signs or symptoms of congestion at the time of randomization in spite of standard
      therapy.This study intends to demonstrate that a repeated 4-day treatment with Tolvaptan in
      addition to standard of care (SOC) is superior to SOC alone for the treatment of clinical
      relevant cardiac-induced volume retention parameters in patients hospitalized for worsening
      HF initially treated with conventional therapy including diuretics.
