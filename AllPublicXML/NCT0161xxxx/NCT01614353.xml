  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Patients can easily be overwhelmed, confused and many times don't fully understand their
      need for new medications, or when the dosages are to be administered&quot; (patient research
      partner quote). The long-term goal of this study is to refine medication science by
      developing patient-centered assessment, monitoring and management guidelines for patients and
      health professionals. The objective is to advance knowledge about the medication-taking
      perspectives, experiences, and behaviors of older adults with multiple chronic medical
      conditions (MCMC) to inform future research related to patient-centered medication
      prescribing, monitoring and management. This pilot study addresses the following PCORI
      interest area: &quot;evaluating methods that can be used to assess the patient perspective when
      researching behaviors and choices within the patient's control that may influence outcomes.&quot;
      The rationale that underlies the proposed study is that medication-taking practices are
      wholly within patients' control, and are foundational to reducing complications and improving
      outcomes for those with MCMC. To meet the overall objective of this application, the
      following specific aims will be pursued: 1) identify perceptions and behaviors surrounding
      the medication-taking process of older adults with MCMC; and 2) generate an interpretation of
      the meaning of medication-taking among older adults with MCMC. To achieve these aims, data
      will be obtained in &quot;real time&quot; from patients (N=30) receiving a new prescription using smart
      phone technology. The smart phones will include prompts to help participants record thoughts
      about medication use throughout the day for 30 days. Findings from electronic diaries will be
      logged, analyzed and qualitatively analyzed. Some patients (n=15) will provide in-depth
      hermeneutic interviews to provide rich descriptions and interpretive commentary about the
      experience of receiving a new medication prescription. The objective is to uncover previously
      unidentified areas of common experience in older persons with multiple chronic conditions who
      have received a new prescription. Common experiences and patterns of influences, that are
      often surprising or unexpected, will be categorized and assessed. The expected outcomes of
      this pilot study are improved knowledge of medication-taking perceptions, experiences, and
      practices of older adults with MCMCâ€”knowledge that is critical to advance patient-centered
      medication science.

    <description>Data will be obtained in &quot;real time&quot; in that patients will audio record thoughts as they arise in the course of each day using an electronic device, over 30 consecutive days, and will answer questions related to medication use. Findings from end of day prompts will be logged using tables that compare participant demographic characteristics, whether or not the new medication or all prescribed medication was taken, and self-assessed level of wellness.</description>

    <time_frame>2 Interviews: 1 at enrollment and 1 at 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>In-depth hermeneutic interviews and interpretive phenomenological analyses will be conducted for 15 of the 30 enrolled participants. Patterns and themes that capture common experiences revealed in these data provide language for further investigation and new discussion in areas that have been studied traditionally. Such findings are the characteristic &quot;phenomenological contribution&quot; of qualitative research. Interpretive commentary in the context of social and cultural evidence and extant literature on medication use will be generated.</description>
