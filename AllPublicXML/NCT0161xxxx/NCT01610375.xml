      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, safety and accuracy of a telephone
      follow-up for women previously treatment for endometrial cancer.

      To achieve this aim, potentially eligible women attending the Queensland Centre for
      Gynaecological Cancer (QCGC) outpatient clinic for review following previous treatment for
      endometrial cancer will be recruited by this study. The study aims to recruit all new
      patients as well as all patients who return to QCGC for their follow-up and who had treatment
      within the previous 2 years.

      The proposed project will involve generation of an evidence-based checklist of signs and
      symptoms of disease recurrence from a thorough literature review. The generated symptom
      checklist will be pilot tested and the refined symptom checklist will be used to follow study
      participants over a period of 12 months.

      During the follow-up period, the basic standard of follow-up after primary treatment for
      endometrial cancer at the QCGC, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH)will not be
      altered; however, the study participants will be interview via telephone 2 to 5 days prior to
      their scheduled review dates.

      The main outcome measure will be the estimated recurrence rate as derived from the telephone
      assessment and this will be compared to the clinically detected recurrences as recorded in
      patients' medical files.

      It is hypothesized, that the telephone follow-up will identify 90% of all recurrences
      correctly that are later confirmed during the clinical follow-up.

      In addition to the main outcome, we will also assess patients' satisfaction with each of the
      follow-up programs, whether or not lifestyle behaviours were queried and support offered to
      improve wellbeing.

      The focus of the study is;

        1. To generate an evidence-based checklist of signs and symptoms of recurrence of
           endometrial cancer.

        2. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of a telephone follow-up compared to the
           current clinic-based follow-up in the detection of recurrence of endometrial cancer.

        3. To determine patients' satisfaction with the clinic and telephone follow-up.

        4. To assess patients' self reported well being (physical activity, smoking, diet, anxiety,
           depression and quality of life).

      The proposed project will involve generation of an evidence-based checklist of signs and
      symptoms of recurrence. The generated symptom checklist will be used to follow study
      participants over a period of 12 months.

      During the follow-up period, patients' routine clinic follow-up schedules will not be
      altered, however; the study participants will be interviewed via telephone 2 to 5 days prior
      to their scheduled clinic visits dates. The checklist of signs and symptoms generated by this
      study will form the basis for this interview.

      In addition, we will also enquire about the participant's wellbeing and provide resources on
      physical activity, diet and other life style behaviours and supportive care when needed.

      The data analysis will include determining:

      i. Sensitivity- Proportion of those with the condition who have a positive test.

      ii. Specificity-Proportion of those without the condition who have a negative test.

      iii. Positive predictive value (PV+) - Proportion of those with a positive test who have the
      condition.

      iv. Negative predictive value (PV-) - Proportion of those with a negative test who do not
      have the condition.

      Overall accuracy of the symptom checklist compared to the clinic-based follow-up program will
      also be calculated.

    <description>Women previously treated for endometrial cancer will be recruited into one study group and continue to be followed per the current routine clinic follow-up. However, an additional program (telephone follow-up) will be offered in parallel to the current clinic follow-up. Outcomes obtained from the telephone follow-up will be compared with the current clinical assessment.</description>

    <description>This is a non-randomised observational study to assess the value of a symptom checklist to detect recurrence in women with endometrial cancer. Women will be telephoned using an evidence-based symptom checklist in parallel to the standard clinic-based follow-up. The researcher will call the participants 2 to 5 days prior to their scheduled clinic review dates to enquire about the presence of symptoms which may be indicative of disease recurrence. In addition, the researcher will also enquire about the participants' wellbeing and provide standard lifestyle resource on physical activity, diet and other lifestyle behaviours and supportive care when needed.</description>
