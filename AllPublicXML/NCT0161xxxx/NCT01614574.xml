  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB)
      that leads to progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macrophages and subsequent
      tissue and organ damage; typically of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain. The disease
      has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based on the presence or absence of neurological
      symptoms and severity of neurological disease. Type 1 Gaucher disease affects an estimated
      30,000 persons worldwide and is the most common. Type 1 Gaucher disease does not involve the
      central nervous system. Patients with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological
      deterioration, which leads to early death. Those with type 3 disease typically display a more
      sub-acute neurological course, with later onset and slower progression.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of every other week dosing of
      velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients with Gaucher disease.

      Velaglucerase alfa has been developed and approved as an enzyme replacement therapy for Type
      1 Gaucher disease.

      Gaucher disease is an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCB)
      that leads to progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macrophages and subsequent
      tissue and organ damage; typically of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain.

      Gaucher disease has been designated in the list of Specified Rare and Intractable Diseases by
      Specified Disease Treatment Research Program of Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)
      as one of &quot;lysosomal storage diseases&quot; since 2001. Gaucher disease is also designated in the
      Medical Aid Program for Specified Categories of Chronic Pediatric Diseases.

      The prevalence of mutations and the phenotype of patients with Gaucher disease in Japan
      differs from that in non-Japanese populations. Some patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in
      Japan have more severe and progressive disease compared to non-Japanese patients and the
      disease is characterized by an earlier onset of symptoms.

      Velaglucerase alfa, a highly-purified form of the naturally occurring enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase, has been developed as an enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease
      for the symptoms (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and bone
      manifestation).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of every other week dosing of
      velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients (naive or previously treated with imiglucerase) 2
      years of age and older with Gaucher disease.
