  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DTRAX Graft is used to relieve nerve pressure in the neck in order to provide relief for
      Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease. This study is being conducted to determine the
      effectiveness of the graft, and to find out whether or not it provides better results or
      faster healing than traditional ways of performing surgery for Cervical Degenerative Disc
      Disease.
