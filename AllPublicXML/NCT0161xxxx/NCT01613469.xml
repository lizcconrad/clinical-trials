    <textblock>
      This study will assess the complete clinical response (no clinical evidence of remaining
      disease or recurrence of disease)in rectal cancer that arises within 3 inches of the anal
      opening after radiation therapy given at the same time as chemotherapy over a 6 week period,
      followed by chemotherapy alone given three times over an additional 9 weeks. Follow-up begins
      with an examination at the end of treatment (at 15 weeks), with ongoing follow-up every 4-6
      weeks for one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that low rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (54Gy
      concurrent with 3 cycles of 5-FU/Leucovorin) followed by 3 additional cycles of
      5FU/Leucovorin, followed by close follow-up (every 4-6 weeks for one year)has had good
      success in achieving complete clinical response, avoiding surgical intervention. If at
      follow-up remaining disease is found or if there is recurrent disease, surgery can be
      performed.
