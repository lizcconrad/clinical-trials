      The purpose of this study is to evaluate outcomes of an established procedure for treatment
      of kidney stones that are present within the inner aspect of the kidney. This procedure is
      called flexible ureteroscopy, which involves placing a small camera through the urethra while
      anesthetized (asleep), up the ureter (the tube connecting kidney and bladder) and into the
      kidney to the kidney stone. Then, the stone is broken into tiny fragments using a small laser
      called a Holmium laser. While this treatment is a well-established option for treatment of
      these stones, there are several different techniques used to help eliminate them from the
      kidney. Some urologists treat the stone by a method called &quot;active&quot; extraction whereby the
      ureteroscope is passed back and forth into the kidney to remove all visible stone fragments.
      Others use a method called &quot;dusting&quot; whereby the stones are broken into tiny fragments or
      &quot;dust&quot; with the intention that achieving such a small stone size will allow the stones to
      pass spontaneously. There has not been a systematic and rigorous comparison of these
      techniques in terms of treatment outcomes. By collecting information on the success of
      treatment, the investigators hope to provide benchmark data for future studies of kidney
      stone treatment and improve the care of all patients who need surgery for their kidney
      stones.

      The investigators hypothesize that the stone free rate for renal stone(s) 5-15 mm is around
      90% and that the stone clearance rate with be 20% higher in those patients that undergo
      complete stone fragment extraction versus those that undergo stone dusting (residual
      fragments &lt; 2mm).

      To date, there is inadequate literature to confidently determine the ideal technique of stone
      extraction during ureteroscopy, an endourologic procedure for the treatment of kidney stones.
      The goals of ureteroscopy for intrarenal stones are to fragment stones and minimize residual
      fragments while doing so in a safe and expeditious way with minimal harm to the patient.
      Options for the treatment of intrarenal stones consist of using a basket to pull them out or
      a laser to break them into small fragments. When stones are deemed too large to be basketed
      primarily, the standard preference in ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy is use of the
      Holmium:YAG laser which can effectively break stones into fragments small enough to remove or
      pass spontaneously.

      There is no consensus on how to achieve optimal stone clearance once the primary stone is
      fragmented with lithotripsy. Many urologists choose to &amp;quot;dust&amp;quot; the stone by breaking
      it into tiny fragments &amp;lt; 1 - 2 mm in size with the assumption that stone fragments of such
      a small size will pass spontaneously after surgery. This can theoretically decrease operative
      times and lower risk of ureteral trauma by minimizing repetitive introduction and removal of
      the ureteroscope. Others choose to actively extract each possible stone fragment during the
      procedure thereby increasing the immediate stone-free outcome.

      Active extraction however typically increases costs as it requires use of a basket or grasper
      and ureteral access sheath. To date, only one prospective, randomized study has addressed the
      practice of active extraction vs spontaneous passage, the results of which suggested higher
      rates of residual stone fragments, hospital readmissions and need for ancillary procedures
      when stones were not actively extracted (8). This study was criticized for not following a
      standardized operative protocol and not reporting several important outcomes including stone
      composition. Additionally, this study used semirigid ureteroscopy, specifically addressed
      ureteral rather than intrarenal stones, and did not follow a &quot;dusting&quot; protocol assuring
      minimal size of residual fragments.

      Complete eradication of stone fragments is one of the primary outcomes of ureteroscopy as
      residual renal stone fragments after ureteroscopy have been shown to lead to a subsequent
      stone event in approximately 20% of cases(9). However, maximizing eradication of stone
      fragments must not come at the expense of the patient. For this reason it is important to
      consider the operative variables associated with the different techniques employed to clear
      stone during such procedures.

      For example, an average of nearly three times as much laser energy was used to fragment the
      stone into tiny pieces compared to active extraction (8). Conversely, active extraction of
      stone fragments requires introducing and removing the ureteroscope through the ureter a
      greater number of times in order to facilitate stone removal; which generally requires use of
      a ureteral access sheath, a treatment with its own associated risk.(10). The short term and
      long term differences resulting from use of these techniques is currently unknown.

    <description>To assess for stone-free rate using K.U.B. (kidney-ureter-bladder) plain radiograph and renal ultrasound. If there is a discrepancy in follow up imaging between the presence of residual stones or fragments between the KUB and renal ultrasound, the KUB will be considered the reference standard for small fragments less than 4mm unless the stone composition is uric acid. If fragments 5 mm or larger exist it will be up to the discretion of the surgeon to order a CT to better delineate the presence of residual stones and their impact on the clinical management of that patient.</description>
