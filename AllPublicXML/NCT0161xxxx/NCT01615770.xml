      Our primary goal is to examine the effectiveness of a multi-factor maintenance treatment
      strategy in promoting longer-term smoking abstinence. The investigators will also conduct
      secondary analyses of mediators and moderators of treatment response.

      400 adult smokers will be randomized. Our primary goal is to examine the effectiveness of a
      multi-factor maintenance treatment strategy in promoting longer-term smoking abstinence. All
      smokers will receive the same &quot;Acute Phase Treatment&quot; that combines nicotine patch, bupropion
      and intensive self-regulatory skills training. Nicotine patches will be provided for 8 weeks
      and bupropion and skills training will be provided for of 9 weeks. Participants will then
      enter a &quot;Maintenance Treatment Phase&quot; during which half (n=200) will receive three
      individualized relapse prevention training sessions spread over a 12 week period. They will
      also receive 12 weeks of self-administered RPT administered via written treatment modules.
      Finally, telephone counseling will be provided in conjunction with an Interactive Voice
      Response system (IVR) that will allow early detection of smoking &quot;slips&quot; and rapid response
      by treatment staff. The other half (n=200) will be assigned to a control condition that
      consists of three counselor-led sessions of &quot;supportive therapy&quot; spread over a 12 week
      period.

    <description>All study participants received 8 weeks of cognitive and behavioral cessation and relapse prevention skills training (CBT) and nicotine patch therapy combined with 9 weeks of bupropion SR therapy. Following open-label, this group received general supportive therapy delivered via four telephone calls made to participants over a 12-week period.</description>

    <description>All study participants received 8 weeks of cognitive and behavioral cessation and relapse prevention skills training (CBT) and nicotine patch therapy combined with 9 weeks of bupropion SR therapy. Following open-label treatment, half the participants received an additional 12 weeks of CBT that combined clinic-based skills training sessions, voicemail monitoring and telephone counseling</description>

    <description>At each clinic session, staff met with participants individually for 30 minutes to develop cognitive and behavioral skills to resist urges to smoke. Staff used self-efficacy questionnaires to assess participants' confidence in their abilities to resist urges to smoke in specific situations and behavioral worksheets to help participants articulate treatment plans to be used in managing their behavior in these situations without smoking. Those participants randomized to extended CBT continued to work with treatment staff individually on the development and use of cognitive and behavioral cessation and relapse prevention skills. Treatment sessions, lasting approximately 30 minutes, were conducted at the San Jose clinic site at weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20.</description>
