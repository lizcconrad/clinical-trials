  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized placebo controlled pilot study comparing the efficacy
      and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA versus saline injections to the cheek region in patients
      with rosacea.

      The pilot study will enroll and treat a total of 10 subjects who present with rosacea of the
      cheek area. Upon study entry, subjects will be randomized to receive treatment with
      incobotulinumtoxinA or bacteriostatic saline to the cheek area. Study treatment will be
      prepared by an unblinded designee and both Physician Investigator (PI) and subject will
      remain blinded for the duration of the study. At the 16 week visit, control subjects will
      enter the rescue arm portion of the study and all study subjects will receive treatment with
      incobotulinumtoxinA to the cheek areas.
