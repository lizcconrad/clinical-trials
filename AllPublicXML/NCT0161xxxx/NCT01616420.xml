      The main purpose of this implementation science study is to find out if providing aPS at 18
      different Ministry of Health (MOH) VCT clinics in Kenya works and is cost-effective. This
      would enable co-investigators in the Kenyan MOH to justify funding to scale-up these
      services.

      The primary aim of the study is to find out whether providing aPS to sexual partners of newly
      tested HIV-infected individuals can result in more sexual partners getting counseled and HIV
      tested and linked to HIV care programs for initiation of ART if appropriate. The
      investigators hypothesize that aPS will increase rates of case-finding, linkages to care, and
      ART initiation and will not result in social harm.

      The second aim is whether aPS is cost-effective in the Kenyan setting. The investigators will
      estimate how much it costs (when compared to standard methods) to identify and link
      HIV-infected persons into care. The investigators will also determine how successful aPS is
      at preventing future HIV transmission events and other outcomes associated with untreated HIV
      infection. The investigators hypothesize that HIV prevalence among partners in the immediate
      aPS arm will be high enough to make this approach cost-effective from the payer and societal
      perspective.

      Finally, with the Kenya MOH, the investigators want to establish a nationwide monitoring
      system to evaluate why Kenyans are testing for HIV. In the future, when aPS is rolled out
      nationally, this will help Kenyan public health officials define the contribution of aPS to
      HIV case-finding. The investigators hypothesize that the proportion of newly tested
      HIV-infected individuals who report testing because of known exposure to a person with HIV
      will represent a significant proportion of new cases and the investigators will be able to
      identify places in Kenya where aPS will have the greatest impact on HIV treatment and
      prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosing HIV soon after infection can benefit individuals and also has important public
      health benefits. It has been shown that starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) before HIV has
      progressed results in a better response to treatment and gives the person a better chance of
      long-term survival with HIV. Treating HIV can also reduce the risk that someone will transmit
      HIV to his or her sexual partners. The first step in achieving these individual and
      population level benefits is testing people for HIV. Unfortunately, in many parts of the
      world, including Kenya where we plan to conduct this study, many people are not tested
      regularly and do not know that they are infected. This study involves providing a public
      health service, notification of an exposure to a communicable disease and HIV testing, to
      sexual partners of those who test HIV-positive at voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)
      clinics in Kenya. Sexual partners are identified voluntarily by the person who tests at the
      VCT. A public health provider then goes to the home of the sexual partners to offer them HIV
      counseling and testing. This process is called provision of assisted partner services (aPS).

      We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial which will be conducted in collaboration with
      the Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) at 18 rural and urban voluntary counseling and testing
      (VCT) facilities across Kenya. Proposed activities will assess the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of providing aPS, improve capacity for program implementation in Kenya,
      and lay the foundation for evaluating the program's impact at the national level.
