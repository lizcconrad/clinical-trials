  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sucrose is the most used sweetener in beverage and foods in Denmark. Other sweeteners with
      other composition and amount of carbohydrates could be of interest in order to decrease the
      glucose and insulin responses after intake of a sweetened beverage/food. Malt extract has a
      sweet flavor but contains a different composition and amount of carbohydrates together with a
      small amount of protein compared to sucrose. Malt extract may therefore be a better
      alternative than sucrose as a sweetener due to a lower increase and more sustained blood
      glucose level. This could be of interest in relation to diabetes and appetite regulation but
      this is yet to be investigated.

      Thus the objective is to investigate the effect of malt extract vs. sucrose on:

        1. 3-hour change in the concentration of glucose and insulin

        2. 3-hour change in subjective appetite sensations (Visual Analogue Scales, VAS scores)

        3. Ad libitum energy intake

      Design: 20 men will participate in the 2-way, randomized, double-blind crossover study. The
      test drinks is isocaloric with 75 g carbohydrates Test drinks: malt extract solution and
      sucrose solution (10%) Three-hour subjective appetite ratings and blood samples will be
      assessed every half-hour. Subsequently, the subjects will served an ad libitum lunch

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute 3-h changes from baseline in the postprandial concentration of glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is seperated by &gt;2 weeks. On each test day glucose is measured prior to the test drink (time 0) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples are taken prior to the test drink (baseline). After initiation of the test drink blood samples are collected at time 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes. Blood samples are analyzed for glucose.</description>

    <measure>Acute 3-h changes from baseline in subjective appetite sensations using visual analogue scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is seperated by &gt;2 weeks. On each test day appetite sensations are measured prior to the test drink (time 0) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of subjective appetite sensations (visual analogue scales (VAS)) at time 0 (baseline - prior to the test meal) and at time 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake.
Measured subjective appetite sensations of hunger, satiety, prospective consumption, fullness, composite appetite score and sensory desires to something sweet, salty, rich in fat, or meat/fish.</description>

    <measure>Rating of the organoleptic quality of the test drinks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test seperated by &gt;2 weeks. On each test day after completion of the test drink (approximately) time 5 minutes post intake) subjects will rate the test drink</time_frame>
    <description>After completion of the test drink the subjects will rate the organoleptic quality of the drink by visual analogue scales (VAS) in regard to appearance, smell, taste, after-taste, and general palatability.</description>
