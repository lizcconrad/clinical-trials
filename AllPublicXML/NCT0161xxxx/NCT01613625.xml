  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastography is a emerging imaging technique that has demonstrated high reliability in the
      assessment of tissues stiffness and quantification of fibrosis particularly in adult's
      livers. This ultrasound exploration has no secondary effects. There is no study published in
      the pediatric population concerning the role of ultrasound elastrography in kidney. The aim
      of this study is to look for a correlation between the elastography's results and the kidney
      fibrosis on children who have to undergo a renal biopsy. Elastography may play a potential
      diagnostic and/or prognostic role in the management of these patients which would limit
      invasive biopsy procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male children or feminine from 5 to 18 years old to whom is indicated a renal biopsy
             by the néphrologue paediatrician whatever is the initial pathology, whatever are one
             or several current or previous treatments and whatever is their associated comorbidity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children of less than 5 years old or more than 18 years

          -  Children for whom a draining renal biopsy is not or more indicated by néphrologues
