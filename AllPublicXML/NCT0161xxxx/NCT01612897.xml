      The investigators hypothesize that children seen in a clinic that uses a compute based system
      known as CHICA, which reminds pediatricians to screen at defined time point for autism, will
      be screened more consistently for autism and receive more timely diagnostic a treatment
      services.

      To be eligible for this trial, participants must receive their care at one of four primary
      care clinics in Indianapolis where the CHICA system is used.
