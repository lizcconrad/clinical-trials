    <textblock>
      Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which is
      relatively prevalent in northern Norway with a total of around 90 patients. This provides us
      with a special opportunity to study AIP. AIP is caused by a mutation in the porphobilinogen
      deaminase, an enzyme in the haem synthesis. AIP presents symptoms, particularly among fertile
      women and older men. Typical symptoms are abdominal pain and dark red urine, nausea,
      vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness and nerve damage including paraesthesia and even
      paresis. This is known as symptomatic or manifest AIP (MAIP). Others do not display symptoms,
      so-called latent AIP (LAIP). AIP attacks may be triggered by a host of medicaments which
      affect the haem synthesis, infections, alcohol and stress. Treatments of manifestations
      include high sugar intake (4 sugar lumps/hour), alternatively administer glucose and
      Normosang (synthetic haem arginate) by intravenous injection and removing triggering factors.
      Diet, glucose intake, dental health and inflammatory parameters will be examined. This study
      can provide new knowledge about why only some people develop symptoms of AIP. Main
      hypothesis: There are differences in the diet, iron status, inflammation and glucose
      metabolism of the MAIP group vs. the LAIP group and the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a group of people with proven acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) mutation, some will
      remain asymptomatic, while others have repeated periods of porphyria symptoms. Glucose
      inhibits ALA synthetase (ALAS), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the haem synthesis. Studies
      of individual patients point to the fact that increased glucose and/or fructose content in
      the diet inhibits porphyria attacks. A high sugar intake can reduce the disease activity in
      patients with AIP. The diet and related biomarkers of those with latent and manifest AIP will
      therefore be mapped to explain why some have latent and others have manifest acute
      intermittent porphyria. Other studies point to the fact that people with manifest AIP who
      have later developed diabetes type 2 no longer have porphyria symptoms. Dental health will
      also be examined.

      Inflammation also affects the haem synthesis. Infections and/or inflammation are known to
      trigger AIP attacks. The disease activity in patients with acute intermittent porphyria in
      relation to inflammatory status, iron status, glucose metabolism and diet will therefore be
      examined.

      The iron metabolism is interesting to study because it is believed that the overstimulation
      of the haem synthesis is what triggers porphyria attacks. Haem consists of iron and
      protoporphyrin IX, and it is therefore possible that iron supplements in cases of iron
      deficiency can induce increased haem synthesis and by doing so trigger and/or aggravate AIP.

      Kidney failure is a serious secondary complication in some patients with MAIP. Protein
      markers for kidney injury in urine will be examined.
