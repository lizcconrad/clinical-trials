  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the performance of an investigational Bayer Blood
      Glucose (BG) meter and five additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMSs). The goal was
      to obtain glucose samples from subjects with diabetes across the meter operating ranges. A
      capillary sample was collected from each subject at 3 different times during the visit to
      obtain natural capillary blood samples with a range of glucose concentrations. Some blood
      samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels and glucose solution was
      added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels. All meter BG results were
      compared with plasma results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose
      Analyzer). All lancings and testing were performed by study staff.

    <measure>MAD Mean Absolute Value of the Difference Between Blood Glucose Meter (BGMS) Results and Corresponding YSI Blood Glucose (BG) Results in the Low BG Range(&lt;70 mg/dL)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Using samples with BG &lt; 70 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Value of the Differences Between BGM system readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MAD was calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| assessments, divided by the number of assessments. Each evaluable sample was tested on all 6 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MAD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value. Higher MAD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>

    <description>Subjects responded to statements about meter accuracy and diabetes management. Subject responses: 'Strongly Agree' 'Agree' 'Neutral' 'Disagree' or 'Strongly Disagree'or No Response. □1ACCURACY HELPS 1A-with my ability to talk with my HCP. 1B-my satisfaction with my self monitoring of diabetes. 1C-with my ability to manage my diabetes. 1D-prevent low BG. 1E-understand how food/exercise affects low BG. □2 I WOULD USE ONLY the meter and strips my insurance company pays for, even if a more accurate meter was available. □3 I USE MY CURRENT METER BECAUSE 3A-my HCP gave it to me. 3B-my insurance company covers the strips. 3C-I think it is the most accurate meter. □4 I WOULD SWITCH meters for a more accurate meter. □5BEING ABLE TO APPLY MORE BLOOD IS IMPORTANT 5A-as I have wasted test strips by not having enough blood to fill the strip 5B-as this would save test strips 5C-I would switch to a meter with this feature</description>

        <title>MAD Mean Absolute Value of the Difference Between Blood Glucose Meter (BGMS) Results and Corresponding YSI Blood Glucose (BG) Results in the Low BG Range(&lt;70 mg/dL)</title>
        <description>Using samples with BG &lt; 70 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Value of the Differences Between BGM system readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MAD was calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| assessments, divided by the number of assessments. Each evaluable sample was tested on all 6 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MAD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value. Higher MAD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>
        <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
        <population>Same number (135) of BG results was possible for each BGMS. A capillary sample was collected from each subject at 3 different times during the visit to obtain natural capillary blood samples with a range of glucose concentrations. Subjects provided 85 unmodified capillary samples &lt;70 mg/dL and 50 samples were modified by glycolyzing them.</population>

          <description>Using samples with BG &lt; 70 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Value of the Differences Between BGM system readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MAD was calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| assessments, divided by the number of assessments. Each evaluable sample was tested on all 6 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MAD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value. Higher MAD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>
          <population>Same number (135) of BG results was possible for each BGMS. A capillary sample was collected from each subject at 3 different times during the visit to obtain natural capillary blood samples with a range of glucose concentrations. Subjects provided 85 unmodified capillary samples &lt;70 mg/dL and 50 samples were modified by glycolyzing them.</population>

          <description>Variability of each meter system was determined by calculating the Standard Deviation derived from each meter's differences between Blood Glucose Meter (BGMS)results and corresponding YSI Blood Glucose (BG) results.</description>
          <population>Same numbers (538) of BG results were possible for each BGMS. A capillary sample was collected from each subject at 3 different times during the visit to obtain natural capillary blood samples with a range of glucose concentrations. Subjects provided 438 unmodified capillary samples and 100 samples were modified (21 to 496 mg/dL).</population>
