  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reports suggest that the Medicaid population includes a higher percentage of smokers than the
      general population. A high prevalence of smokers in a population is likely to lead to a
      higher burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Few studies have evaluated the
      economic burden of COPD in a Medicaid population. The objective of this observational,
      retrospective cohort study is to estimate the economic burden of COPD in subjects with a COPD
      diagnosis who are enrolled in Medicaid and are receiving maintenance treatment covered by
      Medicaid.

      Specifically, the null hypothesis for the primary outcome measure is that no difference is
      observed in all-cause costs between subjects with and without COPD. The test hypothesis is
      that there is a difference in all-cause costs between subjects with and without COPD.

      Secondary outcomes to be evaluated include all-cause resource use and COPD-related costs for
      the COPD cohort.

      The study uses a medical and pharmacy administrative claims database called MarketScan
      Medicaid Database that contains the medical, surgical, and prescription drug experience of
      nearly 7 million Medicaid recipients. This analysis will use data from 8 states.

        Medicaid recipients (aged &gt;=40 years) diagnosed with COPD (International Classification of
        Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) codes: 491.xx, 492.x, 496.xx) and
        newly initiated on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) maintenance medication
        (maintenance therapies include ipratropium alone/combination ipratropium-albuterol (IPR),
        tiotropium (TIO), inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting beta-agonist (LABA), and
        combination product of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA)) will
        be identified and matched in a 1 to 3 ratio to non-COPD Medicaid recipients on age (exact),
        gender, race, index year, Medicare dual eligibility, pre-index long-term care use. Index
        date was defined as the date of the first chronologically-occurring COPD maintenance
        medication during an identification period (01/01/2004 to 12/31/2006) for COPD patients,
        and as the date of the first medical or prescription claim during the index year of the
