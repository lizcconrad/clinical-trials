  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NKTR-181 is being developed as an analgesic compound for the treatment of moderate to severe
      chronic pain - active as a mu agonist, but with inherent molecular properties designed to
      provide a unique clinical profile, including most notably, reduced CNS side effects and an
      attenuated attractiveness as a target of abuse.
