  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence
      of darunavir 800 mg when administered as a fixed dose combination relative to 2 x 400 mg
      tablets of the commercial tablet formulation, in the presence of 150 mg cobicistat, (under
      fed and fasted conditions) in healthy participants.

      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), 3-panel, single-center, single-dose, crossover (method used to
      switch patients from one treatment arm to another in a clinical trial) study in 134 healthy
      adult participants. The study consists of 3 phases including a screening phase of
      approximately 3 weeks (Days -21 to -1) followed by an open-label treatment phase consisting
      of 3 panels with 2 single-dose treatment sessions of 5 days each (Days -1 to 4) separated by
      a washout period of at least 7 days, and a follow-up period occurring 7 to 10 days after last
      intake of study drugs. The study consists of 3 panels. In each panel participants will be
      randomly be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA for Panel 1; CD or DC for Panel
      2; and EF or FE for Panel 3). Participants will receive either single-dose darunavir 800 mg
      as 2 x 400 mg tablets and cobicistat 150 mg tablet or single-dose darunavir/cobicistat
      800/150 mg as tablet in each panel (under fed and fasted conditions).
