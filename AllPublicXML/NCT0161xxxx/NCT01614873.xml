      Eligibility : healthy subject without respiratory complications in the past

      Subjects will breath spontaneously without mechanical ventilation, with Pressure Support
      Ventilation and with Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist during.

      Three levels of pressurisation will be tested : 5 cmH2O, 8 cmH2O and 12 cmH2O Duration of
      each condition will be about 15 minutes.

      Measurements will include:Flow, airway pressure, SaO2, PtCO2, diaphragmatic electromyography,
      chest wall motion by optoelectronic plethysmography

    <description>Gold standard partial ventilator support: Pressure Support Ventilation performed with Servo-i® ventilator (MAQUET,Critical Care, Sweden).
During pressure support the inspiratory muscles are assisted by a constant inspiratory pressure adjusted by the prescriptor and applied to the airway by either an invasive or a non invasive interface. Then the subject initiate the inspiratory effort and a constant pressure is delivered to the airway in order to assist inspiration. Three levels of pressure will be tested (5 cmH2O, 8 cmH2O and 12 cmH2O)</description>

    <description>Spontaneous Breathing using Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist with trigger adjusted on diaphragmatic electromyogram. Electrical activity of the diaphragm will be obtained through a naso-gastric tube with multiple array of electrodes placed at its distal end (Eadi catheter® , Maquet Critical Care, Sweden). During NAVA the inspiratory muscles are assisted by a pressure which is proportional to this electrical activity. Then the subject initiate the inspiratory effort and a pressure proportional to the integrated EMG activity is delivered to the airway in order to assist inspiration. The adjustment of the level of NAVA (expressed in cmH2O/microvolt) will be adjusted in order to obtain a peak pressure similar to pressure support (5 cmH2O, 8 cmH2O and 12 cmH2O)</description>

    <description>Electrical activity of the diaphragm will be obtained through a naso-gastric tube with multiple array of electrodes placed at its distal end (Eadi catheter® , Maquet Critical Care, Sweden). Subject will be ventilated with a mouthpiece interface. NAVA will be compared to Pressure Support using the same ventilator. Once the pattern of breathing will be stabilized (10 minutes) in each condition (see arm) the following parameters will be recorded during 5 minutes and compared : tidal volume, inspiratory time, expiratory time, transcutaneous CO2 pressure, diaphragmatic Emg activity, delay between the inspiratory activity initiation and positive pressure initiation, delay between the end of the inspiratory effort and the end of pressurisation.</description>
