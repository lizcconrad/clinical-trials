    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem. In extra-pulmonary forms, evidence
      of bacteriological cure is difficult to be obtained raising the need for other therapeutic
      assessment tools. 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) is a glucose analogue widely used in
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Its uptake is high in cancer cells and in inflammatory
      cells, especially in active TB foci. The hypothesis is a decrease in the uptake of FDG in the
      foci of TB during treatment permitting a non-invasive monitoring of therapeutic response. The
      main objective is to describe the evolution under treatment of the FDG uptake in PET imaging
      in TB foci in patients cured from lymph node and bone TB. Secondary objectives are to compare
      the decrease of FDG uptake according to type of location, to define the frequency of
      localizations revealed by FDG-PET and their impact on therapeutic management at the beginning
      and the end of treatment, and to describe the evolution of PET in patients not cured.

    <description>To measure FDG uptake and evolution, the ΣSUVmax will be used. SUV (&quot;Standard Uptake Value&quot;) is defined as tissue concentration of FDG / administered FDG dose / patient weight. ΣSUVmax is the sum of the maximum SUV measured in every TB foci. ΣSUVmax variations between the beginning and the end of treatment, and 6 months later in cases of persistent uptake at the end of treatment will be studied in patients considered cured</description>
