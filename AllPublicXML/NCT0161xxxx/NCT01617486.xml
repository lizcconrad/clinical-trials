      This proposal will test Balance Adolescent Lifestyle Activities and Nutrition Choices for
      Energy (BALANCE), a multilevel intervention administered through Parents as Teachers (PAT)
      and designed to reduce overweight in postpartum teens. The intervention will focus on the
      replacement of 'obesogenic' patterns (such as high soda intake, excess portion size, and
      sedentary activity) with 'energy' patterns (such as water consumption, appropriate portion
      size, and walking).

    <description>Postpartum adolescents in the intervention group who are at risk for overweight (85th-94th percentile BMI) or are overweight (equal to or greater than the 95th percentile) at baseline will have a change in BMI with a lower absolute BMI at 6 month post assessment than those in the control group</description>
