      This study was intended to assess the efficacy and safety of different Disease-Modifying
      Antirheumatic Drugs cycle combination regimen using the American College of Rheumatology
      (ACR) criteria of 20% improvement in symptoms (ACR20) in managing active adult rheumatoid
      arthritis.

    <description>Leflunomide 10-20 mg, orally, once daily for up to 48 weeks. Twelve weeks after the initial Leflunomide induction, patients were randomized into two groups (LEF+CTX:LEF+MTX=2:1) if the DAS 28 were higher than 2.6, or continuing leflunomide use without dosing change. Then, the disease activity was assessed using DAS 28 every 12 weeks. The regimen should remain unchanged if the DAS 28 reached to less than 2.6, otherwise, a third (24 weeks) or fourth (36 weeks) DMARs should be added.
Intravenous CTX was administrated once 200-400mg per 3 weeks.</description>
