          <description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) score is a scoring system to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure. The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems.
The total SOFA score is a sum of the individual scores and range from 4 to 24, 4 being the best and 24 being the worst patient status.</description>
