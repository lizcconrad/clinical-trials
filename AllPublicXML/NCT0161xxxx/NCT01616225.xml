    <textblock>
      This study (the &quot;Adjuvant Growth Hormone Study&quot;) is being done to see the effects of adding
      Growth Hormone (GH) during fertility treatment (also called in vitro fertilization or IVF).
      Growth Hormone is a protein that your body normally produces. Growth Hormone can act on
      several different organs, including the ovaries, where eggs are made. From evidence gathered
      from studies done by fertility doctors over the years, researchers believe that women who
      have not become pregnant through IVF in the past might have better results if they go on a
      course of Growth Hormone during the IVF treatment. However, more research needs to be done to
      confirm whether adding Growth Hormone is beneficial and also to find out the best time to
      start Growth Hormone treatment during IVF.

      We hope that our Adjuvant Growth Hormone study will help answer these questions.

    <description>Subjects will receive the standard IVF treatment, as well as adjuvant GH as above.

    <description>All patients will be administered an oral contraceptive (Marvelon®). FSH treatment (daily subcutaneous injections of 450 IU Gonal-F®; Serono Canada) must begin 4 days after OCP stop, providing both of the following criteria are met. Pituitary downregulation with GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide®, Serono Canada) 0.25mg daily (subcutaneous injection) and LH (Luveris®, Serono Canada) 75 IU daily (subcutaneous injection) will be initiated when one or both of the following criteria are satisfied. Monitoring will continue until a lead follicle reaches ≥18 mm, at which time HCG (Ovidrel®, Serono Canada) 250 mcg will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Oocytes will be retrieved 36 hours after HCG treatment. Luteal support for the endometrium (90 mg progesterone (8% progesterone gel; Crinone® gel), administered intravaginally once daily) will begin one day after oocyte retrieval and will be maintained at least until day 31 of gestation.</description>
