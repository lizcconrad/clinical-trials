    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of habituation to diets with different types
      of carbohydrate (simple-carb, refined-carb, unrefined-carb) on selected Cardiovascular
      Disease (CVD) risk indicators.

      The objective of this pilot study is to determine the relative comparability for an
      isocaloric exchange of (1) refined-carb for simple-carb and (2) refined-carb for
      unrefined-carb, on established and emerging CVD risk indicators. To achieve this goal,
      subjects with moderate dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol &gt; 100mg/dL) will consume diets enriched
      in 3 types of carbohydrate (simple-carb, refined-carb and unrefined-carb) according to a
      randomized, cross-over design.
