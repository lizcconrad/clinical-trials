  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of 2 drugs dabrafenib
      and trametinib can help to control melanoma that has or has not spread to the brain. The
      safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Dabrafenib is designed to block the mutated BRAF protein. This mutation is only found in
      moles of the skin and in melanoma cells. By blocking the protein, the drug may slow the
      growth of or kill cancer cells that have the protein.

      Trametinib is designed to block certain proteins that cause cancer cells to grow and
      multiply. This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take both dabrafenib and
      trametinib together.

      You will take 1 capsule of trametinib by mouth once a day. You will take 2 capsules of
      dabrafenib by mouth 2 times every day (1 time in the morning and 1 time in the evening, about
      12 hours apart - a total of 4 capsules a day). If you experience severe side effects, your
      doctor or the research team may lower the dose of the drug(s).

      You should take the study drugs with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of room-temperature water. You
      should not eat or drink anything besides water for at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after
      you take the study drugs.

      You will be given a study drug diary to record the times and doses that you take the study
      drugs. You should bring the diary to each study visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any symptoms you may be having. (if it
           was not recorded in the previous 7 days)

        -  Your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam (if one was not performed in the previous 7 days).

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests (if this was not performed
           in the previous 7 days).

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking, how you are feeling, and if you
           have had any side effects.

        -  You will have a blood draw this visit for research purposes.

      At some point between Day 4-10 of Cycle 1, you will have the same kind of biopsy that you had
      at screening. Your doctor and/or the study team will discuss this with you.

      On Days 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  Your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or herbal supplements that you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking, how you are feeling, and if you
           have had any side effects.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have an ECG.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking, how you are feeling, and if you
           have had any side effects.

        -  If the disease has spread to the brain and your doctor thinks it is needed, you will
           have an MRI of the brain.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking, how you are feeling, and if you
           have had any side effects

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing on day 1 of Cycle 2 and
           4. If your disease worsens, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will also be drawn at that time.

      Every 8 weeks (2 cycles) from the time of the start of the treatment, you will have an x-ray,
      a CT scan, an MRI scan, a skin exam, and/or a bone scan to check the status of the disease.

      Every 12 weeks, you will have an ECHO performed.

      If at any point during the study you have any symptoms or signs of a serious skin, eye, or
      heart side effect, you may be referred to a dermatologist or an ophthalmologist, or you may
      have an ECG and ECHO to check your heart's health.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse,
      you start having other health problems, or intolerable side effects occur.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      You will have an end-of-study visit within 4 weeks after your last dose of study drugs. The
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have an ECG.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will have an x-ray,
           computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and/or bone scan
           to check the status of the disease if you are taken off the study for any other reason
           than the disease getting worse.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will have the same kind of mandatory biopsy that you did at screening. You may be
           allowed to continue receiving the study drugs until the time of this biopsy (up to 2
           days) even if the disease is not showing a response to the study drugs. Your doctor
           and/or the study team will discuss this with you.

      Survival Follow-Up:

      After you stop taking study drug, you will be followed approximately every 3 months (either
      clinic visit or contact by phone or letter) for 5 years or until death. If you are called,
      the call will last about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. This is an investigational study. Both trametinib and
      dabrafenib are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of
      melanoma. Their use together in this study is investigational.

      Up to 45 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication, and must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the start of dosing.
             Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug interaction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             (whichever is shorter) of study drug administration, other than BRAF inhibitor--at
             least 14 days must have passed between the last dose of the prior investigational
             anti-cancer drug and the first dose of study drug. However, there is no required

             metastases, unless they have been previously treated brain metastases with surgery or
             stereotactic radiosurgery and the disease has been confirmed stable (i.e., no increase
             in lesion size) for at least 4 weeks with MRI scans using contrast prior to Day 1.
             Subjects are not permitted to receive enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs and/or

        <description>Overall response rate defined as percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) at any time as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Clinical responses will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1 criteria after every 2 cycles (8 weeks).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance all lesions; pathological lymph nodes reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): &gt;30% decrease in sum diameters of lesions, reference baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;20% increase in sum diameters of lesions, reference smallest sum on study (includes baseline sum if smallest on study); relative increase of 20%, sum must also demonstrate absolute increase of &gt;5 mm; appearance of 1 or &gt; new lesions considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD, reference smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
