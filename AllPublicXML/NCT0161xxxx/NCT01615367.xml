  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in bipolar
      disorder, yet no empirically validated psychosocial interventions to manage risk factors for
      CVD in BD have been developed. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the
      feasibility of an integrated treatment to decrease CVD risk factors, while exploring whether
      the intervention improves overall functioning and mood symptoms. The designed treatment
      integrates theories on Nutrition strategies, Exercise interventions, and Wellness Treatment
      (NEW Tx) to address risk factors for CVD that co-occur with bipolar disorder. NEW Tx includes
      novel intervention strategies in each of these three modules, as well as modified and
      tailored empirically-supported strategies for bipolar disorder. The primary hypotheses are
      that NEW Tx will be feasible to deliver, acceptable to this population, and associated with
      improvements in CVD risk factors (i.e., waist circumference). Exploratory analyses will
      examine predictors of treatment response and the effect of NEW Tx on mood symptoms and
      overall functioning.

      The purpose of the Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness Treatment (NEW Tx) research is to
      develop and test the feasibility and acceptance of a theoretically integrated treatment to
      address the impact of medical comorbidity of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), while
      exploring its efficacy, whether it improves overall functioning and symptoms, as well as
      examine a potential moderator and mediator of treatment response.

      A.Primary Aims

      Aim 1: Feasibility and Acceptance of NEW Tx in the Nonrandomized Trial.

      Hypothesis 1a: A preliminary study of whether NEW Tx will be feasible with regards to
      recruitment, retention, blinded assessments, and therapist adherence to NEW Tx.

      Hypothesis 1b: Participants will report high satisfaction with the treatment and
      acceptability over the study duration in a nonrandomized trial.

      Aim 2: Feasibility and Acceptance of NEW Tx and its Evaluation in the Randomized Pilot Trial.

      Hypothesis 2a: A pilot study of whether NEW Tx will be feasible with regards to recruitment,
      randomization, retention, blinded assessments, and therapist adherence to NEW Tx.

      Hypothesis 2b: Participants will report high satisfaction with the treatment and
      acceptability over the study duration in the randomized pilot trial.

      B. Exploratory Aims

      Aim 3a: Reducing Medical Burden in the Randomized Pilot Trial. Pilot test the efficacy of NEW
      Tx in improving medical burden using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS).

      Hypothesis 3a: Over the course of 20-weeks (18 sessions) the NEW Tx group will have a lower
      FRS compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in the randomized pilot trial.

      Aim 3b: Symptoms and Functioning in the Randomized Pilot Trial. Examine the efficacy of NEW
      Tx in improving functioning and symptoms of BD.

      Hypothesis 3b: Over the course of 20-weeks (18 sessions) the NEW Tx group will improved
      functioning and mood symptoms compared to TAU in the randomized pilot trial.

      Aim 3c: Moderator and Mediator of NEW Tx in the Randomized Pilot Trial. Investigate a
      potential moderator and mediator of treatment response.

      Hypothesis 3c.1: Individuals with higher baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30 will moderate
      the between treatment effect size for medical burden (FRS) in the randomized pilot trial,
      such that of NEW Tx will have lower FRSs.

      Hypothesis 3c.2: Mastery of the diet and exercise modules of NEW Tx will mediate the
      association of NEW Tx and improvement in medical burden (FRS).

    <measure>NEW Tx Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NEW Tx Scale is a 10-item scale to asses participants' expectations of NEW Tx their acceptability of NEW Tx at Week 20. This scale also includes a comments section to solicit unstructured feedback from participants on NEW Tx. The scale for this item is a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) to 5 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;). The score for each item is summed for a total score that ranges from 10 to 50 with higher scores indicating poorer perception of the treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 is a reliable and valid self-report of participants' acceptability of treatment. This is an assessment of client/patient satisfaction with their care and perceived quality and tolerability of NEW Tx. The scale for this item is a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (&quot;poor&quot;) to 4 (&quot;excellent&quot;). The score for each item is summed for a total score that ranges from 8 to 32 with higher scores indicating greater acceptability of the treatment.</description>

        <description>Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale is a 10-item clinician-rated measure of depression that assesses the presence and severity of patient’s current depressive symptoms. The score for each item is summed for a total score that ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating more severe current depressive symptoms.</description>
