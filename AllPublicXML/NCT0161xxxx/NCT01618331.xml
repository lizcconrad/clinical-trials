      The hypotheses is that regular post exercise supplementation increase fitness and daily
      activity level in patients with Fascioscapulohumeral (FSH) muscular dystrophy.

      All patients are tested before and after 12 weeks of cycle-ergometer exercise. Maximal oxygen
      consumption and 6MWT is used as primarily effect goals. Secondary effect goals are risk of
      falls and daily activity level.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the response to protein-carbohydrate
      supplementation doing regular exercise in patients with FSHD. All patients are tested before
      and after 12 weeks of cycle-ergometer exercise. Maximal oxygen consumption and a functional 6
      min walk test(6MWT) is used as primarily effect goals. Secondary effect goals are risk of
      falls and daily activity level. We measure manuel muscle strength, a balance test, a
      5-time-up-and-down-chair-test, a 14 steps-stair-test, accelerometer measuring, daily activity
      level questionnaire and SP36.

      We use a blinded randomized controlled trail. The interventions are 12 weeks regular exercise
      and consumption of a post-exercise drink. The exercise consists of 30 session of 30 minutes
      moderate exercise on a cycle-ergometer. After each exercise session patients consume a
      protein or a non-caloric placebo drink.

    <description>All participant are tested with a standardized maximal oxygen consumption test. Maximal oxygen uptake pr. minute pr. kg body (VO2max) weight and maximal work load (Wmax) is measured. The effect of intervention is found in different between groups in relative and absolute improvement in VO2max and Wmax.</description>
