  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical rehabilitation is a key element in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular
      diseases, and recent evidence has shown that supervised exercise programmes can prevent
      cardiovascular events, improve physical function and quality of life. Individualized exercise
      prescription based on appropriate frequency, intensity and duration is recommended.
      Furthermore, recent studies have shown that physical cardiac exercise training can influence
      inflammation of the vessel wall and hence reduce development of arteriosclerosis in coronary
      vessels. In the literature are divergent conclusions on appropriate frequency and duration of
      physical rehabilitation programs in order to improve physical function and reduce
      arteriosclerosis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an optimized physical
      rehabilitation programme compared to a conventional programme on physical fitness, health
      related quality of life and vascular inflammation.

      Both trial groups carry out physical exercise training in groups. The exercise training is
      instructed by two physiotherapists with expertise in cardiac rehabilitation. Each training
      session takes 60 minutes and is based on current evidence for physical training for IHD and
      CHF patients. Exercise intensity progresses within the first week of the training program
      from moderate intensity (40-59% of VO2max), to high intensity (60-84% of VO2max). Exercise
      intensity of the individual training sessions is monitored by heart rate.

      The training program includes the following:

      Warm-up and stretching: Each training sessions starts 10 min. warm-up and ends with 5 min.
      stretching.

      Aerobic exercise : Takes place on treadmill, stairs, ergometer bikes and interval training
      with different strength-endurance exercises.

      Muscle strength: Is performed on machines with weight training equipment or by floor
      exercises. 10-15 repetitions are performed with a load equivalent to 50-60% of 1 RM.

      The exercise programs for both groups are performed using a standardized exercise protocol.

      All patients per a sub-maximal and a maximal exercise test prior to participation in the
      physical exercise training program.

    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) using breath by breath gas-analysis measures variables related to cardiorespiratory function, including expiratory ventilation and pulmonary gas exchange (oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide (VCO2). Along with the ECG, heart rate and blood pressure these measures allows for quantitatively linking metabolic, cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to exercise. The standard expression of aerobic working capacity is the maximum VO2.
VO2 max reached during a symptom-limited incremental CPX protocol is commonly expressed as O2 per kg-1 per min -1.</description>

    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in muscle strength at end of intervention (8 respectively 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric muscle strength and muscle power are essential determinants for physical performance. Maximal isometric muscle strength is defined as a maximal volunteer contraction at a specific range of motion, and muscle power as the ability to produce high force rapidly.
Isometric volunteer knee extension is measured with the patients sitting in a adjustable dynamometer chair (Good Muscle Strength, Metittur®) and measurement of leg extensor power is measured using a Nottingham Power Rig ®</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VCAM-1</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in VCAM-1(pg/ml) between baseline and end of intervention (8 respectively 12 weeks). Follow-up 6 and 12 month after end of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>VCAM-1 is an endothelial cell protein, which is gate, when leukocytes reside on the intima of the vessel wall. TNF-alpha stimulates endothelial cell to membrane expression of VCAM-1, where leukocytes can adhere to endothelial cell s and influence inflammation of the vessel wall. VCAM-1 is thus a specific inflammation marker in the vessel wall, and hence development of arteriosclerosis in coronary vessels.</description>
