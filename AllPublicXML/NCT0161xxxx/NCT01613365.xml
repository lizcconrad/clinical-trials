  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvement of per and postoperative management, major pulmonary surgery continues to
      carry out a high morbidity with a significant mortality. Among postoperative complications,
      respiratory failures (nosocomial pneumonia, ARDS) are currently the most frequent and
      serious, as well as being the primary cause of hospital death, after major pulmonary
      resections. Vast majority of these complications are notoriously infectious and should be
      considered as hospital-acquired infections. These complications result in a dramatic
      increased of substantial hospital costs in term of length of hospital stay, antibiotics and
      morbidity. Current management of these complications stands on antibiotics, oxygen supply and
      physiotherapy. In severe case, a ventilatory support (invasive or non invasive) is justify in
      near 25 % of cases.

      Recent data have suggested that proximal airways colonizations could be an essential first
      step in the pathogenesis of theses respiratory failures. Previous works have long
      demonstrated that bacterial colonization was frequent between 21 to 40 % in lung cancer
      patients. These colonizations could act as a major predisposing factor to these postoperative
      respiratory failures. Because distal airways and lung parenchyma are free from bacteria at
      the moment of the surgery, respiratory complications should be the result from contamination
      by potential microorganisms belonging the upper aero-digestive tract. Consequently,
      decontamination of the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cavities before and during the first
      days after surgery could have a beneficial advantage in the prevention of these
      complications. This decontamination has been demonstrated to be effective in critically-ill
      patients in intensive care unit, in cardiac surgery and in esophageal surgery.
      Decontamination of oropharynx and nasopharynx with Chlorhexidine Gluconate has significantly
      reduced the rate of postoperative global hospital-acquired infections and respiratory
      infectious as well. To date, data on the efficacy of this decontamination protocol in major
      pulmonary resections are not available.
