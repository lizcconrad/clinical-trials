      Participants will be lean and overweight primary grocery shoppers aged 18 years and older.
      Participants will be considered lean if their body mass index (BMI = kg/m2) is less than
      29.9, overweight if their BMI is greater than or equal to 30.12 To meet eligibility for the
      study, participants must be the guardian of a child at least 2 years or older, do the primary
      grocery shopping for the family, they must also report being weekly household grocery

          <title>Relative Reinforcing Value High Energy Dense Foods (RRV HED)</title>
          <description>RRV was assessed using a computer program where subjects earned points toward food. Participants earned a point by clicking a mouse to meet schedule requirements, i.e. 20 clicks earned one portion of food on schedule one. Each subsequent schedule had double the requirements of the previous schedule. Participants were rewarded with their preferred food each time they completed the schedule requirements. The session ended when participants no longer wished to earn points towards food.</description>

          <title>Delay Discounting $10 reward (DD 10)</title>
          <description>The delay discounting task involved allowing participants to make choices between smaller immediate monetary rewards and a larger, fixed, delayed reward. Participants completed both increasing amount of the immediate reward, and decreasing amount of the immediate reward, in a randomized order, over a series of time delays (1 day, 2 days, etc). An indifference point was calculated as the amount of immediate reward that was equal to the delayed reward. From this area under the curve, or indifference proportion*delay proportion, was calculated, leading the a range of scores between 0 and 1.</description>
