    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to test the ability of a simple questionnaire to detect mild,
      moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea. The investigators are also investigating whether
      adding the size of the neck and waist can add to the accuracy of the questionnaire.

      The study will be conducted at the Center for Sleep Medicine at Tufts Medical Center. The
      investigators hope to enroll 250 patients in our study at Tufts Medical Center.

      We will complete a 12 item questionnaire and data sheet with the study subjects based on
      their responses and 2 measurements specified below, right before application of a study the
      start of their sleep study called &quot;Polysomnography&quot;.

      If available, we will also use information from the subjects medical record, including
      information regarding a history of diabetes (blood sugar that is too high), high blood
      pressure and laboratory data such as blood sugar and blood lipids (fats in the blood). We
      will record this information for research purposes.

      The 2 measurements performed for research purposes consist of the size of the neck and waist
      using a flexible tape measure. After the sleep study, we will also use results from that
      study in this research. We expect the subjects study participation to be completed in 30
      minutes or less.

      There will be no follow up. If a participant cannot complete the sleep study for any reason,
      the study team may decide to withdraw the subject's participation without further notice.

      The study will be open for participation from June 2012 through November of 2012.
