      This is an open, parallel group study in subjects with normal renal function compared to
      those with renal dysfunction.

      The pharmacokinetic of BF2.649 (pitolisant) is already well established from several studies
      in healthy human, and a recent pharmacokinetic study gave data on 12 young healthy volunteers
      compared to 12 elderly subject receiving 20mg/day during 14 days.

      The aim of this study is to investigate effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
      BF2.649 administrated on a single oral dose of 20 mg.

      The once daily dose of 20 mg BF2.649 (pitolisant) chosen for this study corresponds to the
      usual therapeutic dose.

      Twenty four subjects will be stratified according to renal function by using assessment of
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as defined by MDRD formula as follows:

        -  4 subjects from 18 to 75 years of age with mild impaired renal function defined by GFR
           between 60 and 89 ml/min (STAGE 2 according to the international classification of
           chronic kidney disease)

        -  4 subjects from 18 to 75 years of age with moderate impaired renal function defined by
           GFR between 30 and 59 ml/min (STAGE 3 according to the international classification of
           chronic kidney disease)

        -  4 subjects from 18 to 75 years of age with severe impaired renal function defined by GFR
           between 15 and 29 ml/min (STAGE 4 according to the international classification of
           chronic kidney disease)

        -  12 healthy subjects with normal renal function defined by GFR&gt;90 ml/min with no
           proteinuria (&lt;0.15g/L determined by urinalysis) matched with impaired renal function
           subjects on ethnic group, sex, age (+/- 5 years), and BMI (+/- 20%)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For subjects with impaired renal function:

          -  Subjects 18 to 75 years old with impaired renal function (MDRD formula between 15 and
             89mL/min) medically stable since 3 months

          -  With body mass index (weight/height2) in the range 18 to 32 kg/m2 (inclusive)

        For healthy subjects:

          -  Healthy subjects 18 to 75 years old with normal renal function (MDRD &gt; 90 mL/min) and
             no proteinuria (&lt;0.15g/L determined by urinalysis) matched with impaired renal
             function subjects on ethnic group, sex, age (+/- 5 years), and BMI (+/- 20%)
