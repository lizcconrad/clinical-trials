    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tolerability of darunavir (PREZISTA) or etravirine
      (INTELENCE) in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who are
      na誰ve to these medications and in patients who have experienced tolerability issues on their
      current or prior combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The tolerability is evaluated by
      switching the patients from their previous or current combination antiretroviral therapy
      (cART) to either darunavir or etravirine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention.), multicenter (study
      conducted at multiple sites), observational study (individuals are observed for certain
      outcomes) of darunavir and etravirine in patients infected with HIV-1 who are na誰ve to these
      medications and who have experienced tolerability issues on their current or prior
      combination antiretroviral therapy (medicines used for treatment of HIV). PREZISTA is
      indicated for na誰ve HIV patients (someone who has never used HIV drugs) and
      treatment-experienced HIV patients and INTELENCE is indicated for treatment-experienced
      patients who have failed prior therapy and have HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple
      antiretroviral agents (HIV-1 strains are able to survive the exposure of the multiple
      antiretroviral agents), including Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs).
      In this study patients will receive either darunavir (PREZISTA) or etravirine (INTELENCE) and
      physician selected optimized background agents (other antiretroviral medicines), as permitted
      by the local formulary and supported by the current Canadian Product Monograph. 90 patients
      will participate in this study (75 Patients planned for the darunavir group and 15 patients
      planned for the etravirine group). The total duration of the study will be 24 weeks. Safety
      and tolerability will be evaluated at screening (14 days prior to Day 1), baseline (patient's
      medical status before any treatment or research is done) at Day 1, Week 4, Week 12 and Week
      24. Tolerability will be evaluated using HIV Symptom Distress Module (HIV-SDM) also referred
      to as the HIV Symptom Index (HSI) which is a self-completed questionnaire to evaluate
      symptoms and measure the presence and bothersomeness of side effects commonly seen with HIV
      and antiretroviral treatment over the last 4 weeks (20 questions about all symptoms which the
      patient might have had during the past four weeks). Higher scores indicate the presence of
      more symptoms and/or a greater degree of distress related to the 20 symptoms. In HIV-SDM data
      is collected to see the benefit of switching to either darunavir or etravirine.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the patient's total score of the HIV Symptom Distress Module (HIV-SDM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 4, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>HIV-SDM is a questionnaire consisting of 20 questions related to all the symptoms which the patient might have had during the past four weeks. For each question patient has to select appropriate answer related to the symptoms: &quot;0 = I do not have this symptom; 1 = I have this symptom and it doesn't bother me; 2 = it bothers me a little; 3 = it bothers me; 4 = it bothers me a lot&quot;. Total score of HIV-SDM is then calculated for all the 20 items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Maintenance/achievement of virologic suppression at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic suppression is decrease in the number of virus in blood. Number of participants with virologic suppression (who achieved virologic suppression) as well as the Number of participants who maintained virologic suppression will be summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with disappearance by Week 4 of at least one bothersome symptom identified at baseline by patient on HIV-SDM</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The bothersome symptoms (defined as those reported as 'It bothers me a lot' or 'It bothers me') at baseline will be identified for each patient. The number of participants who report the disappearance of at least one of the bothersome symptoms (eg, reported as 'It bothers me a little', 'It does not bothers me', 'I do not have the symptom') by Week 4 will be summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with maintenance of disappearance by Week 12 and Week 24 of at least one bothersome symptom identified at baseline by patient on HIV-SDM</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who report the maintenance of the disappearance of at least one of the bothersome symptoms (eg, reported as It bothers me a little, 'It does not bothers me', 'I do not have the symptom') at Week 12 and Week 24 will be summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Maintenance/increase in CD4 cell count.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>CD4 cells (a type of white blood cells) are circulating in blood and gives an idea of how strong the HIV positive person's immune system really is. The values of CD4 cell counts will be summarized using mean, standard deviations, minimum and maximum at baseline and Week 24. In addition, the number of participants with maintenance or increase in CD4 cell counts will be summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of change in HIV-SDM scores between those participants who were on or off ARTs at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>On and off ARTs is patients taking HIV medications and patients not taking HIV medications. The HIV-SDM change from baseline scores will be summarized using basic statistics (mean, standard deviations, minimum and maximum) by whether the patient is on or off ART at baseline.</description>
