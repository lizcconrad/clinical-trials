      The present study investigates by means of the rubber hand illusion body image stability and
      sense of body ownership in patients with CRPS of the upper limb compared to patients with
      unilateral pain of origin other than CRPS and age and sex-matched healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with CRPS of the upper limb distortions of body representation and impairments of
      sense of body ownership are well-known. To investigate the body schema and body image
      stability of these patients in comparison to patients with upper limb pain of origin other
      than CRPS and healthy subjects, we conducted a series of rubber hand illusions. This well -
      established paradigm is elicited by visuo-tactile stimulation of one´s own real hand and a
      visible hand and forearm prosthesis. The present study investigates 1) if and how far
      patients with CRPS are susceptible to experience the illusion 2) how far the illusion
      strength differs between CRPS and patients with unilateral pain of the upper limb of other
      origin and healthy subjects 3) how far parameters, e.g. neglect-like severity symptoms, body
      plasticity, empathy, duration of disease and pain intensity influence the illusion strength.

    <measure>subjective illusion strength by a validated questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The illusion strength was measured subjectively by a validated questionnaire on a 7- point Likert scale,ranging from 0 (= disagree strongly) to 7 (= agree strongly). The questionnaire encompassed five slightly modified items of the German-translated questionnaire by Ocklenburg et al.(2011), following Botvinick &amp; Cohen (1998).In the experimental conditions the questionnaire was additionally augmented by three further statements regarding the perception of the needle threat.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>objectified illusion strength by measure of skin conductance response (SCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The SCR represents an objective measure of participant´s identification with the artificial limb, indicating the autonomic nervous system arousal in anticipation of pain, while watching the prosthesis being harmed (Armel &amp; Ramachandran, 2003; Ehrsson, Wiech, Weiskopf, Dolan &amp; Passingham, 2007). In every trial, the SCR was recorded with Ag-AgCl electrodes from the thenar and hypothenar eminence of the non-tested hand. Conductivity was measured in micro-Siemens (1/Ohm).</description>

    <description>Several questionnaires were used to assess current and average pain intensity (NRS 0-10), neglect-like severity symptoms (Frettloeh et al. 2006), Handedness (Oldfield,1971), body plasticity (TABP) (Desmond, Horgan et al., 2001), empathy (IRI) ( Davis, 1980) and DASH-score (German, Wind et al. 1999).</description>

        The study sample consists of three groups:

          1. Patients with CRPS of the upper limb type 1 ( n=24)

          2. Patients with unilateral pain of the upper limb origin other than CRPS (n=21)

          3. Healthy subjects, age and sex-matched to patients with CRPS Patients with unilateral
             pain of the upper limb of origin other than CRPS serve as controls. Recruitment for
             all CRPS and the majority of patients in the control group took place in the pain
             clinic of the Bergmannsheil University Hospital in Bochum. The remaining patients were
             recruited from the Neurological respectively Surgical department of the Bergmannsheil
             University Hospital.
