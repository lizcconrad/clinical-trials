      ICLL01 The BOMP trial: Phase II study of salvage treatment with Bendamustine, Ofatumumab and
      MethylPrednisolone (BOMP) in relapsed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).

      A study of the GOELAMS / GCFLLC-MW intergroup

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available datas suggest that a combination of bendamustine, ofatumumab and high dose steroids
      (the BOMP regimen) appears meaningful and likely to induce a high response rate in patients
      with relapsed CLL, including those who have relapsed after modern 1st line
      immuno-chemotherapy combinations and those who are fludarabine-refractory. The BOMP trial
      will address the complete response rate as its main objective. The results of bendamustine
      and rituximab CLL2M trial will serve of a comparator for the BOMP trial. Among secondary
      objectives, an extensive study of the p53 pathway (deletion 17p, TP53 mutational status and
      p53 function) will be performed and its impact on response and survival will be analyzed.
