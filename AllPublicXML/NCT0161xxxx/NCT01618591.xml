  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to develop the evidence on relative efficacy of 3 available
      single-dose loperamide adjuncted regimens for watery diarrhea and a single-dose regimen, with
      and without loperamide, for dysentery/febrile diarrhea required for informing decisions among
      these regimens. Information from this study will be used to develop management guidelines for
      the diagnosis and management of travelers' diarrhea (TD) among deployed United States and
      United Kingdom military personnel.

      The study will be a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial among
      ambulatory deployed personnel. Patients presenting for care will be clinically assessed and a
      determination made as to whether they have acute watery diarrhea (AWD) or acute
      dysentery/febrile diarrhea (ADF). For the AWD arm, patients will be randomized to receive 1
      of 3 regimens: (1) rifaximin 1650 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed
      by 2 mg after each unformed stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (120 subjects); (2)
      azithromycin 500 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after
      each unformed stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (120 subjects); or (3) levofloxacin
      500 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed
      stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (120 subjects).

      For the ADF arm, patients will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 regimens: (1) azithromycin
      1000 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed
      stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (75 subjects); or (2) azithromycin 1000 mg as a
      single dose without loperamide (75 subjects).

      Study Procedures (Brief): Baseline exam as well as blood and stool samples will be collected
      at initial clinic visit. Clinical assessments will be performed at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7
      days. In addition, microbiological cure will be evaluated at 7-d post initiation of
      treatment. Subjects will have blood drawn to assess for serological conversion to common
      enteric pathogens, and stool collected at 7- and 21-d . Subjects may also opt in for
      long-term follow-up at time of enrollment, which will assess for development of
      post-infectious functional bowel disorders. All subjects will complete a baseline assessment
      at 7-d visit, and those who opt for the additional follow-up will complete a series of
      web-based surveys at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-m post enrollment.
