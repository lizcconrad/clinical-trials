  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOR-NRI like Tapentadol are expected to reduce signs and symptoms of central sensitisation
      besides effectively reducing pain intensity in pain. Human pain surrogate models can serve in
      this proof-of-concept study to further elucidate this assumption.

      To evaluate exploratory the antihyperalgesic effect of a single dose of Palexia® IR
      (Tapentadol) in two human experimental models of 1) cold and mechanical (pinprick)
      hyperalgesia after topical application of menthol at high-concentration [40%] and 2) of heat
      and mechanical (pinprick) hyperalgesia by topical applied capsaicin [0.6%] in comparison to
      placebo. Therefore, cold, heat and mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia will be determined
      by parameters of the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). These parameters are cold and heat
      pain thresholds, mechanical pain threshold and sensitivity as well as dynamic mechanical
      allodynia. Further, the areas of dynamic mechanical allodynia and pinprick-hyperalgesia will
      be determined at each timepoint of QST-assessement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provided written informed consent to participating in the trial.

          2. Caucasian, female or male, and aged 18 years to 55 years, inclusive.

          3. Body mass index between 18.5 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, with a lower body weight
             limit of 50 kg.

          4. In good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG,
             vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure),
             oxygen saturation, and laboratory monitoring (hematology, clinical chemistry,
             clotting, and urinalysis).

          5. Subjects must be able to feel thermal and mechanical sensation (cold, warm, sharp,
             unpleasant sensation) on normal skin (at the forearm intended for menthol / capsaicin
             administration) confirmed by routine neurological bed-side testing.
