  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to keep our immune systems healthy over our lifetime, certain cells in the bone
      marrow and lymph nodes called stromal cells nurture the immune cells and protect them from
      damage. Stromal cells and blood cells communicate using a protein called SDF1a. The
      investigators think that cancer cells including lymphoma and multiple myeloma can trick the
      stromal cells into helping them avoid damage from chemotherapy by using SDF1a.

      Plerixafor is a drug developed to block the effects of SDF1a and has been approved by the
      Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans to help release blood stem cells from the
      bone marrow for use in transplantation. The use of plerixafor to interrupt communication
      between stromal cells and cancer has not been approved by the FDA and is experimental.
