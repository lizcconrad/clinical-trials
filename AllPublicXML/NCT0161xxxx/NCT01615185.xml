  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Surveys have shown that antipsychotic drug combinations are frequently
      prescribed. Amisulpride, an atypical antipsychotic agent, has low incidence of extrapyramidal
      symptom (EPS) but with high cost compared to sulpiride. The objective of the study is to
      compare the efficacy and safety of the 800-mg/d amisulpride and 400-mg/d amisulpride plus
      800-mg sulpiride in the treatment of acute psychotic exacerbations of schizophrenia.

      Method: In this 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study, patients with schizophrenia are
      randomly assigned to amisulpride (800 mg/d) or amisulpride (400 mg/d) plus sulpiride (800
      mg/d).The hypothesis is that the two treatment groups have the similar efficacy and safety,
      but different cost.

      Background: Antipsychotic monotherapy is recognized as the treatment of choice for patients
      with schizophrenia. Surveys have shown that antipsychotic drug combinations are frequently
      prescribed, yet few clinical studies have examined this practice. Amisulpride, an atypical
      antipsychotic agent, has low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) but with high cost
      compared to sulpiride. It has been reported that mean doses of low-potency typical
      antipsychotics less than 600 mg/day of chlorpromazine equivalent dose has no higher risk of
      EPS than atypical antipsychotics. The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and
      safety of the 800-mg/d amisulpride and 400-mg/d amisulpride plus 800-mg sulpiride in the
      treatment of acute psychotic exacerbations of schizophrenia.

      Method: In this 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study, patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV
      diagnosis) are randomly assigned to amisulpride (800 mg/d) or amisulpride (400 mg/d) plus
      sulpiride (800 mg/d). The hypothesis is that the two treatment groups have the similar
      efficacy and safety, but different cost. The efficacy assessment was the change from baseline
      in the score on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and subscales (positive scale, negative scale, general psychopathology
      scale), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and Global Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF). Safety assessments include the change from baseline on Simpson-Angus
      Rating Scale (SAS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS),
      and UKU Side-effects Rating Scale (UKU), and the change from baseline in prolactin levels,
      body weight, vital sign, blood pressure, AC glucose level, and lipid profiles(cholesterol,
      high density lipid protein [HDL], low density lipid protein [LDL], and triglyceride [TG]).

    <description>Body weights, body mass index (BMI), pulse rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for QTc intervals (Bazett's correction of QT interval), and laboratory tests were performed to determine safety. Laboratory tests included fasting glucose, liver function (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), renal function (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine), lipid profiles (triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL], and low density lipoprotein [LDL]), and prolactin level.</description>
