      Purpose The aim of this study is to examine if a structured pelvic floor muscle training
      combined with lifestyle advice with can improve pelvic organ prolapse (POP) symptoms more
      than structured lifestyle advice programme alone.

      Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition among adult women and almost one
      in ten women experience symptoms caused by POP. The key symptom of POP is seeing or feeling a
      bulge in the vaginal opening but POP often gives other symptoms, such as pain, difficulty
      emptying the bladder or the bowel, incontinence and sexual problems such as dyspareunia.

      A majority of women with POP will be offered reconstructive surgery but the risk of
      reoperations is substantial and surgery may cause new symptoms. In one out of four women
      surgery does not relieve symptoms and the women have been exposed to unnecessary risk of
      complications.

      It is therefore important to evaluate the effect of conservative treatments for POP. New
      studies have shown that pelvic floor muscle training offered in combination with lifestyle
      advice has a significant on POP symptoms and objective measures of POP compared to a
      lifestyle advice leaflet alone.

      No studies have compared the effect of a combined pelvic floor muscle training and lifestyle
      advice programme with a structured programme of lifestyle advice and hypothetically the
      structured lifestyle advice programme could have a substantial effect on its own. Our
      hypothesis is that the pelvic floor muscle training is a vital component of a conservative
      treatment for POP.

      Methods In this single-blind randomised controlled study women with POP will randomised to
      either a programme of structured pelvic floor muscle training combined with lifestyle advice
      or a structured lifestyle advice programme alone. Both groups will receive the same lifestyle
      advices through six (separate) lectures within 12 weeks. The training group will be examined
      and individually instructed in pelvic floor muscle training before the intervention starts
      and they will, in continuation with their lifestyle lectures, perform pelvic floor muscle
      training as group training

    <description>Group 1 will be individually examined and instructed in pelvic floor muscle training before the intervention starts by specialized physiotherapists. The examination includes a vaginal or an anal examination. The women attend six group sessions within 12 weeks containing structured information about POP and the possible affection of POP on quality of life, exercising and sexual relationship. The lifestyle advice contains information about life style changes that could improve POP symptoms, such as bladder and bowel habits, coughing, heavy lifting, eating habits and weight loss. The women will perform pelvic floor muscle training in the group and they will perform pelvic floor muscle training at home. The training will be individually planned according to the findings of the pelvic floor physiotherapist. The women in the intervention group fill in an exercise diary and also describe on a Visual Analog Scale if the training causes any bother.</description>
