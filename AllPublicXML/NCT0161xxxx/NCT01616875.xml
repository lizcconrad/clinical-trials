  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      26 patients with invasive primary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder will receive 4
      cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of Cabazitaxel and Cisplatin both given
      intravenously on day 1 of each 3 weekly cycle prior to radical cystectomy, to evaluate the
      overall response rate and to determine whether this approach warrants further research of a
      phase II/III study.Participation in 2 sub studies will also be offered to the participants.

        1. Contrast Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) scans will be taken at baseline and after
           cycle 1 and cycle 3.

        2. A pilot sub study involving the circulating tumour cell concentration from blood samples
           taken at baseline, prior to each cycle of chemotherapy and prior to surgery
