    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in
      patients with acute skin graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the complete and partial response rate of steroid-resistant skin GVHD
      exceeds 25% after administration of brentuximab vedotin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of brentuximab vedotin on the clinical manifestations of acute GVHD of
      the liver and gastrointestinal tract.

      II. Determine the incidence and degree of brentuximab vedotin-related toxicity when
      administered after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      III. Evaluate cluster of differentiation (CD)30 expression in skin biopsies before and after
      administration of brentuximab vedotin.

      IV. Enumerate CD30 expressing lymphocytes in the blood and measure the concentration of
      soluble CD30 in serum before and after administration of brentuximab vedotin.

      V. Determine whether changes in CD30 expression in skin biopsies or blood lymphocytes or the
      concentration of CD30 in serum before and after administration of brentuximab vedotin are
      correlated with changes in skin GVHD stage.

      VI. Evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of brentuximab vedotin in patients after allogeneic HCT.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with steroid-resistant stage 2 or 3 acute GVHD of the skin with or without
             involvement of other organs; patients must have received initial therapy with
             prednisone or methylprednisolone at a prednisone-equivalent dose of at least 1.0
             mg/kg/day alone or combined with other agents, including psoralen and ultraviolet A
             (PUVA), with:
