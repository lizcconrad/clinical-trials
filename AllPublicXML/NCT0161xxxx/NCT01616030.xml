  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated surgically for a hip fracture have a need of rehabilitation for the regain
      of former functional skills. Despite an optimized fast track in-hospital rehabilitation
      program it has been found that patients with hip fracture within 2 weeks after the hip
      fracture loose more than half of their muscle strength in the fractured limb compared to
      non-fractured limb. New studies including patients with total hip arthroplasty and strength
      training applied early after surgery has shown promising results regarding prevention of loss
      of muscle strength. No similar study has been found including patients with hip fracture.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of progressive knee-extension
      strength training of the hip fractured limb, starting Day 1 after surgical treatment for a
      hip fracture and proceeded every weekday during their hospital stay.

      The study will include 20 patients surgically treated for a cervical hip fracture and 20
      patients surgically treated for an intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture. All
      patients are admitted from their own home. Age 60 years or older.
