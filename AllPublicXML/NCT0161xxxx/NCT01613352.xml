    <textblock>
      The aim was to assess the patient compliance and medical and psychosocial effects of same day
      hospital discharge after breast conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy only.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with small breast tumours (&lt;2 cm)and clinically node negative disease, were
      randomized to receive breast conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy as ambulatory
      surgery or inpatient-surgery.Complication rate, patient satisfaction and psychosocial
      outcomes were compared. The psychosocial effects of the treatment mode on their spouses were
      recorded as well.
