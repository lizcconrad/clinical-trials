    <description>The participant was asked, &quot;Please rate your overall satisfaction based on your experience with the study lenses over the last 2 weeks. When considering your rating, please take into account comfort, vision, and handling, but disregard the appearance of the lenses.&quot; Overall satisfaction was rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1=Not at all satisfied, and 10=Completely satisfied.</description>

          -  Cylinder ≤ -0.75 diopter (D).

          -  Able to achieve visual acuity (VA) of at least 20/30 Snellen in each eye at distance
             with contact lenses (CLCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 20/25.

          -  Have spectacles that provide acceptable vision and be willing to wear them if unable
             to wear the study lenses.

          -  Successful daily wear of single-vision spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes
             during the past 3 months for a minimum of 8 hours/day, 5 days/week.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eye injury or surgery within twelve weeks immediately prior to enrollment in this
             trial.
