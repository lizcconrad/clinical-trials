  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current recommended antibiotic, Cefazolin, treatment for vascular surgery, provides
      coverage only for Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureaus (MSSA), other gram-positive
      bacteria, and some gram-negative bacteria which may not be adequate antibiotic treatment at
      the time of vascular surgery and result in an increased hospital length of stay, increased
      cost of care, and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality as a consequence of surgical
      site infections. Thus, the investigators want to compare whether Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus Aureaus (MRSA) antibiotic prophylaxis with Cefazolin plus Daptomycin is
      superior to Cefazolin plus Vancomycin in the reduction of surgical site infection (SSI)
      following open arterial revascularization procedures requiring a groin plus lower extremity
      incision. The investigators hypothesis is that Cefazolin plus Daptomycin is superior to
      Cefazolin plus Vancomycin in the prevention of SSI for high risk patients undergoing open
      groin plus lower extremity procedures.

      There is an increase in surgical site infection (SSI) due to MRSA. The current recommended
      antibiotic, Cefazolin, treatment for vascular surgery, provides coverage only for
      Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureaus (MSSA), other gram-positive bacteria, and some
      gram-negative bacteria. To demonstrate that MRSA coverage is needed in vascular surgery with
      prosthetic graft placement in areas of the body that is at high risk for infection, the
      investigators are initiating a second study of patients undergoing groin plus lower extremity
      procedures by using combination antibiotics such as Cefazolin plus Daptomycin, Cefazolin plus
      Vancomycin. By decreasing post surgical site and prosthetic infections, the investigators
      could significantly reduce vascular surgery mortality and morbidity. Cost and amputation
      rates the investigators feel could also be reduced. Patients will be randomized in two groups
      -- Cefazolin plus Daptomycin, Cefazolin plus Vancomycin and will be evaluated during post
      procedure before discharge or within 30 days and between 30 and 360 days, for postoperative
      complications including cellulitis, graft infection, sepsis, limb loss, graft failure, and
      length of stay. If a patient is re-hospitalized, reason for the return and whether it is
      related to the procedure will be evaluated. Additionally, is there a graft failure,
      amputation, infection, hematoma, pseudoanurysm will be assessed. In case of a wound
      infection, the type of organism and finally, length of this hospitalization will be recorded.
