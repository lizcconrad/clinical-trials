      The purpose of this study is to examine differences in driving performance on a simulated
      driving assessment between novice teen drivers who receive the Risk Anticipation-Perception
      Training (RAPT) program and novice teen drivers who do not receive the training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crashes remain the number one cause of death among teens in the United States.
      Teen drivers (ages 16 to 19) are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than
      adult drivers (ages 25 to 69). Driving simulators are a safer alternative to on-road
      assessments that are often affordable and can provide experimental control for research.
      Though driving simulators have advantages for evaluating driving performance in teens, there
      are gaps in the literature on the validity of a multidimensional outcome of driving
      performance in a simulator. To further examine the validity of a multidimensional measure of
      driving performance in a simulator, we compare simulated driving performance among teens who
      are trained hazard anticipation-perception training and those who are not.

    <description>Simulated driving performance will be measured by the number of driving errors made during the simulated drives. The simulated driving performance will be compared across each arm, Intervention and Control. Intervention arm: Simulated driving performance will be measured at least 1 week after completion of the RAPT (Hazard Awareness) training program; Control arm: Simulated driving performance will be measured after enrollment and completion of pre-assessment measures.</description>
