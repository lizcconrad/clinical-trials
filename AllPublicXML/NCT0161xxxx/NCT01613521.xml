  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess how patients respond to their treatment for cervical cancer. This
      research does not involve a specific treatment for the cancer that will be recommended by the
      doctor and may include radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. This is a separate research
      imaging study designed to assess how patients respond to their treatment for cervical cancer.

    <description>For each DCE-MRI parameter, the relative percent change from baseline to the two-week measurement will be calculated. These values will be assessed using ROC curves to evaluate whether they are predictive of tumor response.</description>

    <measure>predict disease-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>baseline tumor perfusion parameters are predictive of disease-free survival at 2 years and 5 years, the primary analysis will again be an ROC analysis, but with the ROC curves modified to take into account the censored failure-outcome. We will create time-dependent ROC curves using methods described by Heagerty et al.</description>

    <description>Each patient will undergo three DCE-MRI (dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) studies: a baseline DCE-MRI within two weeks before chemoradiation; a second DCE-MRI after the second week of treatment (within a week); and a third DCE-MRI three months after treatment. As a pilot study in 10 patients, we will perform 18F-FMISO PET/CT on the same day of a baseline DCE-MRI before chemoradiation. Treatment decisions will not be based on DCE-MRI and 18F-FMISO PET/CT studies.</description>

             (FIGO) stage IB1 and above).

          -  Treatment (chemoradiation), DCE-MRI and 18F-FMISO PET studies will be at MSKCC.

          -  Patients must be an adult female 18 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who because of general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic
             status cannot give an informed consent.

          -  Patients who received prior radiation treatment to pelvis.

          -  Patients with contraindications to DCE-MRI (non-compatible cardiac pacemakers or
             intracranial vascular clips, allergy to Gadolinium, end-stage renal disease) and/or
             18F-FMISO PET.

          -  Patients who do not fulfill the screening criteria for safe DCE-MRI or 18F-FMISO PET
             as per the Department of Radiology guidelines.

          -  Pregnant patients; and or patients who are breast-feeding their babies.
