  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the association between steroid exposure and five potentially
      steroid-related adverse events within a cohort of individuals with systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). Study objectives are to quantify the fraction of the risk of new (i)
      diabetes, (ii) hypertension, (iii) cataracts, (iv) osteoporosis and (v) avascular necrosis
      that is attributable to cumulative corticosteroid exposure in SLE patients. The study will
      consist of five matched case-control analyses nested within the Hopkins Lupus Cohort. Cases
      will be incident SLE cases who have developed one of the case outcomes (diabetes,
      hypertension, cataracts, osteoporosis with fracture or vertebral collapse or avascular
      necrosis). Controls will be matched to cases on time since SLE diagnosis. The primary
      exposures to be assessed are cumulative dose of steroid (g) and cumulative duration of
      exposure to steroids. The extent of the risk associated with steroids will be explored
      through modeling of the relationship and through calculation of attributable risks of
      exposure (number of cases associated with the highest exposure quartile of each primary
      exposure).

        Cases and controls will be identified from the Hopkins Lupus Cohort, a prospective
        longitudinal study of lupus activity, organ damage, and quality of life in patients with
        SLE which has followed patients up since 1987. The cohort database is continually updated
        and includes socio-demographic information, medical and reproductive history,
        comorbidities, SLE complications, and treatment. Data, collected at each patient visit,
        includes SLE clinical activity indices, laboratory data and treatment (medication and
        dose).
