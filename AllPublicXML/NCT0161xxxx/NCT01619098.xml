  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital readmissions are common, costly, and potentially preventable. They are also
      potentially responsive to health system interventions. However, it is uncertain which
      components of care transition interventions are efficacious, for which populations, and at
      what cost. This randomized controlled study is part of a larger project that will evaluate a
      three-tiered quality improvement (QI) intervention intended to reduce hospital readmissions
      within 30 days post-discharge from an urban safety net hospital that serves a racially and
      linguistically diverse population (the randomized controlled study evaluates Tier 3). Few
      studies have evaluated care transition interventions to reduce readmissions among low-income,
      diverse patient populations, and the accumulated evidence on the effects of these
      multi-faceted interventions on readmission rates has been inconclusive. This project will
      take advantage of a unique sequence of three QI innovations to reduce hospital readmissions
      implemented beginning in 2007 in an integrated safety net health care system. The
      &quot;discharge-transfer&quot; tiers are as follows: 1) Tier 1 includes a comprehensive, individualized
      home care plan (HCP) reviewed by the medical service floor nurse with the patient prior to
      discharge; 2) Tier 2 adds the electronic transmission of the HCP to the patient's primary
      care medical home where, on the business day following discharge, a Registered Nurse makes an
      outreach telephone call to the discharged patient to confirm comprehension of the HCP and to
      address medical questions or needs; 3) Tier 3 further adds a community health worker, the
      Patient Navigator, to participate in bedside discussions to develop rapport and learn about
      patients' home situations, weekly outreach calls to assess patients' needs and to facilitate
      communication between the patient and the primary care team, and reminder calls to patients
      prior to all medical appointments to eliminate barriers to outpatient follow-up. The Aim of
      the study being registered is to evaluate the effects of an ongoing randomized natural
      experiment on readmissions, health care use, adherence to medication instructions, and
      preparedness for discharge. This natural experiment features random assignment to one of two
      QI interventions, Tier 2 or Tier 3, and exclusively targets patients at high risk for
      readmission, those with one or more of the following risk factors for readmission: discharge
      diagnosis of congestive heart failure or COPD; length of stay &gt; 3 days; age &gt; 60; or previous
      hospitalization within the past six months.

      The investigators hypothesize that the Patient Navigator intervention (Tier 3) compared to
      usual care (Tier 2) will increase the rates of 30-day post-discharge PCP visits; reduce
      30-day hospital readmission rates; and reduce the total number of days in hospital in the 180
      days following the index admission for high risk patients. The investigators further expect
      that the PN intervention will improve patient adherence to medication instructions in the HCP
      and reduce the probability of reported problems with post-discharge care.
