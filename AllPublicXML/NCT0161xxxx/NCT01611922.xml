    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess eyelid margin staining, termed &quot;lid wiper
      epitheliopathy&quot; (LWE), in three populations. The hypothesis is LWE will be more prevalent in
      symptomatic contact lens wearers than non-symptomatic contact lens wearers and least
      prevalent in asymptomatic non-contact lens wearers.

    <description>Lens wearers must wear lenses for a minimum of 8 hours on the day of assessment, after which lenses will be removed and dye will be instilled. LWE-associated staining will be assessed by the investigator and reported as a composite score based on Korb's method.</description>
