      The primary efficacy analysis will be the clinical benefit at 6 months as measured by a
      modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST classification. Key secondary
      endpoints of objective response rate, progression free survival, time to progression,
      duration of response, effects on physical function, and effects on tumor progression in women
      with Androgen Receptor positive breast cancer will also be assessed.

        1. Give voluntary, signed informed consent in accordance with institutional policies.

          2. Be a woman that has been diagnosed with ER positive metastatic breast cancer.

          3. Have metastatic breast cancer with measurable lesions prior to enrollment or bone only
             disease prior to enrollment. A measurable lesion is defined as one lesion whose
             longest diameter (LD) can be accurately measured as 10 mm CT or MRI technique by using
             a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. Measurable lesions must be at least 2
             times the slice thickness or at least two times the size of the CT scan interval cut.
             Patients with bone only disease and non-measurable lesions are eligible.

          4. Be clinically confirmed as postmenopausal. Subjects must have undergone the onset of
             spontaneous, medical or surgical menopause prior to the start of this
             study.(Spontaneous menopause is defined as the natural cessation of ovarian function
             as indicated by being amenorrheic for at least 12 months. If the subject has been
             amenorrheic for &gt; or equal to 6 months but &lt; 12 months, they must have a serum FSH
             concentration of &gt; or equal to 50 mIU/mL and an estradiol concentration of less than
             or equal to 25 pg/mL. Medical menopause is defined as treatment with a luteinizing
             hormone receptor hormone agonist and surgical menopause is defined as bilateral
             oophorectomy).

          5. Have been treated and responded to previous adjuvant hormonal therapy for 3 years or
             previous hormonal therapy for metastatic disease for 6 months prior to disease
             progression.

          6. Have not had radiation therapy for breast cancer within 2 weeks of randomization in
             this study and are not planned to have radiation therapy during participation in this
             study.

          7. Be willing to provide a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block(s) of cancerous tissue
             from a biopsy of a metastatic tumor lesion(s) collected during the two (2) years prior
             to study entry or as a component of enrollment in the study for determination of AR
             and ER status. Tissue samples from a biopsy of a primary tumor lesion will also be
             provided if available.

          8. Serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL

          9. Have ECOG score 2.

         10. Be age 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects with any of the following will NOT be eligible for enrollment in this study:

          1. Have triple negative breast cancer

          2. Have, in the judgment of the Investigator, a clinically significant concurrent illness
             or psychological, familial, sociological, geographical or other concomitant condition
             that would not permit adequate follow-up and compliance with the study protocol

          3. Have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg despite treatment with
             antihypertensive drugs)

          4. Untreated congestive heart failure or untreated angina

          5. Have Stage 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

          6. Have positive screen for Hepatitis B consisting of HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface
             Antigen), unless subject was diagnosed &gt; 10 years prior to enrollment and no evidence
             of active liver disease

          7. The presence of consistently abnormal clinical laboratory test (Appendix B) values
             which are considered clinically significant. In addition, any subject with total
             bilirubin above 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or liver enzymes ( ALT/SGOT or
             AST/SGPT) above 1.5 times the ULN without evidence of liver metastases or above 5
             times the ULN in subjects with evidence of liver metastases will not be admitted to
             the study

          8. Have positive screen for hepatitis A antibody IgM or HIV

          9. Have received chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer within the 3 months prior to
             enrollment in the study or be expected to receive chemotherapy for metastatic breast
             cancer during the study

         10. Be currently taking testosterone, methyltestosterone, oxandrolone
             (Oxandrin®),oxymetholone, danazol, fluoxymesterone (Halotestin®), testosterone-like
             agents (such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, and other androgenic
             compounds, including herbals), or antiandrogens. Previous therapy with testosterone
             and testosterone-like agents is acceptable with a 30-day washout (if previous
             testosterone therapy was long term depot within the past 6 months, the site should
             contact the medical monitor (1-877-693-2723) for this study to determine appropriate
             washout period).

         11. Have untreated or uncontrolled brain metastasis

         12. Have been diagnosed with or treated for cancer within the previous two years, other
             than breast cancer or non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin.
