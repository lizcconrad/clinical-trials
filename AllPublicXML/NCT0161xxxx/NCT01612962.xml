      In this study, the investigators will perform a retrospective chart analysis of patients that
      underwent a bony debridement or amputation in the operating room at Georgetown University
      Hospital during 2009-2010 under Drs. Steinberg and Attinger. Chart reviews, medical records
      and operative reports via EMR and paper charts will be examined from inpatient records, the
      Center for Wound Healing, the Emergency Department as well as other institutions involved in
      the care of the subjects to gather data.

    <textblock>
      Osteomyelitis is present in approximately 20% of cases of foot infection in persons with
      diabetes [1, 2] and greatly increases the likelihood that the patient will require a
      lower-extremity amputation [3, 4]. Early diagnosis and treatment drastically improves
      prognosis. While there are multiple modalities through which osteomyelitis is diagnosed,
      unfortunately there is no definitive method. Bone biopsy with histopathological and
      microbiological analysis has been deemed the gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis [3,
      5].

      Osteomyelitis is considered proven if one or more pathogens are cultured from a reliably
      obtained bone specimen that shows bone death, acute or chronic inflammation and reparative
      responses on histological examination. However, histological analysis can also produce
      falsely positive results based on sampling error or if there are other causes of inflammation
      [6]. Furthermore, a recent study done by Meyr et al. has highlighted a discrepancy amongst
      pathologists that leaves the medical community questioning the validity of some pathological
      diagnoses.

      Microbiological analysis can differ based on specimen processing and is also dependent on
      sampling technique. Often results can be falsely negative because of sampling error, prior
      antibiotic therapy, or inability to culture fastidious organisms; likewise, they may be
      falsely positive because of contamination by wound-colonizing flora [6].

      Also, cultures of superficial swab samples from diabetic ulcers and sinus tracts may not
      adequately identify the true bacteriological characteristics of diabetic foot osteomyelitis
      because of bacterial colonization of the wound surfaces with microorganisms that are
      typically not considered to be pathogenic (such as enterococci and coagulase-negative
      staphylococci) [7]. Senneville et al. attempted to define the true correlation between
      cultures of swab samples and cultures of bone biopsy specimens obtained from areas of
      osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. It was found that swab cultures are inaccurate and
      unreliable indicators of the pathogenic organism in chronic diabetic foot osteomyelitis and
      there was overall poor concordance between the superficial swab culture and bone biopsy
      culture results for all microorganisms [8].

      Other methods for diagnosing osteomyelitis include radiographic analysis. On plain film,
      osteomyelitis is suspected when one or more of the following radiographic signs is observed:
      periosteal elevation, cortical disruption, medullary involvement, osteolysis, and sequestra
      (segments of necrotic bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue) [9]. Signs of
      osteomyelitis only show up on plain film 10-20 days after infection, [10, 11]. Dinh et al, in
      their meta-analysis on radiographic modalities, found 54% sensitivity and 68% specificity in
      detecting osteomyelitis with plain film versus 90% sensitivity and 79% specificity with MRI
      [12].

      To the investigators' knowledge, there has been no study that compares all these methods to
      determine if there is a superior test to determine osteomyelitis.
