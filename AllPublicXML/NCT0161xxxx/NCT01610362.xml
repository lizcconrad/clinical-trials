    <textblock>
      Dosage of rabies immune globulin was calculated from the victim's body weight, then the
      amount of rabies immune globulin would be injected as much as possible to all of the wounds.
      Increase dosage of rabies immune globulin was needed in situation of multiple severe
      bite-wounds especially among children whose had lower body weight than adults. Our study
      would be conducted in order to determine whether the increase dosage of rabies immune
      globulin would interfere with the protective antibody levels against rabies.

      -  Controlled trial study.

        -  All 50 volunteers who had never had rabies immunization would be enrolled and designated
           into 2 groups.

      group 1 : 15 Healthy volunteers age 18 - 60 yr who were attacked by mammals, possible exposed
      to rabies and had WHO category III exposure, all receive standard post - exposure rabies
      treatment with 5-dose intramuscular rabies vaccine on day 0,3,7,14,28 and 20 IU/kg of human
      rabies immune globulin (HRIG).

      group 2 : 35 Healthy volunteers age 18 - 60 yr receive 5-dose intramuscular rabies vaccine on
      day 0,3,7,14,28 and 40 IU/kg of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG).

      5 cc - Blood would be drawn from all volunteers before vaccination and on day 14, 28 and 90
      for rabies neutralizing antibody titers (RNab).

      The GMTs of RNab among both groups would be analyzed and compared.
