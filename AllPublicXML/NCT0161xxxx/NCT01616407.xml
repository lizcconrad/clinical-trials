    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the effects of a single dose of
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)and methylphenidate (MPH) on emotional and social
      cognition in healthy subjects. The investigators hypothesize that MDMA enhances affective
      perception for positive and impairs perception for negative emotional stimuli compared to
      placebo or MPH.
