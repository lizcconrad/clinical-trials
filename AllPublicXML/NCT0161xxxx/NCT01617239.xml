      The goal of the study is to assess the safety and immune response after vaccination with
      different doses and vaccination schedules of virosomal influenza vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virosomal influenza vaccine is usually administered intramuscularly as a single 0.5 mL dose.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different doses and
      vaccination schedules. A total of 84 healthy adults aged 18-50 years will be randomized
      (1:1:1) into 3 treatment groups: subjects of group 1 will receive a standard dose (0.5 mL) at
      Days 1, 29, and 57; subjects of group 2 will receive a double dose (1.0 mL) at Day 1 and a
      standard dose (0.5 mL) at Day 57; subjects of group 3 will receive a triple dose (0.5 mL) at
      Day 1. Local and systemic solicited adverse events up to Day 4 after each vaccination will be
      documented. To assess the subjects' humoral and cellular immune response against homologous
      and heterologous virus strains, blood will be drawn from each participant at baseline (Day
      1), at the 4 subsequent monthly visits (Months 1 to 4) and at Month 12.
