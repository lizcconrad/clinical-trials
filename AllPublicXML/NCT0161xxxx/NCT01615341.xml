  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft injury is the leading cause of graft loss in renal transplantation. The
      shortage of available kidneys for transplantation has reached crisis levels with increasing
      numbers of waiting list mortalities. Strategies to prolong graft survival are urgently
      needed. The pediatric and young adult transplant population is one in which repeat
      transplantation is inevitable and therefore, this group is one who will especially benefit
      from intervention to prolong graft survival. The hypothesis of this proposal is that
      subclinical viral infection is a modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis of chronic
      allograft injury. The young age of the proposed study population is an ideal one to evaluate
      this objective due to the high prevalence of seronegative recipients. The studies outlined
      will determine the temporal relationship betWeween subclinical viremia, renal allograft
      infection and allograft injury. This will be the first prospective study in renal transplant
      recipients to systematically monitor subclinical viral infection both in peripheral blood and
      in the renal allograft with concurrent quantitative measures of renal function, allograft
      fibrosis, and innate immune activation. The investigators have chosen these 3 outcomes
      because they evaluate a spectrum of renal allograft injury and represent different stages -
      from early to late - in the pathophysiology that leads to renal allograft dysfunction. In
      addition, the role of virus specific T cell immune responses in the control of subclinical
      viral infection and associated allograft injury will be determined. These data are critical
      as they will provide insights into the pathogenesis of injury and will guide development of
      interventions strategies. Importantly, the current treatment strategies for viral disease do
      not prevent subclinical viral infection. Thus, the results of this study may identify that
      prevention, prophylaxis and/or treatment of subclinical viral replication as a long term
      strategy to prevent chronic allograft injury and prolong graft survival.
