        <title>Change From Mean Part A Primary Impairment Visual Analogue Scale Score (After 6 Weeks) at the End of Four Weeks of Open-label Treatment (10 Weeks Total)</title>
        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the Part A study score (mean of all scores during the last two weeks of six weeks of double-blind therapy) in the severity of the primary impairment (mean of all scores during the last two weeks of four weeks of open-label therapy), a composite score from one of five multiple sclerosis symptom categories that subjects nominated as their most severe symptom. The severity scores were recorded using a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 = no problem and 100 = very bad. As such, a decrease in score indicates an improvement and a negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Mean Part A Guy's Neurological Disability Scale Score at the End of Open-label Treatment</title>
        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. The Guy's Neurological Disability Scale has 12 separate categories which include cognition, mood, vision, speech, swallowing, upper limb function, lower limb function, bladder function, bowel function, sexual function, fatigue, and 'others'. Each category consists of a series of questions, which are scored on a 0 to 5 scale, with 0 being indicative of a better outcome and 5 being indicative of a worse outcome. The total Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale score is the unweighted sum from the 12 categories with a minimum score of 0 and maximum of 60. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Mean Part A Care-Giver Strain Index Score at the End of Open-label Treatment</title>
        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. The Caregiver Strain Index is a 13-item questionnaire designed to detect strain in those that care for subjects. Carers were asked if they found certain situations difficult (i.e. work adjustments, family adjustment, emotional adjustments, physical effort). Each question was scored zero (answered no) or one (answered yes), and was recorded for each of the 13 questions. The summary parameter was the total score, which was the sum score of the 13 questions, giving a minimum possible score of 0 (no strain) and maximum possible score of 13 (maximum possible strain). As such a negative value from baseline indicates an improvement in caregiver strain.</description>

All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 1-5 scale): 1= no increase in muscle tone to 5= passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100; minimum score was 20. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition. As such, a negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. The Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration test is a questionnaire designed to measure orientation, concentration on simple tasks and learning and recall of simple information. The test consists of six items, such as 'what year is it now?' and 'count backwards from 20 to 1'. Each item was scored between 0 (maximum number of errors) and three-10 (best score; no errors), with a point deducted for each error. The summary parameter was the total score from the sum of scores for each item, with an overall possible maximum score of 28 (no errors). Scores over 20 are considered ‘normal’. As such, an increased score indicates an improvement, and a positive value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Mean Part A Barthel Activities for Daily Living Score at the End of Open-label Treatment</title>
        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning, specifically the activities of daily living and mobility. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder. The ability to undertake the different daily activities was assessed on scales of 0-1 to 3, with 0= poorest outcome and upper scores= best outcome. The total score was the sum of scores for each item; minimum score= 0, maximum score= 20. A change of two or greater in the total score indicating a clinically relevant change. A positive value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. The Rivermead Mobility Index is a measure of subject self-mobilisation and was developed to enable rehabilitation professionals to document the effect(s) of interventions. This consisted of 15 questions relating to the dexterity and/or mobility of the patient. Each question had a 'yes' / 'no' answer which was scored as yes=1 no=0. The summary parameter was the total for the 15 questions, with a maximum score of 15. An increased score indicates improvement. As such, a positive value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

This consisted of 15 questions relating to the dexterity and/or mobility of the patient. Each question had a 'yes' / 'no' answer which was scored as yes=1 no=0. The summary parameter was the total for the 15 questions, with a maximum score of 15. An increased score indicates improvement. As such, a positive value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Mean Part A Total 28-item General Health Questionnaire Score at the End of Open-label Treatment</title>
        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. The 28-item General Health Questionnaire is a self-reported questionnaire for the detection of non-psychotic mental disorders (anxiety and depression) in the community and primary care settings. A series of four subscale scores (ranging from 0 [good] to 21 [bad]) were combined to give a total score, which ranged from 0 (good) to 84 (bad). As such, a negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

The total bladder control test score was the sum score from fifteen questions, which were each scored on a 0-2 scale (one question 0-3), where 0 = good and 2/3 = bad. Ten questions were related to bladder symptoms and control and five were related to the effects on the patient's life. The summary parameters were the total score with a minumum possible score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 31. A decrease in score indicates an improvement, as such a negative value indicates an improvement in condition from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Part A Mean Muscle Spasm Visual Analogue Scale Score at the End of Open-Label Treatment</title>
        <description>This was achieved by measuring the change in the mean Part A study score (during six weeks of therapy) to the mean score at the end of 4 weeks of open-label treatment with GW-1000-02. Severity scores over the last 24 hours were recorded using a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale on one nominated day each week. Scores ranged from 0 = no problem to 100 = very bad. A decrease in score indicates an improvement. As such, a negative value indicates and improvement in spasms from baseline.</description>
