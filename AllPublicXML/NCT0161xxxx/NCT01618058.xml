  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if exposure to ARV-containing investigational
      products in IPM clinical trials will impact the natural history of HIV infection as measured
      by the virologic, immunologic and clinical outcomes of participants who become HIV-positive
      during the IPM 027 trial.

        Both microbicide and placebo recipients in IPM 027 who have become HIV infected (HIV-1 or
        HIV-2) while participating in IPM 027 will be offered enrolment in IPM 007 at the exit
        visit of IPM 027, i.e. approximately 6 weeks after identification of HIV seroconversion.

        This study includes all active IPM clinical research centres that enrol participants for
        IPM microbicide trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent HIV seroconversion during participation in IPM 027, according to the HIV
             testing algorithm of that trial

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent

          -  Willingness to give the research centre permission to share information with the
             primary health care provider (PHCP), and willingness to sign approved site-specific
             documentation to facilitate such sharing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude provision of
             informed consent, make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.
