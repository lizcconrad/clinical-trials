    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label phase II trial to evaluate the oral daily use of BKM 120 in
      patients with recurrent unresectable or metastatic cervical cancer after palliative cisplatin
      based regimen failure.

      A complete treatment cycle is defined as a 28 days period.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be assessed in the pretreatment visit and the
      informed consent must be taken before treatment assignment. The diagnosis and extent of
      disease, the medical history, and the current medical condition should be recorded by the
      investigator in a pretreatment visit. Adverse events will be recorded including type,
      severity, graded by CTCAE V 3.0, seriousness and potential relation to the investigational
      drug.

      The efficacy assessment will be done by MRI and recorded in the patients' clinical chart.
      Tumor dimension assessments will be performed at baseline through abdominal/pelvic magnetic
      resonance imaging, to be repeated in 3 months intervals and evaluated according RECIST
      criteria. The first cohort, composed by the 06 first patients, will undergo a separate
      positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) evaluation at baseline and 90 days apart.

      Laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry), ECG and physical examination will be done on
      every visit.

      Drug pharmacokinetics will not be assessed in this study. For the screening Baseline periods,
      see chart attached The treatment will be continued until progressive disease or intolerable
      toxicity
