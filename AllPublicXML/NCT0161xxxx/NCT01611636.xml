  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of the allergic, autoimmune and rheumatic diseases are different
      all over the world. The relative impact of gene and environment on diseases can be revealed
      by studies from different populations. National Health Insurance database in Taiwan provides
      a wealth of epidemiology study, which can contribute to the understanding of these diseases.
      However, national health care database did not contain test results and clinical details. The
      database of the hospital records can provide complimentary clinical details. Via the
      comparison of databases of the National health Institutes and the investigators hospital, the
      investigators hope that the characteristics and outcomes of these patients can be better
      understood.

      The incidence and prevalence of the allergic, autoimmune and rheumatic diseases are different
      all over the world. The relative impact of gene and environment on diseases can be revealed
      by studies from different populations.

      National Health Insurance database in Taiwan provides a wealth of epidemiology study, which
      can contribute to the understanding of these diseases. However, national health care database
      did not contain test results and clinical details. The database of the hospital records can
      provide complimentary clinical details. Via the comparison of databases of the National
      health Institutes and the investigators hospital, the investigators hope that the
      characteristics and outcomes of these patients can be better understood.

      Briefly, epidemiology of target disease such as age, sex, incidence and prevalence will be
      derived from national database. Medical source utilization such as medication and surgery
      related to target diseases is also available in national database, providing material for
      cost analysis. These data can be compared with hospital database to ensure validity and
      reliability.

      The investigators study is intended to provide epidemiology of target disease and cost
      analysis. Interaction between diseases will also be explored.

      Target diseases Allergic diseases: Asthma(ICD9 493.x),Steven-Johnson syndrome and other
      erythroderma (ICD9 695.x)

      Autoimmune diseases: Thyroid disease (ICD9 246.x), Addison disease (ICD9 255.x), type 1
      diabetes mellitus (250.x1)

      Rheumatic diseases: gout (ICD9 274.x), SLE (ICD9 710.0 ), RA (ICD9 714.0), AS and spondylitis
      (ICD9 720.0&amp;720.x), Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (ICD9 696.0), scleroderma (ICD9 710.1),
      Sjogren's syndrome (ICD9 710.2), dermatomyositis (ICD9 710.3), polymyositis (ICD9 710.4),
      ANCA vasculitis (WG 446.4, MPA, CSS, PAN ICD9 446.0) or vasculitis 447.6, Behcet's
      disease(ICD9 136.1), Temporal arteritis(ICD9 446.5), Takayasu arteritis (ICD9 446.7),
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura (ICD9 287.0)
