      The purpose of the post-market study is to demonstrate that the KineSpring System is
      non-inferior to high tibial osteotomy in safety and effectiveness in the treatment of
      symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the knee.

      The primary objective of the study will be to:

        -  Demonstrate the non-inferiority of the KineSpring System compared to the standard
           surgical, high tibial osteotomy procedure in improving pain and function outcomes (as
           measured by the WOMAC pain and function subscales) at 24 months in patients with
           primarily uni-compartmental medial knee osteoarthritis.

        -  Demonstrate that the KineSpring System is safe as measured by procedure and
           device-related complication rates through 24 months post-operatively

    <description>The KineSpring System is implanted through two medial incisions, one on the distal femur and one on the proximal tibia. Femoral and Tibial bases are fixed with screws to the femur and tibia. An absorber connects the two bases and offloads forces normally transmitted to the medial compartment of the knee.</description>

    <description>There are two ways to perform a high tibial osteotomy: a closed wedge osteotomy (CWO) or an open wedge osteotomy (OWO). An OWO cuts the bone, increases the angle and fills the gap with bone graft. A CWO removes a wedge of bone to achieve the change of angle. The surgery involves the gaping or wedging of a piece of bone and its removal to change the pressure points of weight-bearing activity, thus redistributing the load to the unaffected compartments of the knee. The cut surfaces of the bone are typically held together with a plate and screw system.</description>
