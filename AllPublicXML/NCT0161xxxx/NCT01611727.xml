  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among women with a BRCA1 mutation and breast cancer, choice of chemotherapy is a critical
      issue. There are emerging data which suggest that mutation carriers may respond differently
      than non-carriers to particular agents. BRCA1-associated cancers differ from non-hereditary
      cancers for a range of pathologic and molecular factors, including tumor grade and histologic
      appearance. Several studies have shown that the response to treatment for women with a
      BRCA1-associated breast cancer reflects the underlying tumor biology, in particular, the
      impairment of the DNA damage response and repair pathways, and that it is possible to exploit
      the sensitivity of BRCA1-associated cancers to DNA damage.

      It is equally important that the investigators evaluate the benefit of cisplatin in women
      with disseminated breast cancer, including those who have previously been treated with one or
      more chemotherapy regimens. This study is undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin
      chemotherapy in BRCA1 carriers with metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective is to
      determine the objective response rate of cisplatin in BRCA1 carriers with metastatic breast
      cancer. The secondary objectives are to determine 3-year survival and to evaluate the
      toxicities of cisplatin in BRCA1 carriers with metastatic breast cancer.
