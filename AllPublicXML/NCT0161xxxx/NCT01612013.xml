  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a common cause of acquired in-hospital renal
      insufficiency and is associated with prolonged hospitalization and unfavorable early and late
      outcomes. The investigators sought to compare 4 different strategies (intravenous high-dose
      of N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, the combination of both, and saline alone) in the
      prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary
      angiography using high-osmolar contrast media defined by creatinine and cystatin C serum
      levels.

    <description>The primary end point of the study was the development of contrast-induced acute kidney injury based either on the creatinine and/or Cystatin C increase between day 0 (when contrast media was administered) and 72 hours (creatinine; Cystatin C increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL increase and/or 10% increase, respectively within 72 hours after contrast media administration).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary end point was development of CI-AKI in a subgroup of high-risk patients, including patients with diabetes mellitus and those with pre-existent kidney disease defined as calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2.</measure>
