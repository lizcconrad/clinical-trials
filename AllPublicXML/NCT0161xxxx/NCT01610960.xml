  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a well established, safe, and effective technique in
      improving gas exchange while reducing dyspnea and inspiratory effort in patients with either
      hypoxemic and hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF) and averts the risk secondary to
      endotracheal intubation.Crucial factors for NIV success, in any forms of respiratory failure,
      are the tolerance to the interface used and the ability of the interface to unload
      inspiratory-muscle. Helmet is better tolerated over time, allowing continuous application of
      NIV for longer periods, while face mask has been proved to be more efficient at iso-support
      in unloading the respiratory muscles and improving patient-ventilator synchrony. Helmet NEXT
      (CaStar, NIV model, Starmed, Mirandola, Italy) is a novel type of helmet with a better
      compliant wall, that avoid the use of armpit braces potentially improving, compared to the
      standard helmet, both pressurization and patient-ventilator interaction and tolerance. The
      objective of this study is to compare the effects of NIV delivered via face mask, standard
      helmet, and NEXT helmet in terms of work of breathing, patient-ventilator interaction, and
      comfort.

      16 Healthy volunteers will be enrolled. They will be ventilated with non invasive
      ventilation. The Work of breathing, ventilator/patient asynchrony, and ventilatory comfort
      produced between face mask, Helmet and NEXT helmet will be compared.
