  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study in Japanese patients with
      CRPC or advanced BC. LFA102 will be administered intravenously once every 4 weeks during the
      study. All patients will remain on treatment until they meet the criteria for study
      discontinuation (e.g. disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal) or
      study closure.

      This study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary
      anti-tumor activity of LFA102. Each cohort will enroll a minimum of 3 patients. A
      two-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model employing the escalation with overdose
      control principle will be used during the escalation phase for dose level selection and for
      determination of the MTD or RD.
