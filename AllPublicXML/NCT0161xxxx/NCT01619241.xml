  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to determine whether 18F-FLT PET/CT can predict which
      patients will have poorer progression free survival and overall survival in advanced
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after first-line therapy and, therefore, need more
      aggressive treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC is platinum based doublet chemotherapy.
      Current first-line chemotherapy is usually limited to 4-6 cycles, as prolonging treatment
      does not result in additional benefit and may often cause further toxicity. Until recently,
      treatment guidelines recommended withholding administration of later-line systemic
      anti-cancer treatment until disease progression.

      There are several reports suggesting that maintenance therapy following first-line
      chemotherapy offers improved survival in advance stage patients. This approach involves the
      administration of an active treatment immediately after first-line chemotherapy, thus
      maintaining the clinical benefit initially obtained. However, drug related toxicity and costs
      are of great concern. There may also be patients with less aggressive disease where an
      immediate transition to maintenance therapy after first-line results in overtreatment.

      Therefore, selecting patients who require more aggressive treatment or earlier intervention
      is necessary.

      If FLT PET/CT can discriminate the patients with shorter progression free survival and
      overall survival in this pilot study, patients could be selected for more aggressive or
      earlier treatment such as maintenance therapy, and the investigators could expect to prolong
      survival while reducing the adverse events and costs that will accompany inconsequential
      therapy with FLT PET/CT.
