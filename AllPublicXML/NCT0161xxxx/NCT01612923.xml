    <textblock>
      The physical examination before an abortion is usually performed by a physician. However, in
      many countries access to physicians is limited. To increase access to safe abortion this
      study wishes to examine if midlevel providers such as specially trained midwives can provide
      safe abortion services. Midwives in study were specially trained to perform early pregnancy
      ultrasound and if needed to consult a physician. The midwife then provided the abortion
      service as well as the contraceptive advice. Women were randomized to receive the service
      from a midwife or a physician.
