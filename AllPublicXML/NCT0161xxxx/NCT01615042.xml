  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also be directly toxic to
      tumor. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells or directly
      kill them. We will be studying how lenalidomide can be used to decrease bone marrow blast
      cells in preparation for a bone transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that lenalidomide in high doses can be used to decrease bone marrow blast
      count in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia in preparation for an
      allogeneic stem cell transplant with acceptable toxicities that are no worse than current
      cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The known dose-limiting toxicity at 75 mg was excessive
      fatigue in a previous phase I trial which in this study may be irrelevant as all study
      participants will have an in-patient status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          -  Non-M3 Acute Myeloid Leukemia with the presence of residual disease in the bone marrow
             on day 14-28 post induction (or re-induction) chemotherapy. Day 14-28 residual disease
             is defined in this study as the presence of more than 10 % blasts in the marrow,
             presence of between 5-10% blasts cells that are not in cluster in hypocellular marrow
             is ambiguous and bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in 5-7 days.

          -  Patient should have an already identified sibling, matched unrelated donor or cord
             blood donor at the time of enrollment to this clinical trial.
