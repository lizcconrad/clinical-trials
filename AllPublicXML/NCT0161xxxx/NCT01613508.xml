    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the results of an established, successful
      procedure, which is total hip arthroplasty through a mini-posterior approach to a less
      studied - increasingly popular procedure, which is total hip replacement through the direct
      anterior approach utilizing the orthopedic table.

    <description>An oblique incision is made over the anterior margin of the tensor muscle. The fascia of the tensor muscle is identified and incised. The muscle is swept digitally laterally and a retractor is placed over the superior aspect of the femoral neck. The hip capsule is then incised and retracted.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Mini-Posterior Approach</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The surgical approach involved a 7 to 9.5 cm incision along the posterior aspect of the femur starting at the tip of the greater trochanter and proceeding distally. The fascia of the gluteus maximus was split, and blunt dissection revealed the underlying abductor and external rotator musculature. The external rotators an the hip capsule were incised and preserved as one layer, with an attempt being made to preserve the insertion of the quadratus femoris on the femur. The hip was dislocated posteriorly and the femoral neck was cut in accordance with the preoperative plan.</description>
