  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TPO-r Switch is a retrospective study of the patients affected by Immune Thrombopenia (ITP)
      who received alternatively romiplostim and eltrombopag.

    <textblock>
      Thrombopoietin mimetics agents are available since 5 years in France through clinical trials
      first and then after their license. Two drugs are used: romiplostim and eltrombopag. These
      molecules have the same receptor on the megacaryocyte and induce the same stimulation of this
      cell leading to the differentiation and the proliferation into platelets. But romiplostim and
      eltrombopag have 2 different characteristics: the way of administration (oral for eltrombopag
      and subcutaneous for romiplostim) and the binding site to the C-MPL receptor on
      megacaryocyte. The aim of this study is to describe ITP patients who received these two drugs
      alternatively in order to know if there is a benefit for switching these molecules in
      clinical practice.
