      The purpose of this study is to explore the pharmacokinetics of different dosing regimens of
      rilpivirine in combination with rifabutin in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label (the participant will know the identity of the treatment they
      receive), 3-period study to investigate the pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the
      medication) interaction of steady-state (constant concentrations in your blood resulting from
      a fixed dosing regimen) rilpivirine and steady-state rifabutin. Twenty healthy participants
      will be enrolled and will receive 3 different treatments (treatment A: rilpivirine 25 mg once
      daily administered daily for 11 days; treatment B: rilpivirine 50 mg once daily administered
      for 11 days + rifabutin 300 mg daily administered for 17 days; treatment C: rilpivirine (in a
      regimen to be determined based on an interim analysis of treatments A and B) administered for
      11 days + rifabutin 300 mg daily administered for 17 days). All 20 participants will be
      randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance) to receive treatments A (10 participants)
      and treatment B (10 participants) and there will be a washout period of at least 21 days
      between treatments A and B. After all participants have completed treatments A and B, there
      will be an interim analysis to decide upon the dosing regimen for rilpivirine in treatment C
      (the rilpivirine regimen in treatment C could be either once daily or twice daily with a
      total daily dose of rilpivirine between 25 and 75 mg). All 20 participants will receive
      treatment C. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants should be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, electrocardiogram, and the results of blood biochemistry and hematology
