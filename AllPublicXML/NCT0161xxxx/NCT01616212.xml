  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two brief, sustainable interventions for a sample of
      280 adolescents charged with an initial drug-related offense: Motivational Enhancement
      Therapy (MET) intervention for youth and the Parenting Wisely (PW) intervention for parents.
      Families are assessed for adolescent substance use, HIV-risk, recidivist substance-related
      offenses, treatment entry, and other areas of individual and family functioning.

      It is expected that the combined MET+PW interventions will be more effective than a
      treatment-as-usual intervention (drug education group) for adolescents with parents not
      participating in PW.

    <textblock>
      Illicit substance use and related problems among adolescents has been consistently high over
      the past decade and remains one of the most pressing public health concerns in the United
      States. The objective of this study is to conduct a pilot investigation of the feasibility
      and effectiveness of two brief empirically based treatments for adolescent substance abuse
      when implemented as early interventions for youth arrested and charged with first- or
      second-offense possession of alcohol or drugs. The two examined interventions are
      Motivational Enhancement therapy (MET) and Parenting Wisely (PW).

      Over a one-year period, 280 adolescents and their parents will be referred to the study by
      the Juvenile Justice Centers in two Oregon counties within the Portland metro area. Families
      will be randomized to one of four intervention conditions; youth will receive either MET or a
      drug education intervention (EDUC), and the PW intervention for parents is present or absent.
      Participants will be assessed for adolescent substance use, HIV-risk, recidivist
      substance-related offenses, treatment entry, and other areas of individual and family
      functioning at intake and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.
