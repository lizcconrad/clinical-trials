  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine infusions resulted in an acute reduction in global depression scores and in severity
      of suicidal ideation. Scopolamine infusions produced also a significant improvement in
      depression that was sustained over time.

      We therefore plan to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of open-label repeated
      intravenous administration of ketamine and scopolamine combined in this population of
      severely depressed, treatment-resistant patients. The results from this study could lead to
      the development of new strategies for the treatment of patients with TRD.

      Patients will undergo two weeks of prospective observation, they will then receive IV
      infusions of ketamine, scopolamine or both per randomization as augmentation of their ongoing
      antidepressant regime. The schedule of administration will be twice a week of three weeks.
      After this phase the subject will be followed with assessments every two weeks for three
      months.
