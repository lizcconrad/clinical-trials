  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The urea cycle consists of a series of chemical reactions through which the body converts
      toxic waste- nitrogen into a substance called urea that can be disposed of easily. While
      disposal of nitrogen is the major function of the urea cycle, recent research has shown that
      some enzymes of the urea cycle are also important for the production of nitric oxide. Nitric
      oxide is an important chemical that has many functions in the human body including regulation
      of blood pressure. Through this study, the investigators will study the production of nitric
      oxide in subjects with citrullinemia type 1 by administering stable isotopes to these
      subjects. Stable isotopes are harmless compounds that can be used to track and measure the
      production of specific compounds in the human body. The overall goal of this study is to
      understand if citrullinemia patients have a deficiency of nitric oxide production. This
      knowledge may have an impact on the treatment of patients with citrullinemia.

      This is an interventional, case control study to investigate the production of nitric oxide
      in patients with citrullinemia type I. Through the infusion of isotopes [15N2-ureido]
      arginine, [5-13C,4, 4, 5, 5-D4] citrulline, [15N]citrulline, 15N sodium nitrate and
      [15N][18O3] potassium nitrate, the flux of citrulline and nitrate through the urea cycle
      pathway will be measured in conjunction with an independent measure of total plasma arginine
      flux. This will be informative in dissecting the contributions of de novo production of
      arginine vs. exogenous contribution of arginine into total body NO flux. Total body urea
      production will be measured by the isotopic dilution of constantly infused [18O][13C]urea.
      These flux measurements will be correlated with the level of residual enzyme activity and
      clinical phenotype in these citrullinemia patients. The investigators plan to enroll three
      patients with citrullinemia.

      Three unaffected control subjects will also be studied.
