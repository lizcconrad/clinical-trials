  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which technology may be used to
      provide (a) state-of-the-art assessment and intervention for children diagnosed with autism
      and (b) parent and tutor training for those who care for these children.

      Children with autism often have problems with social interaction, language, and repetitive
      behavior (e.g., hand flapping and body rocking). Without early and intensive treatments, the
      long-term outcomes for children with autism are not very good; therefore, it is very
      important that effective treatments are started as soon as possible. Research has shown that
      Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI) is an effective treatment for autism.
      Although EIBI is effective, most children with autism in military families do not receive
      EIBI because there are few professionals and paraprofessionals that are appropriately trained
      to do this, especially in the remote areas where military families tend to serve. The
      investigators want to show that web-based technologies (e.g., web-cams and internet-protocol
      cameras) can be used so that professionals in one place can treat children with autism
      anywhere in the world. The investigators also expect that providing these services will help
      children with autism improve their language, social, and academic skills. The investigators
      expect that the gains made by the children will help relieve many daily stressors and worries
      that families with children with autism have.

      Children with autism who lack adaptive skills require constant help and supervision from
      parents. Thus, the improvements in the child's functioning will allow the child to become
      more independent and decrease parent stress associated with the need to constantly watch and
      help the child. Because EIBI services produce lasting improvements long after the
      intervention has ended, this project will provide both short-term and long-term benefits to
      the children who participate in the study, which will provide lasting relief to these
      dedicated military families.

      In the long-term, this project may really change the way in which all (military and
      non-military) children and families get effective services that they cannot get now. Also,
      the results may help other professionals and researchers in psychology and medicine. That is,
      the results should be helpful to any kind of service that uses parent training and
      paraprofessionals. Most importantly, these services will improve the overall functioning of
      the children with autism and decrease the overall stress on these families as they continue
      to serve our country.

      1. Specific Aim: Technology-enhanced parent training. The investigators will assess whether
           E-Learning using the latest web-based instructional technologies provides an efficient
           and effective mechanism for training military parents of children with autism,
           regardless of their geographic location, to implement effective behavior management and
           teaching strategies with high procedural integrity (90% accuracy).

           - Hypothesis: Technology-enhanced parent training. Military parents who have a child
           with autism can be trained anywhere in the world to implement appropriate behavior
           management and teaching strategies based on the principles of applied behavior analysis
           (ABA) with 90% accuracy. Parents who receive this technology-enhanced training remotely
           will outperform those randomly assigned to a waitlist-control group on competency-based
           tests.

        2. Specific Aim: Technology-enhanced ABA tutor training. The investigators will show that
           E-Learning using the latest web-based instructional technologies provides an efficient
           and effective mechanism for training adults to become ABA tutors who implement EIBI
           procedures with high procedural integrity (90% accuracy) in areas of the world where
           such services would otherwise be unavailable.

           - Hypothesis: Technology-enhanced ABA tutor training. Adults anywhere in the world with
           at least a high school diploma and no formal training in ABA can be trained in the basic
           principles of ABA and to implement EIBI therapy with 90% accuracy. Individuals who
           receive this technology-enhanced training remotely will outperform those randomly
           assigned to a waitlist-control group on both knowledge and competency-based tests.

        3. Specific Aim: Technology-enhanced EIBI services. The investigators will demonstrate that
           technology-enhanced telehealth provides remote access to efficient and effective EIBI
           services to military families affected by autism.

           - Hypothesis: Technology-enhanced EIBI services. Young children with autism in military
           families who receive EIBI services that are supervised by University of Nebraska Medical
           Center (UNMC) experts remotely via technology-enhanced telehealth will show marked
           improvements in cognitive, language, social, play, and adaptive skills and decreases in
           problem behaviors relative to children randomly assigned to a wait-list control group.

        4. Specific Aim: Reducing stress in military families affected by autism. The investigators
           will show that the provision of efficient and effective EIBI services using
           technology-enhanced telehealth will reduce family stress among military families
           affected by autism.

             -  Hypothesis: Reducing stress in military families affected by autism. Military
                parents of children with autism who receive technology-enhanced EIBI services will
                show reductions in self-reported stress levels on both the Child Domain and Parent
                Domain subscales of the Parenting Stress Index relative to parents on the
                waitlist-control group.

    <description>The investigators will use the Differential Abilities Scales, Second Edition (DAS-2; Elliott, 2007) as the primary dependent measure because it is particularly useful for measuring the cognitive abilities of young children; it covers a large age range (ages 2-6 to 17-11); it is well standardized; it has strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability (.90 to .95); and it correlates well with other measures of intelligence (M r = .76).</description>

    <description>Almost all studies focusing on training parents and/or staff to implement behavior-analytic procedures include dependent measures that assess the extent to which parents display the following behaviors before and after training: (a) correct and incorrect instructions, (b) correct and incorrect prompts, (c) correct and incorrect consequences for appropriate behavior, and (d) correct and incorrect consequences for problem behavior. These basic measures can be adapted to measure procedural integrity.</description>

The second part of the training involves a parent recruiting an adult friend, who will play the role of a child with autism. The adult playing the child with autism will wear a Bluetooth earpiece connected to a computer, which in turn will be connected to a UNMC expert. The expert will guide the actions of the adult playing the role of the child such that this confederate &quot;child&quot; will exhibit a variety of target behaviors relevant to the target skill, which will provide an opportunity for immediate feedback.</description>

    <description>After training, the ABA tutor and parents will assist in the implementation of early intervention services that will be tailored to the particular needs of the family's child. These programs could include conducting a paired-stimulus preference assessment, using a natural language program to increase spoken communication, and using matching-to-sample methods to teach categorization skills. We will record and review at least an hour of the ABA tutor's and parents' interactions with the child per week during unstructured and structured teaching situations. The purpose of these observations is to determine whether the parents are implementing the teaching strategies or behavior-management programs as designed (i.e., treatment integrity measures). If the ABA tutor or parent implements a program with less than 80% accuracy across two consecutive observations, an additional scripted role-play will be conducted as a booster session for the targeted skills.</description>
