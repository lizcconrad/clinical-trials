    <textblock>
      Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) is a novel proprietary delivery system of docetaxel
      developed by Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. In this Phase I study, the DT-LM was
      evaluated for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients
      with advance solid tumors. It was also evaluated for pharmacokinetic and anti-tumor effects
      of DT-LM compared to commerical docetaxel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere®), given by intravenous or intraperitoneal
      injection, has contributed significantly to the treatment of a variety of malignancies, such
      as ovarian, breast, gastric, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as head and neck
      cancer and some other cancers. In the preclinical, DT-LM showed reduced toxicity (especially
      myelosuppression）and comparable therapeutic efficacy. In clinic, it is believed that DT-LM
      will offer fewer side effects to the patient at similar doses, and possibly greater
      effectiveness when used at higher doses. DT-LM could not only avoid the serious
      hypersensitivity reactions caused by Tween 80, but also be stable, safe and convenient for
      clinical administration.

      This study is designed to determine the following:

        -  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of DT-LM.

        -  The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel following intravenous administration of DT-LM.

        -  Any anti-tumor effects of DT-LM.

      Controlled trial is also carrying out to reveal the differences in safety, pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics between DT-LM and Taxotere.

    <description>This Phase I, open-label, control,dose-escalation study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DT-LM in patients with advanced cancer. DT-LM was administered by intravenous infusion, over 1 hour, once every 21 days until occurrence of disease progression or toxicity requiring early treatment discontinuation. Dose escalation was not done until the safety and tolerability at a given dose level has been confirmed.</description>
