      -  To search the effects of montelukast on the airway inflammation including FEV1%,
           FEV1%/FVC, the provocholine® (methacoline chloride powder for inhalation) challenge
           tests, the leukotriene levels in the exhaled breath condensate in asthmatic children
           with and without food allergy aged 6-18 years old.

        -  To define the patient groups with good response to montelukast and to define the
           parameters which predict the good response.

      The aim of this analysis is to determine whether the children with food allergy may have more
      eosinophilic inflammation in the airways (as measured by FENO) or they may have Cysteinyl
      leukotrienes based inflammation in the airways that will be shown by high levels of Cys LT
      and low levels of lipoxin in the exhaled breath condensate. Our suggestion is that a special
      pattern of inflammation may be seen in asthmatics with food allergy because of their strong
      atopic march history and then we aimed to test if montelukast is more effective in children
      when the ratio of Cysteinyl LT inflammation is high relative to FENO (eosinophilic
      inflammation). This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of montelukast regarding
      the synthesis of Cys leukotrienes, lipoxin and FENO that will be measured from exhaled breath
      condensate, which is the mirror of the local inflammation in the airways in asthmatic
      children with atopy (food allergy). As we mentioned above another factor that we are planning
      to analyze is the ratio of Cys leukotriene to lipoxin, which is the natural antagonist of LT.
      This study will determine the ratio of Cyst LT to lipoxin and Cyst LT to FENO in the exhaled
      breath condensate and then there will be an analysis to see the correlation of these
      inflammatory markers with montelukast related changes on FEV1%, FEV1%/FVC.

    <description>The asthmatic children with and without food allergy will be given placebo and montelukast following one another in a cross over design. The study will be performed in 2 groups of patients (Patients with and without food allergy) parallel to each other at the same time and within each group the patients will take montelukast and placebo. A total of 5 spirometry tests (At the beginning and end of run-in periods, at the beginning of cross-over period, at the end of wash-out period and at the end of the study) will be done and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) will be evaluated.</description>
