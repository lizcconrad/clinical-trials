  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nelson's syndrome, an expanding pituitary tumour, occurs in up to 30% of adults after
      bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease, for which no medical treatment exists. Plasma
      Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) levels in these patients remain high, they are
      characteristically deeply pigmented, and may experience neurological effects as a consequence
      of the tumour. It is not known whether the tumour growth is due to the lack of cortisol
      feedback after adrenalectomy or whether the pituitary cells were preprogrammed to develop
      into a tumour.

      There is a real need for an effective medical management for Nelson's syndrome. This is
      especially true given the increasing data on the somewhat disappointing longterm outcome of
      transsphenoidal surgery, and the increasing use of aparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy for
      failures of pituitary surgery or even as primary therapy for Cushing's disease. Therefore, it
      is likely that there will be increasing numbers of patients attending endocrine centres
      worldwide with Nelson's syndrome following bilateral adrenalectomy as part of their
      management for Cushing's disease. In view of this it is important to investigate all
      potential avenues for the treatment of Nelson's syndrome and translate any benefits to
      patients.

      This study, designed and initiated by the investigators, will assess if pasireotide reduces
      ACTH levels and tumour volume in patients with Nelson's syndrome. Patients will be recruited
      for a period of 32 weeks and receive 4 weeks of pasireotide twice daily and then 24 weeks of
      pasireotide long acting release therapy every 4 weeks. Over the 32 week protocol patients
      will make 12 visits for serial ACTH blood measurements and have 2 MRI scans to assess tumour
      volume.
