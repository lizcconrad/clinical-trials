      Cancer surveillance has a significant cost and generate anxiety for the patient.

      It is important to avoid exams that will not modify health support or whose results wont
      allow to decide.

      Cancer surveillance has a significant cost and generate anxiety for the patient.

      It is important to avoid exams that will not modify health support or whose results wont
      allow to decide.

      Our study will help rationalise surveillance of soft tissue sarcoma and standardize medical
      practices.
