  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of wrist flexion and extension is a common problem after wrist and forearm fractures
      that may lead to disability and unsatisfactory outcomes after fracture treatment. In many
      patients, this range of motion loss is caused by stiffness of the soft tissues. Such
      stiffness may loosen up and improve with rehabilitation. Static progressive splints apply a
      constant stretch upon the wrist resulting in a stretch relaxation and plastic deformation of
      the soft tissues. By altering the splint's bending angle, one can incrementally increase the
      force applied on either wrist flexion or extension. There are no data comparing
      rehabilitation with static-progressive splinting to rehabilitation without static-progressive
      splinting for the restoration of wrist flexion and extension after wrist or forearm
      fractures.

      Primary study hypothesis:

      Two months after study enrollment patients that use static progressive splinting have better
      wrist flexion and extension than patients that use standard therapy techniques.

      Secondary study hypotheses:

        1. Six months after study enrollment, subjects that use static progressive splinting have
           better wrist flexion and extension than those that use standard therapy techniques.

        2. Motion at enrollment, 2 months and 6 months after enrollment correlates with negative
           pain thoughts, pain anxiety, and depression.

        3. Six months after study enrollment, subjects that use static progressive splinting have
           had fewer physical/occupational therapy visits than those that use standard therapy
           techniques.

        4. Six months after study enrollment patients that use static progressive splinting have
           had fewer additional surgeries than patients that use standard therapy techniques.

      This study will employ a prospective randomized design. Subjects will be invited to enroll
      during their routine office follow-up visit. Informed consent will be obtained. Subjects will
      be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to rehabilitation with or without static progressive splinting.

      All subjects will have a standard rehabilitation program including physical or occupational
      therapy and home exercises throughout the study. The static progressive splint will be
      prescribed according to the randomization sequence. Upon receipt of the splint, subjects will
      be instructed in proper application and use by their treating therapist or a representative
      of the company. Subjects will be instructed to follow the daily splint wearing protocol
      provided by the device manufacturer. Use of the splints will be discontinued at the patient's
      discretion or when a plateau phase in active range of motion is achieved (defined as no
      measurable gains in active range of motion achieved in a 30-day period).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon enrollment, a form containing demographic and injury-related information will be
      completed, and the subjects will fill out the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand
      (DASH) questionnaire. Subjects will be evaluated for negative pain thoughts, pain anxiety,
      and depression. Study staff will supervise and assist with the questionnaires. Subjects will
      be evaluated at 2 and 6 months after enrollment during their routine office visits. The DASH
      questionnaire will be filled out and active wrist motion will be measured using a standard
      goniometer by a research assistant who will not be involved in the care of the patient. The
      number of physical/occupational therapy visits, additional surgeries, ease of splint
      application and use, and splint protocol compliance will be recorded.

      The investigators intend to study the effectiveness rather than the efficacy of the splint,
      which means subjects will be free at all times to pursue an alternative treatment course and
      discontinue splint wear. The investigators will use intention to treat analysis.

      Radiographs and other diagnostic studies will be obtained at the discretion of the treating
      surgeon and will not differ from routine clinical care.
