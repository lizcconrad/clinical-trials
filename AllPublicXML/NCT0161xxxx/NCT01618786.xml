  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of novel compliant flooring in reducing injuries due to
      falls in a long-term care facility, determine the cost effectiveness of this intervention,
      and assess perceptions about compliant flooring among staff, residents, and families.

      The investigators hypothesize that compliant flooring will (1) reduce the incidence of
      injuries due to falls in long-term care residents; (2) represent an overall cost-savings when
      material and implementation costs are considered relative to direct and indirect costs
      associated with injuries due to falls; and (3) be received positively by staff, residents,
      and their family members.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the number one cause of unintentional injury among older adults in Canada, and are
      responsible for economic costs in excess of $1 billion CAD annually. In high-risk
      environments, such as long-term care (LTC) facilities, 60% of residents will experience at
      least one fall each year. Moreover, approximately 30% of falls in LTC residents result in
      injury, and 3 to 5% cause fractures.

      A promising strategy for reducing the incidence of fall-related injuries in LTC facilities is
      to decrease the stiffness of the ground surface, and the subsequent force applied to the body
      parts at impact. Purpose-designed compliant flooring can reduce the force applied to the hip
      during a fall by up to 35 % (to allow a raw egg to be successfully bounced without cracking).
      Yet, few LTC facilities have flooring designed to reduce the impact of falls. This study will
      address this gap.

      Resident rooms at a local LTC facility will be randomly assigned to installation of compliant
      flooring or control (non-compliant) flooring. Following installation, primary and secondary
      outcomes, including fall-related injuries and falls, will be monitored for 4 years and
      compared between resident rooms with and without compliant flooring. In addition, health
      resource utilization and their costs will be compared between resident rooms with and without
      compliant flooring. Perceptions about compliant flooring will be assessed among staff,
      residents, and their families.

    <description>SmartCell (SATECH Inc., Chehalis, WA, USA) is a continuous rubber surface layer supported by an array of cylindrical rubber columns 14 mm in diameter, and spaced at 19 mm intervals. It has a surface hardness of 50 durometer. It has been reported to provide approximately 35% peak force attenuation during mechanical tests that simulate falls on the hip. It has also been reported to have minimal effect on balance and mobility of older women during activities of daily living. It will be covered with hospital-grade vinyl and will be inspected regularly for maintenance requirements.</description>
