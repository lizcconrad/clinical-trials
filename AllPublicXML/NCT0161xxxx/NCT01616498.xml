  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to determine the relationship between intra-myocellular lipids
      and muscle contractility in fibers from obese and non-obese older adults. Obese participants
      are being recruited for an on-going weight loss intervention study and this application seeks
      approval to recruit and enroll a lean comparison group of non-obese older adults. The primary
      goal of this study is to characterize the contractile properties of single muscle fibers and
      whole muscle in healthy, non-obese individuals under the same recording conditions the
      investigators used for the obese population to begin to determine whether fat infiltration
      accounts for diminished force.

    <description>Primary Aim:
To measure single muscle fiber contractile properties, including specific force, unloaded shortening velocity, and maximum power. We will also measure whole muscle strength and size and fiber fat infiltration. These results will establish a reference database against which data recorded in older obese individuals can be compared.
Primary hypothesis: Single muscle fibers will exhibit more force and power in healthy non-obese than obese older adults due to greater intra-myocellular fat infiltration.</description>

    <ipd_description>All data will be made available upon email request to the study PI and upon completion of a data-sharing agreement. This agreement will require that data be used only for research purposes, that no attempts be made to identify individual patients, that the data will be kept secure, that the user will not distribute the data to other researchers, that the user will return the files or destroy them once the project is completed, and that the user will acknowledge the data source. All data files will be de-identified. In addition, variables that could permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual subjects will be removed or recoded. We will create a link on our website that describes our study and the data available for data sharing with descriptions.</ipd_description>
