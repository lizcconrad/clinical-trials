  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome of the two different, but widely
      used, surgical approaches (Posterior approach and Lateral approach) of primary total hip
      arthroplasty in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis. This study is divided into one main
      study and two sub-studies. The main study investigates the patient-reported outcome measures
      (questionnaire) within the first year post surgery. The two sub-studies investigate; i) the
      level of physical function and pain within the first 3 month after surgery, and ii)
      investigate the potential difference the two approaches have on gait-patterns and maximal
      isometric hip-muscle-strength, within the first year after surgery. Both approaches are
      described with potential drawbacks. Posterior approach has a higher risk of dislocation of
      the prostheses and revision due to dislocation compared with Lateral approach. Contrary,
      Lateral approach is described with the potential drawbacks of pain, lower physical function,
      gait abnormalities and muscle weakness, leading to less satisfied patients. However,
      according to a Cochrane analysis from 2004 concludes, more investigation is needed to
      determine the extent of differences.

    <measure>Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)-Physical Function Short form(HOOS-PS), 12 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Primary study:
Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) includes five subscales: 1)Pain 2) Other symptoms 3) Activities of daily living(ADL) 4) Sport and recreation function and 5) Hip related quality of life. HOOS-Physical Function Short form (HOOS-PS) is an aggregation and shortening of the two original subscales of HOOS-ADL and Sport and Recreation. HOOS-PS is a validated instrument. HOOS has been translated to Danish.
We will use HOOS-PS as primary outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month, 6 month and endpoint 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Primary study:
University of California Los Angeles activity score (UCLA) is a score focusing on patient activity level. The score is based on a scale from 1 to 10, ranging from inactive to regularly participate in impact sport or heavy labor. UCLA contributes with important qualitative information with regard to patient activity in correlation with other clinical outcome measures. UCLA is found reliable and valid and is translated to Danish.</description>

    <description>Sub-study 1:
The 20 meter walk-test (20MeWa). Patients are instructed to walk 20 meters between two clearly visible lines marked on the floor. The patients are instructed to walk with their usual pace on two trials and on the two following trials to walk at maximal pace, at which they feel secure. The mean velocity of each two trials are used for further analysis.</description>

    <description>Sub-study 1:
The &quot;Timed Up and Go&quot; test (TUG) measures the time it takes a person to rise from a chair walk 3 meters, turn and walk back to the chair and sit down again. TUG is found to be a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility.</description>

    <description>Sub-study 1:
&quot;Repeated chair rise&quot;- test (RCR) assess the strength of the lower limb muscles overall. The test measures the maximum &quot;stand and sit&quot; cycles the test-person can perform on a chair within in 30 seconds. The test has been showed to gives a reliable and valid measurement of lower body strength in generally active older adults.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 days, 21 days and endpoint 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Sub-study 1:
30 seconds maximal repeated unilateral knee bending. It evaluates the maximum number of knee bends performed on one leg in 30 seconds and the ability to execute fast coupled eccentric-concentric muscle force over the knee joint. The patient stand aligned with the front of their foot touching a straight line taped to the floor; finger tip support for balance is provided by the examiner. The patient is then asked to bend the knee, without bending forward from the hip, until he/she could no longer see the line at the toes (about 30º of knee flexion).</description>

Gait Deviation Index (GDI) was created to present gaitanalysis data in one score to give a comprehensive evaluation of the patients ambulation compared to healthy subjects. GDI is calculated from 15 kinematic variables, representing 98% of the variation in gait-patterns. A GDI score upon 100 represent normal gait. Every 10 points below this represent 1 standard deviation (SD) from normal gait.</description>
