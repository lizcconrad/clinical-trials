  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to advance the evidence base regarding methods for facilitating
      informed decisions among patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis by comparing DVD and
      online formats of decision aids for these conditions. The project will assess how these
      different formats impact key outcomes including: patient knowledge about treatment options,
      decisional conflict, preparation for decision making, decision self-efficacy, stage of
      decision making, and acceptability and usability of the decision aids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic conditions and a leading cause of pain
      and disability. Many patients with OA know very little about treatment options and are not
      well equipped to make informed decisions regarding these treatments. Further, there are
      racial and gender disparities in perceptions of the risks and benefits of total joint
      replacement, which also highlights the need to improve facilitation of informed treatment
      choices in these patients. Decision aids have great potential to improve patient
      satisfaction, safety, and outcomes for patients with OA, but there is no evidence base
      regarding best formats for delivering this information. This project will compare patient
      decision-making outcomes immediately following viewing of DVD and web-based versions of the
      Health Dialog DAs for hip and knee OA, as well as three days and one month later. Patients
      with symptomatic knee and hip OA (n=200) will be enrolled from a primary care and orthopedic
      clinics. Participants will be randomized, with stratification according to health literacy
      level, to view the DVD or web-based DA. Outcomes will include: Knowledge about OA and
      Treatments, Decisional Conflict, Preparation for Decision-Making, Decision Self-Efficacy,
      Stage of Decision Making, Acceptability and Usability of the DA, and home use of the DA. This
      project will make a novel contribution with direct clinical applicability, providing
      information regarding best methods for disseminating tools to enhance informed
      decision-making among patients with hip and knee OA, with particular attention to patients
      with low literacy.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge is a key outcome in this study because it is fundamental to informed decision making process 45. We will use the &quot;Facts about Osteoarthritis&quot; section of the Decision Quality Instrument - Knee Osteoarthritis (DQI-KOA; © Massachusetts General Hospital, 2010 46), which includes 8 items that assess knowledge about the knee OA and its treatment options (behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical). Although this instrument was developed for knee OA, the items are also appropriate for hip OA, and it will be used for both groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decisional Conflict Scale at Baseline to post.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Low Literacy version of this scale, which includes 10 items with 3 response categories (yes, no, unsure), across four subscales: Informed (do patients know the different options, benefits, and risks?), Values Clarity (are patients clear about which benefits and risk matter most to them?), Support (do patients have support and advice to make a choice?), and Uncertainty (are patients clear or sure about what to choose?).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decision Self-Efficacy Scale a Baseline to post.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 11-item scale that measures patients' confidence in completing various tasks related to the decision-making processes, such as getting facts about risks and benefits, asking questions, and expressing concerns. All items are measured on a scale of 0 (not confident at all) to 4 (very confident).</description>

    <measure>Measurement of the Acceptability and Usability Scale post viewing of the DAs.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>We will adapt a 10-item scale to assess the acceptability of this OA DAs. This tool assesses patients' opinions of general aspects of the DA (e.g., amount of information, length), as well as specific topical areas of the DA. In addition, for participants who are randomized to view the internet-based DA, we will use the Perceived Health Website Usability Questionnaire. This questionnaire includes items that assess the ease of finding information, ease of reading, appearance, and ease of learning from the website.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Semi-Structured Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>We will use semi-structured interviews to assess patients' perceptions and opinions of the DAs. Specific questions will be developed by the study team, covering the following topical areas: What participants liked about the DA, how well it answered questions they had about treatment options, any additional information to inform their decision-making, other suggestions for improving the DA, likelihood of using the DA to obtain information about treatment options, and how beneficial they think it would be to talk with a nurse / health educator about this information after viewing the DA.</description>

    <measure>Time spent viewing different parts of the internet-based DA</measure>

    <description>Installation of Spector Pro software onto the laptop computer on which participants will view the DA to capture information about participants' viewing of the DA. Descriptive data will be generated. Main variables we plan to evaluate are: 1.) The proportion of patients who view each page of the website. 2.) The mean or median number of minutes patients spent on each page. 3.) The proportion of patients who view video(s) within the DA. We will also compare these variables according to patient characteristics and changes in study outcomes.</description>
