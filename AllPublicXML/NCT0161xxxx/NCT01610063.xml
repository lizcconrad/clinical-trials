  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a study of a genotyping tool that reported on how subjects responded to medications
      and could be used in a community psychiatry practice to improve medication choice for
      depression. After the DNA test, an interpretive report was provided to the subjects'
      physicians. The hypothesis of this pilot study was that it was feasible to use this
      pharmacogenomic algorithm in a new setting to treat depressed subjects..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressant medications are among the most widely prescribed medications. However, only
      35% to 45% of depressed patients have a complete remission of their illness when initially
      treated with these medications. Consequently, the Mayo Clinic psychiatric pharmacogenomic
      team developed a pharmacogenomic algorithm designed to improve the effectiveness and safety
      of antidepressant medications by providing guidance in medication selection and appropriate
      dosing. This algorithm has been incorporated into a new genotyping interpretative report. The
      pharmacogenomic algorithm is based on genotyping both copies of four informative genes. These
      four genes are: 1) the Cytochrome (P450 2D6) gene; 2) the Cytochrome (P450 2C19) gene; 3) the
      Serotonin Transporter gene (SLC6A4); and 4) the Serotonin 2A receptor gene (5HTR2A). The
      trial took place at the Franciscan Skemp Healthcare System in La Crosse, Wisconsin over the
      course of 12 months.

    <measure>Percentage Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C16) Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8-week visit</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-C16 is a 16-item scale that is clinician-rated; it is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS-C16 total score ranges from 0-27. Scores ranging from 0 to 10 correspond with no to mild depression, while scores &gt;/= 11 correspond to moderate to severe depression. A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8-week visit</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17 score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8-week visit</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is the nine item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire. The PHQ-9 is based directly on the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 (no symptoms) and 27 (severe symptoms) for depression. A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression symptoms, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change in Outcome by Bin Status and Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8-week visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Genesight algorithm presents recommendations for antidepressants and antipsychotics in &quot;bin status&quot; associated with colors. Green indicates &quot;Use as Directed.&quot; Yellow indicates &quot;Use with Caution.&quot; Red indicates &quot;Use with Increased Caution and with More Frequent Monitoring.&quot; Definitions of the depression questionnaires are found in previous outcome measures. A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C16) Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The QIDS-C16 is a 16-item scale that is clinician-rated; it is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS-C16 total score ranges from 0-27. Scores ranging from 0 to 10 correspond with no to mild depression, while scores &gt;/= 11 correspond to moderate to severe depression. A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17 score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms.</description>
