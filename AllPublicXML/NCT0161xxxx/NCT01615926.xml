  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is defined as a gradual or rapid change in heart failure (HF) signs
      and symptoms, such as shortness of breath (also called dyspnea or breathlessness), leg
      swelling, fatigue, breathlessness with exertion, trouble sleeping flat at night, and weight
      gain resulting in a need for urgent therapy. AHF results in over 1 million hospitalizations
      every year, resulting in an enormous public health burden. Approximately 1/3rd of patients
      will either be re-hospitalized or die within three months, and the resultant financial costs
      are large. As such, improving outcomes for AHF patients is critically important. Shortness of
      breath is the most common reason why patients with AHF present to the ER. As such,
      understanding how severe this symptom is, how much it improves with current treatments is
      very important to both patients and physicians. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      degree to which your shortness of breath improves during the first few days of
      hospitalization and its association with how fast you are breathing.
