  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study tried to integrate all aspects of denture care: patient satisfaction with
      the treatment, denture decontamination and base material defects after decontamination
      processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering that it is necessary to stipulate a simple and effective routine protocol for
      denture cleaning the aim of this study was to evaluate, in vivo, the efficacy of 0.5% sodium
      hypochlorite (NaOCl) as a denture cleanser and its effect on color stability and surface
      roughness of complete dentures. The patients' satisfaction with the denture cleaning method
      was also assessed.
