  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first goal of this study is to learn more about the experience of pain and other symptoms
      in men being treated for advanced prostate cancer. The second goal of the study is to
      identify reliable ways of measuring pain which will be used in future clinical trials of
      treatments for advanced prostate cancer.

    <measure>pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score changes will be correlated with each of the following: patient rating of change in pain, as well as changes in patient functional status, analgesic use, and various measures of disease status (imaging, PSA, circulating tumor cells). The distribution-based approach is to estimate meaningful change as one-half a standard deviation of the sample mean pain score.</description>

    <description>A single-arm observational study will be conducted at three institutions in the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC): Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Johns Hopkins; and Oregon Health &amp; Science University. MSKCC is the coordinating center. The target enrollment is 400 patients, with at least 250 experiencing &quot;moderate or worse&quot; pain intensity at baseline, defined as a score of ≥4, the preferred regulatory cutoff.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Webcore telephone survey system</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will report pain and analgesic use through the automated telephone system, for 7 days in a row, once every 6 weeks. Data from diagnostic tests (CT Abdomen/Pelvis, Bone Scan, PSA, and circulating tumor cells) conducted during the study period will be collected from medical records by local personnel and entered into the secure online database quarterly, but no specific tests or schedules will be required in this observational study.</description>

        Eligible patients will be recruited from 3 different collaborating sites: MSKCC, John
        Hopkins, and OHSU. MSKCC will enroll approximately 200 patients, and John Hopkins and OHSU
        will each enroll approximately 100 patients; 400 participants will be enrolled in total.
        MSKCC is the coordinating site for this study.

          -  The subject must be ≥ 18 years old on the day of consent.

          -  The subject is able to understand written and spoken English.

          -  The patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  The subject must have castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

          -  The subject must have metastatic disease involving bone, seen on radiographic imaging
             (bone scan, CT scan, PET scan, or MRI).

          -  The subject must be in a castrate state (e.g., currently receiving androgen
             deprivation therapy or have had an orchiectomy).

          -  The subject must be starting any line of systemic treatment post-androgen
             deprivation/antiandrogen therapy, with any of the following: chemotherapy (e.g.,
             docetaxel, paclitaxel, carboplatin, cabazitaxel, or mitoxantrone); abiraterone
             acetate; MDV3100; ketoconazole; a clinical trial.

          -  The subject owns or has regular access to a telephone (cellular or land line).

          -  The subject is willing and able to self-report pain and analgesic use via an automated
             telephone system.

          -  The subject is willing and able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has small cell or predominantly neuroendocrine differentiated prostate
             tumor.
