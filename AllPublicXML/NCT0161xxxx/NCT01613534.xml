  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment regimens: argon
      plasma coagulation (APC) alone and APC in combination with sucralfate administered for
      chronic hemorrhagic radiation proctopathy.

    <textblock>
      Chronic radiation proctopathy (CRP) or proctosigmoiditis is a late complication of pelvic
      radiotherapy. Symptoms, including diarrhea, rectal bleeding, urgency, and tenesmus, are
      difficult to treat and adversely impact patient quality of life. Various treatments directed
      at the reduction of blood loss and improvement of other symptoms have been evaluated, with
      the most encouraging results reported for two methods: endoscopic argon plasma coagulation
      (APC) of radiation-induced abnormal vessels in the rectal mucosa, and administration of
      sucralfate, a drug believed to enhance the mucosal defense and healing when administered
      orally or rectally. Adequately powered randomized trials comparing various treatments are
      lacking, and an optimal management strategy has yet to be determined. To address this issue,
      we conducted a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study comparing
      the efficacy and safety of APC alone and APC in combination with sucralfate administered
      orally.
