  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if selenium supplementation to the standard
      treatment with anti-thyroid drugs in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, will lead to a
      fewer people with anti-thyroid treatment failure and faster remission, in terms of better
      quality of life during the first year of treatment and more patients staying in remission.

The participant has thyroid hyperfunction (TSH &lt;0.1) during the last 12 months (± 1 month) of the intervention period; or

    <description>To make sure we get information on serious adverse events, data on hospital admissions and mortality will be obtained through the national databases (the National Patient Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System) at the end of the trial. Also, participants are informed and instructed to contact their trial contact person in case they:
are admitted to a hospital for selenium intoxication;
experience a clinical picture indicative of selenium intoxication; or
experience a clinical picture unexpected, but suspected to be related to selenium intoxication.</description>
