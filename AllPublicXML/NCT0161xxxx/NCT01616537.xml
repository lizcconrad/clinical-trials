      Background Patient satisfaction with or acceptance of care assessment is increasingly taken
      into account in oncology. Most cancer and other critically-ill patients require a
      totally-implanted Central Venous Catheter (CVC) for their treatment consisting of a reservoir
      connected to a central venous catheter, which may or may not be valved. It is impossible to
      estimate the number of CVC used in oncology. However, some authors claim that, in 2005, over
      7 million CVCs were placed in the United States in both chronic and acute care. Although many
      patients fitted with a CVC are able to undertake activities which are hindered with other
      external vascular access devices, they are often physically or psychologically anxious about
      their device. To our knowledge, no validated questionnaire measuring patient acceptance of
      and satisfaction with their CVC has been reported in the literature. Based on these
      observations, the aim of our study was to develop and to validate a French-language
      questionnaire dubbed QASICC (Questionnaire for Acceptance of and Satisfaction with Implanted
      Central Venous Catheter) assessing patient satisfaction with and acceptance of their CVC.
      QASICC is designed as a multi-dimensional, self-administered questionnaire comprising
      approximately 30 items related to the use, appearance and pros and cons of the device as well
      as quality of life as perceived by patients using one for treatment.

      Objective The purpose of the study is to validate a French-language self-administered
      questionnaire (QASICC) designed to evaluate patients' satisfaction and acceptance concerning
      their totally-implanted central venous catheter: confirmatory validation of questionnaire
      psychometric properties.

      Study Design This is a prospective, multicenter, open study.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Questionnaire's 27 items tested on 990 patients to confirm QASICC internal structure:

        -  Items quality

        -  Dimensional structure

        -  Dimensional consistence

        -  Measure accuracy

        -  Measure reliability

        -  Sensitivity to change

      QASICC Questionnaire The QASICC questionnaire included 27 questions (Q) assessing seven
      dimensions: pain during placement or use (Q1, Q2), contribution to the comfort of the
      treatment (Q3, Q4, Q7, Q10, Q12), esthetics and privacy (Q5, Q6, Q8, Q11, Q17, Q19), the
      impact on professional activities, social and sports (Q9, Q13, Q14, Q18, Q20), the impact on
      daily activities (Q15, Q16, Q21, Q22 ), local discomfort (Q23, Q24, Q25, Q26) and overall
      satisfaction (Q27). The device-related answers were of two types: Likert or visual analogue
      scale. Four types of Likert response were available: &quot;no&quot;, &quot;low,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot;
      &quot;significant,&quot;/&quot;never,&quot; &quot;sometimes,&quot; &quot;often,&quot; &quot;always &quot;/&quot; very easy &quot;,&quot; easy &quot;,&quot; difficult
      &quot;,&quot; very difficult &quot;/&quot; not at all &quot;,&quot; somewhat &quot;,&quot; a lot &quot;,&quot; extremely &quot;. These questions are
      scored 0, 33, 67, 100, respectively, when the scores are correlated with symptoms, or 100,
      67, 33, 0 when the scores are inversely correlated with symptoms. Visual analog scales (VAS)
      have a length of 100 mm. The score represents the number of mm measured on the scale. A mean
      score of acceptance and satisfaction can be calculated on a scale of 0 to 100 for all seven
      dimensions using the following formula: {(100-score DO) + CO + score (score ES-100) + (100-PR
      score) + (100-ES score) + (score 100-IN) + SA score} / 7. The higher the overall score, the
      greater the acceptance and satisfaction

      The questionnaire is administered to the patient 30 days (+/-7 days) after CVC implantation.
