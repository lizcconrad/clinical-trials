      Primary objective:

      - To assess the safe usability of the VIBEX MTX device for subcutaneous (SC) self-injection
      of methotrexate (MTX) in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after standardized
      training by site personnel and review of written instructions

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the reliability and robustness of the VIBEX MTX device

        -  To evaluate the safety and local tolerance of an SC self-injection of MTX using the
           VIBEX MTX device

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness and ease of use of the VIBEX MTX device patient education
           tools for SC self-injection

    <description>A total of 101 patients were included in the Safety Population, which consisted of all patients who received standardized training by site personnel and review of written instructions. And then self-administered study drug using Vibex MTX device.
The Assessment of Essential Tasks Questionnaire was completed by site personnel documenting a patient's performance of essential self-injection steps, including the following:
SC self-injection was administered by the patient
SC self-injection was intentional
self-injection was administered in an appropriate location on the abdomen
patient removed cap marked &quot;1&quot;
patient removed cap marked &quot;2&quot;
patient held device at injection site for 3 seconds
patient confirmed that the window was obstructed</description>

    <description>A total of 101 patients were included in the Safety Population, which consisted of all patients who received standardized training by site personnel and review of written instructions. And then self-administered study drug using Vibex MTX device
Injection site assessments were done 0.25 hour, 1 hour, 6 hours and 24 hours after an injection and reported as the following:
Erythema - 0 = None
Erythema - 1 = Very slight, barely perceptible
Erythema - 2 = Obvious, but well defined
Erythema - 3 = Moderate to severe
Erythema - 4 = Severe</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were screened &amp; enrolled at 8 sites in the US. There were 20 subjects in 10mg, 30 subjects in 15mg, 31 subjects in 20mg and 20 subjects in 25mg dose group. The dose group was determined by the Investigator based on subject's current therapeutic regimen of MTX and disease status. The patient's dose was the same for the entire study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients received standardized subcutaneous self-injection training per Instructions For Use, then demonstrated the self-injection procedure with practice device and completed the training confirmation questionnaire. And then the subjects were allowed to self-administer the study dose via Vibex MTX.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Safe Usability of the VIBEX MTX Device for Subcutaneous (SC) Self-injection With Methotrexate (MTX) in Adult Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as Demonstrated by Successful Self-Injection</title>
        <description>A total of 101 patients were included in the Safety Population, which consisted of all patients who received standardized training by site personnel and review of written instructions. And then self-administered study drug using Vibex MTX device.
The Assessment of Essential Tasks Questionnaire was completed by site personnel documenting a patient’s performance of essential self-injection steps, including the following:
SC self-injection was administered by the patient
SC self-injection was intentional
self-injection was administered in an appropriate location on the abdomen
patient removed cap marked “1&quot;
patient removed cap marked “2&quot;
patient held device at injection site for 3 seconds
patient confirmed that the window was obstructed</description>
        <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
        <population>The safety population consisted of all subjects who received study drug and administered a successful or unsuccessful self-injection. For categorical data, percentages are presented.</population>
