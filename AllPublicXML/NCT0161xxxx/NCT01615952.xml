  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blockade of the brachial plexus using a supraclavicular approach provides excellent
      anesthesia for upper extremity surgery. The most serious complication specific to this block
      is pneumothorax. Subsequent modifications of this block including the use of ultrasound have
      lowered the risk from 6% to &lt;1%. Case reports remain and authors have described certain
      factors and strategies to reduce this risk. Most texts and journals describe the patient in a
      supine or semi-sitting position during the block. At the investigators institution the
      investigators perform the block in a semi-sitting position to facilitate needle tip
      visibility with ultrasound. The investigators plan to obtain ultrasound anatomic measurements
      in three different positions (supine, semi-sitting, sitting) using patients consented for
      supraclavicular nerve blocks.

    <description>Ultrasound measurements will be made at three different positions: Sitting, semi-sitting, and supine. The ultrasound measurements include A= skin to the pleura at the level lateral to the subclavian artery, B= skin to center of the subclavian artery, C= skin to first rib, D= skin to &quot;corner pocket&quot;</description>
