    <textblock>
      A Pancreas Transplant is the accepted treatment in patients with Insulin Dependent Diabetes
      Mellitus (IDDM) and end-organ failure. Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney (SPK) Transplant is
      done in over 90% of cases. At present there is a 5- 8% 30-day mortality with over 80% graft
      survival at 1 year. At Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) approximately 40 cases are done per
      year.

      Goal-Directed Therapy (GDT) involves fluid resuscitation intra-operatively and early in the
      post-operative period, guided by cardiac output monitoring. The mechanism of therapeutic
      benefit is thought to be related to improved tissue oxygenation and oxygen delivery. There
      are a number of studies showing significantly improved biochemical markers of inflammation in
      animal models and in studies on septic patients (patients with an overwhelming infection)
      following GDT. Studies have also shown that GDT improves clinical outcome in post-operative
      patients and in serum inflammatory mediators. These studies have looked at &quot;major abdominal
      surgery&quot; but none have investigated transplant patients. Given the nature of surgery we feel
      that our patients would benefit with reduced Intensive Care Unit stay, reduced length of
      hospital stays and reduced rates of post-operative complications.

      The study will be conducted on all adult patients undergoing pancreas transplant at MRI. It
      will last for 2 years and we hope to recruit 60 patients

      Patients will be randomised into Standard Therapy (ST) or GDT groups, with ST being current
      practice. Each intervention will last for six hours post-operatively before continuing with
      normal care thereafter. Omental fat biopsies will be taken from patients intra-operatively
      and blood samples will be taken from patients at regular intervals for 72 hours intra- and
      post- operatively. Patients will be followed up daily while an in-patient and at
      three-monthly intervals in out-patients for 1 year.
