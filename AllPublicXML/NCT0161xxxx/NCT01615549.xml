  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality devices are widely accepted tools to familiarize surgical novices with the
      principles of laparoscopy. Free Virtual reality training will be tested against basic
      training and efficacy assessed in a randomized controlled trial of surgical novices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality simulators are widely accepted tools to familiarize surgical novices with the
      principles of laparoscopy without jeopardizing patient safety. However, access to a Virtual
      reality simulator and initial instruction alone followed by free training of the surgical
      novice may not be sufficient to achieve the training goals efficiently. The aims of this
      study are to determine if proficiency based laparoscopic training on the Simbionx LAP Mentor™
      with external formative assessment using peer group derived benchmarks is superior to free
      training with self-assessment using the simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure with
      different endpoints (time to extract the gallbladder, serious complications, safe cautery and
      instrument pathways) as outcome parameters.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to extract the gall bladder.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes in average</time_frame>
    <description>The time to extract the gall bladder on a virtual simulator is typically 10 minutes. However this varies according to the settings of the difficulty chosen on the virtual reality software. This is a continuous variable measuring the duration for a trainee surgeon to extract the gall bladder (measured in seconds). The start point is the beginning of the exercise and the finishing point is once the gall bladder is completely resected (gall bladder mobilized and the cystic duct and artery dissected and ligated).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious intra-operative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes in average</time_frame>
    <description>Serious complications on a virtual simulator are considered injuries to the bile duct, hepatic artery, the bowel, or the liver bed. Such complications are automatically detected by the virtual reality software and recorded in a special database. This is a continuous variable with &quot;0&quot; indicating no complications, &quot;1&quot; indicating one complication, &quot;2&quot; indicating two complications, etc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safe cautery</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes in average</time_frame>
    <description>During a virtual laparoscopic cholecycetoctomy, cautery (also know as a coagulator, a device that utilizes electrical current for dissection or bleeding control)is commonly used to mobilize the gall bladder away from the liver bed. The virtual simulator software measures the percentage of the unsafe use of cautery. This is a continuous variable with 100% safe cautery indicating no unsafe cauterization around important structures such as the bowel, bile duct, hepatic artery, etc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total path length of right instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes in average</time_frame>
    <description>The total path length of the right instrument used to extract the gall bladder during a virtual laparoscopic cholecystectomy task measures the &quot;in and out&quot; movement of the right instrument. The higher the value, the more unnecessary movements are made during the task.</description>
