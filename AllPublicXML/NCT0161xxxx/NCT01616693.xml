  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The percentage of participants with a serologic immune response (seroconversion or four-fold
      rise in rotavirus IgA antibodies) to rotavirus vaccine at 14 weeks of age among infants
      receiving zinc or probiotic supplements will be at least 15% higher and significantly better
      to that of infants who receive a placebo for zinc or probiotic supplement.

    <measure>Change in Rotavirus IgA immune response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks post rotavirus vaccine dose 2</time_frame>
    <description>A serologic immune response to rotavirus vaccine will be defined as an increase in serum anti-rotavirus (RV) VP6 IgA antibodies consistent with seroconversion (detection of serum anti-RV VP6 IgA antibodies at a concentration ≥20 U/ml in a previously seronegative individual) or a fourfold rise in anti-RV VP6 IgA antibodies between baseline and 14 weeks of age.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Polio neutralizing antibody titer immune response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks post OPV dose 2</time_frame>
    <description>A serologic immune response to oral polio vaccine will be defined as a neutralizing antibody titer to polio virus subtype 3 greater than or equal to 1:8 at 14 weeks of age. This antigen will be used because it is conservative in that it gives the lowest immune response of all three polio antigens.</description>
