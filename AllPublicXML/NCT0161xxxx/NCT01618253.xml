      To determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose with concurrent sorafenib for unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma that has not responded to transarterial chemoembolization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), transarterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) is first line therapy. Non-responders to TACE (i.e. stable or progressive disease)
      represent a poor prognosis population with limited options. Sorafenib is indicated for first
      line salvage therapy, however it only improves survival 2-3 months and just has a 2-3%
      response rate. Thus, sorafenib is merely a cytostatic agent that delays progression and does
      not cytoreduce disease.

      Radiation therapy (RT) is a non-invasive treatment that can cytoreduce HCC with minimal
      morbidity using modern techniques. A meta-analysis and multiple retrospective series suggest
      TACE + RT improve survival when compared to TACE alone. Higher RT doses are similarly
      associated with increased survival due to improved local control. Paradoxically, some series
      suggest that RT can induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression which may
      stimulate HCC.

      Pre-clinical data suggest that combining RT with concurrent sorafenib (a VEGF inhibitor)
      improves tumor control. However, clinical data is limited to case reports and safety has not
      been well characterized. Prior to determining if this combination can improve control of HCC
      in this poor prognosis population, the optimal radiation dose with concurrent sorafenib must
      be determined by a phase I dose escalation trial.

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined by dose limiting toxicity (DLT) that is observed in either the acute (during treatment) or subacute (up to 3 months after treatment) setting. Acute DLT will be defined by grade 3-5 hepatic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, hematologic, or pulmonary toxicity per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE), v4.0. Subacute DLT will be defined by radiation induced liver disease (RILD) or grade 3-5 gastrointestinal, hematologic, or pulmonary toxicity per CTCAE, v4.0.</description>

    <description>Patients will be stratified by the maximum diameter of HCC in any plane (≤10 cm or &gt;10 cm) based on post-TACE, contrast enhanced MRI or CT. If only 1 lesion is present, the maximum diameter of that lesion in any plane determines stratification. If &gt;1 but ≤3 lesions are present, the sum of the maximum diameter in any plane of all the lesions determines stratification.
The MTD will be determined utilizing a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme (4 Gy increase per bin). For lesions ≤10 cm, the starting RT dose bin will be 42 Gy and escalate to a pre-determined maximum of 62 Gy if no DLT's are experienced. For lesions &gt;10 cm, the starting RT dose bin will be 40 Gy and escalate to a pre-determined maximum of 52 Gy if no DLT's are experienced.</description>
