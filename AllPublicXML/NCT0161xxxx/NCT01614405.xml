  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) develop progressive liver disease and often
      require liver transplantation. The cause of disease is unknown. It is thought to occur as a
      result of an infection in subjects that are more susceptible to disease than others. The
      investigators found evidence of retrovirus infection in patients with primary biliary
      cirrhosis. The investigators found that most patients with PBC have evidence of viral
      infection. Since then the investigators have conducted clinical studies using anti-viral
      therapy. The investigators found that PBC patients treated with combination anti-retrovirus
      therapy experienced significant reversal of the disease process. However, the changes were
      not substantial and the investigators are now looking for better antiviral regimens. Now the
      investigators have found a mouse model with a similar virus infection that develops a similar
      biliary disease. Importantly, the investigators found that antiviral therapy blocks the
      development of the disease in this mouse. The investigators have used this model to find
      safer and more effective antiviral treatments for patients with PBC. The investigators have
      now found out that a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy with Truvada and
      Kaletra stops disease in the mouse and plan to use this combination to see if it works in
      patients with PBC.
