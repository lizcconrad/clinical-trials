  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a lung resection procedure, patients have their pleural space drained of fluid that
      accumulates due to the severing of proximal vessels like lymph nodes. The volume of fluid
      pumped depends on the severity of the inflammation. The investigators are conduction this
      study to attempt to use painkillers with intrinsic anti-inflammatory action to try and reduce
      the degree of inflammation in patients' pleural cavity, thus ensuring patients are discharged
      faster, with a greater comfort level, and a hopefully lower rate of admission.

    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will attempt to reduce the degree of inflammation (and thus
      polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts) in the pleural space following a lung resection procedure
      by administering the Non Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Naproxen in tandem with
      Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) Pantoprazole, ideally leading towards a significantly reduced
      volume of transudate and exudate generated.

      This will be achieved by running a placebo-controlled double blinded randomized control trial
      where investigators and participants will be blinded so as to eliminate experimenter bias.
      After screening for suitable participants using stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      patients will be administered by allied health professionals 500mg Naproxen twice daily and
      40mg Pantoprazole once daily, or an identical placebo for four weeks following resection
      surgery. Patients will undergo a thorough examination during their scheduled follow-up
      appointments to monitor general vitals as well as possible gastrointestinal complications.
      The primary outcome is a significant reduction (Δ100ml) of chest fluid extracted in the
      intervention arm of the study in comparison to that of the control arm. Secondary outcomes
      will include a reduction in length of stay measured in days between control and intervention
      arms as well as a reduction in the total number of days chest tubes are retained in-situ.
      Conditions such as mortality and morbidity, the onset of complications, and general
      re-admission rates will also be recorded.

    <description>This study arm will encompass the administration of a placebo (physically identical to Naproxen) orally to participants. Naproxen is a painkiller with intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, while the placebo has no pharmacological properties associated with it. Participants will also be taking Pantoprazole to negate the gastrointestinal consequences of Naproxen (or the placebo). Participants will not know which arm of the study they belong to. In addition, they will attend scheduled check-ups where their vitals will be recorded, as well as laboratory indicators of gastrointestinal complications (creatinine levels, etc) for their safety.</description>

    <description>Intervention arm involves administering 500mg Naproxen twice a day to participants and 40mg of Pantoprazole once a day in tandem. Pantoprazole will negate gastrointestinal consequences of Naproxen and reduce the likelihood of a complication occurring. Participants will take Naproxen at the above dosage from the time of surgery to four weeks following surgery. They will attend scheduled check-ups where their vitals will be recorded, as well as laboratory indicators of gastrointestinal complications (creatinine levels, etc) for their safety. This experiment is double-blinded so neither investigators nor participants will know which arm of the study they belong to.</description>
