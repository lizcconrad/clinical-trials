    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether RE-021 (Sparsentan), a selective dual-acting receptor
      antagonist with affinity for endothelin (A type) and angiotensin II receptors (Type 1), is
      safe and effective in treating patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a rare glomerular disorder which results in
      frank proteinuria and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) over 5-10 years.
      Proteinuria reduction is widely regarded to be beneficial, and is considered the primary goal
      of treatment in FSGS and slowing its progressive course (D'Agati, et. al, 2011). Patients are
      currently treated with steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
      and angiotensin converting inhibitors (ACE) to lower proteinuria (Cameron, 2003). Despite
      these therapies, many patients have nephrotic range proteinuria and new therapeutic agents
      are needed (Kiffel, et. al, 2011). Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) have been shown to
      lower proteinuria in clinical trials of diabetic nephropathy (Kohan, et. al, 2011) (Mann, et.
      al 2010) and have been speculated to be effective in FSGS (Barton, 2010).
