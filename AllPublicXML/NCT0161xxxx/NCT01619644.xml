    <textblock>
      An exploratory phase 2 therapeutic trial in children from 6 to 21, RTS carriers, randomized
      to be treated either with sodium valproate with the usual pediatric dosage (30 mg/kg/j), or
      by placebo for one year.

      The investigator would like to include children because they could best profit from it due to
      their neuronal plasticity as CBP and EP300 take effect through neuronal and synaptic
      plasticity.

      The therapeutic effect of sodium valproate in RTS patients will be assessed thanks to a
      clinical approach (learning and memory neuropsychological evaluation, fine motor skills
      assessment by pointing), to a biological approach (histone acetylation functional tests), and
      to imaging (morphological and functional MRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Such a multidisciplinary approach has never been presented for this syndrome; it should
      enable us identifying specific cognitive and motor deficits and their association thanks to
      imaging markers. Assessing the various aspects of motor skills, i.e. primary (movements,
      standing at ease position, immobility) and complex motor skills (actions and behaviours,
      motor aspects of feelings and language expressions) is an integral part of the clinical
      examination in psychiatrics.

      The main interest of a functional capacity analysis is to be used as an index allowing the
      assessment of the nervous system's global capacities and the study of the connections between
      cognitive functions and motor skills Main objective: Evaluate long term memory with subtest
      &quot;point location&quot; - CMS and &quot;image recognition&quot; RBMT A patient is said to be responder if
      after one year his or her test result increase for one point at least one of the two tests :
      a increase of one point to &quot;point location&quot; or &quot;image recognition&quot;.

      Double-blind phase 2 clinical trial, designed as a one-step Fleming design but with a control
      group. Rubival is a two-parallel group randomized trial:

        -  a placebo group of 20 patients

        -  a group of 40 patients taking sodium valproate (HDAC inhibitor) with an oral dosage of
           30 mg/kg/jour

    <description>The main outcome measure was to evaluate long term memory with two subtests :
point location, subtest of CMS (children memory scale). The score ranges from 0 to 6
image recognition, subtest of RBMT (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test). The score range from 0 to 10. One point for each image recognized A patient is said to be responder if after one year of treatment , his or her test result increase for one point at least one of the two tests</description>

    <description>For motor skills, the profile was based on 3 tasks : posturology, motor coordination in a visuo-manual pointing task and in mobile interception task..
For brain imaging, a variety of outcome measures will be used for example, brain volume, anisotropy fraction, diffusion coefficient for structural magnetic imaging and the signal intensity for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</description>
