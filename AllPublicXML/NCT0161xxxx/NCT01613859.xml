  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment and monitoring of cardiac function in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is
      an integral part of hemodynamic monitoring of critically ill patients whether it is done
      directly or indirectly. Measurement of cardiac output (CO) can specifically guide therapies
      to support the cardiovascular system in critically ill children with multi organ dysfunction.
      Because of the side effects involved in measuring cardiac output directly, intensive
      monitoring of patients is currently limited to an integrated assessment of tissue perfusion,
      oxygen delivery and cellular health both at regional and global levels. Currently available
      methods of measuring CO have their limitations and complications, and are not used routinely
      for bedside monitoring. Therefore, the investigators propose to use a newly developed method,
      termed COstatus for the monitoring of CO in patients admitted to PICU.

    <description>The objective of this study is to see if the CO measurements obtained with COstatus show a linear correlation with all other indirect and invasive methods currently used to measure CO (within acceptable range) and with the CO measured by thermodilution in the cardiac catheterization lab.</description>
