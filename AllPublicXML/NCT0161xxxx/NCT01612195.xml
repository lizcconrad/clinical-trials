    <textblock>
      Anal abscess-fistula disease is of common occurrence and has a significant impact on the
      quality of life of affected individuals. The course of abscess-fistula disease as well as its
      treatment modalities may affect anal continence. The present cohort study investigates the
      results of anal fistula plug surgery. In particular, this study focus on the impact of anal
      fistula plug surgery on fistula healing, quality of life, and anal continence. Fifty patients
      will be included and followed up at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery in the clinic of
      participating surgeons.

      Anal abscess-fistula disease is of common occurrence and has a significant impact on the
      quality of life of affected individuals. The clinical course of abscess-fistula disease as
      well as its treatment modalities may affect anal continence. Anal fistula plug surgery is an
      Health Canada and FDA approved surgical treatment that has demonstrated promising results in
      terms of fistula healing and minimal patients' burden. The present cohort study prospectively
      investigates the results of anal fistula plug surgery performed in teaching hospitals
      affiliated to the University of Toronto. In particular, this study focus on the impact of
      anal fistula plug surgery on health-related quality of life, and its 2 major determinants
      anal continence and fistula healing. Fifty patients will be included and followed up at 6
      weeks and 6 months after surgery in the clinic of participating surgeons. Quality of life and
      anal continence will be measured with the validated Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2)
      and Fecal Incontinence Score Index (FISI) questionnaires, respectively. It is expected that
      the present study will provide objective information on the results and generalizability of
      anal fistula surgery, as well as on its impact on health-related quality of life and anal
      continence.

    <description>All patients have a draining seton for at least 6 weeks prior placement of the anal fistula plug. All patients are administered a general anesthetic and are operated in the lithotomy position. The seton is removed, but no curettage or irrigation of the fistula tract is performed. The plug is inserted through the internal opening, and pulled through the external opening until it fit snugly and its base is sutured to the internal sphincter with 2 interrupted 2-0 polyglactin 910 sutures. The tip of the plug is cut at skin level and not sutured. The external opening is left open to allow for drainage. The patient is instructed to restrict physical and sexual activity for 2 weeks postoperatively. Patients are seen in the post-operative clinic at 10 days, 6 weeks and 6 months as per protocol.</description>
