  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial neglect represents one of the major cognitive disorders following stroke. Patients
      patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left and orientate instead to their
      right side. Enduring neglect has been found to be a poor prognostic indicator for functional
      independence following stroke. Despite some promising experimental accounts there are no
      established treatments for this condition.

      The aim of this study is to test whether a combined treatment with hemifield eye patching
      (HEP) and optokinetic stimulation (OKS) can permanently reduce neglect behaviour and improve
      functional outcome in patients with hemispatial neglect following stroke.

      The investigators hypothesise that the treatment with HEP and OKS will lead to a greater
      reduction of neglect scoring in the neglect test battery as well as a greater improvement in
      functional independence scores as compared to the spontaneous clinical course of the
      usual-care control group.

      To specify, this study should answer the following main question: Does the daily wearing of
      hemifield eye patches over a period of 1 week in combination with daily sessions of
      optokinetic stimulation lead to a significant reduction of neglect behaviour as measured by
      total scores in a paper-and-pencil neglect test battery and/or an improvement in functional
      independence scores (Catherine-Bergego-Scale, Barthel Index) in a cohort of stroke patients
      with acute hemispatial neglect as compared to the spontaneous course of the disease in a
      control patient group without a neglect-specific treatment?

    <intervention_name>hemifield eye patching (HEP) + optokinetic stimulation (OKS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in this arm will wear standard spectacle frames containing noncorrective lenses to which right half-field patches are attached (hemifield eye patching, HEP). In case of patients already wearing prescribed glasses, the patches will be attached to their own glasses. The glasses will be worn all-day for the duration of the treatment phase (seven days) and only be removed for sleeping and face cleaning as well as for the duration of the daily OKS treatment sessions.
Furthermore these patients will receive daily sessions (20 minutes) of optokinetic stimulation (OKS). Therefore patients will be seated in front of a widescreen monitor, watching a black background with a pattern of various objects (size 1°), which coherently and continuously move to the left at a velocity of 10 °/s.</description>
