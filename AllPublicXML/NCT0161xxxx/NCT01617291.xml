  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if induced therapeutic hypothermia (ITH) in the
      pre-hospital setting of a four county emergency medical system (EMS) that serves both urban
      and rural communities improves meaningful survival from medical cardiac arrest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of therapeutic hypothermia after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in
      medical cardiac arrest is increasingly becoming the standard of care in the hospital setting.
      Several studies, including two sentinel research papers in the New England Journal of
      Medicine, show improved neurologic outcome with induced therapeutic hypothermia (ITH). 4, 5
      This research led to a class IIa recommendation by the American Heart Association for ITH
      after ROSC in V-Fib arrest and a class IIb recommendation after ROSC in all other classes of
      medial cardiac arrest.6

      The role of ITH in the pre-hospital setting is less clear. Studies currently exist that both
      show a benefit and fail to support improved outcomes.7-9 It has been suggested that the short
      transport times in most urban EMS systems might be part of the reason that some studies have
      failed to find benefit of ITH in the pre-hospital setting.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial involving all patients transported by
      CCEMS who have ROSC after a medical cardiac arrest and who are transported to a hospital that
      can continue ITH for 24 hours. All comatose patients who meet inclusion criteria will be
      randomized to either ITH in addition to continued treatment under standing protocols or
      regular care without ITH. Assignment to the two treatment arms will be done using the EMS
      number which is generated when the ambulance is dispatched to a call. Even numbered patients
      will have continued standard therapy while odd numbered patients will receive ITH.
