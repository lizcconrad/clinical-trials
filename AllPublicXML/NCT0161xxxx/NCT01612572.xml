      This study was advocated by Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy
      of Chinese Medical Sciences in October 2011.

      It was funded by China major scientific and technological specialized project for
      'significant new formulation of new drugs'.

      Xiyanping is kind of Chinese Medicine injection used for treating viral pneumonia
      、bronchitis、amygdalitis、infantile diarrhea、bacillary dysentery 、virus hepatitis、and Children
      acute hot diseases in many Chinese hospitals.

      The purpose of this study is to determine adverse drug events or adverse drug reaction in
      large sample size 20,000 patients.
