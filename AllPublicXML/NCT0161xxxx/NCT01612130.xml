      Evaluate the efficacy of Valeriana officinalis L. (Valerian) for control of anxiety during
      third molar surgery. Study design: A single oral dose of either valerian (100 mg) or placebo
      was randomly administered one hour before each surgical procedure to 20 volunteers between 17
      and 31 years of age. Anxiety level was assessed through questionnaires, physiological
      parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) and the observation of signs.

    <description>During each surgery, the researcher and surgeon observed the manifestation of signs and symptoms associated to anxiety (restlessness/agitation/nervous ticks, paleness, excessive perspiration, tingling sensation in hands, feet or lips, change in breathing rhythm or depth). In the presence of one or more of these signs and symptoms, the patient was classified as anxious. If there was no manifestation of anxiety, the patient was classified as calm or relaxed</description>
