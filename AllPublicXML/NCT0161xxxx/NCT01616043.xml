  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The healing of full thickness skin defects treated with a split thickness skin graft (STSG)
      is frequently associated with excessive scarring and contraction. The psychological burden of
      poor cosmesis of these scarred regions as well as functional problems due to skin tightness
      and decreased joint mobility cause a very significant morbidity in these patients.
      Application of a dermal substitute underneath the split skin may improve the quality of the
      scar. Glyaderm is a dermal substitute derived from human skin and due to the elastin in this
      substitute it will contribute to a long term improvement of pliability and function and a
      better esthetic outcome.

      The main objective is to evaluate the difference in scar quality, after skin restoration of
      full thickness defects treated with Glyaderm® and STSG versus STSG alone. Secondary
      objectives are: to evaluate the percentage of Glyaderm® take before application of
      autografts, to compare healing time and percentage of autograft survival and bacterial load
      in full thickness defects treated with Glyaderm® and STSG versus STSG alone, and to conduct a
      concurrent cost-effectiveness and health related quality of life study (i.e. cost utility
      analysis).

      The study is an interventional, prospective, randomized and controlled interactive web based,
      study in a multicentre setting. Patients with full thickness burn wounds or full thickness
      skin defects will be evaluated before enrolment. A total of 120 patients will be included.

      All included patients will undergo full thickness removal of the burned skin or adequate
      debridement of all necrotic tissue. The wounds of the patients will be covered with glycerol
      preserved allografts for wound bed preparation. At the second operation, 5-7 days after the
      first operation, the allografts are removed. If the wound bed is not suitable for grafting,
      additional wound bed preparation with allografts is required until the wound bed is
      satisfactory. If the wound bed is suitable for grafting, the patient is randomized to the
      Glyaderm® group or the control group. The wounds of the patients randomized to the Glyaderm®
      group are covered with Glyaderm®. After 6-8 days the wounds are finally covered with a thin
      STSG. In the control group, the wounds are immediately covered with a thin STSG.

      Up to one year after complete wound closure, patients are followed-up for scar evaluation and
      quality of life.

The elasticity of the scar is measured with the Cutometer® MPA 850 (Courage &amp; Khazaka electronic GmbH) Adapted Vancouver Scar Scale, Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale, Ghent contour scale, Tewameter TM 300 for trans epidermal water loss, Corneometer CM 825 for hydration of the stratum corneum, Mexameter MX 18 for erythema and melanin, Reviscometer RVM 600 for the direction of collagen and elastin in the skin Finally a total score is defined.</description>
