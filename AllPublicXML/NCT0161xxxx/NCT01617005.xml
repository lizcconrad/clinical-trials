    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in participants
      with active moderate to severe RA and an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs. Data
      will be collected from each eligible participant initiating tocilizumab treatment over 6
      months.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs include both SAEs as well as non-serious AEs.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Good or Moderate Response According to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>EULAR response was based on 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28). The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline (CFB) in DAS28 score and the level of disease activity reached (absolute DAS28 score). Good responders had a CFB greater than (&gt;) 1.2 with a DAS28 score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2; moderate responders had a CFB &gt;1.2 with a DAS28 score &gt;3.2 to &lt;= 5.1 or a change from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;= 1.2 with a DAS28 score &lt;= 5.1; non-responders had a CFB &lt;=0.6 or CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1. Number of participants who achieved EULAR good response and EULAR moderate response were reported.</description>
