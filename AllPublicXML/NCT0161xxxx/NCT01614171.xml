  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis pseudoglioma (OPPG) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition of
      childhood osteoporosis and congenital blindness for which new treatments are needed. We have
      found that body fat is increased in OPPG and muscle mass is reduced. We hypothesize that
      growth hormone therapy will improve muscle mass and bone strength in OPPG.
