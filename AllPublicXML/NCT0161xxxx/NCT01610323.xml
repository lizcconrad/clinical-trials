  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pregnancy, the adoption or pursuit of a sedentary lifestyle contributes to the development
      of co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, maternal and childhood obesity, gestational
      diabetes, pre-eclampsia, cesarean section and delivery of large-for-gestational-age infants
      (LGA).

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that obese, pregnant women following a
      supervised moderate intensity physical conditioning program during the 2nd trimester of
      pregnancy will maintain a higher level of physical activity up to the end of pregnancy, as
      compared to women in the control group. We will also conduct a pilot study on the feasibility
      to examine the effects of the intervention on maternal fitness and neonatal anthropometry.

      Looking at the multiple needs of pregnant women with obesity, physical conditioning may offer
      a great opportunity to improve fitness and to decrease cardio-metabolic disturbances, to
      prevent excessive weight gain, to improve general health status, and to reduce health care
      utilization. Furthermore, beneficial effects of fitness on adverse maternal health outcomes
      related to obesity might decrease the development of long-term obesity and metabolic
      repercussions in the offspring.

      The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) recommends that all women
      without contraindication be encouraged to participate in aerobic and strength-conditioning
      exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy. Despite these recommendations,
      obese women are inactive during pregnancy and are currently still at high risk of poor
      physical fitness.

      Thus, although exercise clearly improves maternal health status and thus potentially prevents
      adverse perinatal outcomes, obese pregnant women poorly adhere to experts' recommendations
      about the need for exercise during pregnancy. Therefore, this situation justifies the need to
      develop adapted strategies aimed at increasing the implementation of guideline
      recommendations in this population.
