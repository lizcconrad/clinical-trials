  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amphetamines have been shown to improve cognition but its use is limited due to its side
      effects. Lisdexamfetamine is an amphetamine pro-drug, minimizing these effects and has been
      safely used in children and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The
      investigators hypothesize that lisdexamfetamine may improve cognitive abilities in MS
      patients with documented cognitive dysfunction. Because lisdexamfetamine is a stimulant its
      positive effects should be observed primarily in the domains of processing speed and working
      memory. The investigators therefore propose a study in which the primary objective will be to
      assess the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine in improving attention and processing speed in MS.
      The secondary objectives will be (a) the assessment of the safety and tolerability of
      lisdexamfetamine in the MS population, and (b) to test for effects of the drug on other
      cognitive domains, depression, and self and informant reports of cognitive and executive
      function demanding activities and behaviors.

             revised McDonald's Criteria (68).

          -  Have not received steroids in last thirty (30) days or a relapse in the last ninety
             (90) days, and whose MS is considered stable.

          -  Presence of cognitive dysfunction characterized by slowed processing speed as
             indicated by a score of -1.5 SD below age/education matched norms on the SDMT or the
             PASAT.

          -  An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of ≤ 6.5

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-related procedure not part of
             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the
