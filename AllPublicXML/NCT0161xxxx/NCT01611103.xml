      This research is being done to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) can improve certain mental abilities. In this research, a 9 volt battery is used to
      deliver very weak electrical current to the surface of the scalp while participants complete
      cognitive tasks. Our aim is to find out whether tDCS will improve task performance in adults
      over the age of 55.

      Participants enrolled into this study may be asked to do the following:

        -  Grant permission for the researchers to view medical records associated with their
           language/cognitive difficulties (if applicable).

        -  Complete a questionnaire, provide a health history, and take some pencil-and-paper tests
           of problem-solving and memory in order to verify eligibility to participate and to able
           to safely undergo the experimental procedures.

        -  Complete several tasks (i.e., saying words out loud, naming objects, drawing designs,
           remembering lists of words, searching for images or letters, and/or completing puzzles)
           based upon a number of cognitive functions such as language, memory, vision, processing,
           and perception.

        -  Wear electrodes that will be placed on the scalp with a large rubberized band. These
           electrodes will administer very weak electrical current (tDCS) from a 9 volt battery for
           20 to 60 minutes.

        -  Participate in several study conditions. The exact conditions and their order will be
           randomized. Under some conditions, participants may receive active stimulation (tDCS)
           and under other conditions, they may receive sham stimulation.

        -  The experimental sessions will last approximately 2 hours and participants may be asked
           to have more than one testing session in a day or to return for additional sessions.
