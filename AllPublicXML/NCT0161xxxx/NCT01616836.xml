  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the best method of pain control that will help with
      rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Currently, the best method for pain
      control after TKA appears to be continuous femoral nerve block (FNB) where a small tube is
      placed beside the nerve that provides sensation to a large part of the knee and local
      anesthetic infused after surgery causing numbness to the surgical site. A single injection
      method also exists and may provide similar benefits. Both methods require training and can
      result in side effects such as temporary weakness (while the local anesthetic is still
      working) that can inhibit rehabilitation. A newer method injecting local anesthetic into the
      joint after surgery (Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA)) is becoming common, does not cause
      weakness and can be done quickly at the end of surgery. It is unknown if the pain control
      provided by LIA is as good as that of FNB. This study will compare the femoral nerve block,
      continuous femoral nerve block and LIA technique to determine which provides better pain
      relief after TKA.

      This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind study. Patients will be randomized using
      a computer-generated sequence to one of three groups:

      Group 1: Continuous femoral nerve block group (cFNB) Group 2: Single injection femoral nerve
      block group (sFNB) Group 3: Local infiltration analgesia group (LIA)

      Inclusion criteria: Patients between the ages of 18 and 85 having primary tri-compartmental
      total knee arthroplasty.

      Exclusion criteria: Allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study medication (see
      below), inability to walk independently prior to TKA, inability to comprehend French or
      English, use of major tranquilizers, ASA 4 or 5, BMI &gt; 40, opioid tolerance (opioid
      consumption &gt; 30mg oral morphine or equivalent per day), pregnancy
