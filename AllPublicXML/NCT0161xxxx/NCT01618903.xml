      The part A of N01362 is to evaluate the bioequivalence of Levetiracetam (LEV) 1500 mg
      intravenous (iv) infusion when compared to tablet oral administration in Chinese healthy
      volunteers.

      The study includes 2 parts, part A is to evaluate the bioequivalence of Levetiracetam (LEV)
      1500 mg intravenous (iv) infusion when compared to oral tablet, part B is to assess
      pharmacokinetic profile of LEV infusion during repeated dosing in Chinese healthy volunteers.
