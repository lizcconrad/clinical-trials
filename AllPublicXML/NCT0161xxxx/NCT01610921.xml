  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a frequently occurring inflammatory lung disease that affects the whole bronchial
      tree including the small airways (&lt;2mm). Since the introduction of the solution
      hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) technology it is possible to generate medication with small particles
      of approximately 1-2 μm, and therefore to reach the small airways. However, at this moment
      the investigators have no reliable instruments to identify the asthmatic subjects who
      particularly benefit from treatment with inhaled small particles. Recently the investigators
      research group investigated whether provocation with small and large particles AMP is able to
      identify responders and non-responders to treatment with small and large particles of inhaled
      corticosteroids. This provocation technique gave promising results but needs further
      optimization.

      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal particle size of dry powder adenosine to
      assess small airway involvement in asthma. Secondary, to provide insight in the associations
      between the standard test, executed with nebulized AMP, and the new test, executed with dry
      powder Adenosine.

      This is a cross-over study. The study population consists of 10 non-smoking asthma patients
      in the age of 18-65 years who have a PC20 metacholine value ≤4.9mg/ml.

      Participating subjects perform 6 provocation tests in randomized order: one test with
      nebulized methacholine, one test with nebulized AMP, four times dry powder adenosine
      provocation test. (small particles with inhaled with a slow flow, small particles inhaled
      with a fast flow, large particles inhaled with a slow flow, large particles inhaled with a
      fast flow)

    <time_frame>Small airway reaction is measured during each provocation test. The Visits will take place in a period of 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The R5-R20 is measured with the IOS. This a method to determine the resistance of the small airways. The R5-R20 is measured during each provocation test after each provocative step.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The total airway reaction to provocation with adenosine, reflected by the decline in FEV1 (PD20/ PC20 values)</measure>
    <time_frame>Lung function is measured during each provocation test. All visits take place in a period of 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>We want to compare the different PD20/PC20 values of the three dry powder adenosine provocation test and with the nebulized AMP provocation test. The lung function is measured after each provocative step to determine the point of 20% decline in FEV1. The provocation test is ended after the last step or is ended prematurely when there is a 20% fall of FEV1 compared to baseline</description>

    <description>Provocation tests with adenosine dry powder and nebulized AMP (adenosine-5'monophosphate). The AMP provocation test is a standard test and consists of 14 doubling concentrations in a range of 0.04mg/ml to 320mg/ml. The aerosols will be inhaled during tidal breathing for 2 minutes. The dry powder adenosine also consists of 14 doubling steps with doses in a range of 0.01mg to 20mg.</description>
