    <textblock>
      In couples with infertility secondary to Diminished Ovarian Reserve, the investigators
      hypothesize that a delayed start (7 day) to ovarian stimulation with an GnRH antagonist
      (Ganirelix) will improve oocyte maturation and quality, and improve pregnancy outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, the success rate of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has
      dramatically increased. This increase is attributed to improvements in embryo culture,
      laboratory conditions, and optimization of ovarian stimulation protocols. Over the past
      years, there has been more interest in altering the ovarian stimulation protocol to improve
      outcomes. For example, recently our group found that a modification of ovulation trigger
      toward a more physiologic process improves oocyte quality and pregnancy outcomes. Others have
      suggested minimal stimulation improves in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. The
      investigators propose to further investigate modifying the ovarian stimulation for women who
      have &quot;decreased&quot; ovarian reserve. The investigators propose that a delayed start to ovarian
      stimulation will improve oocyte maturation and quality and pregnancy outcomes. No published
      studies to date have evaluated if a delayed start to ovarian stimulation improves pregnancy
      outcomes. However, the investigators hypothesize that the use an antagonist for a delayed
      start of stimulation will work by one of two mechanisms:

      I. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further recruitment of early antral
      follicles.

      II. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further FSH responsiveness in existing
      follicles to synchronize the primary cohort, thereby increasing the total number of
      follicles.
