    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number change in the number of letters read means that the vision improved and a negative number change in the number of letters read means that the vision has worsened.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye Diagnosed With Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number change in the number of letters read means that the vision improved and a negative number change in the number of letters read means that the vision has worsened. BRVO is a blockage of the small veins in the retina.</description>

The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number change in the number of letters read means that the vision improved and a negative number change in the number of letters read means that the vision has worsened. CRVO is a blockage of the main vein in the retina.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye</title>
        <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number change in the number of letters read means that the vision improved and a negative number change in the number of letters read means that the vision has worsened.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye Diagnosed With Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)</title>
        <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number change in the number of letters read means that the vision improved and a negative number change in the number of letters read means that the vision has worsened. BRVO is a blockage of the small veins in the retina.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye Based on Macular Edema Onset ≥3 Months</title>
        <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number change in the number of letters read means that the vision improved and a negative number change in the number of letters read means that the vision has worsened. The onset of macular edema was ≥3 months prior to treatment.</description>
