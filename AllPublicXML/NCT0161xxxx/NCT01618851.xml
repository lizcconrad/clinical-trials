      This phase II study designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and morbidity of IMRT
      with CyberKnife radiosurgical boosts for clinically localized prostate cancer. Patients will
      be treated with three radiosurgical treatments (6.5 Gy per fraction) followed by IMRT (45 Gy

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and morbidity of
      IMRT with CyberKnife radiosurgical boosts for clinically localized prostate cancer. Patients
      with clinically localized prostate cancer will be treated with three radiosurgical treatments
      (6.5 Gy per fraction to the PTV) followed by IMRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions). Treatment will be
      completed over a 6-7 week period.

      The hypothesis is that for patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate,
      CyberKnife Radiosurgery delivered to the prostate is efficacious with acceptable toxicity in
      combination with IMRT.

      Subjects will have toxicity evaluation and AUA score on the last day of treatment. At 1 month
      following treatment, subjects will be assessed for acute toxicity and will fill out AUA form,
      SF-12, EPIC-26, SHIM and Utilization of Sexual Rx/Devices. At 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month
      intervals (and every 6 months thereafter, through year 5, and annually through year 10, if
      investigators opt to continue past year 5), subjects will be seen and evaluated, including a
      history, physical exam, performance status, PSA, toxicity evaluation, and AUA score. In
      addition, at 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter, the SF-12, EPIC-26, SHIM and
      Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices will be administered. A prostate biopsy will be
      performed at time of biochemical or local clinical failure, and is encouraged at 2 years
      following treatment and at time of distant failure. A bone scan will be performed at the time
      of biochemical failure, or when the subject develops signs of symptoms suggesting metastatic
      disease.

      Acute side effects (â‰¤ 90 days of treatment start) will be assessed using the NCI Toxicity
      Criteria version 3.0.

    <description>Inverse planning using the CyberKnife planning system will be employed. The treatment plan used for each treatment will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose including dose-volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTV and critical normal structures. The homogeneous CT model shall be used.
The prescribed PTV dose of 19.5 Gy shall be given in 3 fractions using the CyberKnife. At least three fiducials should be identified for each treatment. If fewer than three fiducials can be tracked, then additional fiducials will be placed, and the patient replanned. Fiducial locations in the images will be extracted and compared to the fiducial locations in the CT scans to estimate target movements.
For IMRT, Daily doses of 180 cGy are to be delivered to the PTV 5 days a week to a total dose of 4500 cGy in 25 fractions.</description>
