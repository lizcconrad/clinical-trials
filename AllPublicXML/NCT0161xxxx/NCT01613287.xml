      This clinical investigation is a medical device trial to examine the safety and efficacy of
      TheraSorb® Ig flex adsorber treatment (as an add-on to conventional treatment) used
      exclusively with the LIFE 18® apheresis system for extracorporeal application for IA therapy
      (5 treatments) performed over 5 to 8 consecutive days in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension and WHO functional classification III.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form

          -  age &gt; 18 and &lt; 80 years at time of informed consent

          -  Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension diagnosed by right heart catheter

          -  WHO functional classification III

          -  Application of conventional IPAH therapy, which has been stable for the prior 8 weeks

          -  Able to perform a 6-minute-walk test (MWT)

          -  Negative pregnancy test (β-HCG) at the start of the trial and appropriate
             contraception throughout the trial for women with child-bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy and/or lactation

          -  PAH of any cause other than permitted in the inclusion criteria, e.g. concomitantly to
             portal hypertension, complex congenital heart disease, reversed shunt, HIV infection,
             suspected pulmonary veno-occlusive disease

          -  Contraindication for right heart catheterization

          -  Any change in disease-targeted therapy within 8 weeks prior to inclusion

          -  Walking impairment due to causes other than IPAH that would preclude performance of a
             6MWT

          -  Any patient who has received any investigational medication within 8 weeks prior to
             the start of this trial or who is scheduled to receive another investigational drug
             during the course of the trial between visits V1 and V9

          -  Known intolerance to immunoadsorption in general or to one of the excipients (e.g.
             sheep antibodies or agarose) or other supporting agents

          -  Hemoglobin concentration of &lt; 75% below the lower limit of normal

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg

          -  Lack of compliance or other similar reason that, in the judgment of the Investigator,
             precludes satisfactory participation in the trial

          -  Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e. uncontrolled diabetes,
             congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the study,
             unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal disease, or active uncontrolled
             generalized viral, bacterial and/ or mycotic infection) which by assessment of the
             treating Investigator could compromise patients safety or participation in the study

          -  Drug or alcohol abuse within the last 5 years

          -  Hypercoagulability

          -  Known severe immunodeficiency (e.g. AIDS)

          -  Severe lung disease: FEV1/FVC &lt; 50%, total capacity &lt; 60% of normal value

          -  Indications that prohibit transient anticoagulation using Heparin and/or
             ACD-A-solutions
