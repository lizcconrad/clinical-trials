      The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of Rosuvastatin 5 mg once daily
      with Rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily by assessment of the number of patients with
      hypercholesterolemia reaching the LDL-C target goal of &lt;100 mg/dL after 12 weeks of therapy.

      This study will observe the followings:

        1. To compare the effect of 5 mg/10 mg Rosuvastatin by assessment of the number of patients
           reaching LDL-C target goal after 24 weeks of therapy.

        2. To compare the effect of 12 weeks therapy with 5 mg/10 mg Rosuvastatin on change in
           LDL-C (compare change from baseline).

        3. To investigate the effect of 12 weeks therapy with 10 mg Rosuvastatin on change in LDL-C
           (compare values week 0 vs. week 12).

        4. To investigate the safety of Rosuvastatin in regards to liver enzyme change, kidney
           function and muscle toxicity.

        5. To compare the effect of 12 weeks therapy with 5 mg/10 mg Rosuvastatin on change in TC,
           HDL-C, TG, LDL-C density and HbA1c (compare change from baseline).

        6. To investigate the effect of 12 weeks therapy with 10 mg Rosuvastatin on change in TC,
           HDL-C, TG, LDL-C density and HbA1c (compare values week 0 vs. week 12).

        7. To investigate the effect of 12 weeks therapy on change in microalbuminuria in each
           treatment group (compare change from baseline).

        8. To investigate the effect of 12 weeks therapy on change in BMI (compare change from
           baseline).

           The effects of the dose increase and the dose decrease from weeks 12 to 24 will be
           evaluated as follows:

        9. To investigate the change in LDL-C by increasing the dose from 5 mg to 10 mg (compare
           values week 12 vs. 24).

       10. To investigate the change in LDL-C by decreasing the dose from 10 mg to 5 mg (compare
           values week 12 vs. 24).

       11. To investigate the change in TC, HDL-C, TG, LDL-C density and HbA1c by increasing the
           dose from 5 mg to 10 mg (compare values week 12 vs. 24).

       12. To investigate the change in TC, HDL-C, TG, LDL-C density and HbA1c by decreasing the
           dose from 10 mg to 5 mg (compare values week 12 vs. 24).
