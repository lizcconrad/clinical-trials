  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis presents clinically as pain in the inner heal, which is the result of
      degeneration of the plantar fascia, an arch supporting ligament of the foot. It manifests
      predominantly in those subjected to sustained weight bearing or repetitive pounding
      activities. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of inferior foot pain. Although most
      cases resolving within 6 months, traditional treatment regiments such as orthotics and
      physiotherapy are occasionally unsuccessful in treating this limitation leading to chronic
      symptoms (Neufeld &amp; Cerrato, 2008; Rompe, 2009; Roxas, 2005).

      Platelets are central players in clotting, inflammation and the wound healing response.
      Research has shown the potential of platelet rich plasma to accelerate wound healing in a
      variety of conditions including maxillo-fascial and plastic surgery, chronic wound healing
      and orthopaedics. Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP) is a novel treatment that may
      accelerate the healing of injured tissue. Treatment with ACP involves taking a blood sample
      from the patient, isolating the platelets and injecting them back into that patient at the
      injury site

    <description>Within two weeks of the initial visit, the RN, will retrieve a 10-12 mL blood sample from all patients. After the sample is retrieved, the patient will be asked to lie prone on the plinth to assist with blinding. The blood sample will be retained in the Arthrex ABS-10010S Double Syringe with Syringe Cap and then separated using a soft spin centrifuge for 5 min at 1500 rpm/rcf. Three to four mL of platelet rich plasma will be pulled into a smaller syringe that is wrapped in opaque tape to conceal the contents of the syringe. The ACP is injected into the torn region of the tendon.</description>

    <description>Preparation of the blood sample is identical for patients in this group except that the blood sample will ultimately be discarded instead of injected. The syringe is blinded with opaque tape making it identical to the ACP group syringe and injected into the torn area of the tendon.</description>
