    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is an advanced laparoscopic procedure with a potential for
      significant morbidity and mortality along the early part of a surgeon's learning curve.
      Simulation-based training has been shown to improve a surgeon's technical performance and
      shorten the learning curves in the operating room. Despite these benefits, there is no
      evidence-based ex-vivo training curriculum for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The purpose of
      this study is to design and validate such a curriculum. This curriculum will include
      cognitive training, technical laparoscopic skills training (laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy
      and jejunojejunostomy) and non-technical skills training in a simulated environment. The
      investigators will assess the effectiveness of the proposed curriculum by conducting a
      randomized single blinded controlled trial. Cognitive knowledge (multiple choice test),
      technical skills (performance of a procedure in the operating room) and non-technical skills
      (performance in a simulated crisis scenario in a simulated environment) will be compared
      between curriculum trained and conventionally trained groups. The investigators hypothesize
      that curriculum trained group will have superior knowledge, technical skill and non-technical
      skills compared to conventionally trained group.

      OBJECTIVE: To design and validate a proficiency-based ex-vivo training curriculum for
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

      BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is an advanced laparoscopic procedure with a
      potential for significant morbidity and mortality along the early part of a surgeon's
      learning curve. Simulation-based training has been shown to improve a surgeon's technical
      performance and shorten the learning curves in the operating room. Despite these benefits,
      specific simulation-based training curricula have not been widely adopted in residency
      training programs. This is likely a result of the lack of valid simulation-based training
      curricula for minimally invasive operations. Presently, there is no evidence-based ex-vivo
      training curriculum for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The purpose of this project is to
      develop and validate such a curriculum.

      HYPOTHESIS: Completion of the proposed training curriculum is expected to result in superior
      cognitive knowledge, superior technical skills in the operating room, and superior
      performance in a simulated crisis scenario when compared to standard residency training.

      METHODS: The evidence-based training curriculum will be made up of cognitive, technical, and
      non-technical components. The cognitive component will deliver procedure-specific knowledge,
      while the technical component will provide training in basic and procedure-specific
      laparoscopic skills. Non-technical component will address additional components of surgical
      competency including situation awareness, decision making, task management, leadership,
      communication and teamwork. Technical skills will be learned on a bench-top cadaveric porcine
      models. Training will follow a distributed practice schedule until preset proficiency
      benchmarks are achieved. The proposed training curriculum will be validated in a
      single-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing procedure-specific knowledge, technical
      performance in the operating room, and non-technical skills in a simulated crisis scenario
      for 12 surgical residents in the curricular training group and 12 residents in the standard
      residency training group. Cognitive knowledge will be assessed with a multiple choice
      examination. Technical performance will be assessed with previously validated
      procedure-specific and global rating scales. Non-technical skills will be assessed using a
      previously validated NOTECHS scale.

      CONCLUSIONS: The design and implementation of the proposed training curriculum has the
      potential to affect surgical training programs on a national and international level by
      standardizing the proficiency of surgical trainees prior to the start of operating room
      training. This standardization is expected to shorten the learning curves and improve patient
      safety in the operating room.

They will participate in a cognitive component, which will consist of self-directed readings and a faculty-led seminar. Participants will also train to proficiency in laparoscopic jejunojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy using a laparoscopic box trainer with cadaveric porcine bowels. Finally, for the non-technical skills component participants will participate in an introductory lecture on non-technical skills in surgery, as well as a practice crisis scenario with a debriefing session.</description>
