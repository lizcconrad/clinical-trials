      The study includes 2 parts, part A is to evaluate the bioequivalence of Levetiracetam (LEV)
      1500 mg intravenous (iv) infusion when compared to oral tablet, part B is to assess the
      pharmacokinetic profile of LEV infusion during repeated dosing in Chinese healthy volunteers.

    <measure>Area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over a dosing interval (AUCτ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pharmacokinetic samples were taken 36 hours after iv administration on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The AUCτ is the area under the plasma concentration, after the last intravenous (iv) dose, versus time curve observed during the dosing interval τ.</description>

    <measure>Maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pharmacokinetic samples were taken 36 hours after iv administration on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The value of the maximum plasma concentration is directly obtained from the observed plasma concentration versus time curves.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma concentration at the end of the 45-minutes intravenous (iv) infusion (C45'(iv))</measure>
    <time_frame>Pharmacokinetic samples were taken 36 hours after iv administration on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The value of the plasma concentration at the end of the 45-min iv infusion is directly obtained from the experimental data of plasma concentration versus time curves.</description>

    <time_frame>Pharmacokinetic samples were taken 36 hours after iv administration on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The terminal half-life associated with the terminal rate constant λ_z is calculated as: ln2/λ_z. λ_z is the first order rate constant of elimination.</description>
