  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that a patient-centered survey asking about smoking
      habits, with the option for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) will increase the prescription
      rates among health care providers (HCP). The investigators also believe that this
      intervention can also lead to increased referrals to smoking cessation clinics and ultimately
      increase rates of smoking cessation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the past decade, there has been an increased awareness of the effects of smoking of
      general health. In 2000, 18.1% of all US deaths were related to tobacco use. Multiple trials
      have proven that providing nicotine-replacement therapies to help smoking cessation were
      efficacious with various types of populations. However, smoking has not been eradicated in
      North America and was associated with a 3.1 million YPLL (years of potential life lost),
      along with 96.8 billion in productivity losses in the US4.

      We are carrying out a study of 200 inpatients on a general medicine ward to attempt to
      improve prescription rates of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and smoking cessation. Our
      goal is to use a patient centred approach to determine which patients would benefit from NRT
      and which patients would be in the contemplative stage of smoking cessation. We will want to
      look at whether a simple, short survey taken by patients can encourage the health care
      provider (HCP) to provide more NRT and more referrals to a smoking cessation clinic. We hope
      that this tool will improve the ability of HCP to provide optimal, comprehensive care. The
      study's findings should help to guide future practices for hospitalized smokers.

      Currently, standard treatment involves NRT being prescribed completely at the discretion of
      the physician. This occasionally involves a discussion with the patient regarding their
      preferences, but more often is a unilateral decision made by the health care provider.
      Additionally, we believe that this method misses a lot of potential patients who may benefit
      from this therapy but are otherwise not identified. We will not be using a placebo.

    <description>By eliciting patient attitudes toward smoking cessation, we aim to increase the rate of prescription of nicotine replacement by 15% on the medical wards at St. Paul's Hospital by 15% over a 1month period.
We will measure the number of prescriptions for NRT of any kind by referencing pharmacy databases. This will be calculated as a percentage of active smokers.</description>

We will measure the number of patients referred for smoking cessation by contacting the clinic and cross-referencing the data by attending physician making the referral. This will be calculated as a percentage of active smokers.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a survey along with their meal tray, provided by Food and Nutrition Services. The survey will consist of questions related to smoking habits, desire for NRT and desire for assistance with smoking cessation. The results of these surveys will be collected by allied health professionals and forwarded to the CTU team. The CTU team will then be encouraged to use that information to engage in a discussion with the patient regarding prescription of NRT. It will then be left to the discretion of the HCP whether or not to prescribe NRT taking into account patient preference, absence of contraindications and clinical benefit. All those participating in the survey will be offered referral to a smoking cessation clinic upon discharge.</description>

    <description>In the control arm, surveys will also be given out to all patients along with their meal trays. However, these surveys will include only questions related to smoking habits in order to get a baseline number of smokers. The surveys will then be collected by the allied health and nursing staff and forwarded only to the research team. The HCP taking care of the patients will still provide standard of care treatment with NRT and smoking cessation referral as clinically indicated.</description>
