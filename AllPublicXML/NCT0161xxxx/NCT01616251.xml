  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  New Nordic diet guidelines advocate a reduction in consumption of protein from animal
           sources such as beef and pork, due to environmental concerns.

        -  Instead, intake of protein from vegetable sources such as legumes and pulses should be
           increased.

        -  A previous study showed that a meal enriched with vegetable protein increased the
           subjective sensation of satiety and decreased hunger and ad libitum energy intake (EI)
           compared to animal protein.

        -  This study did, however, not document that vegetable protein per se is more satiating
           than animal protein as the vegetable meal had higher fiber content. Fiber is a likely
           confounder.

        -  The protein from egg is sparingly investigated in relation to appetite. Few studies have
           found that eggs have a high satiety index but further investigation is needed.

      Objective:

      - To examine if vegetable protein (beans and peas) can suppress subjective appetite (VAS and
      ad libitum energy intake) compared to isocaloric meals enriched with either red meat or egg
      with similar distribution of macronutrients and content of dietary fibers.

      Design:

      Single-blind randomized 4-way crossover meal study

      Subjects:

      33 young healthy men (Age: 18-50 years; BMI: 19-30 kg/m2). Expected completers: n=30.

      End points:

        1. Subjective appetite (VAS) (every 30 min for 3 hours)

        2. Ad libitum EI (3 hours after lunch test meal)

    <measure>Acute 3-h changes from baseline in subjective appetite sensations using visual analogue scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 4 separate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is separated by &gt;1 week. On each test day appetite sensations are measured prior to the test meal (time 0) and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of subjective appetite sensations (visual analogue scales (VAS)) at time 0 (baseline - prior to the test meal) and at time 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake. Measured subjective appetite sensations of hunger, satiety, prospective consumption, fullness, composite appetite score and sensory desires to something sweet, salty, rich in fat, or meat/fish.</description>
