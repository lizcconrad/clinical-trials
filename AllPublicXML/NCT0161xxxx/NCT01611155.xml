    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are going to be treated
      with oxaliplatin chemotherapy as part of your standard care. Oxaliplatin commonly causes
      neuropathy (numbing, tingling and/or pain).The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effects, good and/or bad, of venlafaxine with a placebo (an inactive agent) on
      oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy (numbing, tingling and/or pain)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether venlafaxine can prevent or ameliorate chronic, cumulative neurotoxicity
      associated with oxaliplatin in cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin, fluorouracil,
      leucovorin calcium (FOLFOX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether venlafaxine can ameliorate acute neuropathy associated with
      oxaliplatin.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether venlafaxine can increase the cumulative oxaliplatin doses that can be
      delivered without dose-limiting chronic neurotoxicity.

      II. To explore whether venlafaxine causes adverse events in this setting. III. To explore
      whether the neuropathy data provided by the Rydel-Seiffer graduated tuning fork is consistent
      with patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
      (CIPN) and whether this tool might cause different results in patients receiving venlafaxine
      versus placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive venlafaxine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning on day 1 of and
      continuing through completion of FOLFOX.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID beginning on day 1 of and continuing through
      completion of FOLFOX.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic, cumulative neurotoxicity associated with oxaliplatin during the treatment course as measured by the sensory subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-CIPN20</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 sensory neuropathy score will be calculated using the standard algorithm of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and transformed into a 0-100 point scale. The changes of sensory neuropathy from baseline will be derived by subtracting the baseline score from the sensory neuropathy scores at each cycle of evaluation. Linear mixed models or GEE modeling will be applied, whichever is applicable, based upon available data. The 95% confidence intervals will be constructed for the mean difference in sensory neuropathy score between arms.</description>
