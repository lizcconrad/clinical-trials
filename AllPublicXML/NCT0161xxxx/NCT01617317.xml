      Treatment with hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-IVIG), derived from convalescent
      plasma from patients recovered from H1N1 2009 influenza A infection, for patients with severe
      H1N1 2009 infection will decrease mortality, reduce viral load, and shorten the length of
      stay in ICU and hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the emergence of the novel swine origin influenza A virus (H1N1 2009) in Mexico in
      March 2009, the virus has led to a pandemic in over 170 countries, resulting in over 180
      thousands microbiologically confirmed cases and over 18000 mortality. This strain represents
      a quadruple re-assortment of two swine strains, one human strain, and one avian strain of
      influenza. Although the H1N1 2009 is causing a mild disease and has a relatively low
      mortality rate currently in Hong Kong, severe cases have been reported.

      Patients infected with severe H1N1 2009 have overwhelmed the intensive care services in these
      countries and the mortality has rose up to 6% in Argentina and Brazil, and 0.4% in Australia.
      This is very much higher than the 0.06% mortality rate of the seasonal flu. Furthermore,
      there were reports of H1N1 2009 oseltamivir resistance and zanamivir is difficult to be
      delivered to the consolidated lungs in the severe cases when such drug is most needed. In
      Hong Kong, vaccination for the H1N1 2009 was prioritised to the older people aged 65 or above
      with chronic illness, younger people with chronic illness and health care workers. The
      healthy adults aged 18 to 65, who are most at risk of developing severe H1N1 2009 was not
      covered by the vaccination program. Experience from 1918 H1N1 pandemic and single case report
      on the treatment for severe H5N1 infection (Zhou et al. 2007) showed that hyperimmune
      convalescent plasma is useful (Luke et al. 2006). Mice experiments also showed that antibody
      therapy is highly effective in the case of H5N1 infection (Heltzer ML et al. 2009, Writing
      Committee of the Second World Heath Organization, 2008). Therefore, convalescent plasma from
      patients recovered from H1N1 2009 infection can be harvested to prepare for hyperimmune
      intravenous immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) and the prepared H-IVIG can be assessed in a randomised
      controlled trial for treatment of patients with severe H1N1 2009 infection.
