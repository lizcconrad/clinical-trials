      bioequivalence between Test Product and the corresponding Reference Product under fasting
      condition in healthy adult human subjects.

      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Lamotrigine Tablets 25 mg (2 x 25 mg)of M/s Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the
      corresponding Reference Product: LAMICTAL® (Lamotrigine) Tablets 25 mg (2 x 25 mg) of
      GlaxoSmithkline, USA, under fasting condition in healthy adult human subjects in a randomized
      crossover study.

      The study was conducted with 28 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 2 X 25
      mg dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting
      position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 26 days including washout period of at
      least 21 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.
