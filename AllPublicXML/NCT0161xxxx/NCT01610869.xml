  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to explore the efficacy and safety of an all oral combination of
      BIBF 1120 (an inhibitor of angiogenic signalling) and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients
      with multiply-relapsed advanced ovarian cancer, who have completed a minimum of two lines of
      previous chemotherapy and who for any reason are not suitable for further 'standard'
      intravenous chemotherapy treatments.

      A randomised placebo controlled double blind multi-centre phase II trial: BIBF 1120 200mg bd
      plus 100mg daily of oral cyclophosphamide (experimental arm) or oral cyclophosphamide 100mg
      daily plus placebo (control arm). Patients will receive oral BIBF 1120 and cyclophosphamide
      or cyclophosphamide and placebo continuously until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
