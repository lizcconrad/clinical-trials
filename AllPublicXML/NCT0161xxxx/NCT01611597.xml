  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Validation of a measure specifically suitable to evaluate the residual function of upper
      limbs of non-ambulant neuromuscular patients, especially with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and
      spinal muscular atrophy.

      This approach is of fundamental importance for clinical monitoring and preparing the future
      therapeutic trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is the continuous measurement of muscle activity in a standardized setting
      and in the non ambulatory patient's natural environment. This measure uses an innovative
      technology based on accelerometer and magneto-inertial sensors. The system is intended to
      measure the physical activity of patients from the extraction of data recorded by the sensors
      in the three space axes.

      The non ambulatory patients will be included and evaluated at baseline and 14 days later. The
      patients wear the accelerometer device during some standard evaluations and also at home
      continuously for 14 days.

      With this protocol the investigators want to try to find the best variable that characterizes
      the movement of the upper limbs of non-ambulant neuromuscular patients.

      The aim of Pre-Acti is to propose a primary outcome measure that may be used in clinical
      monitoring of patients.
