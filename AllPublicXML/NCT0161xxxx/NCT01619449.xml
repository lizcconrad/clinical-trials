  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) during orthotopic
      liver transplantation (OLT) in clearing excess solutes and improving acid-base parameters.
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of intra-operative CRRT in OLT recipients is
      associated with increased solute removal and improved acid-base statues when compared to
      controls who do not receive CRRT
