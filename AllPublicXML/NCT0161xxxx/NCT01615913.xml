  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the optimization of anti‐onychomycosis patch with various
      formulation contents (three patch groups: 3%, 6% and 8% of terbinafine (contains 3‐mg, 6‐mg
      and 8‐mg/patch terbinafine, respectively) combined with fixed 2% ketoconazole (contains 2‐mg
      ketoconazole/patch) and its safety profile.

      This study is to explore the optimization of anti‐onychomycosis patch with various
      formulation contents (three patch groups: 3%, 6% and 8% of terbinafine (contains 3‐mg, 6‐mg
      and 8‐mg/patch terbinafine, respectively) combined with fixed 2% ketoconazole (contains 2‐mg
      ketoconazole/patch) and its safety profile. At least 18 patients (age: 20 to 75 years old)
      with one or two feet toenails infected simultaneously need to complete the whole study.
      Patients will be assigned to one of patch groups. The patients with only one infected toenail
      will also apply one patch on other foot with uninfected toenail. The patch will be applied on
      the foot on the dorsal site and leave it there for two consecutive days. Totally six patches
      will be used for each week. The duration of therapy will be 24 weeks. The patients' blood
      sample and toenail clippings will be collected every 8 weeks and will be analyzed as well as
      the safety profiles. The most appropriate patch formulation will be selected on the drug
      content residues in toenail. The safety profile will be also presented and discussed with
      various anti‐onychomycosis patch formulations.

    <description>Both terbinafine and ketoconazole plasma concentration, and their residual contents in toenails will be measured with a validated LC/MS‐MS method.</description>

    <measure>(1) Efficacy is evaluated 24 weeks after the start of treatment and will be recorded at baseline, 8-week, 16-week and 24-week.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8-week, 16-week and 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The degrees of improvement are assessed based on each toenail as follows:
Complete cure is defined as regeneration of a healthy nail plate to replace the diseased nail.
Marked improvement is defined as regeneration of a healthy nail plate in at least 70% of the affected nail.
Improvement is defined as regeneration in 40-70% of the affected nail.
Slight improvement is defined as regeneration in less than 40%.
No change is defined as the absence of change or exacerbation of the disease condition or the side effect.</description>

    <description>A novel transdermal patch that is to be used to treat toenail onychomycosis with minimal body exposure to the antifungal drugs. The active substances in the patch are 3% terbinafine (contains 3-mg terbinafine/patch) and 2% ketoconazole (contains 2‐mg ketoconazole/patch). The average daily released drug amount estimated from in‐vitro skin permeation test were about 3.99 mcg for terbinafine and 1.70 mcg for ketoconazole, respectively.</description>
