  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an enhanced peer intervention is effective
      in retaining and re-engaging at-risk people of color living with HIV/AIDS into care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site longitudinal study of an enhanced peer intervention to re-engage and
      retain high-risk people of color living with HIV into HIV primary care and other needed
      medical or social services. Three demonstration sites are implementing programs in which
      peers are employed as part of the health care team. Peers are trained to conduct educational
      sessions, provide emotional support, help prepare for and accompany patients to appointments,
      and debrief after visits.

      Study participants will be current or newly enrolled patients of three clinics: CARE
      Resources, in Miami FL, the PATH Program at Brooklyn Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, and PR CONCRA
      located in San Juan Puerto Rico who (1) have been out of care for 4 months or more or (2)
      present a need for substance abuse, mental health, or housing services.

      Data will be collected at baseline and follow up (at six and twelve months) through client
      questionnaires, selected medical chart data (visit dates, laboratory tests and values) and
      intervention encounter forms on approximately 375 HIV positive adults. The data collected for
      this study will allow us to assess changes in: (a) retention in HIV primary care, (b) viral
      load suppression, (c) health-related quality of life, (d) self-efficacy, and (e) HIV
      knowledge that may be associated with an enhanced peer intervention.
