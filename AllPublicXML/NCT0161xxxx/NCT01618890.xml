      Study hypothesis:

      Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)-directed primary prophylaxis with nonselective
      beta-blocker therapy (NSBB) leads to a reduction in first variceal bleeding episodes and is
      cost-effective in the long term.

      Study design:

      A multi-center randomized controlled study comparing nonselective beta-blocker therapy guided
      by the hemodynamic response as determined by the difference in HVPG before and after starting
      oral NSBB therapy, to standard heart rate-guided NSBB therapy in patients with esophageal
      varices due to liver cirrhosis without a history of esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      First variceal bleeding episodes occurring within the first two years.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:

        -  Mortality

        -  Occurrence of other cirrhosis-related complications

        -  Occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma

        -  Costs of treatments

        -  Adverse effects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study:

      About 50% of cirrhotic patients who use nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) for primary
      prevention of variceal bleeding do not reach target hemodynamic response, defined as HVPG &lt;
      12 mmHg or a &gt; 20% decrease in HVPG from baseline. These so-called hemodynamic nonresponding
      patients have significantly higher rate of first esophageal variceal hemorrhage as compared
      to patients who do respond to NSBB.

      International institutions that publish guidelines differ in their recommendations concerning
      HVPG monitoring. As a result, practice currently varies widely.

      The investigators hypothesize that HVPG-directed primary prophylaxis leads to a reduction in
      first variceal bleeding episodes and is cost-effective in the long term.

      Objective of the study:

      To determine cost-effectiveness of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)-guided
      nonselective beta-blocker therapy as compared to standard heart rate-guided beta-blocker
      therapy in the primary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

      Study design:

      A multi-center randomized controlled study comparing nonselective beta-blocker therapy guided
      by the hemodynamic response as determined by the difference in HVPG before and after starting
      oral nonselective beta-blockers, to standard heart rate-guided nonselective beta-blocker
      therapy in patients with esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis.

      Study population:

      Patients with liver cirrhosis and large (&gt;5 mm) esophageal varices without a history of
      esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

      Intervention:

      -In HVPG-group: Perform baseline HVPG measurement, then start propranolol 20 mg orally twice
      daily (BID), increase the dose stepwise with 3 days interval to decrease the heart rate to
      maximum tolerated dose. After 4 weeks a second HVPG is performed.

      In hemodynamic responders (who reach target decrease in HVPG) NSBB are continued until end of
      follow-up.

      In hemodynamic nonresponders (who do not reach target decrease in HVPG), NSBB are continued
      and repeated endoscopic band ligation is performed with 2-4 weeks interval until complete
      obliteration of large varices.

      -In control group: Start propranolol 20 mg BID, increase the dose stepwise with 3 days
      interval to maximum heart rate-guided tolerated dose.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      First variceal bleeding episodes occurring within the first two years.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      Mortality Occurrence of other cirrhosis-related complications Occurrence of hepatocellular
      carcinoma Costs of treatments Adverse effects

    <description>A baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement (HVPG measurement) is performed in day-care setting. After this procedure propranolol is started at 20 mg BID. with dose escalation as described in the propranolol arm.
A second HVPG measurement is performed at 4 weeks after adequate propranolol therapy. In patients who reach target HVPG reduction (responders), propranolol is continued at the same dose without routine control endoscopy. In patients who do not reach target HVPG reduction (nonresponders), endoscopic band ligation is performed in day-care setting with intervals of 2-4 weeks until complete obliteration of varices. Follow-up endoscopy with 6 months interval is performed to detect and treat recurrent large varices.</description>
