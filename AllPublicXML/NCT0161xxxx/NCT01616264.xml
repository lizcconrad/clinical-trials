      Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of the Computed Tomograph
      scan three-dimensional reconstruction method for the measurement of the TB pleural effusion
      volume in clinically stable patients.

      Speed, accuracy, and precision in the quantification of pleural effusion are of critical
      importance as it determines whether or not thoracocentesis should be carried out and which
      technique should be employed for such a procedure. This study evaluates the precision of
      thoracic computed tomography with three-dimensional (3D) rebuilding in determining the volume
      of tuberculosis pleural effusion.Twenty patients with pleural effusion were screened and
      invited to take part in the study. Each patient underwent two computed tomography scans,
      before and after one month of treatment for tuberculosis, a total of 40 exams. These were
      evaluated by two expert radiologists. In conclusion, the quantification of the pleural
      effusion volume by using thoracic CT with volumetric three-dimensional reconstruction is a
      highly reproducible method.
