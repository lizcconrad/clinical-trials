      Background:

      Proper pain relief is a major concern of patients worldwide. Preoperatively, one of the most
      common questions asked by patients pertains to the amount of pain they will experience after
      surgery how long it will last and how good will it be controlled. Pain concerns the surgical
      team as well, because of its correlation with clinical outcomes and patients' satisfaction
      rate. Studies have shown that negative clinical outcome with regard to pain control includes
      decreases in vital capacity and alveolar ventilation, pneumonia, tachycardia, hypertension,
      myocardial ischemia, transition into chronic pain, poor wound healing, and psychological
      sequelae .

      Pain has been found to be one of the three most common medical causes of delayed/aborted
      discharge after ambulatory surgery, the other two being drowsiness and postoperative
      nausea/vomiting. Despite progress that has been made with regard to postoperative pain
      control, and the development of new standards for pain control, many patients continue to
      experience intense pain after surgery .

      Recent advances in the understanding of the particularities of central sensitization indicate
      that it plays an important role in post surgical and post traumatic pain and therefore should
      be avoided

      Hypothesis:

      No studies considered the comparison of pre-emptive and post-incisional or post-surgery PGL
      administration. The investigators hypothesize that the administration of PGL preemptively
      would diminish pain sensation, and therefore the need for pain administration in
      neurosurgical patients, better than postoperatively. In addition, preoperative administration
      could reduce the level of anxiety in these patients.

      It should be stressed that this study will used a placebo controlled group and at availuating
      placebo related psychological effective treatment versus a central efficacy of Lyrica

      Objectives:

      To assess the beneficial preemptive and preventive effects of PGL on the immediate and late
      (1- and 3 months) postoperative analgesia requirements and pain scores in neurosurgical
      patients.
