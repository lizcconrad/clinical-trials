      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of women and is the most common endocrine
      syndrome.PCOS is associated with infertility, risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The
      elevated insulin characteristic of PCOS is likely to play a major role in its symptoms.
      restricted calorie High protein diet and mediterranean diet may improve insulin sensitivity
      and therefore lower androgen production in women with pcos women.the purpose of this study is
      to determine which diet is more effective in improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes.

      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous syndrome affecting 5-10% of women of
      reproductive age. It is characterized by elevated circulating insulin, reduced insulin
      sensitivity, infertility, hyperandrogenism, and a multitude of symptoms that result in a
      decreased quality of life. The elevated insulin characteristic of PCOS is likely to play a
      major role in its pathogenesis by reducing insulin sensitivity and stimulating excess
      androgen production hence causing an hormonal imbalance.

      Low calories diets have shown to improve pcos symptoms but the optimal diet for all pcos
      women is still unknown.

      In this study, our purpose is to compare two lowering insulin restricted calories diets in
      order to find the optimal diet for improving metabolic and endocrin outcomes in pcos women we
      will also investigate which diet has the best long lasting compliance.
