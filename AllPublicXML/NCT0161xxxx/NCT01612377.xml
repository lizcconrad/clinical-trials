    <textblock>
      This is a long-term Phase II safety study of approximately 52 weeks in duration. Eligible
      patients will have completed at least 6 weeks of Protocol Z102-008 and will have met all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study.

      All patients will be up-titrated on Z102 over 3 weeks or will receive prednisone 5.0 mg or
      7.5 mg:

      Primary objectives:

        -  Adverse events (AEs)

        -  Vital signs

        -  Clinical laboratory and clinical chemistry evaluations

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Joint imaging and bone density

        -  DAS28-CRP and individual components

        -  Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity

        -  American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70)

        -  Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF)

        -  Time to failure
