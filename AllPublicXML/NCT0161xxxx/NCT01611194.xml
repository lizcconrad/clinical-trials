    <description>The primary objective of this randomized study is to provide a rationale for the selection of outcome assessments to serve as primary and secondary endpoints for a pivotal randomizedclinical trial of hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of PCS. The participants will undergo a comprehensive battery of symptom and quality of life assessments. The distribution of response, change in response over time, homogeneity of variance across subgroups, and relationships between outcome measures will be compared by treatment assignment with a cohort from a study of similar design among a normal study population.</description>
