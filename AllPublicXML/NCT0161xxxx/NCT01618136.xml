    <textblock>
      Overall Design: This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study which will be conducted in
      three arms (as described below). Each arm will be conducted in two parts: a Phase 1 part
      which will include dose escalation and a Phase 2 part which will include four cohorts in
      specific disease indications. Phase 1 will also include a food effect study of E7449 as a
      single agent. Once the MTD in the Phase 1 single agent arm and the Phase 1 combination arms
      of this study has been achieved, the sponsor will submit the relevant safety information and
      recommended Phase 2 dose to the IRB/Health Authorities. Arm 1: E7449 will be administered as
      a single agent. Arm 2: E7449 will be administered in combination with TMZ. Arm 3: E7449 will
      be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel

             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

         12. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partner must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing potential
             or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation).
