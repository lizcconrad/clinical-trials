  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to determine the time to resolution of individual acne lesions using
      a popular handheld heat based device in comparison to no treatment and to standard topical
      therapy with benzoyl peroxide in order to determine its effectiveness in the spot treatment
      of acne vulgaris. Patient satisfaction and potential side effects will be examined as well.
