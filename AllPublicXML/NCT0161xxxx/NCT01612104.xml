      The purpose of this pilot-study is to evaluate a cognitive behavioral method &quot;Psychological
      First Aid&quot; used with a group of children (11-16 years) in high risk of developing
      psychological problems. Participants are recruited from a low-threshold program (&quot;The
      Children's House in Oslo&quot;) where counseling is given to children suspected of being
      physically or sexually abused, or having witnessed domestic violence. The study includes
      twelve children and teenagers that receive 2 to 6 sessions of counseling. Psychological
      problems (e.g. anxiety, depression, reactions to trauma) and quality of life will be assessed
      at pre- post and follow-up (after 3, 6 and 12 months). In addition, some symptoms of will be
      assessed daily.
