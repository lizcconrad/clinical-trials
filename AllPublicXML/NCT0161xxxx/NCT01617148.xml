      This study will examine the use of Aflibercept in patients with exudative macular
      degeneration requiring intravitreal injections. Patients will be followed for 12 months.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to examine the use of Aflibercept in patients who have been
      previously treated with Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab for exudative macular degeneration.
      Specifically, we will examine its effect on macular degeneration, measured by SDOCT (Spectral
      Domain Optical Coherence Tomography) and ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study)
      visual acuity. This will be a prospective study with patients to receive an intravitreal
      injection of Aflibercept at the time of treatment.

          2. Men and women ≥ 50 years of age.

          3. Active primary subfoveal CNV lesions secondary to AMD, including juxtafoveal lesions
             that affect the fovea as evidenced by historical OCTs and angiograms in the study eye.

          4. CNV must be at least 50% of total lesion size by either previous or current angiogram.

          5. ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity of: 20/25 to 20/320 (letter score of 73 to 25) in
             the study eye.

          6. Willing, committed, and able to return for ALL clinic visits and complete all study
             related procedures.

          7. At least one injection of Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab within 3 months of enrollment for
             active exudative AMD.

          8. Active need for anti-VEGF therapy at study entry based on the following criteria:

               1. Presence of fluid by either OCT or clinical examination (further defined as
                  intraretinal, cystoid, subretinal, worsening pigment epithelial detachment)

               2. Presence of new hemorrhage on clinical examination

        Exclusion Criteria

        A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Any prior or concomitant therapy with another investigational agent to treat
             neovascular AMD in the study eye, except dietary supplements or vitamins.

          2. Prior systemic anti-VEGF therapy, investigational or FDA/Health Canada approved, is
             only allowed up to 3 months prior to first dose, and will not be allowed during the
             study.

          3. Presence of retinal pigment epithelial tears or rips involving the macula in the study

          4. History of any vitreous hemorrhage within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 in the study eye.

          5. Presence of other causes of CNV, including pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent of
             -8 diopters or more negative, or axial length of 25 mm or more), ocular histoplasmosis
             syndrome, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, or multifocal choroiditis in the study
             eye.

          6. History or clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema or any
             other vascular disease affecting the retina, other than AMD, in either eye.

          7. Prior vitrectomy in the study eye.

          8. History of retinal detachment or treatment or surgery for retinal detachment in the
             study eye.

          9. Any history of macular hole of stage 2 and above in the study eye.

         10. Any intraocular or periocular surgery within 3 months of Day 1 on the study eye,
             except lid surgery, which may not have taken place within 1 month of day 1, as long as
             it's unlikely to interfere with the injection.

         11. Prior trabeculectomy or other filtration surgery in the study eye.

         12. Uncontrolled glaucoma at baseline evaluation (defined as intraocular pressure ≥25 mmHg

         21. History of corneal transplant or corneal dystrophy in the study eye.

         22. Significant media opacities, including cataract, in the study eye which might

         23. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g. cataract) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, could require either medical or surgical intervention
             during the 52 week study period.

         24. Any concurrent ocular condition in the study eye which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could either increase the risk to the subject beyond what is to be
             expected from standard procedures of intraocular injection, or which otherwise may
             interfere with the injection procedure or with evaluation of efficacy or safety.

         25. Participation as a subject in any clinical study within the 12 weeks prior to Day 1.

         26. Any systemic with an investigational agent in the past 3 months prior to Day 1.

             menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device [IUD]; bilateral tubal
             ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly, or diaphragm
             plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

               -  *Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to
                  be considered of child bearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are
