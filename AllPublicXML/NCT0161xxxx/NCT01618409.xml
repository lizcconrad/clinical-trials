    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of Spanish-language
      illustrated medication instructions (PictureRx cards), compared to traditional medication
      instructions, on Latinos' understanding of their medication regimens. The study will also
      assess the effect on self-reported medication adherence. Patients with diabetes who attend
      participating clinics are eligible. The target sample size is 200.
