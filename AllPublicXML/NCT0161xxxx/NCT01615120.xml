      Protocol G200712 is a Phase II, exploratory study to assess the effects of GTx-758 on serum
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) response ans serum PSA progression in men with Metastatic
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) on Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) with
      luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, LHRH antagonists, or orchidectomy.
      This study will also assess the venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk of lower doses of GTx-758.

             contraception from the time of the first administration of study medication until 3
             months following administration of the last dose of study medication.Acceptable

             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository [i.e., barrier method of contraception], surgical
             sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azospermia) and a barrier method
             {condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/fil/cream/suppository}, the female partner uses
             oral contraceptives (combination estrogen/progesterone pills), injectable progesterone
             or subdermal implants and a barrier method {condom used with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository}.

          -  If the female partner has undergone documented tubal ligation (female sterilization),
             a barrier method {condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository} should
             be used

          -  If the female partner has undergone documented placement of an intrauterine device
             (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), a barrier method {condom with spermicidal
