  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by progressive cyst
      formation in both kidneys, in most patients leading to end stage renal disease. It is the
      most common hereditary renal disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1,000 persons.
      The majority of patients also have progressive cyst formation in the liver, leading to pain,
      gastrointestinal discomfort and sometimes the need for liver transplantation. At present
      there is no proven therapeutic intervention to slow the rate of disease progression in human
      ADPKD. The development of renoprotective treatments that are well tolerated, is therefore of
      major importance.

      In this respect, somatostatin analogues are promising for especially polycystic liver
      disease, but also for the renal phenotype. However, the studies that have been performed thus
      far with these agents, were underpowered and of too short duration to reach a definitive
      conclusion on the potential reno- and hepatoprotective efficacy of somatostatin analogues.
      Therefore, the present study is designed as a randomised clinical trial with sufficient
      duration of follow-up to investigate whether the somatostatin analogue Lanreotide slows
      progression of polycystic kidney and liver disease in ADPKD-patients.

      To this end, 300 ADPKD patients, aged 18-60years, with an eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2) will be
      randomized 1:1 to standard care or monthly subcutaneous lanreotide injections on top off
      standard care. These 300 subjects will go through 15 study visits in 3 years and 1 follow up
      visit. During these visits, questionnaires will be filled in, physical examinations will be
      performed, blood will be drawn and urine collected. After study completion, rate of renal
      function decline in lanreotide treated subjects will be compared to that of subject who
      received standard care.

      Aims:

      First, to determine whether Lanreotide attenuates progression of the renal phenotype in ADPKD
      patients as measured by change in rate of renal function decline and change in renal volume
      growth.

      Second, to determine whether Lanreotide modifies progression of the liver phenotype in the
      subset of ADPKD patients with moderate to severe polycystic liver disease as measured by
      change in liver volume.

      Methods:

      Investigator driven, randomized, multi-center, controlled clinical trial.

      Study population:

      300 subjects, diagnosed with ADPKD, based on the revised Ravine criteria, with advanced
      disease and high likelihood of rapid disease progression (eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73
      m2 and age between 18 and 60 years).

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized (1:1) into two groups. One group will receive a dose of
      Lanreotide 120 mg sc every 28 days for 30 months. The dose of Lanreotide will be eGFR (BSA
      unadjusted) dependent. Subjects that reach an eGFR &lt;30ml/min during the study will receive
      Lanreotide 90 mg sc every 28 days. Down-titration will also occur in case of dose related
      side effects. The other group of patients will receive standard care.

      Main study endpoint:

      Change in renal function in Lanreotide versus not treated patients, as assessed as slope
      through serial eGFR measurements over time during the treatment phase of the trial, with the
      value obtained at month 3 as first eGFR value for slope analysis.

      Main secondary outcome variables:

        -  to determine whether Lanreotide modifies ADPKD progression as measured by change in
           renal volume in the overall study population,

        -  to determine whether Lanreotide modifies ADPKD progression as measured by change in
           liver volume in the subset of ADPKD patients with moderate to severe polycystic liver
           disease

        -  to determine whether Lanreotide changes the quality of life

        -  to determine whether Lanreotide is well tolerated

             likely to confound endpoint assessments (e.g. diabetes mellitus for which medication
             is needed and patients with proteinuria &gt; 1 g /24hr).

          4. Patients who underwent surgical or drainage interventions for cystic kidney disease
             the year before study-entry or are likely candidates for these procedures within 2
