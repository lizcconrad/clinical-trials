      Aim of Study: Adverse effects from noise pollution in operation theatres have been throughly
      demonstrated. We assessed the impact of a noise reduction program in paediatric surgery.

      Methods: A prospective controlled study on 156 operations performed by 16 surgeons was
      conducted. The sound levels before and after a noise reduction program based on education,
      rules and technical devices (Sound Ear tm) were assessed. Endpoints were spatially resolved
      sound levels matched by the surgeon's biometric (saliva cortisol, electrodermal activity) and
      behavioural stress responses (questionnaires). These were correlated with mission protocols
      and NoiSeQ for individual noise sensitivity.

      We recorded median noise levels in the control vs. interventional group including the count
      of peak events with different tresholds.

      Three phases were conducted: 1. Reference group/phase I 2. Control group/phase II The full
      data set was recorded by a research clerk present in theatre however all staff were left
      unaware of the study purpose 3. Intervention group/phase III. The intervention consisted of a
      panel of work rules including mainly communication regulations (only conversations concerning
      the current case were allowed, no in and out during surgery, mobile phone ban etc.. Measures
      were backed by intervention conferences, posters and pictograms. .

      A wear off-effect was sought after . Biometrically, we analyzed the surgeon's pre- to
      postoperative rise in cortisol and the proportion of the surgeon's electrodermal potentials
      of &gt;15µS indicating severe stress. Intra-team communication, a decrease in disturbing
      conversations and sudden noise peaks were investigated and correlated with the individual
      noise sensitivity determined by the noise Q questionnaire.
