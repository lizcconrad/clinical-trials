    <textblock>
      Some recent reports indicate that incidence of prostate cancer is increasing rapidly in
      China. However, no large-scale survey of prostate cancer has been done in central China, few
      data are available regarding its management. The investigators aimed to analyze the
      management of prostate cancer and compare the outcome of patients with such a survey.

      The investigators collected data of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from the 2003 and
      2008 in central China. Data were disaggregated by rural and urban hukou. The survival rate of
      patients was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were analyzed using the
      log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.

    <description>We selected 9 cities (Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Anyang, Xinyang, Zhoukou, Shangqiu, Nanyang, Zhumadian) by probability proportional to size sampling from geographical regions in central China. All cases with complete follow-up data of histological-proven prostate cancer treated in 2003 and 2008 at 14 department of urology in the 9 cities were retrospectively collected. Only patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were included in the study. Those with a history of prostate cancer who were treated for another disease were excluded from study.</description>
