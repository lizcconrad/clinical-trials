  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthostatic hypotension is a major complication of hemodialysis and interferes with everyday
      activities in hemodialysis patients. Since information regarding the use of droxidopa in
      clinical trials relating to orthostatic hypotension of chronic hemodialysis patients is
      limited in Taiwan, this study is designed for evaluation the efficacy and safety profile of
      droxidopa on orthostatic hypotension treatment / prevention in hemodialysis patients.
