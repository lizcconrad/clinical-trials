      This randomized controlled community-based trial will assess the effectiveness of
      administration of 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol with standard of care vs. placebo with
      standard of care for postpartum hemorrhage treatment at the community level, primarily home
      births attended by primary health care unit (PHU) staff in Etay El Barood and Kafr El Dawar
      districts (El Beheira governorate), Egypt. Standard of care per national guidelines in this
      setting is referral to a higher level health facility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-based clinical trials have demonstrated misoprostol to be a safe and effective
      treatment option for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Additional research is needed to
      demonstrate how these findings translate into program effectiveness at lower levels of the
      health care system, including community home births, where access to skilled providers and
      treatment options are limited and misoprostol could potentially have the greatest impact on
      maternal health outcomes. This randomized controlled community treatment trial will assess
      the effectiveness of misoprostol with standard of care (i.e., referral to higher level care)
      vs. placebo with standard of care for PPH treatment at the community level, primarily home
      births attended by primary health care unit staff in Etay El Barood and Kafr El Dawar
      districts (El Beheira governorate), Egypt. This research will help guide decisions on how to
      introduce misoprostol into PPH care programs in different contexts such as primary care
      settings, including community-based home births.
