  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive genetic disease always progressed
      slowly，tends to leading proximal skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness of limbs, as well as
      impaired respiratory muscle and cardiac muscle. To a large extent, patients always lose motor
      function gradually and die for heart failure or severe infection at the end stage of DMD. At
      present, the treatment strategy relies on heteropathy accompanied with rehabilitation
      training. However, the therapeutic effect remains extremely limited.

      Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have been evidenced to improve motor
      function, increase muscle strength and reduce abnormal levels of related enzymes, such as
      creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST). This study is aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of
      hUC-MSCs transplantation for DMD.
