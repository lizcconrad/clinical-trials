    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the irreversible degeneration of articular cartilage and underlying
      bone. It poses a major healthcare problem as it is the leading cause of joint disease and
      disability in the United States. It was traditionally thought that OA was a consequence of
      aging and joint trauma. However, it is now thought that OA is a result of the interplay of
      multiple genetic, biomechanical, and biochemical factors that disrupt the normal homeostasis
      of cartilage, bone, and synovium.

      OA is classified into two groups, primary and secondary. Primary OA is classically
      polyarticular and peripheral while secondary OA can commonly be attributed to a specific
      cause, limited to a singular joint, and a result of trauma. It is known as post-traumatic OA
      (PTOA). Other causes of secondary OA include congenital disorders, calcium pyrophosphate
      dehydrate deposition disease, and other diseases. Regardless of classification, genetic
      variation in the normal metabolism of cartilage and bone is thought to play a role in the
      progression of OA. Furthermore, the polyarticular presentation of primary idiopathic
      osteoarthritis suggests that it may have a stronger genetic component as compared to
      secondary OA, indicating a deviation from normal cartilage and bone homeostasis.

      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their inhibitors take part in the metabolism of cartilage
      and bone. MMPs are enzymes that catalyze the degradation of elements within joint spaces
      while their inhibitors cease this activity. Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a
      naturally-occurring plasma glycoprotein that functions throughout multiple tissues and
      extracellular spaces as a protease inhibitor but does not normally reach high levels within
      the intra-articular joint space. A2M is believed to modulate the systemic inflammatory
      response by its ability to bait, trap, and clear various MMPs and cytokines. Concentrated A2M
      directly addresses the roles of cytokines and catabolic enzymes known to participate in the
      development of osteoarthritis. Cytonics has shown that A2M can inhibit cartilage degradation
      in vitro. As the role of MMPs and protease inhibitors have emerged as key components of OA,
      the investigation of regulators of MMP has become of interest to elucidate the pathogenesis
      and possible novel treatments of OA.

      This study aims to measure and correlate the levels of alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M) in plasma
      and knee joint OA between primary post-traumatic (PTOA) and secondary osteoarthritis groups.

      This is a single institution observational study.

      Pre-procedure diagnosis: Based on chart review and consultation with operating surgeon of
      subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty, patients will be grouped into primary or
      secondary (PTOA) osteoarthritis groups. Primary osteoarthritis will be identified through a
      clinical presentation of generalized osteoarthritis with possible bilateral involvement and
      no identifiable trauma or overuse to knee joint. Secondary osteoarthritis will be identified
      by history of overuse or trauma to the afflicted knee and a clinical presentation that in
      general lacks symmetrical involvement and/or severity, PTOA.

      On the date of surgery, both primary and secondary groups will have 2 cc whole blood
      collected via venipuncture during placement of intravenous access for anesthesia. No
      additional venipuncture is necessary and this study necessitates no
      instrumentation/manipulation of patient beyond that of IV access normally obtained
      preoperatively. Blood will then be placed in refrigerated storage (2-6 C) until analyzed for
      A2M assay.

      On the date of surgery, joint aspirate from both primary and secondary groups will be
      collected by the operating surgeon during knee arthroplasty. At the time of arthrotomy, joint
      fluid that is expressed from surgical site will be harvested and placed into an eppendorf
      tube and placed on ice. The study incurs no further risk to the patient and no further
      instrumentation/manipulation for synovial fluid harvest that is beyond the risk or
      instrumentation/manipulation of the indicated surgical procedure. Joint aspirates will then
      be stored until A2M assay.
