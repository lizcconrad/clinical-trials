    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning, specifically the activities of daily living and mobility. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder. The person receives a score based on whether they have received help while doing the task. The ability to undertake the 10 different daily activities was assessed on scales of 0-1, 0-2 or 0-3, with 0 indicative of the poorest outcome and the highest possible score indicative of the best outcome. The summary parameter was the total score for each of the ten items, with a minimum possible score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 20. An increased score indicates an improvement, with a change of two or greater in the total score indicating a clinically relevant change. A positive value therefore indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Barthel Activities for Daily Living Scale Score at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Barthel Index consists of 10 items that measure a person's daily functioning, specifically the activities of daily living and mobility. The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder. The person receives a score based on whether they have received help while doing the task. The ability to undertake the 10 different daily activities was assessed on scales of 0-1, 0-2 or 0-3, with 0 indicative of the poorest outcome and the highest possible score indicative of the best outcome. The summary parameter was the total score for each of the ten items, with a minimum possible score of 0 and a maximum possible score of 20. An increased score indicates an improvement, with a change of two or greater in the total score indicating a clinically relevant change. A positive value therefore indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <description>The Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration test is a questionnaire designed to measure orientation, concentration on simple tasks and learning and recall of simple information. The test consists of six items, such as 'what year is it now?' and 'count backwards from 20 to 1'. Each item was scored between 0 (maximum number of errors) and three-10 (best score; no errors), with a point deducted for each error. The summary parameter was the total score from the sum of scores for each item, with an overall possible maximum score of 28 (no errors). Scores over 20 are considered ‘normal’. As such, an increased score indicates an improvement, and a positive value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The Caregiver Strain Index is a 13-item questionnaire designed to detect strain in those that care for subjects. Carers were asked if they found certain situations difficult (i.e. work adjustments, family adjustment, emotional adjustments, physical effort). Each question was scored zero (answered no) or one (answered yes), and was recorded for each of the 13 questions. The summary parameter was the total score, which was the sum score of the 13 questions, giving a minimum possible score of 0 (no strain) and maximum possible score of 13 (maximum possible strain). As such a negative value from baseline indicates an improvement in caregiver strain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Guy's Neurological Disability Scale Score at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Guy's Neurological Disability Scale has 12 separate categories which include cognition, mood, vision, speech, swallowing, upper limb function, lower limb function, bladder function, bowel function, sexual function, fatigue, and 'others'. Each category consists of a series of questions, which are scored on a 0 to 5 scale, with 0 being indicative of a better outcome and 5 being indicative of a worse outcome. The total Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale score is the unweighted sum from the 12 categories with a minimum score of 0 and maximum of 60. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <population>All subjects randomised who received at least one dose of study medication and had any on-treatment evaluable efficacy data recorded were included in the analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Total Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery Test Score at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery test comprises six sub-sections which assess cognition and mental alertness. These include immediate and delayed story recall, word-list learning, copying a complex figure followed by its immediate reproduction, design learning, and information processing (parts A and B). The sum score for each section gave the total score which ranged from 1 (bad) to 105 (good). As such, a positive value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>
