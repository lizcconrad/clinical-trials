  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac output (CO) is an important hemodynamic variable in the management of critically ill
      patients. The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) requires invasive techniques with potential
      complications and there is increasing interest in less invasive methods of measuring CO. This
      study is designed to compare CO values from PAC thermodilution (COTD) and ultrasound dilution
      (COUD).
