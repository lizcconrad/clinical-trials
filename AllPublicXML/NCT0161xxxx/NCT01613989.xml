      Computer assistance in prosthetic hip surgery is able to improve the accuracy of the surgery:
      Associating hip navigation and EOSTM imaging pre-operatively could simplify the procedure of
      hip navigation in lateral decubitus while maintaining the accuracy of the technique

    <textblock>
      Hip navigation based on preoperative EOS(TM) imaging could help to improve the accuracy of
      cup positioning like other computer assisted hip surgery, but it would also simplify the
      procedure in lateral decubitus. Indeed, the registration of the controlateral antero superior
      iliac spine and the pubis is not necessary with this technique. The target population of the
      study is the one affected with primitive hip osteoarthritis for which an indication of
      prosthesis of total hip has been chosen Expected Result: Simplification of the procedure of
      navigation of the cup. Decrease in the number of cups positioned out of the &quot;security zone&quot;
      compared to the standard manual technique of cup positioning. A result of 50% of good
      positioning is expected with the manual technique versus 80% with the technique of navigation
      based on EOS(TM).

      MAIN OBJECTIVE: Compare the surgical treatment of total hip prosthesis without assistance by
      computer and total hip prosthesis with navigation based on imaging EOSTM pre-operative
      Comparative clinical trial of superiority, randomized in single blind, in 2 parallel groups:
      -Group 1: Installation of hip prosthesis without assistance by computer -Group 2:
      Installation of hip prosthesis with assistance by computer based on imaging EOS(TM)

    <description>The patient will be installed in supine side position. The cup will be navigated with the technique based on EOS imaging. This technique requires the registration of the homolateral antero superior iliac spine and the homolateral postero superior iliac spine only. It does not require the registration of the pubis or any other controlateral points which are poorly accessible in the supine side position</description>
