      This study is studying the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a standard
      protocol of gentle yoga and breath meditation, on patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
      The investigators are testing whether this intervention can help improve the stress response
      and increase resiliency and mindfulness for patients with TBI, which may lead to improved
      symptoms and neurocognitive function.
