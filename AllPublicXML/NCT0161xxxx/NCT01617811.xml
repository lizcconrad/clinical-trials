    <intervention_name>epidural anesthesia and analgesia</intervention_name>
    <description>A thoracic epidural catheter (T8-10) was placed in group E. A bolus of 8ml 1% lidocaine with 0.375% ropivacaine was administered 15min before skin incision, followed by 5-8 ml/hr infusion during surgery in group E.
Postoperative analgesia by PCEA in group E (concentration: 0.1% ropivacaine + 0.1μg/ml sufentanil, loading dose: 4ml, infusion rate: 8ml/hr, bolus: 4ml, 1hr limit: 16ml) and lasting for 48hr and PCIA in group G (concentration: 1μg/ml sufentanil, loading dose: 4ml, bolus: 2ml, 4hr limit: 30ml).
Both group received general anesthesia maintaining with 1-2% end tidal sevoflurane together with TCI of propofol (target plasma concentration, 2-3µg/ml), continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.10 - 0.20 μg/kg/min) and cis-atracurium intermittently as needed.</description>
