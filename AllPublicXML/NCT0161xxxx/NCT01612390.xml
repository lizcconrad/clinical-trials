      Sublingual misoprostol is superior to oxytocin in reduction of blood loss during the third
      and fourth stages of labor as The data from a pharmacokinetics study suggested that the
      bioavaiblitiy of misoprostol after sub-lingual administration was higher than those after
      oral or vaginal administration
