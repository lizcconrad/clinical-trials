    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label study and consists of 3 treatment groups (dose levels) .
      Treatment cycles are 3 weeks in duration. The primary objective of this study is to determine
      the recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of veliparib (ABT-888) when administered in combination
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel in Japanese subjects with solid tumors. Secondary objectives
      are to assess pharmacokinetics and to obtain a preliminary efficacy of anti-tumor activity in
      the subjects.
