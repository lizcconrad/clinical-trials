  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, experimental medicine study to evaluate the efficacy, safety
      and mechanism of action of belimumab in subjects with antiphospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)
      autoantibody positive idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy (IMGN), and to profile the
      relationship between biomarkers, autoantibody status and clinical response. 10 milligrams per
      kilogram (mg/kg) belimumab intravenous (IV) will be administered at weeks 0, 2, and then
      every 4 weeks, over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with anti-PLA2R antibody positive
      IMGN followed by a further long term treatment period until subjects reach remission of
      proteinuria, up to a maximum of 2 years total treatment. All subjects will receive background
      supportive therapy throughout the study. The dosing frequency will be adjusted to every 2
      weeks if the subject's proteinuria as assessed by urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) is
      greater than 1000 milligrams per millimole (mg/mmol) [greater than 10 grams(g)/24 hours (h)],
      to compensate for loss of belimumab in the urine. Effects on mechanistic markers will be
      measured by the level of proteinuria, levels of anti-PLA2R antibodies, and various other
      measures of kidney function. These will be compared to historical data. The pharmacokinetics
      of belimumab will be measured to confirm dosing in heavily proteinuric subjects.
      Pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, biomarkers and Quality of Life(QoL) in IMGN subjects will also
      be investigated. Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AE), clinical laboratory
      evaluations, and vital signs.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Proteinuria Levels at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Proteinuria based on urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) was measured from 2 consecutive 24 hour (h) urine collection pre and post dosing at Baseline and Week 28 and the mean PCR was determined at each time point. Baseline is defined as the mean of the pre and post dosing Day 0 values. The ratio is defined as the Week 28 value divided by the Baseline value. Ratio to Baseline: Estimated value = 0.76, 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.57 to 1.01. The geometric mean method was used to calculate the CI. The analysis was performed on Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population which comprised of all eligible participants who received at least one dose of investigational drug. Only those participants available at the indicated time point (Week 28) were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Proteinuria Levels at Week 28</title>
        <description>Proteinuria based on urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) was measured from 2 consecutive 24 hour (h) urine collection pre and post dosing at Baseline and Week 28 and the mean PCR was determined at each time point. Baseline is defined as the mean of the pre and post dosing Day 0 values. The ratio is defined as the Week 28 value divided by the Baseline value. Ratio to Baseline: Estimated value = 0.76, 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.57 to 1.01. The geometric mean method was used to calculate the CI. The analysis was performed on Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population which comprised of all eligible participants who received at least one dose of investigational drug. Only those participants available at the indicated time point (Week 28) were analyzed.</description>

        <description>Proteinuria based on urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) measured from 2 consecutive 24h urine collections at Baseline and Week 28, from a pre-intervention spot urine sample and 24 hour urine collection after visit at Weeks 12, 52, 76 and 104, and from a spot urine sample at week 128. Mean PCR was calculated at each time point where there were 2 samples. Baseline is defined as Day 0 value and change from Baseline was calculated as ratio of post-Baseline value divided by the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Anti-PLA2R autoantibody titers in serum were analyzed by means of a validated anti- PLA2R enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Euroimmun. Baseline is defined as the Day 0 value and change from Baseline was calculated as ratio of post-Baseline value divided by the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Time to Complete or Partial Remission</title>
        <description>Time to complete or partial remission was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Complete remission is defined as PCR &lt;30 mg/mmol (proteinuria &lt;0.3g/24 h) with no worsening in renal function (eGFR reduction from Baseline &lt;15 percent ). Partial remission is defined as PCR &lt;350 mg/mmol (proteinuria &lt;3.5 g/24 h) but &gt;= 30 mg/mmol (proteinuria &gt;= 0.3g/24h) and decrease of &gt;50 percent from Day 0 Baseline, together with no consistent worsening in renal function (eGFR reduction from Baseline &lt;15 percent). Only 1 participant reached complete remission. Hence, statistical analysis for complete remission was not performed.</description>

        <description>Incidence of anti-PLA2R autoantibody remission were evaluated by full response and partial response. Full response is defined as antibody undetectable, partial response is defined as reduction in titers by 50 percent. For anti PLA2R autoantibody data, log transformation was applied before the formal analyses. Anti-PLA2R autoantibody blood samples were evaluated at Week 12, 28, 52, 76, 104 and 128/6 week post last-dose. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category titles).</description>

          <description>Trough concentration (Cmin) samples collected on the specified days are being used to assess attainment whether there was sufficient belimumab despite it being lost in the urine from the proteinuria and to check if it improved as proteinuria resolved. Analysis was performed on pre-infusion samples at weeks 2,4,8,12,28,40,52,76 and the 4 week post last-dose.</description>

A population approach was undertaken to characterize the population PK parameters and associated variability of belimumab in nephrotic participants. The population approach could have provided derived clearance of belimumab for each participant after the first dose. The population PK analysis was conducted using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM) or appropriate nonlinear mixed-effect analysis software. Several samples were taken pre-dose at Day 0 and some at week 12 incorrectly which affects interpretation.</description>

        <description>Health-related quality of life was assessed through participant self-completion of the short form health survey (SF-36 version [v2]), a general health related quality of life metrics. Norm-based Scores (NBS) for physical functioning, role emotional, role physical were assessed. The remaining SF-36 component scores require re-scaling and therefore will be added at a later date. SF-36 was administered prior to any procedures at Weeks 12, 28, 52, 76 and 104/4 week post last dose. Item score were recorded and higher score represented better health status. Baseline is defined as Day 0 pre dose value and change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Urinalysis Dipstick Findings</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for urinalysis by dipstick method from Baseline up to Week 116/16 months follow up and number of participants with findings were presented for Baseline, Week 12, 28, 52, 76, 104/4 weeks post last-dose and Week 116/16 week follow up (WF). The urinalysis parameters included occult blood, glucose, ketones, protein. The findings were presented as trace or 1/10 g/100 milliliter (dL), trace, negative, 4+, 3+, 3+ or 1 g/dL, 2+ or 1/2 g/dL, 2+, 1+ or 1/4 g/dL and 1+. Only participants present at the specific time points were presented (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</title>
        <description>SBP and DBP were measured from Baseline throughout the treatment period up to Week 116/ 16 week follow-up visit. The Baseline value was taken at Day 0 pre dose and change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were measured and presented for Week 12, 28, 52, 76, 104 withdrawn visit, 4 Week post last dose and 16 Week follow-up visit. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>B cell Facs panels were used to measure changes over the course of therapy in B cell subsets such as transitional, naïve, memory and plasma B cell compartments by percent of the B cell compartments and absolute numbers. T cell Facs panel were used to measure changes in T cell subsets, such as T regs and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in terms of numbers and expression of activation markers to establish if B cell targeting with belimumab affects the T cell compartment perhaps through limiting B cell antigen presentation or cytokine release. Baseline is defined as Day 0 value and change from Baseline was calculated as ratio of post-Baseline value divided by the Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) normalized by creatinine as a ratio of BLyS: creatinine. Free BLyS protein is being analyzed using an ELISA. Urine samples are being collected before treatment and after belimumab washout at Week 0 and Week 116/16 week follow-up visit. Only raw BLyS values available and unable to be assessed due to lack of comparison to a creatinine as a urine concentration marker.</description>
