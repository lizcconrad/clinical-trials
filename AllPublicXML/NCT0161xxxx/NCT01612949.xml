  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop a computer algorithm that can accurately predict how
      easy or difficult it is to intubate a patient based upon digital photographs from three
      different perspectives. Such an application can provide a consistent, quantitative measure of
      intubation difficulty by analyzing facial features in captured photographs - features which
      have previously been shown to correlate with how easy or how hard it would be to perform the
      intubation procedure. This is in contrast to established subjective protocols that also serve
      to predict intubation difficulty, albeit with lower accuracy. A digital application has the
      potential to decrease potential complications related to intubation difficulty and increase
      patient safety.

      Both control and experimental cohorts will be recruited in this study. In order to drive
      clinical acceptance of this technique, the investigators will need to study and then
      demonstrate applicability to all patients regardless of race or gender. This will require the
      recruitment of a control population of patients who have been demonstrated at surgery to be
      easy to intubate. Such patients are in relative abundance. The experimental group will
      consist of patients who are found at surgery to be difficult to intubate. Patients are
      defined as easy to intubate if their anesthetic record described a single attempt with a
      Macintosh 3 blade resulting in a grade 1 laryngoscopic view (full exposure of the vocal
      cords). Difficult intubation was defined by at least one of: more than one attempt by an
      operator with at least one year of anesthesia experience, grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view on
      a 4 point scale, 5 need for a second operator, or non-elective use of an alternative airway
      device such as a bougie, fiberoptic bronchoscope or intubating laryngeal mask airway.

      The primary purpose of the study is to develop algorithms capable of discriminating patients
      who are likely to be difficult to intubate from those who are likely to be easy to intubate
      based on facial appearance. The primary analysis is the demonstration of statistical
      significance in the ability of the derived algorithms to determine successfully whether a
      subject was easy or difficult to intubate. A secondary analysis is the demonstration of a
      statistical difference in performance between the derived algorithms versus conventional
      airway assessment tests.
