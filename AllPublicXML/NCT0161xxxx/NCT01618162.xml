    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of
      this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide in
      insulin naïve subjects inadequately controlled with SU (sulphonylurea) alone or in
      combination with metformin. All subjects will continue their pre-trial SU treatment with or
      without metformin treatment without changing the frequency or dose throughout the trial.

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent (Confirmed) Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>After 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An event was treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurs after the first administration of trial product and no later than 7 days after last trial product administration.
Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as hypoglycaemic episodes that were either severe or minor.
Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as:
An episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and confirmed by blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or plasma glucose &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) and which was handled by the subject himself/herself.
Any asymptomatic PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL).
Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.
Reported values are hypoglycemia event rate per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. Reported values are hypoglycemia event rate per 100 PYE.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  HbA1c 7.0-9.0% (53-75 mmol/mol) (both inclusive)

          -  Subjects on stable daily dose of sulphonylurea (above or equal to half of the max
             approved dose according to local label) with or without metformin (above or equal to
             1500 mg or max tolerated dose) for at least 90 days prior to screening visit (Visit 1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any use of oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) (other than SU in monotherapy or in
             combinationwith metformin) below or equal to 90 days prior to screening visit (Visit
             1)

          -  Use of any drug (other than SU in monotherapy or in combination with metformin), which
             in the Investigators opinion could interfere with the blood glucose level (e.g.
             systemic corticosteroids)

          -  Previous treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (e.g.
             exenatide, liraglutide)

          -  Treatment with any insulin regimen (short term treatment due to intercurrent illness
             including gestational diabetes is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator)

          -  Screening calcitonin above or equal to 50 ng/l

             Association (NYHA) class III-IV), diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris, cerebral
             stroke and/or myocardial infarction within the past 52 weeks prior to screening visit
             (Visit 1) and/or planned coronary,carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation

          -  Subjects with a clinical significant, active (during the past 12 months) disease of
             the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrinological (except for the Type 2 Diabetes
             Mellitus),neurological, genitourinary or haematological system that in the opinion of

          <description>In this arm, subjects suboptimally controlled on sulfonyl urea (SU) +/- metformin, were given subcutenaous (s.c.) injection of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira). SU and metformin were maintained at the stable pre-trial dose throughout the duration of the trial. IDegLira was injected in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen once daily preferably at the same time every day. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, but rotation within the area was recommended. Treatment with IDegLira was initiated at 10 dose steps containing 10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide. Adjustment of the IDegLira dose was performed twice weekly based on the mean of 3 preceding daily fasting SMPG values on 3 consecutive days (fasting glycaemic target of 4.0−6.0 mmol/L).</description>

        <description>An event was treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurs after the first administration of trial product and no later than 7 days after last trial product administration.
Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as hypoglycaemic episodes that were either severe or minor.
Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as:
An episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and confirmed by blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or plasma glucose &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) and which was handled by the subject himself/herself.
Any asymptomatic PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or blood glucose value &lt;2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL).
Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.
Reported values are hypoglycemia event rate per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE).</description>
