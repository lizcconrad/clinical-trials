      Hd-EEG and MRI measures are used to study the maturation of functional networks in order to
      identify the neural circuits underlying executive and memory processes in children born
      preterm. It will be determined whether children born preterm with executive function deficits
      will have an abnormal connectivity between basal ganglia and cortex due to WM injury.
      Moreover, the development of hd-EEG activity during sleep (coherence and travelling waves)
      and brain maturation of children and adolescents born preterm will be compared with the
      respective measures in healthy controls. This is of eminent importance as it helps to
      understand the nature of executive function and hence, it may help to develop neuroprotective
      strategies to prevent executive function deficits in these infants.
