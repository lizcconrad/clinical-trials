  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A potential complicating factor affecting implants is crestal bone loss. The causes of
      crestal bone loss are attributed to several factors. Among those hypothesized, proof for one
      or another cause remains obscure. Clinical documentation suggests that implant design may be
      a key factor. While the evidence is inconclusive, various authors suggest that it is a result
      of a combination of effects including (1) limited drilling procedure and restricted
      second-stage surgery 2, (2) rough implant surface in crestal bone 3, (3) microthread design
      for implant stiffness 4, (4) loading along a conus versus a flat interface 5, and (5) the
      absence of a significant microgap 6.

      The practice of platform switching (e.g. placing a 4 mm diameter abutment on a 5 mm implant
      seating surface physically moves the inflammatory cell infiltrate zone away from the crestal
      bone). The growing body of anecdotal platform switch evidence supports this biological width
      hypothesis. Here the biological width refers to the height of the dento-gingival attachment
      apparatus around a normal tooth and is defined as the distance necessary for a healthy
      existence of bone and soft tissue from the most apical extent of a dental restoration.

      To formally test this hypothesis the current study has been designed. The Prevail implant has
      been made with an integrated medialized seating surface that establishes a platform switching
      function. This implant moves the implant/abutment interface away from the crestal bone and
      may therefore reduce the amount of bone loss observed in the standard (non-medialized)
      Osseotite implant design. The objective of this study is to evaluate crestal bone levels
      adjacent to the implant reference point from the time of implant placement to a period of two
      years after loading.
