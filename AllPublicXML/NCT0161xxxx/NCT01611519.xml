      Is the early removal of Foley catheter safe in patients undergoing general thoracic surgery
      with an epidural catheter in place?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesis that removing the foley catheter within 48 hours after a thoracotomy in
      patients that have an epidural catheter will result in an increase in the rate of urinary
      infections and the need for reinsertion of the foley. We have designed a randomized trial to
      test this hypothesis.

          -  foley in place

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  &lt; 18 years of age

          -  death in hospital within 30 days of the operation

          -  length of hospital stay is less than 48 hours

          -  epidural catheter is removed before the 3rd postoperative day

          -  patients who have a suprapubic catheter or no bladder

          -  patients who require a urologist or a urologic technician to insert the Foley catheter

          -  patients with a known urinary tract infection preoperatively

          -  patients required to keep Foley in since they required close monitoring of urinary
