      Peripheral vascular function is impaired in people with obstructive sleep apnoea who are
      untreated compared with age-, weight- and sex-matched healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a chronic respiratory disorder associated with endothelial
      dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and increased cardiovascular risk. The standard
      treatment paradigm is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), however, patient adherence
      to CPAP is variable. It is unclear to what extent that poor adherence to CPAP therapy
      augments vascular endothelial function and reduces cardiovascular risk compared to excellent
      adherence. The main aim of this research is to investigate vascular endothelial function in
      OSA patients who are poorly-adherent to CPAP therapy. Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated,
      endothelium-dependent macrovascular and microvascular function (by brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilatation and forearm cutaneous thermal hyperaemia, respectively) and
      generalised microvascular function (by post-occlusion reactive hyperaemia) will be assessed
      in three obese OSA patient populations (high-adherence (n=20); low adherence (n=20); and,
      untreated (n=20)) and age-/BMI-matched OSA-free controls. We will also assess body
      composition, cardiovascular risk, lipid status and functional capacity. This research will
      evaluate treatment efficacy in patients who are poorly-adherent to CPAP treatment and could
      identify whether an alternative approach to their care should be explored.

    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>Proximal arterial occlusion will be performed by inflating a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm to 200 mmHg for 5 min. After cuff deflation, the skin blood flow response will be measured using laser Doppler flowmetry.</description>

    <measure>Forearm skin blood flow response to localised heating at 42 degrees C</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>A local heating unit on the forearm will be heated from 33 to 42 degrees C at a rate of 1 degree C every 10 s. Temperature will be held at 42 degrees C for 35 min. The increase in skin blood flow will be measured using a laser Doppler flowmetry probe placed in the centre of the local heating unit.</description>
