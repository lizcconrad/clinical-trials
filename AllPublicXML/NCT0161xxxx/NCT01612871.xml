      This is a biomedical and prospective study of interventional type. The trial will include 29
      patients over a period of 15 months + 24 months of follow up maximum.

      The study will be conduct in womens with metastatic invasive breast cancer or locally
      advanced breast cancer and for which treatment with tamoxifen or anti aromatase (first line
      hormone therapy for metastatic breast cancer) is indicated.

      The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility to detect in the
      circulating blood of patients, before treatment (T0), the presence of the fifteen tissular
      microRNAs described in preclinical studies as possibly involved in hormone
      resistance/sensitivity.

      In parallel of the detection of these specific miRNAs, we will conduct a larger scale
      analysis of circulating miRNAs in these patients before (T = 0) and after one month of
      treatment (T28).

          2. Women with metastatic invasive breast cancer or locally advanced (without surgical
             project), for which treatment with tamoxifen or anti aromatase

             +/- LH-RH agonist, is indicated (anti-aromatase prescribed for menopausal womens;
             tamoxifen prescribed for both menopausal, pre menopausal or not menopausal womens).

          3. Cancer hormone-expressing estrogen receptor (ER) and / or progesterone receptor (PR)
             (&gt;= 10% of tumor cells by IHC technique).

             Cancer HER2 negative.

          4. Evaluable disease (measurable according RECIST criteria or not)

          5. Any previous adjuvant hormone therapy should be discontinued for at least 21 days.

          6. One or two prior metastatic lines of chemotherapy are allowed

          7. General status WHO 0-2
