  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances and even when receiving optimal therapy, patients with chronic heart
      failure (CHF) suffer poor quality of life, with recurrent hospitalisations and persistent
      symptoms. The investigators have shown that patients attending the Leeds Integrated Heart
      Failure Service are also frequently deficient in vitamin D and that the severity of the
      deficiency relates to the levels of symptoms, exercise capacity, diuretic requirements and
      response to optimal medical therapy. Vitamin D contributes to cardiac and skeletal muscle
      contractile function, immune function, pancreatic insulin release, and neuro-hormonal
      homeostasis. A randomised, placebo-controlled proof of concept study in 60 CHF patients has
      demonstrated improvements in submaximal exercise capacity and symptoms. VINDICATE will be a
      randomised, placebo-controlled developmental clinical study in 250 patients with CHF and
      vitamin D deficiency. The present study is designed to detect whether vitamin D has
      pathophysiologically important effects, as well as providing preliminary evidence of efficacy
      and safety by examining cardiac function (using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) and
      submaximal exercise capacity (by 6-minute walk test). This will provide pertinent data to
      inform a larger multi-centre efficacy and effectiveness study.
