  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergies are a major trigger of asthma. Therapies are being developed to control the
      allergic response to cats. We are interested in measuring a type of white blood cell which is
      linked to cat allergies, which will help us understand how to use new therapies in people who
      suffer from cat allergies and asthma. We will study cat-allergic individuals with stable,
      mild asthma who will be exposed to cat allergens. We will measure various white blood cells,
      including the cells that are linked to cat allergies, to determine whether the number of
      these cells changes following cat exposure. These cells will be measured from the blood and
      bone marrow by removing samples using a needle. These cells will also be measured from the
      lungs by inserting a bronchoscope into the airways and drawing up fluid containing cells.
      This study will improve our understanding of the harmful versus protective role of these
      cat-specific cells, and will allow for development of better drugs for treatment of asthma
      triggered by cat exposure.

    <description>The primary outcome for Aim 1 of the study is to compare the number of tetramer+ T cells in the airways of early and dual-responder subjects after segmental allergen challenge. The primary outcome for Aim 2 of the study is to compare the number of tetramer+ T cells in the bone marrow of early and dual-responder subjects after segmental allergen challenge. This will be measured using a panel of antibodies and flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers.</description>

        score of at least 1 or equivalent international units/mL.

        (5) Subjects must express one (or more) of the following Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA):
        HLA-DRB1*0101, HLA-DRB1*0301, HLA-DRB1*0401, HLA-DRB1*0405, HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DRB1*0901,
        HLA-DRB1*1001, HLA-DRB1*1101, HLA-DRB1*1301, HLA-DRB1*1401, HLA-DRB5*0101.

        (6) Methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in the FEV1 (PC20) &gt; 0.125
        mg/ml and &lt;16 mg/mL.

        (7) Development of early asthmatic response (≥20% fall in FEV1) with or without a late
        phase asthmatic response during a screening whole lung allergen challenge.

        (8)Willing and able to provide written informed consent. (9) The subject must be willing
        and able to comply with the study requirements. (10) If the subject is female and of
        childbearing potential she must practice an acceptable form of contraception, and produce a
        negative urine pregnancy test on the Screening Visit and at Days -27 and 1. A female
        subject may be included without a negative urine pregnancy test if she can document that
        she is surgically sterile or at least 2 years post-menopausal.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        and an FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt; 70. (3) Receipt of any allergen immunotherapy within the last 10
        years.
