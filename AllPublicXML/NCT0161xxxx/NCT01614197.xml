  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of temsirolimus (Torisel) combined with dexamethasone,
      cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
      lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) inhibit growth of pre-B and T-cell ALL cell
      lines in vitro and in ALL xenograft models. The MTI temsirolimus was chosen for use in this
      study due to its weekly intravenous dosing, its more predictable blood levels, and
      availability of a single-agent pediatric MTD and its sustained biologic effect due to
      conversion to sirolimus. This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus
      that can given in combination with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in relapsed
      ALL, LL or PTL. A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design will be used. Response to
      treatment will be evaluated. Biology tests will be done to evaluate minimal residual disease
      (MRD), temsirolimus' effect on glucocorticoid resistance, and mTOR inhibition.

             concurrent signs or symptoms of active infection or hemodynamic instability.

          -  A positive fungal culture within 30 days.

          -  Active fungal, viral, bacterial, or protozoal infection requiring IV treatment.
             Chronic prophylaxis therapy to prevent infections is allowed.

        Patients with Down syndrome and Fanconi Anemia are excluded.

        Patients will be excluded if they have significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric
        disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance with protocol
        treatment or required observations, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up,
        or interpretation of study results.

        Patients with known optic nerve and/or retinal involvement (because it may not be possible
        to safely delay irradiation) are not eligible. Patients presenting with visual disturbances
        by history or physical exam should have an ophthalmological exam and, if indicated, an MRI
        to determine optic nerve or retinal involvement.
