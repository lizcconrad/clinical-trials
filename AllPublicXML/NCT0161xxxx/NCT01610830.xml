    <textblock>
      Henoch Schonlein Purpura (HSP), vasculitis of small vessels with deposits of IgA, is
      considered by many authors as the systemic form of Berger's disease (IgA-N). IgA-N is
      characterized by IgA1 deposits in mesangial areas associated with mesangial proliferation.
      These two diseases remain the leading cause of ESRD by primitive glomerulopathy in Western
      countries. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of IgA-N. However, only a high rate of proteinuria at one year
      or the presence of severe glomerular inflammation on renal biopsy remain predictors of long
      term renal function. Moreover, the high variability of HSP clinical expression, from few
      purpura skin lesions that evolve favourably spontaneously, to rapidly progressive renal
      failure, remains so far unexplained but suggests the existence of individual genetic
      susceptibility.

      In the first part of the study, we will study key factors based on physiopathological data
      obtained by our laboratory as well as by other groups. The second part of the study concerns
      genetic factors. Although the candidate genes that may confer a particular susceptibility to
      the disease, to progress to ESRD or respond to treatment are many, the genes involved in
      inflammation or controlling renin-angiotensin system are of particular interest.

      We will apply these results by studying patients with HSP showing three distinct phenotypes
      (HSP with isolated cutaneous purpura or associated with minimal or severe renal disease) at
      diagnosis and after clinical remission.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the phenotype at diagnosis is associated with
      the physiological markers and if one of them predicts a pejorative evolution of renal disease
      at 1 year. Meanwhile, study of polymorphism of selected genes of interest could allow
      identification of patients with specific genetic susceptibility or with bad prognosis factors
      who would be thus eligible for specific treatment.
