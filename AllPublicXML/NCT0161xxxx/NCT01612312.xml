  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whereas thrombus aspiration in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is
      recommended by current guidelines, there are insufficient data to unequivocally support
      thrombectomy in patients with non-STEMI (NSTEMI). The Thrombus Aspiration in ThrOmbus
      containing culpRiT lesions in Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (TATORT-NSTEMI) trial is
      a 400 patient, prospective, controlled, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial. The
      hypothesis is that under the background of early revascularization, adjunctive thrombectomy
      in comparison to conventional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) alone leads to less
      microvascular obstruction (MO) assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in
      patients with NSTEMI. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two
      treatment arms. The primary endpoint is the extent of MO assessed by CMR. Secondary endpoints
      include infarct size and myocardial salvage assessed by CMR, enzymatic infarct size as well
      as angiographic parameters, such as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-flow post-PCI and
      myocardial blush grade. Furthermore, clinical endpoints including death, myocardial
      reinfarction, target vessel revascularization and new congestive heart failure will be
      recorded at 6 and 12 months. Safety will be assessed by bleeding and stroke. In summary, the
      TATORT-NSTEMI trial has been designed to test the hypothesis that thrombectomy will improve
      myocardial perfusion in patients with NSTEMI and relevant thrombus burden in the culprit
      vessel reperfused by early PCI.
