      The purpose of this study is to better understand the different ways our bodies burn fat
      which may be important for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will examine the hypothesis that overweight/obese individuals
      that are unable to meet target weight loss goals on a low calorie diet (LCD) are
      intrinsically less metabolically flexible than their weight-losing counterparts. The
      investigators expect that this 'inflexibility' will be characterized by impaired fat
      oxidation (as determined by indirect calorimetry) in response to caloric restriction. If this
      were the case, these subjects may represent a population of 'super-responders' likely to
      demonstrate a robust response to approaches to increase fat oxidation. The investigators will
      also measure lipid concentrations in skeletal muscle and liver by hydrogen 1 magnetic
      resonance (1H-MRS) to determine both the stability of these measurements as well as the
      magnitude of changes that can be seen during LCD.

Expected Results
Overweight and obese subjects will show a wide variation in fat oxidation in response to the low calorie diet
Approximately one-third of study participants will not meet target weight loss by four weeks
Following an overnight fast (prior to and during LCD) individuals that fail to meet the target weight loss will be characterized by decreased whole body fat oxidation and increased carbohydrate oxidation (measured by indirect calorimetry)</description>

Expected results
1H-MRS can measure hepatic lipid and skeletal muscle (intramyocellular lipid) IMCL content with low test-retest variability
1H-MRS can sensitively monitor reductions (or lack thereof) in skeletal muscle IMCL and liver intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) concentration during caloric restriction

Protection Against Risk:
Prior to administering any phentermine, a history and physical including EKG will be conducted (at the screening visit) and will be used to determine whether the participant is clear to receive the medication.
Participants will see the study doctor or nurse practitioner at every study visit after the drug is initiated.</description>
