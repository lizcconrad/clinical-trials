    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to ascertain whether the bacteriophage 0X174 neoantigen is safe and
      effective as an antigen used in the evaluation of primary and secondary immune responses.
      Bacteriophage 0X174 is given intravenously 2 billion PFU/Kg of body weight; small blood
      specimens of 3-5 ml (about 1 teaspoon) are collected after 15 minutes, 7 days, 14 days, and
      28 days. Blood is collected at intervals following the administration of the bacteriophage
      and the number of phage/ml is determined by the agar overlay method using suspension of E.
      coli C and serially diluted patient's serum. Phage-specific IgG and IgM are measured by
      neutralization assay. Capacity of switch from IgM to IgG is determined.

    <description>Give first dose of bacteriophage (2 x 109 PFU/kg body weight (0.02 ml/kg)) at visit one. Obtain labs prior to vaccine, 15 minutes, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after vaccine. 6 weeks after 1st vaccine, obtain blood, give 2nd dose of bacteriophage, obtain labs 15 minutes, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after vaccine. Selected patients may receive a tertiary vaccine.</description>
