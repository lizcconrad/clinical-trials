  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a very rare disease, with a severe impact on the life of the
      patient and the caregiver. Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) comprises a group of genetically
      determined skin fragility disorders characterized by blistering of the skin and mucosae
      following mild mechanical trauma. There is no specific proven treatment for any form of EB,
      and the mainstay of clinical management is based on protection and avoidance of provoking
      factors. Chronic nonhealing erosions and ulcers have been treated with conventional
      split-thickness skin grafts. Alternatively some patients may benefit from the use of
      autologous or allogeneic cultured keratinocyte grafts.

      Apligraf is a living bilayered cell therapy product. Apligraf is constructed of Type I bovine
      collagen. The mechanism of action of Apligraf is still unknown. No clinical evidence of
      rejection of Apligraf was observed when placed on acute or chronic wounds. Apligraf has been
      suggested to act as a &quot;smart&quot; material for wound healing by interacting with the surrounding
      environment to promote healing. It provides components with multiple actions, interacts with
      wounds in biological and physical ways, and appears to adapt to the wound environment and
      probably produces numerous pro-healing cytokines. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the use of Apligraf for the treatment of nonhealing wounds in subjects with epidermolysis
      bullosa. Apligraf will be evaluated for efficacy and safety compared to a conventional
      nonadherent dressing. The study is a pivotal, single center, within subject controlled
      observational trial in which the rate of wound healing, recurrence of EB lesions, subject
      report of pain will be compared to wounds treated with Control treatment. Subjects between 2
      and 65 years of age, inclusive, with epidermolysis bullosa lesions will be screened for this
      study. For each subject at least two designated treatment sites will be selected. In case of
      two comparable treatment sites the most right side will receive Apligraf and the most left
      side will receive control. Efficacy will be assessed by clinical observations, wound tracings
      and photographs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is between 2 and 65 years of age.

          2. Subject with clinical confirmed diagnosis of EB.

          3. Subject has at least two lesions, if in a situation with two non-adjacent EB lesions,
             at least 4 cm apart.

          4. Subject with EB lesions at least 2 cm2 present for at least 3weeks. For the purposes
             of this study, a lesion is defined as a wound resulting from a post blister erosion.

          5. Subject who is a female of child-bearing potential (females &gt;10 years of age) must
             have a documented negative urine or serum pregnancy test. Sexually active females must

             period.
