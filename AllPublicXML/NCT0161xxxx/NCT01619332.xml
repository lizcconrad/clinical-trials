    <description>An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. Adverse events will also be determined on the basis of clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiographic evaluations and vital signs determinations.</description>
