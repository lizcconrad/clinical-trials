      To determine the effects of 12 months of treatment with Androxal on bone mineral density in
      men with secondary hypogonadism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III single-blind placebo-controlled safety study with a 52 week active
      dosing period with Androxal. Safety will be assessed by physical and visual acuity exams,
      slit lamp and fundoscopy eye exams, clinical laboratory tests, DEXA scanning, lean soft
      tissue assessment (LST), and adverse event reporting. Results will be compared to an
      age-matched placebo group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Overweight (BMI 25 to 42 kg/m2 inclusive, or BMI 23 to 42 inclusive in Asian subjects)
             males age 18 to 60 inclusive

          2. Men currently using topical testosterone products should wash-out for at least 7 days
             before Visit 1

          3. All clinical laboratory tests within normal ranges (any clinically significant
             deviation of laboratory results will require approval of sponsor)

          4. Previously or concurrently diagnosed as having secondary hypogonadism and confirmed
             with morning testosterone &lt;300ng/dL measured twice on separate days. One of the two TT
             levels must be confirmed at baseline. Subjects who fail this criterion will be
             enrolled in the placebo group.

          5. LH &lt;9.4 mIU/mL (at Visit 1 only)

          6. Ability to complete the study in compliance with the protocol

          7. Ability to understand and provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of an injectable or pelleted testosterone within 6 months prior to study (men
             currently on topical products may be enrolled in the study after a 7-day washout
             period)

          2. Use of testosterone injection, spironolactone, cimetidine, Clomid, 5Î±-reductase
             inhibitors, hCG, androgen, estrogen, anabolic steroid, DHEA, or herbal hormone
             products during the study

          3. Use of Clomid in the past year

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus based on the Investigator's assessment
             at baseline. Subjects treated for Type II diabetes will be allowed into the study.
             Newly diagnosed diabetics need to be treated for at least 48 hours before being
             enrolled in the study

          5. Clinically significant abnormal findings at screening (Visit 1), based on the
             Investigator's assessment.

          6. A hematocrit &gt;54% or a hemoglobin &gt;17 g/dL

          7. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings at baseline (Visit 2), based on

             participant's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions,

             took part in the study

         13. Irreversibly infertile or compromised fertility (cryptorchism, Kallman Syndrome,
             primary hypogonadism, or tumors of the pituitary)

         14. Current or history of breast cancer

         15. Subjects with a Z-score of &lt;2

         16. Hyperparathyroidism, metabolic bone disease, previous fracture of the spine, recent

             immunosuppressive therapy, prednisone or antiepileptic drugs

         17. No intravenous or oral contrast agents within 7 days.

         18. Subject weighs &gt;300 pounds (&gt;136 kg)
