  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of nursing undergraduates in
      dressing of tunneled central venous access in the simulator, according to the aid of a
      preceptorship or an auto-instructional guide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The simulation facilitates the acquisition of knowledge, skills and decision-making required
      for clinical practice. Mentoring has been employed and valued as pedagogical process
      qualifier.

      The hypothesis of this study was that students who trained with the assistance of a
      preceptorship had better practical performance when compared to students who used an
      auto-instructional guide.

    <description>The practical performance in carrying out dressing procedure of each student was analyzed according to a list of 28 steps of procedure, including the preparation of environment and material, antisepsis, curative application and recording (score: 0 to 35). The list of items used to analyze the steps of the catheter dressing procedure were face and content validated by five experts working in the oncology field.</description>
