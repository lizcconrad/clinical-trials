  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the benefits of exercise and physical activity people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      are relatively inactive. Physical activity is important for persons with disabilities to
      maintain physical function. A lack of physical activity can contribute to heart disease,
      osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes. At the moment, the best way for people with MS to
      exercise and be physical activity is unknown. People with MS report not knowing what to do.
      This is a barrier to exercise.

      The global aim of this study is to contribute evidence for the role of targeted exercise in
      altering MS outcomes over time. The design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      primary research question is to what extent does an MS Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP)
      result in greater improvements in exercise capacity and related outcomes in comparison to a
      program based on general guidelines for exercise among people with MS who are sedentary and
      wish to engage in exercise as part of MS self-management. The primary outcome for this
      question is exercise capacity measured using cycle ergometry. However exercise efficiency,
      functional ambulation, strength, components of quality of life including frequency and
      intensity of fatigue symptoms, mood, global physical function, health perception, and illness
      intrusiveness, will also be measured as components of a global response outcome. The first
      confirmatory hypothesis is that MSTEP will result in a greater proportion of people making
      clinically relevant gains (at least 10% change) in exercise capacity than with general
      guidelines after 12 months of intervention; a secondary hypothesis is that, while there may
      be some decline in exercise capacity among individuals from end of intervention to follow-up
      one year later, the decline will be greater in the general guideline group augmenting the
      difference between groups in the proportion making 10% change from study entry to 24 months.
      In other words, gains will be maintained more for the MSTEP group over the general guideline
      group.

      An exploratory hypothesis is that more of the targeted outcomes will improve with the MSTEP
      program than the general guideline approach. An explanatory hypothesis is that these gains
      will be accompanied by reports of greater exercise enjoyment and exercise self-efficacy
      (confidence) with the MSTEP program than with the general guideline program leading to more
      consistent exercise engagement and improved long-term adherence.

      The proposal is for an assessor-blind, parallel-group, stratified, randomized controlled
      trial. Potential participants will be identified from the population of persons enrolled in 3
      MS clinics in the Montreal area and in 3 clinics in Toronto. All persons who are known to be
      ambulatory and not to have co-morbidity preventing exercise engagement or capacity to consent
      will be informed of the study in writing and will be invited for an assessment to determine
      eligibility for entry into the trial. Those consenting will be randomly assigned to either
      the MSTEP program or the general exercise guideline program. The intervention period will be
      one year with follow-up to a second year.

      The investigators are targeting a sample size of 120 per group (total 240), which would be
      sufficient to detect RR of &gt; 1.5 with 80% power. Sample size estimated using pc-size
      software. The sample size takes into account that drop-outs will inflate the variance of
      outcomes as multiple imputation will be used to deal with missing data.

      The main analysis will be logistic regression to test the main hypothesis related to the
      superiority of the MSTEP program based on a greater proportion of people making a clinically
      relevant gain in exercise capacity at 1 year. A secondary outcome will be the differences in
      proportions at 2 years also using logistic regression. The analysis will be based on
      intention-to-treat and all persons will be analysed in the groups to which they were
      randomized.

      A secondary analysis will estimate the impact of exercise on the other relevant outcomes. For
      this approach, each outcome will be converted to a binary response variable based on
      published clinically meaningful changes and generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be
      used to test the rate of response in the MSTEP program to the rate of response in the general
      guideline approach. Multiple outcomes improves the efficiency of the study as the total
      number of data points is equivalent to the total n multiplied by the number of tests and
      reduced by the extent to which the outcomes are correlated. Highly correlated outcomes will
      make the effective sample size smaller than less strongly correlated outcomes. If there is a
      statistically significant effect of the intervention, then and only then, can the effects of
      the separate outcomes be interpreted as real.

      The results of the trial will be used to develop guidelines for exercise for MS. The
      investigators are in the process of copyrighting the name of the program (MSTEP). Upon
      publication of the findings, the description of content will be made available at no cost. If
      proven effective, a training guide for professionals and patients will be produced most
      likely taking advantage of the end-of-grant Knowledge Translation (KT) Supplement. Note: The
      investigators have been funded by the KT supplement to produce a general guide for people
      with MS, entitled: Getting on with Your Life with MS. The knowledge generated can be used by
      people with MS and health professional to promote exercise engagement.

    <description>mCAFT is a graded step test and can predict VO2peak using a regression equation recently published. Thus, we are confident that we will get usable data for each person and as we are looking for a proportion of people who change over time, persons who do not achieve a peak and have low values on the mCAFT will have a very low value for exercise capacity.

    <description>Participant will meet with instructor twice to learn how to exercise safely. Exercises will be demonstrated and practiced under the direct supervision of the instructor. Written details and pictures will be made. Variety in exercise will be encouraged to promote long-term adherence. Stretching, strengthening and relaxation exercises will be given. Persons will be given Thera Band® to facilitate resistance exercise training and instructed how to progress. Equipment such as Nordic Walking Poles, stationary bicycle, BOSU®, or exercise balls will be available. Rather than having a fixed rigid prescription, the aim is to get people to intuitively adjust the amount of resistance so they feel they are working without causing harm, they are not doing the same boring activity, week in week out.</description>

    <description>Individuals in the control condition will meet with the exercise instructor on two occasions during the first two weeks to review key components of public health guidelines for physical activity and health. In brief, the general guidelines for MS are (i) aerobic and endurance exercise for 30 minutes per session, 3 times per week at an intensity of 60% to 75% of heart rate peak; (ii) weight training for weak muscles, 2 days per week, on non-endurance days, 8 to 15 repetitions per exercise; and (iii) stretching daily with active or passive range of motion exercises, or attendance at Yoga or Tai Chi classes.</description>
