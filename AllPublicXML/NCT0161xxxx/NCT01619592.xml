      Inclusion criteria: adult diabetes patients on multiple daily insulin injections or using an
      insulin pump; Internet users Exclusion criteria: having a severe mental illness Patients will
      be recruited during the conventional consult. If they want to participate, they will get
      detailed information regarding the study; after giving consent; they will sign the informed
      consent form and they will get a unique study number.

      The patient will than complete a questionnaire on a secured website (https://) using the
      unique study number. After completing this questionnaire, the patient will be randomised
      either into a group 'standard care + direct start with web-based diabetes education'
      (intervention group) or they will enter into the other group (control) receiving standard
      care. Three months after the start of the study, all patients will be asked to complete the
      questionnaire again and the patients into the control group will also get access to 'standard
      care + web-based diabetes education'. The questionnaire will have to be completed on months
      6, year 1 and year 2. At the time of completing the questionnaire, HbA1c will be determined.
      This is part of the routine examination in each participating hospital (UZGent and AZ
      Nikolaas). The determination of HbA1c is not study-specific but the value will be taken into
      the study.

      The web-based questionnaire:

      Patients will enter on a website including general study-information. They also have to
      explicitly click a button to proceed to the questionnaire. After clicking on 'I am prepared
      to participate in the study' they will see a second webpage retrieving some general
      information. After receiving this real basic information; they will be redirected to a secure
      website (https://) and will make use of a unique study number. Only the main researcher will
      have the possibility to link the general information to the unique study number.

      The informed consent form:

      The patient will be asked for added information. He/she will have to sign specific pages
      giving explicitly informed consent for information retrieved from the 'mutualiteit' (National
      Health Service - NHS).

      On the NHS information will be asked regarding the health costs. These figures should make it
      possible to have a more objective figure of the costs associated to diabetes (care).

      The patient can stop on every moment the study participation. Once decided he/she wants to
      stop, he/she will receive standard care.

      Study hypotheses: the QoL will improve by the use of web-based diabetes education; there will
      be a reduction in costs using web-based diabetes education; there will be at least an
      equal-stay or improvement of the HbA1c while using web-based diabetes education.
