    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare BIAsp 30 twice daily
      individually adjusted by the subject versus BIAsp 30 twice daily individually adjusted by the
      investigator both combined with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in subjects with type 2
      diabetes inadequately controlled with premixed human insulin. Subjects to continue their OAD
      background treatment: Metformin plus/minus alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.

    <description>Definition of a treatment emergent hypoglycemic episode: an episode occurred after the first administration of insulin or oral anti-diabetic drug, and no later than the last day on trial product. Severe hypoglycemic episode was that requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resusciative actions. Minor hypoglycemic episode was the one with plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L, either with symptoms that could be handled by subject, or without symptoms.</description>

          <description>Subjects were transferred on a 1:1 basis from pre-trial premixed/self-mixed human insulin to biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30). Individually adjusted BIAsp 30 was given immediately before breakfast and dinner during 20 weeks. Subjects were trained on how to adjust BIAsp 30 doses during the training period [4 weeks] and then were asked to adjust their BIAsp 30 doses by themselves during the maintenance period [16 weeks]. Subjects continued their pre-trial oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) (metformin and/or alpha-glucosidase inhibitor). OADs were kept unchanged in regimen and daily dose during this trial, and were administered orally according to local labels.</description>
