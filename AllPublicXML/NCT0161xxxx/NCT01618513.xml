  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of acromegaly with somatostatin analogs (SA) is well-established and are primarily
      used after insufficient surgical intervention, but also as primary medical treatment in
      selected patients. Evaluation of treatment control is based on monitoring blood levels of
      growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). However, evaluation of disease
      control during SA treatment is not always straightforward. It is usually based on
      normalization of IGF-I and achievement of a certain GH level. In approximately 40% of
      patients discordant values of GH and IGF-I levels are seen after treatment with SA, with
      normalized IGF-I levels, despite elevated GH levels. The mechanism behind this observation is
      unknown, but it indicates that SA may affect this difference.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate if disease control during SA treatment
      is best achieved by monitoring either GH or IGF-I.
