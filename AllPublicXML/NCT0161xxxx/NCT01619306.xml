      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

      • The investigators aim to conduct a questionnaire survey in a South-East Asian tertiary
      institution, to assess whether breast cancer patients and their physicians would consider the
      use of three different kinds of genetic tests currently available to breast cancer patients:

        -  BRCA1/2 germline testing,

        -  CYP2D6 genotyping and

        -  Oncotype DX® testing.

      Secondary objectives:

      To explore factors which might influence their decisions on genetic testing, including:

        1. Acceptability of the tests and anti-cancer management based on the test results

        2. Reliability and affordability of the test

        3. Ability of the test to influence treatment decisions

        4. Broader implications of the test, e.g., psychosocial, financial impact Study design:
           Cross-sectional study, Survey Questionnaires were developed for 3 categories of
           individuals:

             -  Patients with early stage breast cancer

             -  Healthcare professionals caring for breast cancer patients

             -  Medical students /cancer researchers The questionnaires for patients and medical
                students/cancer researchers are similar. The questionnaires contain a brief section
                on demographic information, interest in and past experience with genetic testing.
                Three hypothetical situations are described to determine if participants will agree
                to BRCA1/2 testing, CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing, respectively. 18
                categorical 'yes'/ 'no' questions explore reasons for their decisions. Each
                scenario requires a short, hand-written response.

      The questionnaire for healthcare professionals contains a brief section on demographics and
      past experience with genetic testing. Three hypothetical situations are described to
      determine if healthcare professionals will recommend their patients for BRCA1/2 testing,
      CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing, respectively. 12 categorical questions explore
      the reasons for their decision, and physicians are required to rank these in order of
      importance.

      Distribution of questionnaires:

      Questionnaires will be handed out to agreeable participants on the following occasions:

        1. Patients- National University Health System Cancer Centre Level 3 amp; 4 waiting areas

        2. Medical students - before or after lectures, or at personal contact

        3. Cancer researchers - before or after lectures, or at personal contact

        4. Healthcare professionals - before or after NUHS breast tumour board, or at personal
           contact Due caution will be exercised to ensure that the questionnaire is only handed
           out to subjects who are aged 21 years and above.

      No subject identity will be collected for these questionnaires.

      Rationale and Hypothesis:

      BRCA1/2 germline testing, CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing have all been approved
      for use in clinical practice, but controversy still exists surrounding their utility, and
      apart from BRCA1/2 mutation testing in high-risk individuals, genetic tests are not routinely
      performed in Singapore. BRCA1/2 germline mutation testing is performed in individuals at high
      risk for hereditary cancer. CYP2D6 genotype testing predicts the benefit of adjuvant
      tamoxifen therapy; poor and intermediate metabolisers of tamoxifen may have a higher risk of
      breast cancer recurrence due to lower efficacy of tamoxifen because of less efficient
      conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen. Oncotype DX®
      testing is a gene-expression profiling test performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
      tumour specimen, to predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence and guide decisions on
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Understanding the attitudes of patients and medical professionals
      toward these genetic tests may help to guide medical oncologists in their clinical
      recommendations and utilization of these tests in breast cancer patients.
