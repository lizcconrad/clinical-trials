      HIV-infected pregnant women who begin taking antiretroviral (ARV) medications in the late
      stages of pregnancy need an effective medication regimen to reduce the risk of transmitting
      HIV to their children. This study will examine the virologic response, safety, and
      tolerability of two different ARV medication regimens in HIV-infected pregnant women who are
      between 20 and 36 weeks pregnant when they enter the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there are many ARV medications and combination regimens available to treat HIV-infected
      people, the number of ARV medications studied in HIV-infected pregnant women for the
      prevention of mother-to-child transmission remains limited. HIV-infected pregnant women who
      begin taking ARV medications late in their pregnancies require effective therapy to reduce
      the risk of transmitting HIV to their children. Currently, there is no data available that
      compares the effects of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and integrase
      inhibitors (which are two classes of ARV medications) in pregnant women. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the safety, tolerance, and virologic and pharmacologic responses to two
      different medication regimens, each including an NNRTI or integrase inhibitor, in pregnant
      HIV-infected women who begin ARV therapy late in their pregnancies (i.e., a gestational age
      between 20 and 36 weeks).

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Participants in Arm
      A will receive lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice a day and efavirenz 600 mg each
      night. Participants in Arm B will receive lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg twice a day and
      raltegravir 400 mg twice a day. All participants will receive their assigned medications from
      study entry through delivery. Participants will attend study visits at entry and Weeks 1, 2,
      and 4; and thereafter, every two weeks until labor and delivery. Study visits will include a
      medical history review, physical examination, questionnaires, blood collection, and a vaginal
      swab procedure.

      While participants are in labor, they will continue to receive their study medications. Some
      participants may receive additional or alternate medications according to local standard of
      care/guidelines. Participants will have a physical examination and blood collection. After
      delivery, some women will continue to receive ARV medications according to the local
      guidelines. Participants will attend study visits following the delivery at Weeks 2 to 4, 6,
      16, and 24, which will include a medical history review, physical examination, and blood
      collection. One study visit will include a vaginal swab procedure. Some participants may have
      vaginal specimens stored for future research.

      Participants' babies will receive ARV medications as prescribed by the babies' doctors. Study
      visits for babies will occur at birth; Weeks 2 to 4, 6, 16, and 24. Each study visit will
      include a medical history review, physical examination, and blood collection. Select visits
      will include oral and nasopharyngeal swab collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART) or have received ART with short course
             zidovudine (maximum of 8 weeks) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in
             previous pregnancies

          -  Willing and able to sign informed consent. Participant must be of an age to provide
             legal informed consent as defined by the country in which the participant resides. If
             not, the informed consent must be signed by a legal guardian/parent, as per country
             guidelines.

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 infection defined as positive results from two samples
             collected at different time points. The same method may be used at both time points.
             All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. Documentation may be
             abstracted from medical records to satisfy these criteria for infection. More

          -  Viable pregnancy with gestational age of greater than or equal to 20 weeks to less
             than or equal to 36 weeks based upon menstrual history and/or ultrasound. Note: If
             menstrual history is unknown or if there is a discrepancy between menstrual history
             and ultrasound, determination of gestational age should be based upon best available
             methodology at each site.

          -  Intends to continue pregnancy

          -  Agrees to use two reliable methods of contraception after delivery if randomized to
             the efavirenz arm and is sexually active. A barrier method of contraception (condoms,
             diaphragm, or cervical cap) together with another reliable form of contraception must
             be used for 4 weeks after stopping efavirenz.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active labor defined as onset of regular contractions or cervical dilatation greater
             than 2 cm

          -  HIV genotypic resistance, as defined in the protocol, to efavirenz or raltegravir or
             to NRTIs that will be included in the ART regimen. Note: A lack of HIV drug resistance
             test results at the time of enrollment is not exclusionary.

          -  Serious active opportunistic infection and/or serious bacterial infection including
             active tuberculosis (TB) or unstable or severe medical condition within 14 days of

             that prevents adequate swallowing and absorption of study medication

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity to any study drugs or their formulations or sulfonamide
             allergy

                  or equal to Grade 2

               4. Serum creatinine greater than or equal to Grade 1

               5. Platelet count greater than or equal to Grade 3

          -  Evidence of pre-eclampsia (such as persistent diastolic blood pressure greater than 90

          -  Receipt of disallowed medications as described in the protocol
