    <textblock>
      Therapeutic alliance, and drug observance are major difficulties in the care of persons
      presenting schizophrenic symptomatology. They appear to be linked to insight, the
      consciousness that one has of his troubles. Nurse care in psychiatry aims at improving it,
      but usually without using specific evaluation tool. Insight is usually not evaluated during
      care, and its evolution is also not known, although it is highly probable that a positive
      evolution of insight for a person in hospital correlated to an adapted and optimal care by
      the medical and nursing teams. The investigators do not know examples of insight evaluation
      during a sequence of hospital care, or any evidence of insight variation in relation to
      evolution abilities of some schizophrenic patients cared in hospital.

      The investigators propose here to evaluate insight in people presenting schizophrenia or
      related troubles, at the beginning of hospitalization (I1) and 1 month later (I2), to better
      characterize insight variations, and identify the sociodemographic, clinical and therapeutic
      variables linked to it.
