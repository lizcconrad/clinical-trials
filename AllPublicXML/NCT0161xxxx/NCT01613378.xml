  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, non-interventional study will evaluate the pattern of usage in clinical
      practice, efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients
      initiated on treatment with tocilizumab according to the licensed Canadian product monograph
      recommendations will be followed for 12 months from the start of treatment.
