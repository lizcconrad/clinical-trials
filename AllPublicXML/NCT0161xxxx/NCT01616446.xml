    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether there are differences in the
      pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in remission nephrotic syndrome compared to relapsed disease
      in children.

      This is a prospective study on ten children using Cyclosporin-A (CSA) microemulsion to treat
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), with normal renal function, who achieved complete
      remission with CSA. The objective is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of CSA in
      INS during remission and relapse of the disease. The PK profile of CSA was evaluated with the
      12-hour area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-12) using seven time-point samples.
      This procedure was done on each patient during remission and relapse with the same CSA dose
      in mg/kg/day. The AUC0-12 was calculated by trapezoidal rule. All PK parameters and the
      resumed 4-hour area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-4) were correlated with AUC0-12.
      This study is very important because the cyclosporin is a nephrotoxic drug with narrow
      therapeutic window.
