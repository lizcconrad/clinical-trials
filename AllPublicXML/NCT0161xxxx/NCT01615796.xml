  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of
      antibiotics. GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram positive
      pathogens including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative
      pathogens associated with respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections including
      isolates resistant to existing classes of antimicrobials.

      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of
      antibiotics. GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram positive
      pathogens including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative
      pathogens associated with respiratory tract, skin and soft issue infections including
      isolates resistant to existing classes of antimicrobials. This study will be the first
      administration of GSK2140944 as an intravenous (IV) formulation in humans and will be
      conducted in two (2) parts. Single IV doses will be explored in Part A and repeat IV doses
      will be explored in Part B. In addition, this study will evaluate the absolute
      bioavailability of an oral capsule formulation as compared to the IV formulation in Part A.
      Both study parts will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of
      GSK2140944 in healthy adult subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than and equal to 1.5xULN (isolated

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 60 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or

             is confirmatory. Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion
             must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until the final
             follow-up visit.

             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator may place the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol (or alcohol breath test) at
             screening.

          -  A screening urinalysis positive for protein or glucose (greater than &quot;trace&quot; findings

             average weekly intake of greater than 21 units (or an average daily intake of greater
             than 3 units) for males or an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units (or an
             average daily intake greater than 2 units) for females. One unit is equivalent to 270
             mL of full strength beer, 470 mL of light beer, 30 mL of spirits and 100 mL of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary

             acetaminophen (less than and equal to 2 grams/day) up to 48 hours prior to the first
             dose of study medication. However, the Investigator and GSK study team can review
             medication on a case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise subject
             safety or interfere with the study procedures or data interpretation.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 12 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.
