  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at high risk for loss of independence because of age-related chronic health
      conditions. Of these chronic conditions, arthritis accounts for the largest proportion of the
      disability in the community. The investigators propose to target older adults who have
      self-reported arthritis or joint pain for dissemination of a disability prevention program.
      The program will be a collaborative effort of the Arthritis Foundation, the investigators
      Prevention Research Center staff and other key partners in the community. The project will
      develop information needed to provide guidance for implementation of the investigators
      intervention by other agencies and organizations. As a major thrust of the investigators CDC
      Prevention Research Center, the investigators have developed a comprehensive program focused
      on preventing disease and disability in older adults: the &quot;10 Keys to Healthy Aging&quot;. Each of
      the 10 Keys disseminates proven approaches and current recommendations for prevention in
      older adults, focusing on age 65+ but also addressing age 50-65 years. The overall objective
      is to determine if an integrated evidence based exercise intervention (AFEP) combined with
      health education on preventive practices for older adults (&quot;10 Keys&quot;) is more effective for
      improving mobility and risk factors for mobility disability and use of preventive services
      compared to exercise alone (AFEP). The investigators will also propose to evaluate the impact
      of geographic location on outcomes and overall sustainability of the program.
