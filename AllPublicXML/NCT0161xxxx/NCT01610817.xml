  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse drug events (ADEs) are responsible for 3.6% of the hospitalisations in France. 50% of
      these ADEs could be preventable. Cardiovascular drugs are frequently involved in ADEs. A
      common underlying factor of such events is inadequate communication between patients and
      medical personnel. General practitioners (GP) often initiate the treatment of hypertension,
      being generally the first prescribers of these medications. 12.6% of the patients present an
      ADE with hypertensive drug after 3 months. The InPAct procedure is a tool to facilitate
      communication in order to improve patient safety in primary care. In the context of the
      primary care prescription of an antihypertensive drug, the GP informs the patient about
      hypertension, cardiovascular risk, and the benefits and risks of antihypertensive drugs,
      which helps the patient to detect and declare situations involving a heightened risk of
      antihypertensive-related ADEs. The aim of the InPAct study is to evaluate the efficiency of
      the InPAct intervention in primary care.

    <textblock>
      A stepped wedge cluster randomized study, with 8 clusters and 5 periods of 3 months each.
      Each cluster is composed of about ten general practitioners. The InPAct intervention will not
      be presented to the first patients recruited by each general practitioner, whereas it will be
      presented to all their last patients. The period of intervention introduction by each general
      practitioner will be randomized amongst the 5 periods.
