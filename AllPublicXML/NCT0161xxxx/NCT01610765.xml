    <textblock>
      This study is to identify if a Novel Antiviral Drug could be used to treat babies with Herpes
      Simplex Virus (HSV) with central nervous system (CNS) disease. In this study the
      investigators will identify the best dose for young children as well as identify additional
      safety information about the Novel Antiviral Drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the pharmacokinetics and safety of a Novel Antiviral Drug will be determined
      in babies with neonatal HSV CNS disease. The study will be conducted at 18 academic medical
      centers throughout the United States. Young infants presenting with virologic confirmation of
      neonatal HSV infection and evidence of CNS involvement will be eligible for study enrollment.
      Study Day 1 is defined as the day when dose 1 of the Novel Antiviral Drug study medication is
      administered.
