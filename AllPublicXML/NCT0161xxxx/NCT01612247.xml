    <textblock>
      Patients with stage II-III breast cancer who do not achieve a pathologic complete response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the time of surgery will be treated with oral low dose continuous
      cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM) in combination with aspirin following surgery and
      radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is to assess toxicity and safety with secondary endpoints
      of cytokine correlates and relapse free survival (RFS) at 2 years. The investigators design
      tests the null hypothesis (H0) that the true primary toxicity event rate will be 5% or less,
      against an alternative hypothesis (HA) event rate of 25% or more.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is toxicity and safety. Serious adverse events, grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicity, and hematologic toxicity requiring removal of the patient from study treatment will be reviewed. A fixed sample size design to test for primary toxicity events will be conducted. Sample size was selected based upon a null hypothesis that the toxicity rate will be 5% or less and that the alternative hypothesis toxicity rate will be 25% or more.</description>

    <description>Cytokine and LVEF data will be examined using a pre-post analysis implemented using an analysis of covariance model where the pre-value serves as the baseline covariate and the post-value serves as the dependent variable of interest. Pre-post changes for each of these measures will also described in terms of 95% confidence intervals for absolute and relative changes. Other covariates may be included to examine any mediating influences on these changes dependent upon exploratory model building results.</description>

             positive or negative. Margins must be negative, with the following exception:
             microscopic positive anterior margin adjacent to skin is allowed.

          -  Patients must receive chemotherapy prior to definitive surgery. Any preoperative
             chemotherapy regimen is acceptable, with the exception of anti-angiogenic agents.

             therapy, if given, should start 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment in
             order to avoid a confounding effect on the correlative studies.

          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because breast cancer is extremely rare in this age group, children are

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             despite optimal medical therapy) are not eligiblePatients with poorly controlled

             pressure of 90 mmHg or higher) are ineligible.

          -  Patients on chronic aspirin therapy, anti-platelet agents, anti-coagulation agents or
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at any dose are excluded. Patients who

             study treatment.

          -  Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their
             ability to swallow and retain oral medication are excluded.

          -  Patients with any of the following conditions are excluded:

               -  Prior history of gastrointestinal or central nervous system bleeding, or

                  12 months prior to study entry.

               -  History of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, stable/unstable angina,
                  symptomatic congestive heart failure, or coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft
                  or stenting within 12 months prior to study entry.

               -  History of pulmonary embolism within the past 12 months.

               -  Abnormal LVEF by objective measurement. Measurement is not required unless
                  clinically indicated, but patients are excluded if LVEF is documented to be
                  abnormal.

                  system (see Appendix B).

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cyclophosphamide and methotrexate
             are chemotherapeutic agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with aspirin, cyclophosphamide and
             methotrexate, breastfeeding should not occur during study treatment. These potential
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Patients with a prior history of breast cancer, or any other malignancy other than
             non-melanoma skin cancer within the past five years, are excluded because recurrence
             of these cancers could affect the exploratory secondary endpoint of the trial.

          -  Known HIV-positive patients are excluded because they are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
