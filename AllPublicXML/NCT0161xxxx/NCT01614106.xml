      This study will evaluate the efficacy of an integrated &quot;Retention Clinic&quot; in achieving
      virologic suppression among HIV-infected cocaine (including crack) users by using a two-group
      randomized, prospective trial. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the
      following two groups: 1) &quot;Retention Clinic&quot; or 2) Treatment as Usual. The intervention
      (&quot;Retention Clinic&quot;) group will receive up to 11 Patient Navigator sessions over a 6 month
      period and 9 sessions of substance abuse treatment over a 3 month period. Follow-up
      assessments will be conducted at 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Medical records will be
      reviewed to document use of HIV care, drug treatment and mental health services during the
      study period. A total of 360 HIV-infected individuals who report cocaine (including crack)
      use will be randomized across both sites (Miami, FL, and Atlanta, GA). Primary hypothesis is
      that more participants randomized to the &quot;Retention Clinic&quot; will have undetectable viral load
      than will participants randomized to the treatment as usual group.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of an integrated &quot;Retention Clinic&quot; in achieving
      virologic suppression among HIV-infected cocaine (including crack) users by using a two-group
      randomized, prospective trial.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) &quot;Retention Clinic&quot; group and 2)
      Treatment as Usual. The intervention content of these groups is briefly described below:

      Retention Clinic (RC) Group: This group will receive comprehensive and integrated services
      from a Retention Clinic. Services include HIV primary care, substance abuse treatment and
      mental health services, as needed. Participants in this group will also receive hands-on
      assistance with navigating through the clinic and accessing these services from a patient
      navigator.

      Treatment as Usual (TAU) Group: This group will receive no protocol directed intervention.
      They will get the standard retention services from their local clinic.

      All participants will provide informed consent and will complete a baseline audio
      computer-assisted self-interview or ACASI focusing on drug use, mental health, demographics
      and socio-economic factors, HIV care, and drug treatment history as well as blood draws for
      viral load and CD4 count. Follow-up assessments consisting of both ACASI and blood draws in
      all groups will be collected at 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Medical records will be
      reviewed to document use of HIV care, drug treatment and mental health services during the
      study period.

    <description>The Retention Clinic will incorporate HIV primary care and mental health services with on-site substance abuse treatment and patient navigation.

    <description>The treatment as usual (TAU) group condition will represent standard of care at both of the participating clinics. Standard of care at both clinics includes primary HIV care, the provision of mental health services, and the assignment of a clinic case manager. These case managers meet with patients when they first come to clinic and then meet with them as needed and typically offer substance-using patients a referral to substance abuse treatment in the community as needed. Case managers usually do not follow up to determine the uptake of these referrals.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participating individuals must:

          1. be at least 18 years old

          2. be HIV-seropositive (confirmed via medical record/laboratory results or via rapid HIV
             test in conjunction with confirmatory test or viral load)

          3. meet one of the following: a) have an (*)AIDS-defining illness OR b) have a CD4 count
             &lt;350 cells/uL AND a viral load &gt;1000 copies/mL in the medical record in the past 3
             months OR c) have a CD4 count &lt;350 cells/uL AND a viral load &gt;200 copies/mL as
             obtained via baseline blood draw OR d) have a clinical profile indicative of a
             persistently detectable HIV viral load (&gt;200 copies/mL) attributed to non-adherence to
             HIV medications as per PI evaluation of the individual and/or individual's medical
             record

          4. report (OR have evidence in the medical record of) any cocaine (including crack) use
             in the past 3 months OR (**)have a positive toxicology result for cocaine via the
             study toxicology screen

          5. agree to have their blood drawn for CD4 and viral load testing

          6. report living in or near either Miami, FL, or Atlanta, GA, and be able to return for
             follow-up visits

          7. provide locator information

          8. be able to communicate in English

          9. provide written informed consent

             abstraction

         11. be willing to go to the study clinic

        (*)Site PI discretion will be used to assess whether or not the AIDS-defining illness is a
        good indicator of eligibility. For example, if a patient does not meet the CD4 and viral
        load criteria and does have an AIDS-defining illness, the Site PI will assess the
        AIDS-defining illness to determine whether or not the patient is a suitable candidate for
        the study.

        (**)Per PI discretion, the urine toxicology screen may be administered as part of the
        screening process if the participant's self-report and/or medical record data renders
        him/her ineligible on the drug use criterion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals will be excluded from study participation if they:

          1. do not meet any one or more of the above-described inclusion criteria

          2. are receiving patient navigator services for HIV care and/or substance abuse treatment

          3. have significant cognitive or developmental impairment to the extent that they are
             unable to provide informed consent

          4. are terminated via site PI decision
