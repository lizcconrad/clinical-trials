  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedative endoscopic examination using sedative premedication has been undertaken to induce
      conscious sedation for comfortable and painless endoscopy. Midazolam has been most widely
      used as a sedative premedication because it has lots of advantages, such as a short
      half-life, a faster onset of sedation and an excellent sedative hypnotic effect. However,
      midazolam has been used regardless of whether or not alcohol although using midazolam in
      chronic alcoholics is related to paradoxical reaction, characterized by increased
      talkativeness, emotional release, excitement, and excessive movement. In recent years,
      propofol has been used safety and effectively in sedative GI endoscopy because of its potent
      hypnotic effect and its ultrashort pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, The present study was
      conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of BPS (propofol in combination with midazolam)
      with conventional sedation (midazolam) in chronic alcoholic patients undergoing diagnostic GI
      endoscopic procedures.

    <description>In both study arms, patients who were 20-70 years of age received an initial intravenous bolus of 0.05mg/kg of midazolam, while patients ≥71 years of age received an initial intravenous dose of 1mg of midazolam. After 2min following this initial dose of midazolam, the conventional sedation group received additional boluses as needed of 1 to 2 mg of midazolam at the discretion of the endoscopist, to target moderate sedation. The BPS group received an initial 0.5mg/kg bolus of intravenous propofol at 2min after midazolam administration. Subsequent incremental boluses of 10 to 20 mg of propofol were allowed to be given at the discretion of the endoscopist every 30s to target moderate sedation.</description>
