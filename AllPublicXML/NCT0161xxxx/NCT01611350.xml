      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of different sales offers and
      different marketing messages to increase the uptake of energy efficient cookstoves.

      This research will address the following major barriers to the acquisition and correct use of
      improved cookstoves into four main categories:

        -  Inappropriate product or marketing for intended users

        -  Lack of consumer trust in new products

        -  Failure to address consumers' financial constraints

        -  Failure to achieve behavioral change

      To do so this research includes 3 Randomized Controlled Trials including:RCT 1- Testing the
      Effectiveness of Marketing Messages in Increasing Willingness to Pay; RCT 2- Testing the
      Effectiveness of the Novel Sales Offer and its ability to Increase Uptake of Purchasing
      Energy Efficient Cookstoves; and RCT 3-Measure the Effects of Fuel Efficient Cookstoves on
      Health, Fuel Use and Time Spent Collecting Fuel.

      RCT 1 studies the price women are willing to pay for the improved stove. It will also test
      the effects of the two most effective marketing messages identified during the Phase 1
      Feasibility stage (e.g., improved health, saves time, and has high status) on increasing
      willingness to pay. RCT 1 will run second price auctions in 36 parishes with an average of 60
      participants per meeting.

      From RCT 1, RCT 2 tests the effect of a Novel Sales Offer- which includes a free trial, and
      time payments- on purchasing decisions of participants versus those that receive the
      Traditional Offer- a cash and carry offer. Based on a pilot in urban Kampala conducted by Dr.
      David I. Levine (co-P.I. on this project) results show a 44% uptake for households offered
      the novel offer vs. a 4% uptake for those offered the traditional offer. The hypothesis is a
      novel offer will significantly increase uptake of fuel efficient cookstoves in rural Uganda
      when compared to a traditional offer.

      RCT 3 measures the impacts of fuel efficient cookstoves on health, fuel usage, and time spent
      collecting fuel. For RCT 3 we will randomize those who accept the Novel Offer into early and
      late groups. To measure the impacts of improved stoves on health, fuel use, time spent
      collecting fuel, etc., there will be a baseline and follow-up survey and associated
      quantitative measures on our full sample and a small endline on select quantitative measures
      for a sub-sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that 95% of Ugandans rely on solid fuel for cooking, and the vast majority use
      unimproved wood stoves in rural areas, replacing dirty and inefficient household wood stoves
      in Uganda provides a tremendous opportunity to improve health. Impact Carbon has been
      implementing an improved cookstove program in Uganda since 2005 which has now commercially
      sold more than 80,000 stoves. However, the program has not been successful in selling clean
      burning household wood stoves due to challenges related to the four categories of major
      barriers discussed above. Targeted research addressing these barriers will allow the team to
      test new sales and marketing methods to increase uptake of fuel efficient cookstoves. This
      has the potential to significantly reduce indoor air pollution as more households adopt fuel
      efficient cookstoves.

    <time_frame>This will be assessed from March 2012 to July 2012</time_frame>
    <description>We will randomly select some parishes to receive the Novel Sales Offer which includes a free trial and time payments and some parishes to receive the Traditional Offer, which is the offer to pay full price immediately. The outcome will be the percentage of both groups which accept the Novel Offer vs. those that accept the Traditional Offer.</description>

    <time_frame>Will be assessed between April 2012 and August 2012</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure wood use by weighing wood before without fuel efficient stove and after with fuel efficient stove.
To monitor effects on health we will measure Particulate Matter via. UCB PATS monitors. We will measure PM before without the fuel efficient stove and after with the fuel efficient stove.
We will measure time spent collecting fuel by self reporting survey questions from a baseline, follow-up and endline survey.</description>
