      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel-cisplatin
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with cetuximab or weekly
      cisplatin in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Although concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment
      related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. A phase Ⅱ study conducted by Hui
      et al. showed that neoadjuvant docetaxel-cisplatin (TP) chemotherapy followed by concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy was superior to the standard concomitant chemoradiation in terms of the
      3-year OS without significantly exacerbating the acute toxicities. Moreover, Bonner et al.
      demonstrated that RT with concurrent Cetuximab significantly improved the 5-year OS and did
      not increase the treatment induced toxicities when compared with RT alone. Therefore, we
      initiated this study to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the two regimens, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy followed by concurrent radiotherapy with cetuximab or weekly cisplatin for
      locally advanced NPC.
