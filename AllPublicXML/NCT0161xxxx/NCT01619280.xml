  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is caused by a wide variety of conditions, but always characterized
      by hypoxia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Current treatment of ALI is supportive and
      treatment of the underlying cause. New therapies to treat severe ALI have not been shown to
      improve survival, and are limited by financial and logistical resources.

      The investigators propose to investigate the role of inhaled sodium nitroprusside (iSNP) in
      ALI. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is a vasodilator. When inhaled, SNP may travel to areas of
      the lung participating in gas exchange, and cause the blood vessels surrounding these areas
      to enlarge. This may result in an increase of blood vessels to these areas of the lung, and
      improve oxygenation. Currently, iSNP has not been studied in the adult population. Therefore,
      this study is intended to find the safety profile of varying doses of iSNP.

      Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
      with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are not attributed to left atrial hypertension. ALI
      is responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in the critically ill population.

      Novel rescue therapies used to support oxygenation in severe ALI include inhaled nitric oxide
      and high frequency oscillatory ventilation; however, neither have been shown to reduce
      mortality and both are limited by logistical and financial challenges.

      Inhaled sodium nitroprusside (iSNP) is a vasodilator which causes local vasodilation of
      pulmonary capillaries surrounding functional alveoli, resulting in improved oxygenation by
      redistributing pulmonary blood flow to areas with better ventilation-perfusion ratios. As
      iSNP can be administered by a low-cost nebulizer and is relatively inexpensive compared to
      other novel rescue therapies, this modality may be an alternative therapy for patients with
      severe hypoxemia. Two pediatric studies support the use of iSNP in ALI; however, iSNP has not
      been studied in the adult ALI population. To determine whether iSNP can improve oxygenation
      in adult ALI, the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) must first be determined.

      Our study aims to determine the MTD of iSNP in adult ALI through an open-label,
      non-randomized, single centered, dose escalation study design, whereby subjects will receive
      iSNP for thirty minutes and have various physiologic variables recorded.

    <description>Each subject will receive one of five possible dosages of nebulized sodium nitroprusside. The dosage will be determined by the 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Only a maximum of six patients will be given a particular dosage. Arterial blood gases will be drawn at 0 min, 15 min, 30 min and 45 min during nebulized sodium nitroprusside administration. Vitals signs will be recorded every five minutes. No changes to ventilator settings or vasopressor dosage or fluid administration will be allowed.</description>
