      This proposed study aims to determine whether decreasing stress levels in persons with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can lead to a change in the intestinal microbiota,
      assessed 8 weeks after enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiota is known to be integral to gastrointestinal health and disease.
      Psychological stress has been shown to significantly alter the gastrointestinal microbiota of
      rats, rhesus monkeys, and humans. These studies have consistently shown decreases in
      lactobacilli among other changes in species that correlate with an increase in diarrheal
      symptoms. While it is unclear whether stress causes diarrhea leading indirectly to a
      disruption in the native microbiota, or whether stress leads directly to changes in the
      microbiota that then lead to diarrhea; there is a growing body of evidence to support the
      latter. Differences in microbiota have also been shown to be present in irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and predispose or protect against other forms of diarrhea including bacterial
      gastroenteritis and radiation-induced diarrhea. In addition, treatment with probiotics
      containing lactobacillus and other species has been shown to help alleviate IBS symptoms.
      Stress is hypothesized to act on the microbiota via the brain-gut axis through endocrine,
      immunological, and/or neurological pathways. This proposed study aims to determine whether
      decreasing stress levels in persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) &amp; IBS can lead
      to a change in the intestinal microbiota, assessed 3 weeks after enrollment. It also seeks to
      determine if a change in intestinal microbiota correlates with a decrease in IBS symptoms. We
      propose to use broad-range bacterial 16S rRNA gene PCR with 454 pyrosequencing to
      characterize the fecal microbiota and correlate changes in bacterial communities to IBS
      symptoms at baseline and after completion of an 8-week-stress reduction course in 15 patients
      with PTSD &amp; IBS and to compare these findings to 5 patients with PTSD &amp; IBS undergoing usual
      care without a stress-reduction course.
