      The only test available for in vivo diagnosis of tuberculosis is the intradermal injection of
      tuberculin according to the Mantoux method (also named tuberculosis skin test or PPD skin
      test).

      The tuberculin skin test is based on a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction However,
      this test needs to be performed by trained personnel, presents problem of reproducibility,
      and its interpretation is not well standardized (measure in millimeters of skin induration 48
      to 72 hours after the PPD skin test).

      The new generation BD micro needle used in this study should solve the technical
      difficulties; intradermal administration of tuberculin could then be made by any personnel.

      A non-invasive and objective instrumental method of reading the test will be also tested .
