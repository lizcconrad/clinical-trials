  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of advanced quantitative mass spectometry
      (Super SILAC) as a discovery platform to uncover novel protein biomarkers in tumor and to
      compare the protein profile between different subtypes of breast cancer (ER positive, HER2
      positive, triple negative). A maximum of 100 breast tumor specimens will be obtained from the
      NUHS Tissue repository, comprising approximately equal proportion of ER positive, HER2
      positive, and triple negative tumors. Samples will be analyzed using advanced Mass
      Spectrometry (Super SILAC) as a discovery platform to identify novel protein biomarkers that
      may be important in cancer. DNA and RNA will also be extracted from tumor samples for
      correlative analysis with the proteomics data. Genomics and proteomics data will be
      correlated with clinical data including treatment response and survival data. Importance of
      proposed research to science or medicine:Identification of tumor biomarkers may allow better
      prognostication, follow-up, and selection of treatment for cancer patients in the future.
      Potential benefits and risks: No direct benefit to the patient. Risk to the subjects is
      minimal as there is no direct patient contact, and analysis is done on previously donated
      tumor samples. Patients have previously provided consent to donate their samples for research
      into the NUHS Tissue Repository.

      Novel tumor biomarkers that determine tumor biology, including prognosis and treatment
      sensitivity, may be detectable using the novel advanced quantitative mass spectromy method
      (Super SILAC). Different subtypes of breast cancers will have different proteomic profiles
      analyzed using super SILAC.

    <measure>Evaluate the use of advanced quantitative mass spectometry (Super SILAC) as a discovery platform to uncover novel protein biomarkers in tumor</measure>
    <description>SILAC is a method of advanced quantitative mass spectometry that allows whole proteome analysis as comprehensively as transcriptome analysis. It allows quantification of whole-proteome, measure post-translational modifications and map complete interactome of a protein. Super-SILAC, an improvement of the SILAC method, enables the comparison of the amounts of hundreds or thousands of proteins from a particular tissue between different patients. This technology may enable the discovery of novel tumor protein markers that may be important in tumor progression and treatment response.</description>
