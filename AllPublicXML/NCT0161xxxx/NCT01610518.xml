  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability of oat β-glucan to lower postprandial glycemic responses has been attributed to
      the viscosity of the solution in which the fibre is solubilized. To our knowledge, no studies
      have investigated the effect of β-glucan solutions on glycemic response when concentration,
      and thus viscosity, is varied by changing the solution volume but not the β-glucan dose.
      Therefore, the investigators will test the effects of altering β-glucan solution viscosity by
      altering solution volume at a fixed amount of β-glucan fibre.

    <textblock>
      The ability of β-glucan to lower postprandial glycemic responses has been attributed to the
      viscosity of the solution in which the fibre is solubilized. It has been demonstrated that
      the viscosity of a β-glucan solution increases with the molecular weight (MW) of β-glucan
      polymers, as well as the dose or concentration (C) of those polymers in solution. Numerous
      studies have shown that glycemic response-lowering is strengthened when the C of a β-glucan
      solution of fixed liquid volume is increased by increasing β-glucan dose. However, the C of a
      β-glucan solution depends on not only the amount of fibre present but also on the solution
      volume. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effect of β-glucan solutions on
      glycemic response when C, and thus viscosity, is varied by changing the solution volume but
      not the β-glucan dose. Therefore, the investigators will test the effects of altering
      β-glucan solution viscosity by altering solution volume at a fixed amount of β-glucan fibre.
      Knowing how to incorporate β-glucan into solution so that its physiological benefits are
      preserved will assist in the development of β-glucan-containing functional foods.

    <description>Two fasting blood samples spaced 5 minutes apart (-5 min and 0 min) were collected by finger-prick using a monoejector lancet device. Immediately following the collection of the second blood sample, subjects consumed a test solution and 250mL of a beverage of their choice (water, tea or coffee with milk and/ or artificial sweetener aspartame). Subjects received the same beverage and volume of that beverage for each test in the study. Additional finger-prick blood samples were taken at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the start of the meal.</description>
