  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-adherence to oral medications is a prevalent problem in adolescents and young adults
      (AYA) with cancer that may impact both survival and quality of life while on treatment. The
      purpose of this study is to explore use of a smart-phone medication reminder application to
      promote adherence to oral medications by AYA with cancer. The study's primary aim is to
      explore the feasibility and acceptability of using a smart-phone medication reminder
      application to promote adherence to oral medications by AYA with cancer as well as to
      characterize application use. Secondary aims include: 1) to obtain initial estimates of
      intervention effect- measured by pre-intervention to post-intervention differences in
      perceived behavioral control for adherence, intention to adhere, and adherence behavior - to
      inform design of a future trial powered to detect a clinically significant effect of
      smart-phone medication reminder application use on adherence to oral medications; and 2) to
      examine the relationships among perceived behavioral control for adherence, intention to
      adhere, and adherence behavior. A pre-post single group design will be used. Data will be
      collected weekly for 4 weeks before introduction of the intervention and for 8 weeks
      following introduction of the intervention. Analytic approaches will include descriptive
      statistics and generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling.
