      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 'patient journey' model in
      internet-based counseling of a person with hearing impairment is a feasible approach in
      management of emotional and social consequences, anxiety and depression, readiness to change
      and acceptance of hearing loss.

    <description>Stage 1 - introduction to the concept of the patient journey and presenting the participants series of questions which may help them to explore their journey through hearing loss; Stage 2 - patient journey model of PHI and 2 case examples will be presented. The PHI will be advised to compare their journey to the model presented and identify the similarities and differences; Stage 3 - communication partners' journey model will be presented and the PHI will be asked to consider how interactions between each other may affect various things in the physical, mental and social domains; and Stage 4 - patients will be encouraged to think about how the PHI &amp; CP may influence each other during their journey through hearing loss, how they can overcome some of the difficulties they may be experiencing and to think about the potential benefits and the challenges from the audiological management.</description>
