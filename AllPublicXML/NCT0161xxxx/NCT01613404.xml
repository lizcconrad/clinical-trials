      The purpose of the study is to compare the 90 day and 12 month composite end point of death
      (all-cause mortality) and hospitalization in incident hemodialysis patients randomized to
      receive support from a dedicated case manager (intervention group) versus those not receiving
      support from a dedicated case manager (control group).

      This is multicenter, prospective, observational, and randomized (the study drug is assigned
      by chance), 1-year study, in academic and community-based nephrology clinical practices that
      will examine the impact of a facility nurse case manager. In this study a group of patients
      guideline- based, algorithm- driven approach to hemodialysis initiation with targets (as per
      Canadian Society of Nephrology and/or International guidelines) will be used with facility
      nurse case manager and in control group same approach will be used without facility nurse
      case manager. Patients will be treated with any approved erythropoiesis stimulating agent for
      the correction of anemia, according to guidance in the current approved product monographs.
      All treatments will be prescribed by the physician according to actual clinical practice or
      standard of care for chronic kidney disease. The entire study duration for each participant
      will be approximately 12 months.
