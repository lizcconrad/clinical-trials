  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard chemotherapy is capable of eliminating most leukemic blasts in acute myeloblastic
      leukemia (AML), while leukemia-initiating cells are not sufficiently eradicated. As a
      consequence, refractory disease and relapse frequently occur in AML, especially in elderly
      patients. The investigators propose that the addition of temsirolimus may improve standard
      AML chemotherapy. Furthermore, temsirolimus may specifically target the leukemia-initiating
      cells in AML, thereby reducing the risk of leukemia relapse.

      The study's main part is preceded by a open label run-in part, in which optimal temsirolimus
      dose and schedule for the main part o the study will be determined.
