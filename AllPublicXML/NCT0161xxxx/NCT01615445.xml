  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous animal studies have found that resveratrol supplementation significantly increased
      aerobic capacity. The investigators conducted a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over
      study to assess whether resveratrol could provide similar benefits in humans.

      All participants were assigned to two 4-week treatment periods, with a 2 week washout
      in-between. During one period, volunteers in received resveratrol and during the other
      period, they received identical-appearing placebo.

      The primary outcome of interest was change in exercise capacity, as measured by change in
      exercise duration on constant load exercise testing and change in aerobic capacity (peak VO2)
      on incremental exercise testing. Secondary outcomes were tolerability and side-effects
      associated with resveratrol.
