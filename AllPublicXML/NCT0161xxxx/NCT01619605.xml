  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of serum tryptase for the
      confirmation of shrimp-induced anaphylaxis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based primarily on the clinical history. In some
      circumstances, inability to confirm the clinical diagnosis such as present with unusual
      manifestation, or when skin signs are absent likely contributes to underrecognition and
      undertreatment of the disease.

      Currently, products of mast cell activation (histamine and total tryptase) can be measure in
      clinical laboratories as markers of acute anaphylaxis events, however these tests have
      clinically relevant limitations.

      Therefore, development of laboratory tests with improved sensitivity and specificity that
      will support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis are needed.

      In addition, shrimp is the major cause of seafood anaphylaxis among Thai children.
