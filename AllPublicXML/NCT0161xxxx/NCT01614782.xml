      The purpose of this study is to assess the multiple rising dose safety/tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of MK-5823 in overweight/obese participants who are healthy and
      overweight/obese participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

    <description>MK-5823 administered subcutaneously (doses ranging from 0.35 mg to 2.8 mg) once daily for 3 weeks. Doses may be adjusted downward based on safety, tolerability, and/or pharmacokinetic data. The decision to dose escalate will be based on accrued safety/tolerability data at the prior dose level.
In each arm, 6 participants will be randomized to receive study drug and 2 participants will be randomized to receive placebo.</description>
