      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Luxe™ device for use in
      wrinkle and rosacea treatment.

      Up to 60 subjects will treat their periorbital and cheek areas daily for 4 weeks and then
      twice a week for an additional 4 weeks. Evaluations of improvement will be conducted at the
      clinic after enrollment and during the treatment at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after initiation.
