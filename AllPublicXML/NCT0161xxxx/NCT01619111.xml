  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HER2 status in breast cancer patients may change during the course of the disease. In 30%
      of initially HER2-negative patients with circulating tumor cells (CTC), HER2-positive CTCs
      can be detected in peripheral blood samples(1). At present, it is unclear if therapy based on
      the HER2 status of CTC offers a clinical benefit for these patients. The DETECT III - trial
      compares lapatinib, as HER2-targeted therapy in combination with standard therapy versus
      standard therapy alone in those patients, with initially HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer and HER2-positive circulating tumor cells.

      As one of the first interventional trials based on the assessment of CTC phenotypes, the
      DETECT III - trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy in patients with
      MBC and HER2-positive CTCs as well as the significance of CTC as an early predictive marker
      for treatment response.

             per investigator assessment).

          7. Concurrent disease or condition that might interfere with adequate assessment or
             evaluation of study data, or any medical disorder that would make the patient's
             participation unreasonably hazardous.

          8. Other malignant diseases within the last 3 years apart from CIN of the uterine cervix
             and skin basalioma.

          9. Disease or condition which might restrain the ability to take or absorb oral

             small bowel or stomach), uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's disease)
             and any other diseases significantly affecting gastrointestinal function as well as

               -  ejection fraction below the institutional normal limit,

               -  any other cardiac condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician would
                  make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

         11. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric or social condition which would
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or which might interfere
             with the patient's adherence to the protocol.

         12. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months.

         13. Male patients.
