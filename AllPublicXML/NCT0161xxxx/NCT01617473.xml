  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of peripheral blood stem cells(PBSCs) is rapidly growing in the allogeneic
      transplantation setting as an alternative to bone marrow (BM).It was found that the use of
      PBSCs is associated with faster hematologic recovery but have yielded differing results
      regarding the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and relapse.

      The study hypothesis:

      transplantation of mobilized PBSC to haploidentical donor with standard-risk leukemia had
      comparable engraftment and non-relapse mortality to mobilized BM combined with PBSCs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The donors were primed with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) injected
      subcutaneously for five consecutive days. In the trial group, the PBSCs were harvested on the
      fourth and fifth day;in the control group, the bone marrow cells were harvested on the fourth
      day and the PBSCs were harvested on the fifth day.
