  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The average life expectancy in Denmark is increasing resulting in an increasing part of the
      population having age-related disease, ex lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). LSS causes
      constriction of the nerves in the lumbar spine resulting in pain in the legs and lower back,
      especially when standing and walking, known as neurogenic claudication(Goh KJ FAU - Khalifa
      et al.). LSS occurs in a combination of degenerative changes in the lower back, including
      hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavus, arthrosis of the facet joints and bulging of the disc.

      Current treatment of LSS is varied ranging from non-operative conservative treatment to
      operation.

      Operative intervention shows very good results according to physical ability and
      pain(Christensen FB et al.;Hee HT and Wong;McGregor AH FAU - Hughes and Hughes;Xu et al.),
      but the most optimal treatment is still debated. Nevertheless, a decompression and, if
      needed, a spinal fusion is recommended.(Ausman).

      Clinical improvement including decrease of pain, improved ADL-function and an increased
      quality of life are parameters of highest interest and the purpose of an operation is clear:
      Making sufficient room for the affected nerves. In addition fusion is desired achieving
      stability avoiding a new compression of the nerves. Studies attending these issues find a
      correlation between fusion and clinical outcome, why obtained fusion of the affected levels
      are very important(Andersen et al.;Andersen et al.;Girardo et al.;Kornblum MB FAU -
      Fischgrund et al.).

      P-15, bound to Anorganisk Bone Mineral (ABM), called i-FACTOR®, shows fusion superiority, no
      side effects and no risk of transferring disease(Thorwarth et al. 5648-57;Thorwarth et al.
      789-95;Wenz, Oesch, and Horst 1599-606;Scarano et al. 318-24;Kubler et al. 171-79) why the
      investigators find this material suited for fusion surgery in the elderly.

      To the investigators knowledge this is the first prospective study comparing fusion rates and
      postoperative clinic with i-FACTOR vs allograft in older patients operated with decompression
      and spondylodesis because of spinal stenosis due to degenerative spondylolisthesis.

      Hypothesis:

      There are no difference in the clinical parameters measured by ODI and fusion rates comparing
      i-FACTOR® and allograft in non-instrumented posterolateral spondylodesis-operations in
      patients 60 years and older.
