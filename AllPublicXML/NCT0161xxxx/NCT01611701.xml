  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomized double-blind study was to compare the efficacy and
      safety of cryoballoon ablation with the RF approach in the treatment of paroxysmal AF after
      failed first radiofrequency ablation.

    <description>In Cryo group, 28mm balloon was introduced into the PV ostium with the best possible occlusion of the PV. Every step was controlled by fluoroscopy. Cryoenergy was applied for maximal 6 minutes per application for 2 times, resulting in a circumferential ablation lesion. Before the right superior vein was treated, a quadripolar catheter was placed in the superior vena cava to continuously stimulate the right phrenic nerve during cryoapplication. The application was stopped immediately in the case of diminished diaphragm movements.</description>

    <description>n RF group, reisolation of the PV was performed by identifying the breakthrough site. Radiofrequency energy was delivered at 43°C, 35 W, 0.5 cm away from the PV ostia at the anterior wall, and was reduced to 43°C, 30 W, 1 cm away from the PV ostia at the posterior wall, with a saline irrigation rate of 17 mL/min. Each lesion was ablated continuously until the local potential amplitude decreased by &gt;80% or RF energy deliveries exceeded 40 s.</description>
