    <textblock>
      Identifying effective strategies for improving healthier eating for low- income populations
      is both a clinical challenge and a public health priority. Approximately one-fifth of the
      children in the United States are either overweight or obese. Obesity is even more common in
      low- income populations as are other related health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension
      and cardiovascular diseases.

      The consumption of fruits and vegetables is strongly associated with the prevention and
      management of obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Overall, only about 38% of
      Americans consume the recommended servings of vegetables and only 23% consume the suggested
      amount of fruit. Close to 20% of low- income households do not purchase fruits and vegetables
      at all.

      The proposed research offers an opportunity to investigate a different approach to incentives
      for healthier eating in a low-income urban population. Specifically, this study will examine
      a rewards-based incentive for fruit and vegetable purchases with rewards based on cumulative
      purchases. Previous studies have shown that incentives may be an effective means of promoting
      behavior change. The proposed study will provide essential data about the impact of targeted
      incentives to promote acquisition of fruits and vegetables by individuals living in
      households with young children. The investigators plan to design a subsequent, larger study
      based on the results of this study. In the proposed study, the investigators will
      specifically contribute to this knowledge by investigating the effects of rewards-based
      incentives that provide delayed reinforcement.

      SPECIFIC AIMS AND STUDY HYPOTHESES

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether incentives to low-income families to
      encourage purchase of healthier foods can be used to help stem the tide of childhood obesity.
      Although this study is a randomized trial, a major function is collecting data to be used in
      the design of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing two different interventions
      using incentives to promote healthier eating in low-income communities. The investigators
      will test a supermarket &quot;gift card&quot; with rewards based on purchases of fruits and vegetables
      during the intervention periods. The specific objective is to determine whether that
      incentive systemâ€”(where the rewards can be used to purchase anything in that supermarket)
      increases healthier food purchasing practices by low-income families. The primary outcomes
      are: number of servings, and percent of total food dollars spent on fruits and vegetables
      (fresh and frozen). The primary hypotheses are:

        1. Households in the intervention group will purchase more fruits and vegetables than
           controls per week, both during: a) each intervention phase as compared to the baseline
           period and b) in the follow up phase compared to the baseline period. (Between group
           comparisons over time of intervention versus control group)

           The secondary hypotheses are:

        2. Households in the intervention group will purchase more fruits and vegetables per week
           both during: a) each intervention phase as compared to the baseline period and b) in the
           follow up phase compared to baseline. (Within group comparisons over time)
