      Researchers are doing a research study to examine the use of eribulin (eribulin mesylate) in
      patients with salivary gland cancer. Researchers want to know if eribulin is safe and
      effective in treating salivary gland cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the response rate of eribulin per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) in patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic salivary gland cancer
      (SGC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of eribulin in patients with locally advanced refractory
      or metastatic SGC.

      II. Evaluate the duration of response and time-to-progression.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented salivary gland cancers;
             patients that do not have a salivary gland primary must have one of the following
             histologies - adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell
             carcinoma

          -  Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease that is progressive and not
             amenable to surgery or curative radiotherapy occurring within 6 months of study entry,
             as evidenced by: at least a 20% increase in radiographically or clinically measurable
             disease, appearance of any new lesions, or deterioration in clinical status

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2
