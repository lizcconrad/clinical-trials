      The main purpose of the study is to better understand how specific proteins/markers in blood,
      urine, synovial fluid (a lubricating fluid secreted by the membrane lining the joints), and
      joint tissue are involved in osteoarthritis of the knee. The aim is to investigate if there
      is a correlation between x-ray results, specific proteins/markers and different types of pain
      in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The study consists of 3 visits over 3-20 days
      and the last visit will be the day of surgery.

    <description>WOMAC consists of 3 subscales with a total of 24 questions regarding pain, stiffness and difficulty in performing daily activities. A VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) will be used for the patient to report the severity of the symptoms on the target knee. Endpoints are marked &quot;No pain&quot; (0 mm) and &quot; Extreme pain&quot; (100 mm) on a paper PRO (Patient Reported Outcome) questionnaire. The less pain scored the better outcome.
NPQ accesses 12 different pain intensities. 0 represents no intensity and 100 represents worst intensity imaginable. The less intensity the better outcome.</description>
