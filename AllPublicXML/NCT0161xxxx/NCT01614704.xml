  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer affect around 52 000 women in France each year. Amongst them, 7% are less than
      40 years old and 2% are in between 25 and 35 years old. Significant therapeutic advances have
      improved the prognostic of these patients. They will all most likely to received
      chemotherapy. Despite the fact that chemotherapy has many side effects, these women do
      question the impact of the treatment on their ability to procreate.

      On 06/08/04 law basis, each patient is allowed to preserve gametes or germinal tissues when
      medical care potentially affect fertility.

      Functional evaluation of ovarian reserve could help comprehend new chemotherapy protocols,
      provide fertility information, and help individualize fertility preservation supports.

      Principal objective is to ensure the absence of ovarian stimulation's side effects and assess
      chemotherapy effects on child carrying potential.
