  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The New Orleans Criteria (NOC) and the Canadian CT Head Rules (CCHR) have been developed to
      decrease the number of normal computed tomography (CT) in mild head injury (MHI). The aim is
      to compare the clinical performance of these 2 decision rules for indentifying patients with
      intracranial traumatic lesions and those who required an emergent neurosurgical intervention
      following MHI.

      A multicenter external validation study in 7 Tunisian teaching and non teaching hospitals
      including patients with MHI defined as a blunt trauma to the head within 24 hours with a
      Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 and at least one of the following: history of loss
      of consciousness, short-term memory deficit, amnesia for the traumatic event, post-traumatic
      seizure, vomiting, headache, external evidence of injury above the clavicles, confusion, and
      neurologic deficit. Primary outcome was need for neurosurgical intervention defined as either
      death or craniotomy, or the need of endotracheal intubation within 30 days of the traumatic
      event. Secondary outcome was the presence of traumatic lesions on head CT scan. Comparaision
      of both decision rules using sensitivity specifications, positive and negative predictive
      value.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with acute MHI was defined as a patient having a blunt trauma to the head
             within 24 hours with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13 to 15 and at least 1 of the
             following risk factors: history of loss of consciousness, short-term memory deficit,
             amnesia for the traumatic event, post-traumatic seizure, vomiting, headache, external
