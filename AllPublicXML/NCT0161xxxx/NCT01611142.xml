    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate of KW-0761 for
      the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. KW-0761 targets CCR4. CCR4 is the
      receptor for macrophage derived chemokines MDC/CCL22 and TARC/CCL17. Chemokines are
      considered to play a role both in the recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells for
      anti-tumor response and in the selective homing of neoplastic B and T cells.

      PTCL is a rare and heterogeneous disease that remains difficult to diagnose and treat. In the
      majority of PTCL subtypes, patients are of older age (&gt;60 years) and present with advanced
      stage disease.With the exception of the ALCL-ALK-positive subtype that responds well to CHOP
      combined chemotherapy, most PTCL subtypes become refractory even to aggressive chemotherapy
      regimens or relapse. Overall survival of PTCL patients is poor compared with that of
      aggressive B-cell lymphomas.Thus, novel and effective therapies are
      needed.KW-0761(mogamulizumab) is a defucosylated, humanized, IgG1 mAb with enhanced antibody
      dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)that binds to CCR4, a molecule that is suggested to be
      significantly involved in patients with PTCL.
