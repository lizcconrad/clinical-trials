      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and North and South America. The aim of the trial is
      to investigate the effect of liraglutide versus placebo when added to basal insulin analogues
      with or without metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events (AEs) During The Randomised Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 26 + 7 days follow up</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as treatment emergent if the onset date (or increase in severity) was on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment. The adverse events were categorised as 'serious' and 'non-serious' adverse events. Adverse events were also categorised according to the severity as 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe' adverse events.</description>

          <title>Liraglutide</title>
          <description>Liraglutide was administered subcutaneously (s.c. injection, under the skin) once daily (OD) for 26 weeks in combination with pre-trial basal insulin analogue regimen ± metformin. The starting dose of the liraglutide was 0.6 mg/day; dose was escalated to 1.2 mg/day after one week and 1.8 mg/day after 2 weeks; dose was maintained at 1.8 mg day for subsequent weeks until the end of the trial. All subjects continued their pre-trial insulin therapy of insulin glargine (100 U/mL, s.c. injection) or insulin detemir (100 U/mL, s.c. injection). Oral anti diabetic drug metformin was administered as a tablet with a total daily dose of ≥1500 mg, divided into one to three doses per day.</description>

The starting dose of the placebo was 0.6 mg/day; dose was escalated to 1.2 mg/day after one week and 1.8 mg/day after 2 weeks; dose was maintained at 1.8 mg day for subsequent weeks until the end of the trial. All subjects continued their pre-trial insulin therapy of insulin glargine (100 U/mL, s.c. injection) or insulin detemir (100 U/mL, s.c. injection). Oral anti diabetic drug metformin was administered as a tablet with a total daily dose of ≥1500 mg, divided into one to three doses per day.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as treatment emergent if the onset date (or increase in severity) was on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment. The adverse events were categorised as 'serious' and 'non-serious' adverse events. Adverse events were also categorised according to the severity as 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe' adverse events.</description>
