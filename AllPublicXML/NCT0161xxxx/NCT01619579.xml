    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Daily use of the AVACEN Thermal Exchange System for 4 weeks will show improved
      Fibromyalgia pain and functioning markers, as assessed by biomarkers and clinical and
      psychological assessment. This non-invasive device is able to rapidly raise the core body
      temperature of the user by placing a hand in a vacuum chamber and resting it upon a heating
      element. The change in body temperature may change the sympathetic nervous system's activity
      and thereby reduce Fibromyalgia pain.
