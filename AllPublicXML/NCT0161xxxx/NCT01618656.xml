  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis dependence is associated with changes in the brain's cannabinoid system. When
      cannabis dependent individuals try to quit using cannabis, some of them experience problems
      that make it difficult for them to achieve and maintain abstinence. Therefore, reducing the
      problems related to quitting cannabis may facilitate abstinence. One way to do this is by
      harnessing the brain's capacity to make its own cannabis-like substances - endocannabinoids.
      One of the main endocannabinoids is anandamide. The study is based on the hypothesis that the
      problems related to quitting cannabis use will be reduced by increasing the brain levels of
      anandamide. Furthermore, by reducing the problems related to quitting cannabis, people will
      be less likely to relapse. Brain anandamide levels will be increased by blocking the
      breakdown of anandamide using a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor (FAAH-I). The effects of
      a novel FAAH-I cannabis withdrawal and relapse in cannabis dependent subjects will be studied
      in a double-blind, randomized, controlled, proof-of-concept study. Cannabis-dependent
      subjects will receive placebo or the FAAH-inhibitor PF-04457845 in a 2:1 randomization. The
      trial consists of a 1 week inpatient stay to achieve abstinence, a 3 week outpatient
      treatment phase and a 8 week follow-up phase. Abstinence and relapse will be measured at
      various times during this 12 week study.
