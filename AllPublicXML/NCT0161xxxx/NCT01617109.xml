  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to
      determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation (800IU and 2000mg,
      respectively) on biochemical indicators of nutritional status and bone health in military
      personnel during Army basic combat training (BCT) and Air Force basic military training
      (BMT).

      The investigators hypothesize that daily supplementation with vitamin D and calcium during
      military training will improve vitamin D status, stabilize PTH levels, and result in
      improvements in markers of bone health. As a result of the investigators study design, the
      findings will provide critically important data regarding the concentration of vitamin D in
      blood necessary to stabilize PTH levels and to optimize bone formation during initial
      military training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for maintaining bone health. Previous work from our
      laboratory indicates that vitamin D status may decline in Soldiers during BCT, even during
      the summer months in the Southeastern United States. Stress fractures may affect up to 5% of
      male and 21% of female Soldiers during training, resulting in attrition in up to 60% of
      affected personnel, but a recent report indicates that vitamin D and calcium supplementation
      may attenuate stress fracture risk by up to 20% in female Navy recruits. However, biochemical
      measures of nutritional status and associated markers of bone health were not collected in
      that study, leaving questions regarding the vitamin D and calcium requirements for military
      personnel during periods of elevated bone turnover.
