      Primary objectives: A. To evaluate the effect of Zortress® versus standard immunosuppression
      therapy on progression of CAC as evidenced by changes in Agatston scores from baseline and at
      6, and 12 months in renal transplantation patients. B. To investigate progression of CAC in
      patients undergoing renal transplantation within the study period.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard
           immunosuppression therapy on bone mass as evidenced by changes in quantitative computed
           tomography (QCT) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

        2. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard
           immunosuppression therapy on activity of bone forming and resorbing cells as evidenced
           by changes in bone histology.

        3. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard
           immunosuppression therapy on biochemical parameters of bone turnover as evidenced by
           changes in serum Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Bone-Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP),
           Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP), Sclerostin, Receptor Activator of Nuclear
           factor Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), , serum CTX (C-terminal
           telopeptide of type 1 collagen), and urinary NTX (N-terminal cross link telopeptide).

        4. To evaluate in renal transplantation the effect of Zortress® versus standard
           immunosuppression therapy on cardiovascular events, graft rejection and patient
           survival.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the proportion of pts in the treatment group who experience a 1yr increase of ≥2.5 for the square-root transformed volume indicating CAC progression. Student's Fisher's Exact T-tests will be used to determine progression of CAC score between control &amp; treatment groups. Secondary objectives 1-3 examine 1yr changes in several measurement outcome variables. Fisher's exact tests &amp; confidence intervals for the difference in proportions will be used to compare the two groups in terms of cardiovascular events, graft rejection, &amp; pt survival.</description>
