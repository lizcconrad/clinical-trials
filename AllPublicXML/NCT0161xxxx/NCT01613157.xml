      The investigators would like to carry out this study to measure drug levels in HIV-infected
      women that are taking anti-HIV medications. This study will determine the predictors of high
      drug levels and will assess the association of drug levels and adverse events in women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been tremendous advances in the treatment of HIV by combining 3 to 4 of the 20
      anti-HIV medications available. Despite these advances, there remain several important
      complications related to the treatment, most importantly adverse events like nausea,
      diarrhea, liver toxicity and lipodystrophy (fat wasting or accumulation). Some studies have
      found that drug levels are higher in women and that these higher drug levels are associated
      with the increased toxicity in women. The reasons for the higher drug levels remain unclear.
      It is unknown whether these relate to hormonal influences, drug metabolism, adherence, fat
      distribution, body size or other factors. For this reason, we would like to carry out this
      study to measure drug levels in HIV-infected women that are taking anti-HIV medications. This
      study will determine the predictors of high drug levels and will assess the association of
      drug levels and adverse events in women.

          -  A biologic woman

          -  Are taking their first combination Anti-retroviral regimen that includes a Protease

          -  Have end-stage organ disease

          -  Have another significant non-HIV underlying disease that might impinge upon disease
             progression or death
