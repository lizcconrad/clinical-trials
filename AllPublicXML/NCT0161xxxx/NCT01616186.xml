  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial that follows the completion of the phase I UCSF trial of everolimus
      and sorafenib for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). This trial will be for patients who have not
      had treatment for RCC before. This trial will have 2/3 patients getting everolimus/sorafenib
      treatment and 1/3 getting sunitinib, an FDA approved RCC drug. All three drugs are approved
      for advanced RCC when used individually, the combination of everolimus and sorafenib for RCC
      is not approved by the FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the phase I study of the combination of everolimus and sorafenib, clinical benefit was
      observed in patients with no prior systemic therapy. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic
      interaction and acceptable toxicity at a dosage of sorafenib of 400 mg twice daily (BID) and
      everolimus 5 mg daily. Based on these data and the need for more effective front-line therapy
      for renal cell carcinoma, the plan is to investigate this regimen in patients who have not
      undergone prior therapy. A sunitinib arm is being included as a concurrent reference to help
      provide a guideline of an activity level and toxicity that would be meaningful to move
      forward to a phase III study. Therefore, this study is designed as a non-comparative
      investigation and patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to everolimus/sorafenib or to
      sunitinib, respectively.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed renal cell carcinoma, which is unresectable
             or metastatic and of any of the following histologies: clear cell, papillary,
             chromophobic, oncocytic, unclassified, or mixed. A component of clear cell histology
             must be present. Tumors with pure collecting duct histology are not eligible.

          2. Cytoreductive nephrectomy is allowed but not required

          3. Evidence of RECIST-defined measurable disease (lesions that can be accurately measured
             in at least one dimension with the longest diameter ≥ 20mm using conventional
             techniques or ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan)

          4. Male or female at least 18 years old

                  of therapy, and for 3 months after the end of treatment/end of participation in
                  the study. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by
                  cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this
                  study.

               2. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective
                  contraception during the period of therapy, and for 3 months after the end of
                  treatment/end of participation in the study.

               3. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the
                  investigator.

          8. Adequate renal function as determined by either:

               1. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (for calculated
                  creatinine clearance, Cockroft-Gault equation will be used)

                  Modified Cockcroft-Gault formula:

                  ((140 - age (yrs)) x (actual weight(kg))) / (72 x serum creatinine(mg/dl))

                  * Multiply by another factor of 0.85 if female

             renal pelvis is excluded.

          2. Prior systemic regimens for renal cell carcinoma (neoadjuvant therapy is acceptable as
             long as it did not include sunitinib, sorafenib, everolimus, or temsirolimus). A prior
             therapy which was started and stopped after no more than four weeks of therapy will
             not constitute a prior systemic regimen.

          3. Prior surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy for renal cell carcinoma within
             4 weeks of starting study treatment.

          4. History of or known brain metastasis, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous
             meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease on screening CT or MRI
             scan (evaluation for CNS disease is required to be performed for eligibility).

          5. Any of the following within 6 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial
             infarction, unstable or severe angina, coronary or peripheral artery bypass graft,
             NYHA functional Class II, III, IV congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident
             or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism.

          6. Ejection fraction lower than institutional lower limit of normal by echocardiogram or
             MUGA.

          7. Hypertension that is unable to be controlled with medications to a blood pressure of ≤
             150/90.

          8. Hypothyroidism that is unable to be controlled with medications such that FT4 is
             outside of normal limits.

          9. QTc prolongation (QTc interval ≥ 480 msecs) or any other clinically significant ECG
             abnormalities.

         10. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome
             (AIDS)-related illness (because of the immunosuppressive effects of therapy). Testing
             for HIV in the absence of a history or symptoms is not required.

         11. Hepatitis B or C (because of the risk of reactivation). The following serologies are
             acceptable for enrollment: HBsAg-/anti-HBc-/anti-HBs-; HBsAg-/anti-HBc+/anti-HBs+;
             HBsAg-/anti-HBc-/anti-HBs+. The following serologies are not acceptable for
             enrollment: HBsAg+/anti-HBc+(IgM+/-)/anti-HBs-. If the following serologies are
             obtained, additional testing will be required to ascertain the patient's hepatitis B
             status: HBsAg-/anti-HBc+/anti-HBs-.

         12. &quot;Currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients
             are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and are considered to have a less than 30% risk of relapse.

         13. Current treatment on another clinical trial.

         14. Pregnant or breastfeeding.

         15. Chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agent.

             anticoagulants are allowed).

         17. History of malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function or major resection of stomach or small bowel that could interfere with
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drugs.

         18. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition
             (including lab abnormalities) that could interfere with subject safety or obtaining
             informed consent. Examples of such include uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting
             serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN (Note: optimal glycemic control should be achieved before
             starting trial therapy), nonhealing wound, severe infection, severe malnutrition,
             ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, chronic liver or renal
             disease, or active upper GI tract ulceration.

         19. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.
