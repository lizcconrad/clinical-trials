      Aim 1: To assess steroid sensitivity to mometasone furoate (MF) in cultured nasal polyp
      explant tissue in vitro.

      Aim 2: To assess steroid sensitivity in vivo in each subject by comparing symptom scores,
      nasal endoscopic findings before and following 4 weeks of treatment with mometasone furoate
      nasal spray (MFNS) and by comparing tissue immunohistology in NP biopsies pre- and
      post-treatment withA MFNS.

      Aim 3: To characterize the molecular signature of gene mRNA expression in &quot;steroid-sensitive&quot;
      and &quot;steroid-resistant&quot; NP using microarray on NP tissue pre- and post-MFNS treatment.

      Hypothesis 1: Genes that regulate apoptosis are dysregulated in nasal polyp (NP) inflammatory
      cells, epithelial cells and smooth muscle actin myofibroblasts leading to persistence of
      inflammatory cell infiltration and abnormal epithelial and myofibroblast cellular
      proliferation. These can be corrected by mometasone. Apoptosis-regulating genes that cannot
      be corrected by mometasone are upregulated in steroid-resistant NP.

      Elucidation of this dysregulation may prove insightful in understanding the mechanism of
      action of mometasone in NP and identifying potential molecular targets that will increase
      steroid sensitivity or, conversely, overcome steroid resistance.

      Hypothesis 2: There is a molecular signature of gene expression in NP that signifies steroid
      sensitive NP (SS-NP). This signature is altered in steroid resistant NP (SR-NP).

      Elucidation of differences in the molecular signature of SS-NP versus SR-NP before and after
      treatment with mometasone furoate (MFNS) will provide novel insight into treatment of NP with
      steroids.
