    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is being acknowledged as a potential public health time bomb, whose incidence
      is predicted to double over the next 10 years in the UK, associated with the rise in obesity
      and increasing sedentary lifestyles. Increased insulin resistance has been shown to be an
      important feature of type 2 diabetes (especially in those presenting with obesity and in
      particular visceral or abdominal obesity). Insulin resistance is implicated as a risk factor
      of cardiovascular disease and may lead to pancreatic dysfunction through increased β-cell
      stress in the pancreas. A combination of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell failure
      then leads to type 2 diabetes. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes
      is cardiovascular disease as the condition is associated with impaired vascular functioning
      and increased levels of oxidation markers.

      Epidemiological studies suggest dietary flavonoids decrease the risk of death from coronary
      heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Flavonoid-rich foods include fruits and vegetables as well
      as tea, red wine, and chocolate. In a cohort of elderly men, cocoa intake was inversely
      associated with blood pressure and 15-year cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It has
      been reported that in healthy humans, consumption of flavanol-rich dark chocolate decreased
      daytime and night time blood pressure, reduced insulin resistance, and improved nitric oxide
      dependent vaso-relaxation. Another trial found that cocoa powder increased postprandial
      insulinaemia in lean young adults. These research papers have led to the hypothesis that
      chocolate containing high cocoa liquor may help to reduce the risk of developing type 2
      diabetes.

      This study is design as a double-blind, controlled, single center, randomized, parallel
      design clinical trial. The primary outcome measure is to compare parameters of insulin
      resistance and glycaemic control in volunteers with type 2 diabetes after consumption of 3
      different chocolates (one dark and two milk chocolates) with a secondary outcome of
      endothelial function, cholesterol profile and oxidative stress. Subjects will undergo medical
      screening, anthropometry, physical activity and dietary assessments before randomization.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes will be based on the WHO guidelines. These are 2

             readings &gt;11mmoll-1 in the absence of symptoms or concurrent illness or medication
             which might lead to hyperglycaemia (e.g. thiazide diuretics). Or one reading meeting
             the diagnostic level with the presence of symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia,
             fatigue or blurring of vision. The final diagnostic method of diagnosis type 2

      <recruitment_details>62 subjects were recruited. The intention-to-treat (ITT) set comprised of all the subjects who completed V4. One subject joined another trial after recruitment while two other subjects dropped out in course of the trial. These three subjects were not included in the full analysis population. Finally, PP dataset comprised of n = 48.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Two subjects withdrew their consent quickly after giving it and were replaced so that the total number of recruited subjects was 62. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups using age and gender as the stratification factors. The randomization was performed using the software TRIALSYS (developed internally at Nestlé).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>HOMA at the begining of product intake</title>
          <description>Baseline HOMA (Homeostatic Model Assessment)index was evaluated at V1 (visit 1) scheduled 28 days after the screening visit (V0) without any chocolate intake. HOMA reflects the resistance to insulin and is obtained from glucose and insulin plasma concentrations at a given sampling timepoint, based on the following formula:
HOMA = Glucose (in mmol/L) X Insulin ( in mU/L)/ 22.5. Insulin resistance is defined by a HOMA index &gt; 2.4. The highest the HOMA index is, the more pronounced the resistance to insulin is.</description>
