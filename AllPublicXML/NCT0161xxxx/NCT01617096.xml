      A Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Safety and Effectiveness
      Trial of a Vaginal Matrix Ring Containing Dapivirine for the Prevention of HIV-1 Infection in
      Women.&quot; MTN-020 will enroll approximately 3676 sexually active HIVnegative women aged 18-45
      years randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a vaginal ring containing 25 mg of
      dapivirine or a placebo vaginal ring. Rings will be inserted once every 28 days for 12
      consecutive months. MTN expects to initiate this study in August 2012.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 through 45 years (inclusive) at screening, verified per site SOPs; within this
             range, sites may restrict the upper age limit per site SOPs, to target women at high
             risk of HIV infection

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and to take
             part in the study

          -  Able and willing to provide adequate locator information, as defined in site SOPs

          -  HIV-uninfected based on testing performed by study staff at screening and enrollment
             (per applicable algorithm in Appendix II)

          -  Per participant report, sexually active, defined as having vaginal intercourse at
             least once in the 3 months prior to screening

          -  Using an effective method of contraception at enrollment, and intending to use an
             effective method for the duration of study participation; effective methods include
             hormonal methods (except contraceptive ring); intrauterine device (IUD); and
             sterilization (of participant, as defined in site SOPs)

          -  At screening and enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies
             involving drugs, medical devices, vaginal products, or vaccines for the duration of
             study participation -- Note: Tampons may be used for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Per participant report at screening:

               -  Plans to travel away from the study site for more than 8 consecutive weeks during
                  study participation

          -  Is pregnant

             -- Note: A documented negative pregnancy test performed by study staff is required for
             inclusion; however a self-reported pregnancy is adequate for exclusion from the study.

          -  Currently breastfeeding

          -  Diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI)

             -- Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening are
             offered treatment and may be enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms have
             resolved. If treatment is completed and symptoms have resolved within 28 days of
             obtaining informed consent for screening, the participant may be enrolled.

          -  Diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease, an STI or reproductive tract infection
             (RTI) requiring treatment per current WHO guidelines

             -- Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed during screening with pelvic
             inflammatory disease or STI/RTI requiring treatment per WHO guidelines — other than
             asymptomatic BV and asymptomatic candidiasis — are offered treatment and may be
             enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms have resolved. If treatment is
             completed and symptoms have resolved within 28 days of obtaining informed consent for
             screening, the participant may be enrolled. Genital warts requiring treatment also
             must be treated prior to enrollment. Genital warts requiring therapy are defined as
             those that cause undue burden or discomfort to the participant, including bulky size,
             unacceptable appearance, or physical discomfort.

          -  Has a clinically apparent Grade 2 or higher pelvic exam finding (observed by study
             staff) as per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and
             Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August

                  non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.

               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may
                  be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary
                  severity grading or resolved. If improvement to a non-exclusionary grade or
                  resolution is documented within 28 days of providing informed consent for
                  screening, the participant may be enrolled.

               -  Platelet count Grade 1 or higher as per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading
                  the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004

                  2009)

                    -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test may be
                       re-tested during the screening process.

                    -  Note: Women with a documented normal result within the 12 months prior to
                       enrollment need not have Pap smear during the screening period. Women with a
                       Grade 1 abnormal Pap smear can be enrolled upon completion of the initial
                       phase of evaluation if no current treatment is indicated (based on local
                       standard of care for management of abnormal cervical cytology). Need for a
                       repeat Pap within 6 months does not preclude enrollment prior to that result
                       becoming available.

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives
