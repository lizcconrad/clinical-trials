  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out whether a nutritional supplement, called BioResponse-DIM
      (BR-DIM [oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane]), improves the survival for women who have
      residual cancer cells following surgery after chemotherapy for breast cancer. BR-DIM is an
      active ingredient in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts and cauliflower).
      Consumption of these vegetables has been associated with a decreased risk in several cancers.
      Researchers also hope to find out whether different biomarkers (also called &quot;markers&quot;) in the
      blood predict the chance of breast cancer returning. BR-DIM is thought to be effective in
      treating stage II-III breast cancer that is triple negative, AR positive (+), and where there
      is residual cancer cells in the breast after chemotherapy.

      Patients receive oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 1
      year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a histologically or pathologically confirmed diagnosis of triple
             negative, AR positive invasive breast carcinoma (stage II or III) who have received
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy (anthracycline or taxane or both) who have residual disease
             in their breasts following surgical resection by lumpectomy or mastectomy; androgen
             receptor (AR) testing will be performed on all patients who have residual invasive
             breast cancer after neoadjuvant taxane and/or anthracycline for triple negative breast
             cancer; this will be done under institutional protocol approval; physicians of
             patients who have AR positive tumors will be notified by our research coordinator of
             the potential eligibility for this study

          -  Participants must have undergone definitive surgery with negative margins for breast
             cancer in the past 2 years and must have residual pathologic invasive disease in the
             primary breast or lymph nodes or both; at the time of protocol entry it will be
             determined under good medical practice that there is no evidence for metastatic
             disease; patients should have completed all radiation therapy if indicated at the time
             of study entry

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2

                  increased risk of fetal harm including fetal death from the chemotherapeutic
                  agents; women of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have
                  agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of this trial

               -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
                  sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and

               -  Bilirubin =&lt; 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 5 x IULN

          -  Patients must not have a current active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Patients must not have had a cardiac event within 6 months prior to registration such
             as myocardial infarction (including severe/unstable angina), coronary/peripheral
             artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular
             accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism
