  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This sub-study to the E-30 is designed to collect vital signs, accelerometer and ECG data on
      subjects, and will consist of two phases. Phase 1 is designed to collect data in an Epilepsy
      Monitoring Unit (EMU) and Phase 2 is designed to collect data in an everyday (ambulatory)
      setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        (Phase 1)

          -  Subject be scheduled to participated in the E-30 parent study for a minimum of 48
             hours

          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy based on a prior EMU visit

        (Phase 1&amp;2)

          -  Subject is currently enrolled or previously participated in the E-30 study

          -  Subject must be 6 years of age or older

        (Sleep State: Optional)

          -  Subject must be 12 years of age

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in the E-30S sub-study and is willing to stay in a light
             controlled environment in the EMU for up to 120 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (Phase 1&amp;2)

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would affect
             his/her ability to participate in the sub-study.

          -  Subject who has implanted defibrillator, pacemaker or Vagus Nerve Stimulation TherapyÂ®
             (VNS) System

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects with severe psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator would
             prevent the subject's successful completion of the sub-study.

          -  Subjects 6 to 16 years of age with moderate/severe learning difficulties or those who
             may be at risk of self-harm.

          -  Subjects prescribed drugs specifically for a cardiac or autonomic disorder that in the
             investigator's opinion would affect heart rate response unless the patient has ictal
             tachycardia while taking said drugs. These include, but are not limited to, beta
             adrenergic antagonists (&quot;beta blockers&quot;).

          -  Subjects with cardiovascular arrhythmias or cardiac disease that would preclude the
             ability to detect intrinsic changes in heart rate due to activity, stress, or seizure.
             This would include but not be limited to chronic atrial fibrillation or chronotropic
             incompetence.

          -  Subjects with a history of dependence on alcohol or narcotic drugs within the past 2
             years as defined by DSM IV-R.

        (Sleep State: Optional)

          -  Subjects with a history if gastrointestinal disease (GI)or GI surgery

          -  Subjects with a history of difficulty swallowing

          -  Subjects with diabetes mellitus

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Subjects with planned MRI during EMU stay
