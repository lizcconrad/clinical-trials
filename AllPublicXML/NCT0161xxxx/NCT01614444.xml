  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will assess the efficacy of acupressure, a type of complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) in the Veteran population. Veterans with co-occurring mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be consented and
      randomly assigned to either an active or placebo acupressure treatment series of 8 sessions.
      The investigators will determine if acupressure affects aspects of day-to-day function, such
      as memory, sleep, mood, psychiatric health and stress resilience. This information will help
      identify potential treatment strategies to improve quality of life and overall function in
      this particular Veteran population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between the ages of 18-60

          -  Diagnosis of mild TBI and PTSD as assessed by interview and/or chart review

          -  Currently receiving or eligible to receive physical and/or mental healthcare through
             the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of other significant neurological disease (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
             multiple sclerosis etc.) as assessed by interview and/or chart review. Such conditions
             could affect outcome measures independently, thereby creating an experimental
             confound.

          -  History or diagnosis of lifetime moderate to severe TBI, as assessed by interview
             and/or chart review.

          -  History of psychotic disorder or bipolar I disorder as assessed by structured
             interview. Such conditions could affect outcome measures independently, thereby
             creating an experimental confound.

          -  Inability to read the informed consent document or adequately respond to questions
             regarding the informed consent procedure.

          -  Prior experience with acupressure, as this would result in individuals potentially
             being able to detect Placebo treatments if randomly assigned to that group.
