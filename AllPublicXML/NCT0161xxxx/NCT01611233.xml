  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DePuy Orthopaedics has issued a voluntary recall of the ASR hip replacement system due to a
      higher than expected revision rate reported in the England/Wales and Australian national
      joint registries. There are two types of ASR hip implants used for total hip replacement
      surgery:

        -  ASR XL Hip System

        -  ASR Hip Resurfacing System Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, USA is the
           study sponsor. MGH is conducting this study with the help of funding from DePuy
           Orthopaedics. MGH will collect and analyze clinical information from 5,000 subjects
           around the world. The countries include the United States of America, Australia, South
           Africa, England, Denmark, Finland and Sweden. MGH will collect and analyze blood test
           results, X-rays, soft tissue imaging and how well the ASR hips are functioning. MGH will
           analyze the data annually for 6 years.

      The purpose of this study is to follow patients who have the ASR hip system for the next 6
      years. The findings of this study may help surgeons to make better informed decisions about
      monitoring and treatment of patients with ASR hip systems.

      Description of the Subject Population:

        -  Adults who have previously undergone a surgery implanting the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular
           Hip System or ASR Hip Resurfacing System;

        -  ASR patients who are already being followed-up by their surgeon at least once a year.
           This routine follow-up care consists of a clinic visit, blood tests, X-rays and possibly
           an MRI, Ultrasound or CT scan.
