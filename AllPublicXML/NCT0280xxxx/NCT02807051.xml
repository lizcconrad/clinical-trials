  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-center, crossover, one-way, drug-interaction study to
      evaluate the effect of 500 mg clarithromycin BID (dosed to steady state) on the PK of a
      single 400-mg dose of pacritinib in healthy male and female subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, open-label, one-way crossover, drug-interaction study. On Day 1,
      subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib. On Day 8 through the morning of
      Day 12, following a 7-day washout period, 500-mg oral doses of clarithromycin were
      administered twice daily (BID), 8 to 12 hours apart. It was anticipated that steady-state
      concentrations of clarithromycin would be achieved by Day 12. On Day 12, a single oral 400-mg
      dose of pacritinib was co-administered with the final 500-mg dose of clarithromycin.
