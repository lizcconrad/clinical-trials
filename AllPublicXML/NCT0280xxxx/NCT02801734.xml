    <textblock>
      i. Project Background Patients with advanced lung cancer have a high symptom burden and low
      quality of life. Early palliative care improves patient outcomes in newly diagnosed advanced
      lung cancer patients, but previously tested models are not feasible for widespread adoption.
      Hence, the aim of this study is to pilot a more sustainable nurse-led intervention -
      Enhancing Quality of life in Patients (EQUIP).

      ii. Hypothesis / Aim The aims of this study are three-fold. Firstly, the investigators aim to
      determine the feasibility and acceptability of the EQUIP intervention itself. Secondly, the
      investigators aim to obtain a tentative estimate of efficacy of the EQUIP intervention.
      Thirdly, the investigators aim to determine the data completion rate of patient reported
      outcome measures in the context of the EQUIP trial.

      iii. Methods Patients with newly diagnosed stage 3 or stage 4 lung cancer will be recruited
      and randomized to the EQUIP intervention or usual care (control) group. Patients randomized
      to the EQUIP intervention group will receive four face-to-face sessions with a palliative
      care nurse. The content of these educational sessions will equip patients with the knowledge
      and skills to manage the three commonest symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness and anxiety.

      All participants will complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L),
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the stigma subscale at four time points:
      baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after recruitment. Measures of healthcare use will also be
      recorded. Additionally, participants in the intervention group will complete a feedback
      survey after each intervention session.

      A total sample of 60 patients (30 in each arm) will be recruited.

      Clinical Significance

      If successful, this study will lead to a larger scale phase III trial which tests various
      components of the EQUIP intervention, in order to develop a sustainable and effective model
      for the provision of palliative care to advanced lung cancer patients.
