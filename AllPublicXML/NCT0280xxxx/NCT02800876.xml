  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective study to evaluate the impact of computational wall stress analysis based on
      computed tomography (CT) of ruptured and not-ruptured aortic aneurysms as an additional
      predictor for rupture with dedicated software.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with known aortic aneurysm who received clinically indicated CT during a time
      period from 01/2004-12/2013 the CT data was evaluated with dedicated software, A4clinics,
      VASCOPS GmbH, Graz, Austria. The following parameters will be evaluated: exterior and luminal
      diameter, intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness, vessel-, luminal- and intraluminal thrombus
      volume, peak wall stress (PWS), peak wall rupture risk (PWRR), von Mises-stress and rupture
      risk-index in the ILT.
