  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the long term effects of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN-Suspension)
      probiotic bacteria administration on the number of both, bacterial and viral infections
      during the first 24 months of infant's life. Half of study participants will receive
      EcN-Suspension, while the other half will receive placebo. In an additional non-clinical
      explorative evaluation will furthermore be investigated whether the early intestinal
      colonization with E.coli strain Nissle 1917 affects the establishment of the intestinal
      microbiota.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the course of the present trial the participants will be observed during the first 24
      months of life, starting right after birth.

      All newborns meeting all inclusion criteria and non-fulfiling any exclusion criteria will be
      included into the trial. Each participant of this clinical trial will be randomly allocated
      to one of the two trial arms, by using the method of randomly permuted blocks.

      The newborns will be primarily treated during the first three weeks of life and re-treated
      after 6 and 12 months according to trial interventional plan.

      Data on the efficacy and safety will be recorded during control visits after first month, 6,
      12, 18 and 24 months.

      A follow-up examination of study participants will be performed two years after the end of
      the participation in the present trial (i.e. at an age of 48 months), during which each child
      will be examined for its normal physical and cognitive development (covered by the U8
      standardized examination). In addition data on allergic/atopic complaints or symptoms will be
      recorded.

      In an additional non-clinical explorative evaluation, it will furthermore be investigated
      whether the early intestinal colonization with E.coli strain Nissle 1917 affects the
      establishment of the intestinal microbiota. Therefore stool samples of study participants
      will be collected at an age of 24 and 48 months. The microbial composition of these samples
      will be characterized and compared between the two trial arms (EcN vs. placebo).
