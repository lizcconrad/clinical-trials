    <textblock>
      This prospective study aimed to determine the minimal level of Bispectral index needed for
      quality laryngoscopy before ear, nose and throat surgery in children.

      -  Children will received intra-rectal premedication based on midazolam 0.4mg

        -  Children will be monitored according to standard guidelines

        -  One blinded anesthesiologist will be in charge of anesthesia induction and the other one
           will be in charge of data collection (end tidal sevoflurane concentration, sevoflurane
           minimal alveolar concentration, bispectral index) and guidance of induction according to
           the predetermined bispectral index (up and down allocation)

    <description>After at least 4 minutes of stable inspired sevoflurane concentration, that concentration will be titrated to obtain a targeted bispectral index (BIS) level required for perform laryngoscopy. This level was initially set at 40, based on a preliminary study showing that such level of BIS was obtained at the laryngoscopy after common general anesthesia induction. For the next patients, BIS target was set according to a sequential allocation method (up and down).</description>
