      The aim of this phase 1 study is to determine the role of autologous adipose derived
      mesenchymal stem cells in the reduction of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula failure when
      applied during the time of surgical creation.

             extremity AV fistula with suitable anatomy

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior to surgery (Day 0)

          -  Other hematological and biochemical parameters within a range consistent with ESRD and
             acceptable for the administration of general anesthesia prior to day 1

          -  Ability to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, competence to give

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History or evidence of severe cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within 6 months
             of entry, ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring continuing treatment, or unstable
             angina

          -  Significant uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg)

          -  History or evidence of severe peripheral vascular disease in the upper limbs or known
             or suspected central vein obstruction on the side of planned fistula creation

          -  Stroke within six (6) months of study entry

          -  Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 6 months

          -  Immunodeficiency including AIDS / HIV or Active autoimmune disease

          -  Documented hypercoagulable state or history of 2 or more DVTs or other spontaneous

          -  Bleeding diathesis or Gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding, or wound dehiscence

          -  A prothrombin time or a partial thromboplastin time more than 1.2 times the upper
             limit of normal, or absolute platelet counts below the lower limit of normal; an
             absolute neutrophil count below 1,500/mm3

          -  Active local or systemic infection (WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3) or anemia with a hematocrit less

          -  Previous autogenous fistula in the operative limb unless the AVF can be placed more
             proximally than previous failed fistula or more than 1 failed AVF in the operative
             limb

          -  Known serious allergy to aspirin or penicillin

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug/ device within 60 days prior to study entry or
             Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AMSCs and the AVF

          -  Employees of the sponsor or patients who are employees or relatives of the
