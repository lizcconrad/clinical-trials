  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PICC (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) are commun used. Just one paper report
      morbidity with suture as fixation system for PICC (dislodgement, infection) In the guidelines
      it's recommended to use sutureless device. The devices actually used are unsatisfactory
      because of the high risk of migration, accidental removal.

      A new device, called KTFIX PLUS, seem to be more secure for PICC fixation and offer the
      possibility to simplify the after care. This device may stay on patient for 4 weeks. Others
      devices may be changed 1/week.

      The investigators aimed to compare morbidity between this new device and the old one. The
      investigators also want to perform an economic evaluation of this device and compare patient
      quality of life.
