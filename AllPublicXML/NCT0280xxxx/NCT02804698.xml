    <textblock>
      This project will look to improve standards of care for diabetic patients by evaluating a
      program that supports participants in making healthy lifestyle changes.

      The program consists of 13 educational sessions that contain information about the prevention
      and care of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, physical activity, nutrition, community
      health and emotional well being.

      Researchers propose to address extremely high rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and
      mortality in Sonora, Mexico through use of an evidence-based community health worker
      intervention for adult patients with diabetes who receive care at health centers operated by
      the Secretaría de Salud, an office of the Mexican government. Researchers will conduct a
      cluster-randomized trial with a total of 400 patients at 20 health centers to understand
      whether the 13-week educational intervention, Meta Salud Diabetes, can effectively reduce
      clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with
      diabetes. Researchers will also conduct an implementation study that will consist of
      systematic engagement of local, state and national decision makers to identify barriers,
      facilitators, and strategies to adopt and integrate community health worker-led
      cardiovascular disease prevention interventions throughout the 209 health centers in Sonora.

    <description>Attend the thirteen weekly educational classes and physical activity group (prior physician approval) that are part of the Meta Salud Diabetes program.
Allow the research staff to collect your cholesterol, glucose, A1c, triglyceride levels, as well as your blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip circumference.
Respond to a survey about your nutrition and physical activity habits on three separate occasions (at the start of the 13-week program, just after you finish the program, and nine months after you finish the program).
You may also be invited to participate in a follow-up interview, where you will be asked about your experience during and after the Meta Salud Diabetes program.</description>
