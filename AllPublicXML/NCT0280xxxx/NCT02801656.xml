  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) is a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality, caused by loss of healthy gut flora. Conventional treatment uses antibiotics to
      kill Clostridium difficile. A novel treatment uses replacement of gut flora by fecal
      microbiota transplant (FMT). Randomized trials have established safety and efficacy of FMT in
      recurrent CDAD, but no trial has used FMT for primary CDAD. This study will randomize
      patients to oral encapsulated FMT or oral Vancomycin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary CDAD will be approached for consent and randomized equally to two arms:
      oral FMT with oral Vancomycin placebo, or oral FMT placebo with oral Vancomycin. FMT will be
      prepared from anonymous donors screened according to Health Canada guidelines and stored
      frozen.
