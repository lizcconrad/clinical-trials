      This study was designed as a prospective controlled study to investigate the effects of
      probiotic support started immediately after birth on newborn jaundice in breastfed babies
      born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.

      Objectives: Enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin imposes an extra burden of approximately
      30% on total serum bilirubin levels. Intestinal microflora is the main factor affecting
      enterohepatic circulation. This study investigated the effects of probiotic support started
      immediately after birth on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in babies born by normal spontaneous
      vaginal delivery and breastfed only.

      Methods: A total of 150 healthy term newborns were included in the study and allocated in the
      study and control groups. Immediately after birth, newborns in the study group received
      probiotic in liquid drop form (Maflor® drops containing Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG 109 Colony
      Forming Units(CFU), Mamsel Pharmaceuticals, Turkey), at a dose of 5 drops a day orally for 10
      days. Newborns in the control group received 5 drops of saline solution per day orally,
      instead. In addition to routine biochemical examinations;serum bilirubin levels in the cord
      blood, and blood samples of the newborns on the 3rd, 5th and 10th days of birth were measured
      in all subjects in both groups. Defecation frequency was recorded for all subjects.
