    <textblock>
      Coronary arterial disease is a risk factor for bariatric surgery and might be a predictor for
      later major adverse coronary events. Diagnosis of coronary arterial disease would thus be
      desirable for obese patients, however percutaneous angiography is an invasive procedure and
      associated with a certain morbidity in obese patients. In this study the investigators would
      like to assess whether dual source CT angiography can be used for diagnosis of coronary
      arterial disease in severely obese patients and which settings yield the best image quality.

      Obesity is a major health problem in many countries and a major risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. Extreme obesity can be treated with surgery, however these procedures
      are associated with a certain surgery-related morbidity which increases with comorbidities,
      in particular coronary diseases. Thus, preoperative cardiac risk assessment would be
      desirable, however percutaneous coronary angiography is an invasive procedure with problems
      and complications in obese patients. A non-invasive alternative would be coronary
      dual-.source CT angiography (CCTA), however little experience exists in the application of
      CCTA in morbid obese patients. This study would like to address the following issues:

        1. Comparison of image quality of coronary CT angiography using a dual source CT from obese
           patients using a special protocol (140 kV, 350 mAs) with images from historical controls
           from normal weight patients with a standard protocol (120 kV, 330 mAs).

        2. Prediction of major adverse coronary events. Patients with a coronary stenosis in CCTA
           will be followed for any major adverse coronary events (details see Outcomes)

        3. Is it possible to detect myocardial fat by a reduced CT density. Images from obese
           patients will be compared to historical controls from normal patients. Furthermore, is
           the myocardial CT density correlated with the BMI of obese patients?

        4. Optimisation of scan protocol. Increasing the scanning angle beyond the standard 90°
           will reduce the signal noise at the cost of temporal resolution. Various scanning angles
           with be tested for an optimal combination of signal noise and temporal resolution.

        5. Does the long QT-syndrome improve after bariatric surgery? It is assumed that the long
           QT-syndrome is a consequence of fattening of the myocardia. Is it possible to see a
           reduction of myocardial fattening and thus an improvement of the long QT-syndrome with
           CT during the follow-up after bariatric surgery?

    <description>Coronary arteries (with at least 1 mm diameter at their origin) were segmented according to the 15-segment model of the American Heart Association (Austen 1975). Subjective image quality was judged for each coronary artery segment on a 4-point scale (Leschka 2007) :
= excellent;
= good, minor artifacts;
= fair, moderate artifacts but still diagnostic;
= non-diagnostic</description>

    <measure>coronary artery stenosis</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant coronary artery stenosis was defined as more than 50% narrowing of luminal diameter. Stenosis assessment was performed by a radiologist not involved in image quality assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Image noise</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Image noise was determined as the standard deviation of the attenuation value in a region of 1 sq cm that was placed in the ascending aorta. The average of the attenuation in the left and right coronary artery were used for further calculations.</description>

    <measure>Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</measure>

    <measure>contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Vessel contrast was calculated as the difference in the mean attenuation (in Hounsfield units) between the contrast-enhanced vessel lumen and the mean attenuation in the adjacent perivascular tissue. Attenuations were measured in a region in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery and in the left main artery, and were defined as large as possible, whereas avoiding calcifications and plaques. CNR was calculated as vessel contrast divided by image noise (Husmann 2006, Lembcke 2004).</description>
