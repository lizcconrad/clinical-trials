      This study evaluates the efficacy of Prasugrel and Ticagrelor in the treatment of acute
      myocardial infarction.

      Study objectives:

        1. Compare the efficacy and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor in acute myocardial
           infarction treated with emergent PCI.

        2. Assess the safety of switching to clopidogrel after remission of the acute phase of MI
           in patients for whom economic barriers do not allow to continue treatment with prasugrel
           or ticagrelor. All randomized patients with acute myocardial infarction have been
           treated with standard therapeutic procedures in accordance with the guidelines of
           European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Participation of patients in the study is not
           connected to any deviations from the ESC guidelines recommendations.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite primary outcome measure consisting of Death / Re-infarction / Stroke / Serious bleeding requiring transfusion or prolonged hospitalization / Urgent Target Vessel Revascularization.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after Randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Definitions:
Death defined as summary of death from any cause. Re-infarcion defined according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.
Stroke defined as the rapid onset of new neurological deficit caused by an ischemic or hemorrhagic central nervous system event with symptoms that lasted at least 24 hours after onset or leading to death.
Urgent Target Vessel Revascularization defined as a new emergent/urgent revascularization of the vessel dilated at the initial procedure driven by recurrent signs of ischemia occurring after completion of initial PCI.
Units: The percentage of randomized patients is the total number of randomized patients experiencing Death / Re-infarction / Stroke / Serious bleeding requiring transfusion or prolonged hospitalization / Urgent Target Vessel Revascularization divided by number of randomized patients in the treatment arm multiplied by 100.
Primary endpoint is adjudicated by the Independent Control committee</description>

    <measure>Composite secondary outcome measure consisting of Cadiovascular death / Non-fatal myocardial infarction / Stroke.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days and one year after Randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Definition:
Cardiovascular death defined as a death with a demonstrable cardiovascular cause, or any death that is not clearly attributable to a non-cardiovascular cause.
Non-fatal myocardial infarction must be distinct from the index event and is defined according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.
Units: The percentage of randomized patients is the total number of randomized patients experiencing Cadiovascular death / Non-fatal myocardial infarction / Stroke divided by number of randomized patients in the treatment arm multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Stent thrombosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days and one year after Randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Definition: Academic Research Consortium (ARC) criteria were used to define ST. Units: The percentage of randomized patients is the total number of randomized patients experiencing Stent thrombosis divided by number of randomized patients in the treatment arm multiplied by 100.</description>
