      The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of maternal malaria on child growth in the
      two first years of life in relation to fetal growth.

      This study is following a birth cohort of children born to pregnant women enrolled in the
      study &quot;Impact of malaria infection in pregnancy on fetal and newborn growth&quot; (protocol OXTREC
      14 08 and Mahidol 2009-003-01). In this cohort growth monitoring is conducted until 2 years
      of age using routine anthropometric measurements such as weight, length, arm and head
      circumference. A few additional tests will enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes with
      minimal risk. These tests will include anthropometry, screening, nutrition questionnaire and
      neurodevelopmental assessment.

      This is an existing on-going prospective birth cohort of children born to the pregnant women
      who had fetal growth assessed during pregnancy. In this cohort an expected 10% of pregnant
      women will be exposed to malaria while the remaining will be free of malaria. Their offspring
      are already followed up for growth monitoring from birth until 2 years of age with
      anthropometric measurements including weight, length, arm and head circumference at each
      scheduled visit. The investigator would like to enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes
      with minimal risk for the child by proposing the following anthropometric and screening
      tests, nutrition questionnaire, and neurodevelopment assessment. In addition a prospective
      cohort of children born after study approval will be followed on both protocols. The
      additional measure include:

        -  Body fat composition (at birth, and monthly up to 4 months unless weight â‰¥ 8kg)

        -  Triceps and subscapular skinfold (at 1 and 2 years)

        -  Anemia, malaria and soil-transmitted helminths screening (every 3 months in first 12
           months and 6-monthly 1-2 years)

        -  Buccal swab (at 1 and 2 years)

        -  Neurodevelopment (every 6 months)

        -  Food questionnaire (at 1 and 2 years)

        Participants in a current birth cohort. For those pregnant women who have not yet delivered
        (circa n=25), permission for their unborn child to commence participation after delivery
        will be conducted after ethical approval has been received. For those children who have
        already been born in the existing birth cohort and less than 2 years of age an invitation
        to participate will be proposed to the parent or legal guardian after ethical approval has
        been granted.
