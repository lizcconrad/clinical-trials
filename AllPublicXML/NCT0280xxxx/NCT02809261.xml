  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration. Recently, the ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose was
      widely used for entrapment neuropathy with positive benefit. However, current studies have
      not entirely proved the effects of perineural injection on peripheral neuropathy because
      these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. The
      investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after
      ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose in patients with CTS.

    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with CTS were
      randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received
      one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose and control group
      received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with normal saline. No additional
      treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog
      scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire
      (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of
      the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as
      well as on the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24th week after the treatment.
