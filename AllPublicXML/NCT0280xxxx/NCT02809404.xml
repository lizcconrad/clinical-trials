  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus shows a large interpatient variability with fixed dose administration. These very
      different exposure levels between individuals can result in supratherapeutic or
      subtherapeutic exposure levels and consequently in over- or undertreatment, respectively.
      Dose individualization based on the measured drug concentration could theoretically result in
      less toxicity and more efficacy.

      Nowadays everolimus exposure is determined by everolimus concentration in whole blood.
      Therefore, a vena puncture is always necessary. This is invasive and requires patients to
      come to the hospital. It would be convenient for patients to have their everolimus blood
      concentration determined by dried blood spot (DBS) analysis. With DBS only a single drop of
      blood from the finger is necessary, which can be done at home and sent by regular mail for
      analysis. Previous studies have shown the feasibility of this approach. In patients with
      cancer treated with everolimus 10mg once daily, the correlation between everolimus DBS
      concentrations and whole blood concentration is yet unknown. Therefore, the investigators
      want to determine the everolimus concentration collected with DBS from a finger prick with
      everolimus concentration from whole blood and everolimus concentration collected with DBS
      from whole blood.

      In addition, possibly a relatively high everolimus concentration in saliva could be
      correlated with the incidence and severity of oral mucositis. Determination of drug
      concentration in saliva has also been proven to be feasible before.

      Therefore, in this study the investigators want to determine whether the everolimus
      concentration in saliva correlates with the incidence of oral mucositis and how everolimus
      concentration in saliva correlates with everolimus concentration in whole blood.
