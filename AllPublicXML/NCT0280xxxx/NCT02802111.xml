      Albuterol is the most commonly used β agonist to treat reversible lower airway obstruction.
      Albuterol contains a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Levalbuterol contains the single R
      form enantiomer. Levalbuterol is frequently prescribed to limit cardiovascular toxicity. The
      investigators sought to examine the changes in oxygen consumption (V'O2) and Heart Rate (HR)

    <textblock>
      Inhaled β2 adrenoceptor agonists are frequently used to treat reversible lower airway
      obstruction, or to assist with mucociliary clearance. Albuterol remains the most commonly
      used β agonist and contains a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. The R enantiomer is the
      active moiety responsible for the bronchodilation, while the S enantiomer was initially
      thought to be inactive, although recent studies suggest otherwise. Levalbuterol contains the
      single R form enantiomer, and in clinical practice it is frequently prescribed not only
      because of its bronchodilator benefits, but to limit cardiovascular toxicity. Adverse
      cardiovascular effects remain the main dose-limiting factor for β2 agonists. The primary
      objective of the investigators study is to compare the change in oxygen consumption following
      albuterol to that of levalbuterol, in healthy adult volunteers. The investigators
      hypothesized there would be no clinically significant difference in V'O2 between the two
      drugs, if equal doses of the R-enantiomer were administered. Secondary objectives were to
      compare the changes in heart rate and other vital signs between the two drugs.
