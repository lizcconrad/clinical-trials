  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring sensitive epithelial
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations invariably develop acquired resistance to EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Identification of actionable genetic mutations can be
      helpful for guiding the subsequent treatment. This study aimed to analyze the genetic profile
      of NSCLC harboring acquired resistance to the first-generation EGFR TKIs using next
      generation sequencing (NGS).
