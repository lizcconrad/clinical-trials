      Home visiting programs for pregnant women aiming to improve mother-infant relationship has
      received worldwide attention in the past 30 years. These programs are considered an important
      strategy to improve women's health during pregnancy, aside from improving child's birthing
      conditions and allowing parents access to tools which will nurture and properly stimulate
      their baby, thus promoting emotional and cognitive development. Objectives: The &quot;Nurse home
      visitation program for pregnant youth&quot; aims to promote infant´s healthy development, from
      pregnancy to the first months of life, in a high-risk population. Methods: Eighty young
      pregnant women aged between 14 and 20 years were randomly allocated to the intervention or to
      usual prenatal care program. The &quot;Nurse home visitation program for pregnant youth&quot; was
      developed based on Albert Bandura's theory of self-efficacy, on Urie Bronfenbrenner´s
      bioecological model, which recognizes the importance of individual and family inclusion in
      various contexts of social life, on John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth evolutionary theories of
      attachment, which involves the care practitioner addressing issues such as environmental
      health, life course and parenting, bond between mother and infant, and infant´s social and
      cognitive development. Neuropsychomotor development will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months
      using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development. Brain development will be assessed via
      electroencephalography at 6 and 12 months.
