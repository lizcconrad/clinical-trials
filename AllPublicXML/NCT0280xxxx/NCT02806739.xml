  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of randomizing pregnant women at high
      risk for gestational diabetes to a 24-week period of soy food consumption. This study will
      also examine the effects of soy protein and isoflavones on glucose metabolism and lipid
      levels among pregnant women at high risk for gestational diabetes, and on child's weight and
      height at birth and 6 weeks of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from animal studies, human observational studies, and some randomized controlled
      trials has suggested that soy protein and isoflavones have beneficial effects on lipid and
      glucose metabolism. Additionally, soy isoflavones can diffuse across the placenta, enter
      fetal circulation and potentially reduce the susceptibility to cardiometabolic disorders in
      adulthood. Given the high prevalence of GDM and its serious health consequences for women and
      their children, and likely health benefits of soy protein and isoflavones on a panel of
      metabolic parameters, the role of maternal supplementation of soy protein and isoflavones for
      prevention of GDM and/or minimization of GDM severity in mothers and for improving health
      indicators in their offspring merits investigation.

      This study will provide new and essential information about the efficacy and feasibility of
      using soy-based whole foods to prevent and manage gestational diabetes development. This
      study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Forty pregnant women at high risk for
      gestational diabetes will be recruited from the obstetrics services at the Melrose Wakefield
      Hospital and Tufts Medical Center, and randomized to receive soy-based foods or minimize soy
      intake, from the 16th gestational week to birth. To measure participants' compliance with the
      treatment, the study will use three methods: (1) monthly telephone interview about adherence
      to the treatment; (2) daily soy food intake log; and (3) serum isoflavone concentrations. To
      evaluate the effects of soy supplementation on GDM, the study will collect blood samples to
      measure glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ). The study will also
      measure weight and body composition of participating pregnant women and the participants'
      respective children's weight, length and body composition.
