      The COPD Patient-Powered Research Network (COPD PPRN) is a patient research registry with the
      goal of enrolling 75,000 or more COPD patients and those at risk who are willing to share
      their heath information over several years and participate in research. The COPD PPRN has
      built an online platform to allow volunteers to enroll electronically, complete surveys, be
      contacted about studies they qualify for and become connected to COPD resources. The goal of
      the registry is to speed research to find better treatments for COPD and ultimately a cure.
