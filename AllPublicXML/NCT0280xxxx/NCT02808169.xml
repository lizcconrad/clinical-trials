      Evaluate the accuracy of Radlink System in determining acetabular cup placement and limb
      length evaluation during Anterior hip replacement as measured intraoperative with C-Arm

      Evaluate the accuracy of Radlink System in determining acetabular cup placement and limb
      length evaluation during Anterior hip replacement as measured intraoperative with C-Arm
      visualization and confirmed with digital x-ray at 4-6 weeks postoperatively.

      GPS may improve total hip replacement by allowing surgeons to measure the exact position of
      components placed during surgery and there is a question whether RADLINK helps surgeons place
      the acetabular cup (the part that goes into the hip bone) component in a precise position.
      The objective of the study is to determine whether GPS gives surgeons reliable, valid
      information about the orientation of the cup component. The surgeons need to collect data to
      help clarify this issue.
