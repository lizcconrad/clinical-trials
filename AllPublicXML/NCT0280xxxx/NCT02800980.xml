  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic lymphocele (LC) can be a complication after pelvic and para-aortic
      lymphadenectomy performed for treatment or staging purposes in the management of some
      cancers. Management procedures are: single or repeated puncture, prolonged drainage with
      drains or catheters, mostly followed by sclerotherapy, or surgery. A decision, which
      management option is most optimal, should be guided by two principles: first to control
      patient's symptoms, second to apply the least invasive but effective way to treat LC, taking
      into account that the patient has undergone major surgery recently, and often needs adjuvant
      treatment at the moment when symptomatic LC is diagnosed.

      The aim of this study is to validate feasibility, safety and efficacy of a minimally invasive
      management of a symptomatic LC - drainage with the usage of vascular catheter followed by
      sclerotherapy, as well as to evaluate patient's experience on the treatment.

      Patients with symptomatic LC are evaluated with ultrasound. Data about diameters, estimated
      volume of LC and other organs failure if appear is recorded. Management options are discussed
      with patient, and if the method with catheter insertion and drainage is chosen than the
      patient is eligible for the study. After vascular catheter insertion into LC and fluid
      evacuation, patient is followed with active drainage. Patients with drainage only are
      observed for a short period of time (up to 7 days), and if not efficient a sclerotherapy is
      considered. In case a patient does not agree to sclerotherapy, or there are
      contraindications, or it is doctor's decision that drainage alone is sufficient, than the
      prolonged drainage without sclerotherapy is the only procedure. The choice about the regimen
      used for sclerotherapy, it's volume, time intervals between repeated infusion depend on
      institution practice.

      Data concerning feasibility, safety and efficacy are noted in designated templates. Patients'
      experience on the treatment is evaluated with formal questionnaire FACIT-TS-G.

      The study is observational. Primary outcome measure is to establish efficacy of the method.
      Secondary outcome measures are safety and patient's experience on the treatment.

      Investigators hope to establish step-by-step guidelines for optimal, minimally invasive
      management of symptomatic lymphocele.
