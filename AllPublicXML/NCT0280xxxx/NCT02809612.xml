  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia is a very common but vastly under-diagnosed and under-treated gynaecological
      condition that leads to extreme suffering for both the women involved but also their
      partners. It has also been shown to be associated with poor quality of life, leading to
      depression and anxiety states. When left untreated, the condition takes a very long time to
      resolve, with a substantial associated disability and suffering. Both psycho-education and
      internet-based interventions have been shown to be highly successful while they can be quite
      affordable. This makes them highly cost-effective. The present study aims at evaluating the
      effectiveness of such an intervention among a vulvodynia patient population from the clinics
      of Uppsala, Falun, Orebro and Gävle. The patients will be recruited by treating physicians
      and given access to the internet-based platform, where they will fill out questionnaires
      during four different time-points, after randomization to the control or the intervention
      group. The intervention group will also have access to multiple activities and information
      material uploaded in the internet-based platform. Differences in pain, quality of life and
      mental health parameter outcomes will be assessed at the end of the study. Should this
      intervention prove effective, it will be implemented in clinical praxis in the four regions.

    <description>Patients randomized to the internet-based intervention will be given access to the information in the internet-based platform directly after randomization. During the first 6 weeks, information will be offered in a structured way, with a &quot;theme&quot; changing weekly. After this time-point, the patients will have the possibility to navigate through all information. The platform encompasses internet-based training including information on the disorder, psycho-education and information of simple self-implemented intervention strategies cope with vulvodynia and ameliorate dyspareunia. The platform will also include videos where team members will describe their role in treating patients with the disorder, but also short videos from former patients willing to share their individual stories.</description>
