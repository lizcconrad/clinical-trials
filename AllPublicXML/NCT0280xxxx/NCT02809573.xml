  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this dose-escalation study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      treatment with Chidamide in a range of doses combined with CHOP in fixed dose in patients
      with newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety include adverse events,
      vital signs, laboratory tests, etc., of a range of doses of chidamide combined with CHOP in
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients, and to determine the dose limit toxicity and the maximum

    <description>Lead-in period is 4 days. Patients take a single dose of Chidamide tablet, then off for 3 days before the first cycle begins. In the subsequent treatment cycles, Chidamide tablets are given orally on Day 1,4,8 and 11 of each cycle. Cyclophosphamide, adriacin and vincristine are given in intravenous infusion on Day 1. On Day 1 to 5, prednisone is given orally. Treatment cycles are repeated every 3 weeks .The combination therapy lasts for at most 6 cycles. Patients enter the single agent therapy if attained complete response after 6-cycle combination therapy. In this stage, patients take chidamide orally on Day 1, 4, 8 and 11 of each cycle.</description>
