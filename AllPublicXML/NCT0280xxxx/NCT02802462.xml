  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas hypoxic stress causes
      vascular endothelial dysfunction. Monocyte- derived endothelial progenitor cells (Mon-EPCs)
      contribute to vascular repair process by differentiating into endothelial cells. This study
      investigates how high-intensity interval (HIT) and moderate intensity-continuous (MCT)
      exercise training affect circulating Mon-EPC levels and EPC functionality under hypoxic
      condition. Sixty healthy sedentary males were randomized to engage either HIT (3-minute
      intervals at 40% and 80%VO2max , n=20) or MCT (sustained 60%VO2max , n=20) for 30
      minutes/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks, or to a control group that did not received exercise
      intervention (n=20). Mon-EPC characteristics and EPC functionality under hypoxic exercise
      (HE, 100W under 12%O 2 ) were determined before and after various interventions.
