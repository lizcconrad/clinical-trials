  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brucellosis, also known as Mediterranean fever, undulant fever, or Malta fever is a zoonotic
      disease caused by Brucella infection.With the rapid development of animal husbandry and
      aquaculture and increasing consumption of dairy products in urban residents, the incidence of
      this disease in Inner Mongolia and even in the mainland area of China is significantly
      increased.

      The disease can damage multiple systems including nervous system, circulatory system,
      reproductive system and bone joints, etc. The sooner the diagnosis of brucellar spondylitis
      is diagnosed and treated, the better will be the prognosis of the patients which can prevent
      the development of severe complications and diminish the need for surgical therapy. Thus the
      early diagnosis of brucellar spondylitis was of great significance.We quantitatively analyzed
      the brucellar spondylitis with DCE-MRI to explore the application of DCE-MRI in the early
      diagnosis of brucellar spondylitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 100 patients with Brucellosis were conducted with conventional MRI and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI(DCE-MRI) scan. The variations of the value of ktrans（endothelial
      transfer constant），kep（reflux rate）,Ve(fractional extracellular fluid space volume) and
      Vp(fractional plasma volume) between the vertebral lesions,Early lesions of vertebral body
      and normal tissues were measured and compared. And under the receiver operating
      characteristic（ROC） curve analysis,we will calculate the sensitivity and specificity of
      Ktrans,Kep,Ve and Vp in the diagnosis and early diagnosis of brucella spondylitis .The values
      of Ktrans,Kep,Ve and Vp will be studied between the vertebral lesions and normal tissues, the
      early lesions of vertebral body and normal tissues.The sensitivity and specificity of both
      parameters (Ktrans、Kep、Ve、Vp)will be done.The valve of DCE-MRI in the diagnosis and early
      diagnosis of the brucella spondylitis will be analysed.
