  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a posterior malleolar fracture were recruited and assigned to the direct
      reduction (DR) group or the indirect reduction (IR) group. Following reduction and fixation
      of the fracture, the quality of fracture reduction was evaluated in radiograph and CT images.
      Functional outcome was evaluated at the last follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Patients with a posterior malleolus fracture were recruited meeting the inclusion criteria of
      unstable and displaced posterior malleolar fractures requiring surgical management. Patients
      with open fractures or pathological fractures were excluded. Preoperative anteroposterior
      (AP), lateral, and mortise view radiographs as well as computed tomography (CT) scans were
      routinely obtained to evaluate the characteristic of the fracture. Patients were then
      assigned to the direct reduction (DR) group or the indirect reduction (IR) group. Following
      reduction and fixation of the fracture using the direct reduction technique or the indirect
      reduction technique, the quality of fracture reduction was evaluated in radiograph and CT
      images. Functional outcome,including AOFAS score, ankle range of motion were evaluated at the
      last follow-up.

    <description>Intervention: The posterior and lateral malleoli were accessed via a posterolateral approach with the patients in prone position. The fibular fracture was exposed and reduced anatomically in the first place. The posterior malleolus was then exposed between the fiexor halluces longus and peroneus longus interval. The posterior malleolar fragment was then reduced with reference to the typical metaphyseal-diaphyseal spike of the posterior malleolus. One-third tubular plate, reconstruction plate, or distal radius plate were applied spanning the fracture in a buttress mode. Cannulated screws could also be used.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Intervention: After open reduction and internal fixation of lateral and medial malleolar fractures, the posterior malleolus was then reduced through ligamentotaxis with the ankle in dorsiflexion. One or two 4.0 mm cannulated screws were used to fix the posterior malleolar in anterior-to-posterior direction.</description>
