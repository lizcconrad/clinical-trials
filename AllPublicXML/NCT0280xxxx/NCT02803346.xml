  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic syndromes (systemic inflammatory response associated with infection) remain a major
      although largely under-recognized health care problem and represent the first cause of
      mortality in intensive care units. While it has long been known that sepsis deeply perturbs
      immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic inflammatory response, novel findings
      indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex immunologic response that varies over
      time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a
      resultant, after a short pro-inflammatory phase, septic patients enter a stage of protracted
      immunosuppression. This is illustrated in those patients by reactivation of dormant viruses
      (CMV or HSV) or infections due to pathogens, including fungi, which are normally pathogenic
      solely in immunocompromised hosts. These alterations might be directly responsible for
      worsening outcome in patients who survived initial resuscitation as nearly all immune
      functions are deeply compromised. Both arms of immunity (innate and adaptive) are indeed
      markedly suppressed (including enhanced leukocyte apoptosis, lymphocyte anergy and
      deactivated monocyte functions). New promising therapeutic avenues are currently emerging
      from those recent findings such as adjunctive immunostimulation for the most immunosuppressed
      patients. The prerequisite for immunostimulation administration (IFNg, GM-CSF, IL-7) however
      relies on the investigators capacity in identifying the patients who could benefit from it,
      as there is no clinical sign of immune dysfunctions. The main objectives are:

        1. to identify the best biomarkers for sepsis-induced immunosuppression and

        2. to evaluate ex vivo whether drugs could rejuvenate immune functions.
