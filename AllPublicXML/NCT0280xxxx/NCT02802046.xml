    <textblock>
      Angina pectoris is the most common clinical manifestation of coronary heart disease（CHD）,
      which is the main feature of chest pain caused by transient myocardial ischemia. Chronic
      stable angina pectoris is the degree, frequency, nature and cause of angina pectoris in
      patients with no significant change in a few weeks. The disease incidence is complex,
      difficult to diagnosis and treatment, clinical should be combined with various inspection
      methods for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Fractional flow reserve of computerized
      tomographic scanning (FFRCT ) allows computerized tomographic scanning（CT） to scan the
      determination of coronary blood flow and blood pressure in the heart at rest and hyperemia,
      but no need to additional check or drugs. This technique has been used for noninvasive
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) in the calculation, assuming normal artery, calculated by the
      ratio of the maximum blood flow and blood flow of coronary artery stenosis of an artery.
      Along with the development and progress of computational fluid dynamics, in the resting state
      by computed tomographic angiography of coronary artery(CCTA) image data based, simulation of
      coronary artery maximal hyperemia and according to the 3-dimensional model of the traditional
      method of reconstruction of coronary arterial tree and ventricular muscle structure, and in
      order to calculated coronary blood flow and pressure. FFRCT is a novel non-invasive
      examination method, using computed tomographic angiography of coronary artery image data can
      be calculated FFR, and preliminary study proved that it has a high degree of correlation with
      traumatic FFR. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the correlation between the degree of
      coronary stenosis and the grading of angina pectoris by noninvasive means --FFRCT, in order
      to provide a new idea for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of coronary heart disease.
