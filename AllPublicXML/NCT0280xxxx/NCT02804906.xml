  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot feasibility study will test whether a home-based cardiac rehabilitation
      intervention, using physical therapist visits combined with mobile health technology, will
      prevent decline in high-risk patients post acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Participants
      will be randomized to either an intervention arm (home-based physical therapy), or a control
      (usual care) arm. Prior to discharge, participants in the intervention arm will receive a
      1-hour educational session by a research physical therapist that includes information on
      cardiac risk factor management, postoperative recovery, education on medication adherence,
      and a prescription for home exercise that is tailored to each patient's baseline abilities
      and limitations. Participants assigned to the control arm will receive a 30-minute counseling
      session on risk factor modification prior to discharge, in addition to usual care post-AMI.

      All participants enrolled in this research study will receive the FDA-approved FitBit Flex, a
      wearable activity monitoring device which will objectively measure physical activity and
      sedentary behavior in the period post-hospital discharge. Daily activity monitoring will
      include: number of steps, distance traveled, calories burned, number of active minutes.

    <description>Participants will be visited by a physical therapist 3 times a week for approximately 1 hour each day, for a duration of 4 weeks. These visits will serve to encourage adherence to the intervention, reinforce activities recommended at discharge, monitor safety under direct supervision, and adjust the exercise prescription if/as needed (e.g. advance recommended activity level) if necessary. Patients will also be provided with a tablet computer device installed with software, Moving Analytics, that will reinforce the cardiac rehabilitation program through daily reminders and easily accessible visual activity plans. This program will be updated by the physical therapist during home visits as the program advances. Daily patient-reported health status (&quot;Your Activities of Daily Living&quot;) 26 will be ascertained on the same tablet device by participants three times per week using open source software designed.</description>
