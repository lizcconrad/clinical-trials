  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a well-recognized neurodevelopmental disorder severely affecting the health of
      children. While the unclear neurobiological basis of autism and the lack of effective
      medication, the most commonly used approach for treatment is behavioral intervention.
      However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the intervention therapy remains
      incompletely understood. The current project aims to explore the impacts of different early
      behavioral intervention methods on brain plasticity of autism using multimodal MRI technique
      and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating the
      efficiency of these methods.

      Autism is a well-recognized neurodevelopmental disorder severely affecting the health of
      children. While the unclear neurobiological basis of autism and the lack of effective
      medication, the most commonly used approach for treatment is behavioral intervention.
      However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the intervention therapy remains
      incompletely understood. The current project aims to explore the impacts of different early
      behavioral intervention methods on brain plasticity of autism using multimodal MRI technique
      and provide guidelines for the intervention and treatment of autism by evaluating the
      efficiency of these methods. Investigators first investigate longitudinal effect of
      behavioral intervention on brain structure and function in children with autism. In addition,
      investigators provide new biological indexes upon multimodal large-scale brain connectomes to
      evaluate the curative effect of intervention. Finally, investigators propose a prediction
      model of intervention effect based on multimodal multivariate pattern analysis methods.
      Furthermore, investigators expect to map the state-of-the-art biomarkers on multi-modal
      networks to provide a new interpretation of pathophysiological mechanisms of autism.

    <description>First, classify autism individuals into effective treatment group and ineffective treatment group according to the intervention effect at 6 months. Second, conduct feature selection with Sparse optimization algorithms and cluster analysis on MRI data. Third, design optimized classifiers integrated support vector machines and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers.</description>
