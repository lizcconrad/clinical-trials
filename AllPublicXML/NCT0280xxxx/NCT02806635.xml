      This study investigates the effectiveness of www.OurRelationship.com, which provides
      self-help, web-based programs to improve romantic relationships and related outcomes. Couples
      will be randomly assigned to complete the OurRelationship program, the PREP Online program,
      or a wait-list control group and followed for six months.

      Nationwide, lower-income (LI) couples (those with household incomes &lt;200% of the federal
      poverty level) - many of whom are also African American, Hispanic/Latino, or rural couples -
      face numerous challenges to their relationships. Chief amongst those challenges are: 1)
      higher risk of relationship problems and 2) lack of access to effective relationship services
      to prevent or intervene with relationship distress. Compared to higher-income couples, LI
      married and cohabiting couples are significantly more likely to divorce or separate and
      report lower relationship quality. Unfortunately, LI couples are least likely to receive
      interventions to prevent or solve relationship problems. To overcome these barriers, we
      propose to test the effectiveness of two effective web-based curricula - OurRelationship and
      PREP Online.

      A total of 850 LI couples will be recruited nationwide and randomly assigned to the PREP
      Online program, the OurRelationship program, or a wait-list control group and followed for
      six months. Once randomly assigned to group, couples will be assessed at one month, two
      months, four months, and six months following randomization. After couples randomized to the
      wait-list control group finish their waiting period, they will be able to select the program
      they would like to complete (OurRelationship or ePREP) but will not complete research
      assessments during or following their participation in the program. Interested couples can
      find out more information (and sign up for the study) at www.OurRelationship.com

    <description>The OurRelationship program is based on Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy and encourages couples to select, understand, and solve a relationship problem. Partners complete the majority of the web-based program on their own and come together for three key conversations with their partner. The first conversation between partners centers on discussing possible core relationship issues and jointly deciding on the problem(s) to focus on during the program. During the second conversation, both partners' previous written responses are displayed on the screen and conversation is encouraged. During the final conversation, couples share their strategies to decrease stress, improve patterns of communication, and engage in problem-solving exercises specific to their core issue(s).</description>

    <description>The PREP Online program is based on the in-person Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program. The PREP Online program consists of seven sections of material. In each section, new information and skills are presented, videos demonstrate real couples practicing the skills, participants are encouraged to discuss the information in the context of their own relationship, and a multiple choice quiz reiterates and summarizes the section. In addition to the core educational materials, couples are asked to complete six additional online and offline homework assignments (one per week), each lasting approximately one hour.</description>
