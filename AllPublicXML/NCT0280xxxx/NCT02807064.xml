    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing the efficacy of supplementation with a mixture of three
      bifidobacteria , on the allergic rhinitis..The rhinitis symptoms were assessed by validated
      score ( TSS ) , for children aged between 4 and 17 years with allergic rhinitis parietaria ,
      mild , moderate or severe , than children not supplemented .

      Secondary Objectives

        -  The effectiveness of treatment by VAS :

        -  Evaluation of the rescue medication consumption

        -  Evaluation of quality of life ( using structured questionnaire )

        -  Evaluation of the frequency and school performance ( using structured questionnaire )

        -  Assessment of sleep quality and attention (through structured questionnaire )

        -  Satisfaction rating and satisfaction of parents

        -  Evaluation of asthma exacerbations in children susceptible

      This is a randomized , double-blind , placebo - controlled , phase 3 , 2 arms , in which
      patients were selected to receive placebo or a mixture powder composed of three
      bifidobacteria : Bifidobacterium Longum BB536 ( 3 billion units ) + Bifidobacterium infantis
      M - 63 ( 1 billion units ) Bifidobacterium breve M + -16 V ( 1 billion units ) . The subjects
      included in our study are represented by children aged between 4 and 17 years , with seasonal
      allergic rhinitis moderate and presenting positive skin prick test against parietaria.The
      participation of each subject in the study was based on evaluation of its clinical history.
      The recruited patients were divided into two groups according to the drug used.The group A
      received placebo , while the group B mixture bifidobacteria. The treatment was performed for
      a period of two months. At the beginning and at the end of therapy several surveys have been
      carried out , so as to be able to compare results and to draw some preliminary conclusions
      about the effectiveness of treatment.
