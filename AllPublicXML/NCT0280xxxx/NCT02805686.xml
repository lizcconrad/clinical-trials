  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maculopathy induced by the retinal toxicity of the synthetic antimalarials must be
      detected at the infra-clinical state, when it can still be reversible. Identifying early
      retinal anatomical changes has always represented (a challenge for medical interns,
      dermatologists, rheumatologists, and ophthalmologists). Currently, the gold-standard for its
      screening and its diagnostic is the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), however it is a
      long and tedious exam, offered by only few medical centers. It is recommended to find a
      simple non-invasive alternative, on a commonly used equipment. The study of the ellipsoid
      (junction line between, the external and internal photoreceptor segments) using optical
      coherence tomography (OCT-SD) &quot;en face&quot; enables us, to obtain a panoramic viewing of the
      state of the photoreceptor layer, and to detect any modification, even subtle, within this
      layer. The OCT-SD &quot;en face&quot; can be easily done by any ophthalmologist who owns one.

      The proportion of &quot;en face&quot; OCT-SD showing suggestive retinal damage and patients who present
      retinal damage in relation with synthetic antimalarial treatments and diagnosed by mfERG is
      considered in this study.

             because of a supposed retinal damage not confirmed by mfERG
