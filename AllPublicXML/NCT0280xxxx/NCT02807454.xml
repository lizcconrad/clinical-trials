  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study to confirm the safety and efficacy of durvalumab +
      daratumumab (D2) in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. This study will
      also explore the safety and efficacy of the addition of pomalidomide + dexamethasone to
      durvalumab + daratumumab (PD3).

      On 05 Sep 2017, a Partial Clinical Hold was placed on this study by the United States (US)
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The decision by the FDA was based on data related to
      risks of anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody, pembrolizumab, in combination with
      IMiDs® immunomodulatory drugs in patients with multiple myeloma. As a result, enrollment into
      this study has been discontinued. Subjects who are receiving clinical benefit, based on the
      discretion of the investigator, may remain on study treatment after being reconsented.
