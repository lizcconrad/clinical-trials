      Aim: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the PRO-067 ophthalmic solution manufactured by
      Laboratorios Sophia S.A. de C.V. versus GAAP Ofteno® ophthalmic solution like hypotensor
      therapy in subjects with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      Study design: a muticentric, prospective, crossover (2x2), double blind clinical study.
      Sample size: one hundred patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
      Patients in the period 1: In the first sequence 50 patients will be assigned to receive the
      ophthalmic solution: GAAP Ofteno ® (latanoprost 0.005%) 1 drop QD during 30 days and the
      second sequence 50 patients will be assigned to receive the ophthalmic solution: PRO-067 1
      drop QD during 30 days in the same period. Washout period: 21 hours. Patients in the period
      2: the pharmcological intervention change to the opposite therapy for 30 days.

      The American Academy of Ophthalmology Glaucoma PanelThe primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is
      a progressive, chronic optic neuropathy in adults in which intraocular pressure (IOP) and
      other currently unknown factors contribute to damage and in which, in the absence of other
      identifiable causes, there is a characteristic acquired atrophy of the optic nerve and loss
      of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. This condition is associated with an anterior
      chamber angle that is open by gonioscopic appearance.

      This is a multicentric, crossover, double blind and prospective clinical study. The
      investigators will include patients with confirmed diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma
      or ocular hypertension, with target intraocular pressure (TIOP) within a range at which a
      patient is likely to remain stable or at which worsening of glaucoma will be slow enough that
      the risk of additional intervention is not justified.

      Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups, one of them treated with a known formulation
      of Latanoprost 0.005% (GAAP Ofteno®, Laboratorios Sophia, Mexico) and the other one treated
      with PRO-067 ophthalmic solution. Patients will receive 1 drop QD into the lower conjunctival
      sac of either formulations and were examined at days: 1, 15, 30, 45 ad 61 after initiation of
      treatment. A phone call security at day 75 will be performed.

      Primary efficacy outcome: To evaluate the efficacy of PRO-067 versus GAAP Ofteno ® instilled
      onto the ocular surface in subjects with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular
      hypertension (HTO), to control and maintenance of the target intraocular pressure (TIOP).
