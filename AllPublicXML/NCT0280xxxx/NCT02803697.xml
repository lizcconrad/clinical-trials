  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) are the most common pituitary adenomas. Their
      growth is usually slow and diagnosis is often made in the context of masse effect .The
      therapeutic alternatives are surgery and radiotherapy such as fractionated stereotactic
      radiotherapy. Nowadays, there is no clinical or histological prognostic factor to allow an
      individualized follow-up and recurrence could happen 10 or 15 years after the first surgery.
      In this study, the investigators evaluate NFPAs recurrence rate after surgery and try to find
      predictive factors of recurrence to personalized the follow-up of each patient.
