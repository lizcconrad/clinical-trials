  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for patients with Alzheimer Disease or Related Disorders (ADRD) is accompanied with a
      caregiver burden that increases with the progression of the disease. This burden can have
      physical, psychological, emotional, social and financial issue on the informal caregivers who
      are often represented as hidden secondary patients. They frequently have a higher risk of
      developing mood disorders as depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disorders and a lower quality
      of life associated with a greater use of psychotropic drugs. They also incur higher risk of
      heart disease and mortality. The embrittlement of the caregiver is a major factor of early
      institutionalization of patient. In the PIXEL study, the mean age of the men caregivers was
      73.9 years and 64.8 for the women caregivers. Elderly themselves, especially spouses, the
      informal caregivers are also exposed to common chronic diseases and associated polypharmacy
      with a higher risk of developing drug-related problems due to aging and negligence of their
      own health care. These risks are increased mainly in the elderly because of changes in
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters related to aging, acute or chronic diseases
      and the potentially inappropriate prescription (PIP). Previous studies have shown the
      effectiveness and positive impact of optimization of the therapeutics by a clinical
      pharmacist on the reduction of drug-related problems, length of hospital stay, readmission
      rates, quality of life and mortality. The patient's medication management is usually
      delegated to the informal caregiver, who must also manage his own treatment. The caregiver
      may face difficulties with therapeutics (e.g., inappropriate dosage form, adverse effects and
      patient refusal) that could impact on its compliance with treatment or that of his relative.
      No previous study has evaluated the impact of pharmaceutical collaborative care including
      personalized interview with a clinical pharmacist and optimization of drug prescribing among
      patients with ADRD and their caregivers.

      However, many studies have assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on
      caregiver burden, mood disorders and the patient institutionalization. Meta-analysis showed a
      moderate improvement of the caregiver burden.

      The main objective of the PHARMAID study is to measure the impact of personalized
      pharmaceutical collaborative care integrated to a multidisciplinary psychosocial program on
      the burden of ADRD caregivers and assessed at 18-month follow-up.

    <description>The caregiver burden is measured using the Zarit Burden Index (ZBI) questionnaire. The ZBI is a subjective measure of burden that includes 22 items exploring the caregiver's perception and feelings about care situations. Each item was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always), which are summed. The score range is 0-88, a higher score indicating a higher burden level.</description>
