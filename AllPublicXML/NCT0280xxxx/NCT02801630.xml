  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded randomized control trial of a Surface Acoustic Wave Patch device for
      the treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia. This will be a crossover study for the group that
      receives the sham device. Subjects will be monitored for subjective criteria of pain and
      quality of life, as well as objective measurement of analgesic usage.

    <textblock>
      This study is a double blinded randomized control trial of a Surface acoustic wave patch
      device for the treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia. All subjects will be enrolled for a 14 day
      lead up period, where baseline measures of pain, quality of life and analgesic use will be
      recorded.

      During the first month of the study subjects will be randomized into a sham or active device
      group. Both groups will be assessed every two weeks for pain, quality of life and analgesic
      use. After 4 weeks, those subjects in the sham group will be crossed over into the active
      group. Both groups will continue to be assessed biweekly through months 2 and 3.

      After 3 months of treatment a final assessment will be conducted and the results evaluated.
