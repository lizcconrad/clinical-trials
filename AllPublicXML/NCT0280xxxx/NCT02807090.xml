  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supervised exercises are the first line therapy for patients with chronic low back pain. The
      lumbar segmental stabilization (LSE) is a specific training for the muscles of the lumbar
      spine, which aims to improve neuromuscular control, strength and endurance of the muscles
      that promotes stability to the spine. The circular dance (CD) belongs to the group of
      complementary and integrative practices entered in Public Health Care in Brazil, and has been
      used to improve several aspects related to physical and mental states such as flexibility,
      posture, strength and muscular endurance, awareness or scheme body, pain control and strains.
      There are few studies evaluating the circular dance effect on back pain. The aim of this
      study is to compare the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises and circular dance for
      improvement in non specific low back pain in middle-aged women.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>There will be 16 sessions, twice a week, with 40-60 minutes each session. In this arm the participants will learn basic notions about anatomy and biomechanics and the lumbar stabilization technique. They will be evaluated by a pressure biofeedback in the first day that will be used in the training. The lumbar stabilization technique consists of three stages: cognitive, associated and automatic. The biofeedback is used in the first stage and it helps patients to do the best contraction of stabilization muscles in different levels of pressure. Then, in stage two the patients do the contraction without the use of biofeedback and in the last phase different exercises are associated with the contraction of stabilization muscles.</description>
