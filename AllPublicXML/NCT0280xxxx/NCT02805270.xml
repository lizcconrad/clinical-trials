    <textblock>
      The implementation of a medication reconciliation intervention including: medication
      reconciliation on admission and discharge, bedside medication counselling and take-home
      medication list, on the development of adverse drug events within 30 days post discharge as
      primary outcome. Secondary outcome is the evaluation of its impact on health care resource
      utilization

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial in 587 patients randomized to intervention and usual
      care. The intervention is medication reconciliation on admission and discharge, bedside
      medication counselling and take-home medication list. Usual care is ward pharmacy practice.
      The primary outcomes are preventable and potential adverse drug events at 30 days post
      discharge. The secondary outcome is health care utilization: length of stay, emergency room
      visits, unplanned hospital visits, readmissions and travel abroad to seek medical attention.
