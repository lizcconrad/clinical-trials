  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of people in the world are infected with H. pylori, and its eradication
      rate fail to exceed 80% and even fails into an unacceptable range.Various risk factors for
      infection include lower socioeconomic status, younger age, and geographic location.In the
      present study, investigators aimed to perform a prevalence survey about risk factors for H.
      pylori infection.To obtain the higher eradication of H. pylori and find out the relevance
      between the diverse infection and clinical drug focused on refractory H. pylori infection.

Eight weeks after treatment,a 13C-urea breath test was performed on patients.The successful treatment group were patients with negative in 13C-urea breath tests in the first treatment. The refractory infection of H. pylori group were treatment failure patients after the second standardized treatment.</description>
