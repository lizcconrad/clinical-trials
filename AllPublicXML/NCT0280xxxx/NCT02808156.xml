    <textblock>
      This 3-year research project aims to investigate and compare the immediate and long-term
      treatment effectiveness as well as motor improving curve and potential predictors of the
      unimanual intensive training and bimanual intensive training protocols with an equivalent
      intervention period in children with hemiplegic CP and children with CP with apparently one
      side affected. In addition, based on the ICF-CY model, comprehensive outcome measures
      including motor functions as well as psychological functions will be included.
