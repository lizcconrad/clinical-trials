    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how the body processes LY900018 and the effect of LY900018 on the
      body. The study drug will be delivered into the participant's nostril(s) (intranasally) once
      or twice in each of four study periods. The study is expected to last about 50 days for each
      participant. The study is open to adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and will last about
      50 days.
