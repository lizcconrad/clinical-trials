  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose study of the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of Minocin® (minocycline) for injection in subjects with renal
      insufficiency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) data
      on a single dose of Minocin® (minocycline) for Injection in subjects with renal insufficiency
      and in subjects receiving hemodialysis therapy. The safety, tolerability, and PK data will
      support the compound as a potential clinical candidate in Europe and will inform the
      development of future Phase 2/3 studies.

             after discharge, for the duration of the study;

          2. Healthy adult male or female between 18 and 85 years of age (inclusive) at the time of
             screening;

          3. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 kg/m2 and ≤ 45 kg/m2;

          4. Pulse measured at screening/baseline must be within the ranges ≥ 45 to ≤ 115 beats per
             minute (bpm, taken after resting in a semi-recumbent position for at least 5 minutes);

          5. Have sufficient peripheral vascular access, based on the Investigator's assessment,
             for all blood sample collections to take place;

          6. Female subject is surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or if of childbearing potential,
             agrees to abstinence or to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (e.g.,
             prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch,
             intrauterine device, barrier methods, etc.) or male partner sterilization alone,
             between randomization and for 7 days after the completion of the study;

             Subjects with Renal Insufficiency:

          7. Assessment of renal insufficiency for assignment to study groups will be based on
             measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by the Modification of
             Diet in Renal Disease equation at the screening visit to determine eligibility;

             Subjects with Normal Renal Function:

          8. Normal volunteers first matched by age (± 10 years), BMI (± 20%), and gender to the
             mean values of the moderate renal insufficiency group. Once the mild, moderate, and
             severe renal insufficiency groups are fully enrolled, the mean values of age, BMI, and
             gender will be calculated for the pooled renal insufficiency groups, and additional
             healthy subjects may be enrolled to match the pooled means;

          9. Have a creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 90 mL/min calculated using the Cockcroft Gault
             equation;

             Hemodialysis Subjects:

             months, using an arteriovenous fistula or graft;

         11. Otherwise considered to be clinically stable with respect to underlying renal
             impairment, as determined by the Investigator, and based upon a medical evaluation
             that includes a medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and
             electrocardiogram (ECG);

         12. Have clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the
             opinion of the Investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameter is deemed associated with the subject's underlying renal impairment;

         13. A stable medication regimen is required, defined as not starting new drug(s) or
             significant changes in dosage(s) within 14 days prior to administration of study drug,
             or during the conduct of the study. Changes of medications in hemodialysis subjects
             are subject to dialysis site protocols such that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents,
             iron, and vitamin D can be changed based on the then current subject status and
             dialysis unit standard practice and subject safety prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any condition, including findings in the medical history or in pre-study
             assessments, that are capable of altering the distribution, metabolism, or elimination
             of drugs or that constitute a risk or a contraindication for the participation in the
             study or completing the study; Subjects in the renal insufficiency groups will have
             consideration for the degree of renal insufficiency and presence of comorbidities;

          2. Current evidence or history of malignancy, excluding basal cell carcinoma, in the 2
             years prior to Day -1 (day before dosing) with no evidence of recurrence;

          4. Vigorous exercise from 48 hours prior to Day -1 until the day of discharge from the
             study;

          5. Surgery within 48 hours prior to randomization or surgery planned during the study
             period;

             bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase that is 1.5 x upper
             limit of normal of the normal range for subjects based on age and sex);

          7. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who have a positive pregnancy test result;

          8. Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth
