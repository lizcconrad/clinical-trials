      Randomized trial of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram on admission versus after
      resolution of pain for mild gallstone pancreatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a single-center randomized trial to compare
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) within 24 hours of
      presentation versus after clinical resolution during index admission for mild gallstone
      pancreatitis on clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, this study aims to
      determine patients' values and preferences that influence decision-making regarding treatment
      options for gallstone pancreatitis. Hypothesis: During index admission for mild gallstone
      pancreatitis, early cholecystectomy within 24 hours of presentation regardless of symptoms or
      laboratory values versus after clinical resolution results in a shorter 30-day total hospital
      length of stay.
