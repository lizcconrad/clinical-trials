  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, compression ultrasound (CUS) has become an easy and reliable
      noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

      Currently there are not validated methods to assess the biological age of venous thrombus,
      and the date of onset of thrombosis. One potential technique to age DVT is ultrasound
      elastography (UE). UE is a noninvasive technique to measure tissue hardness, and it is well
      known that thrombi harden as they age. The aim of this study will be to assess the ability of
      UE to distinguish acute from chronic DVT. The investigators will evaluate prospectively all
      consecutive outpatients presenting with clinically suspected unprovoked DVT of the lower
      limbs, and those having a previous diagnosis of DVT for the scheduled 3 months visit of
      follow-up, for a period of about one year. All the enrolled patients will undergo to the CUS
      of the lower limbs, and at the same time to the ultrasound elastography by the physician
      expert in vascular ultrasound. The specialist performing both examinations will be unaware of
      the time of onset of DVT (acute or chronic). Then the patients will be divided into two
      groups (group A: patients with acute DVT; group B: patients with chronic DVT at the 3rd month
      of follow-up). Each examination (CUS and ultrasound elastography) will be repeated three
      times in the same patient at the same visit, to assess the reproducibility of the technique.
      The demographic data, medical history, physical examination and the results of CUS and
      ultrasound elastography will be collected in a case report form (CRF) by another investigator
      who does not perform the examinations. The blinded CRF will be submitted to a dedicated
      committee for statistical analysis.

        diagnosis of DVT for the scheduled 3 months visit of follow-up, for a period of about one
        year. All the enrolled patients will undergo to the CUS of the lower limbs, and at the same
