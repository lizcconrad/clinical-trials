    <textblock>
      This research clinical trial studies high definition single cell analysis in blood and tissue
      samples from patients with colorectal cancer which has spread to the liver. High definition
      single cell analysis allows doctors to study the properties of cancer cells that are
      sometimes found in the blood of patients and to determine how the genes and proteins in them
      may change over time. Studying samples from patients with colorectal cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about how cancer spreads, as well as how to predict the disease
      outcomes in patients with cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the level of correlation between solid tumor touch preparations and liquid
      biopsies (circulating tumor cells [CTCs]) from patients with surgically resected colorectal
      cancer (CRC) metastases to the liver using single-cell high-content analysis, including gene
      copy number variation (CNV) and to establish one or more bio-signatures that represent the
      liquid and solid biopsy correlation for each patient and for the patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the technical validity and reproducibility of the bio-signatures by
      comparing the two pre-resection liquid biopsy samples drawn one week prior to and on the day
      of surgery.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare biosignatures between pre-surgical and post-surgical blood samples. II. Compare
      biosignatures between resected metastatic liver tumor tissue, primary colon tumor tissue (if
      available), and pre-surgical blood samples.

      III. Compare biosignatures between blood samples prior to resection with those obtained after
      resection and at the time of recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood collection 1 week prior surgery, before and after surgery on the same
      day, and 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Patients also undergo tissue collection during
      the surgery. Blood and tissue samples are processed for high definition single cell analysis
      including whole-genome CNV profiles, protein expression, and cell morphology.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.
