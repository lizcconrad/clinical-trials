  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is a common complication that patients experience in the early
      postoperative period following cardiac surgery. Increasingly, the composition and volume of
      intravenous fluids administered during surgery have been implicated in the development of
      postoperative acidosis. Intraoperative Cell Salvage (ICS), an autologous blood transfusion
      technique employed by Cardiac/Perfusion Units to minimize blood loss during surgery, involves
      the infusion of of one such fluid, 0.9% sodium chloride. The rapid infusion of large volumes
      of 0.9% sodium chloride has previously been linked with the development of hyperchloraemic
      acidosis. We hypothesize that the volume of mechanically salvaged of red blood cells
      re-infused into patients undergoing heart surgery contributes to the acidosis that occurs in
      the early postoperative period.

      To test this, we have designed an observational cohort study to check for correlation between
      the volume of cell salvaged blood infused during surgery and the severity of postoperative
      acidosis (which will be assessed using data from routine arterial blood gas samples).

    <description>Plasma hydrogen ion concentration is measured by the arterial blood gas analyzer machine, and serves as a direct indicator of plasma acidity at a given time point.
Data from two routine blood gas samples are of interest:
T1 - baseline measurement taken on insertion of an arterial line immediately after the induction of anaesthesia (i.e. before any fluid infusion has commenced); T2 - postoperative measurement made immediately after patient arrives in ICU (i.e. once all the cell salvaged blood has been transfused)</description>

    <description>Plasma strong ion difference can be computed from routine arterial blood gas electrolyte measurements (chloride, lactate, sodium, potassium) using a formula.
Strong ion difference serves as an indirect measure of plasma acidity.
