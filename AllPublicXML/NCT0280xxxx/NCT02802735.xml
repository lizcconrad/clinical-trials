  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study to assess the pharmacokinetics of apremilast in healthy adult male Korean
      subjects living in Korea. The study will consist of two parts. Part 1 will evaluate the PK of
      ascending single doses of apremilast. Part 2 will evaluate the PK of apremilast when
      administered as multiple doses.

             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator and understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

          5. Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator according to past medical
             history, physical examination (PE), vital signs, 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             laboratory tests.

          6. Must have a body mass index Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          7. Clinical laboratory tests must be within normal limits or considered by the
             Investigator to be not clinically significant.

          8. Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral [or tympanic]
             body temperature) will be assessed in the supine position after the subject has rested
             for at least five minutes. Subject must be afebrile (febrile [oral or tympanic] is
             defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.3°F) with vital signs within the following ranges:

               -  Systolic blood pressure: 90 to 140 mm Hg;

               -  Diastolic blood pressure: 50 to 90 mm Hg;

               -  Pulse rate: 40 to 110 bpm.

          9. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG). Subjects
             must have a QTc value ≤ 450 msec.

         10. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable Physical examination (PE).

         11. Contraception Requirements:

             - Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in
             which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (latex or non-latex
             condoms NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while
             on Investigational Product (IP) and for at least 28 days after the last dose of IP.

                  vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first
                  dose administration.

               5. Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption,
                  distribution, metabolism and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure, colon resection,
                  irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, etc. Subjects with cholecystectomy and
                  appendectomy may be included.

               6. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days prior to
                  the first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if
                  known (whichever is longer).

               7. Donated blood or plasma within eight weeks before the first dose administration
                  to a blood bank or blood donation center.

               8. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and
                  Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing, or a positive drug screen
                  reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

               9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) within 2
                  years before dosing, or a positive alcohol screen.

              10. Known to have hepatitis, or known to be a carrier of the HBsAg, or HCV Ab, or
                  have a positive result to the test for HBsAg, HCV Ab, or Human Immunodeficiency
                  Virus (HIV) antibodies at Screening.
