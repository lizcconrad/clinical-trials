      This study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of neoadjuvant tamoxifen for patients with
      locally advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer in a low/middle income country.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm feasibility study of neoadjuvant tamoxifen for locally advanced hormone
      receptor positive breast cancer in a low-resource setting in a middle-income country
      (Guatemala). Patients will be treated with tamoxifen for four to six weeks, then have an
      on-treatment biopsy to assess Ki-67. If Ki-67 is less than or equal to 10%, the patient will
      continue on tamoxifen for a total of 4 months; if Ki-67 is greater than 10% or there is
      clinical progression, patients will be taken off study. The study will evaluate the
      proportion of patients treated with four months of tamoxifen who undergo definitive surgery
      and the clinical and pathologic response rates.

    <time_frame>4-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is defined as the ability to recruit the stated number of patients and fifty percent of participants completing the trial. Completing the trial is defined as reaching surgery if they are a responder to tamoxifen or obtaining the six week biopsy specimen if they are a non-responder.</description>

    <description>Rate of definitive surgery after 4 months of neoadjuvant tamoxifen therapy in patients who were deemed to be &quot;responders&quot; to neoadjuvant tamoxifen (Ki67 &lt; or = 10% after 4-6 weeks on neoadjuvant tamoxifen therapy)</description>

    <measure>Ki67 Suppression Rate at 4-6 Weeks in Patients Who Underwent an On-treatment Biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Result is the number of participants who had Ki67 suppression (&lt; or = 10%) after 4-6 weeks of neoadjuvant tamoxifen out of patients who underwent an on-treatment biopsy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Clinical Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response rate was assessed by palpation after 4 months of tamoxifen. Complete response was defined as no palpable primary tumor on clinical examination and lymph nodes &lt; 10 mm. Partial response was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters compared to baseline sum of diameters. The overall clinical response was the sum of the complete clinical response and partial clinical response.</description>

    <measure>Pathologic Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pathologic complete response was defined as no residual tumor at the primary site or the axillary lymph nodes at the time of surgery.</description>

        <title>Overall Clinical Response Rate</title>
        <description>Clinical response rate was assessed by palpation after 4 months of tamoxifen. Complete response was defined as no palpable primary tumor on clinical examination and lymph nodes &lt; 10 mm. Partial response was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters compared to baseline sum of diameters. The overall clinical response was the sum of the complete clinical response and partial clinical response.</description>
