  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main objective of the experiment is threefold: 1) to technically test a device for central
      blood pressure estimation for its applicability in a spaceflight-related environment and on
      the International Space Station. 2) Furthermore the objective is to compare central blood
      pressure estimates based on arterial pressure readings of different peripheral arteries. For
      central blood pressure estimation mathematical transfer functions as described by Karamanoglu
      and colleagues (11) will be used. 3) Finally the experiments' objective is to simultaneously
      apply phonocardiography together with ECG and carotid plethysmography to determine cardiac
      systolic time intervals in parabolic flight during gravity transitions.

      Secondary objective of the experiment is to simultaneously measure key variables of the
      central circulation during gravity transitions to expand the understanding of cardiovascular
      regulation in weightlessness. Furthermore spirometric measurements shall be performed during
      a parabolic flight day to observe changes in end-expiratory CO2. Arterial CO2 content is
      central for cardiovascular regulation.

      Our main hypothesis is that there is no difference between different methods of central
      arteria pressure determination.

      Concerning our secondary objective, this experiment is designed as an observational study.
      Thus no clear hypothesis was generated but the measured cardiovascular and respiratory
      variables will be analysed regarding differences correlated to gravity.

    <description>Rebreathings will be performed every parabola (2, 4, 6, 8, 10…). Ultrasound measurements will be performed during the remaining parabolas (1, 3, 5, 7, 9…). The procedure consists of a fixed breathing frequency of 20 breaths per minute and an exact triggered start point for the measurements. . Central blood pressure measurements, finger blood pressure measurements, impedance cardiography, carotid plethysmography and phonocardiography will be performed continuously during the flights. The breaks between parabolas 10 and 11 and 20 and 21 will be used to change subjects, which takes approximately 5 minutes.</description>
