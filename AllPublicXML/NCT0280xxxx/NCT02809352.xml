  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is due to a persistent infection with a group of viruses known as high-risk
      Human Papillomaviruses (hrHPV). Viral DNA can be easily detected in a cervical sample by a
      procedure called 'HPV testing', which can be used as a relevant screening test. A pilot
      screening program called START-HPV has been set up in the Ardennes, a French administrative
      area localized in the North of France, with HPV testing as a primary screening test.This
      observational study aimed to evaluate hrHPV genotypes repartition in the population who
      participate in the START-HPV screening program. This study will allow a better knowledge of
      hrHPV infection epidemiology in a screened population.
