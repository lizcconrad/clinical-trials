  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment-sequence crossover study to determine the
      relative bioavailability of pacritinib following administration as a 400 mg oral dose of four
      100 mg pacritinib capsules and an 80 mg dose of an oral solution and to characterize the PK
      and major human metabolites of pacritinib.

    <textblock>
      Twelve healthy subjects will be enrolled in the study (6 subjects per sequence) at a single
      clinical site with the intent that 12 subjects complete Periods 1 and 2 in the study.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 2 possible sequences (6 subjects per sequence) on Day 1
      of Period 1. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 2 possible sequences. Each subject
      received 2 treatments (a 400 mg oral dose of four 100 mg pacritinib capsules and an 80 mg
      oral solution dose of pacritinib) in a 2-period crossover design. Each treatment will be
      administered as monotherapy during 1 of 2 treatment periods with a 7-day washout period
      between administrations of each study medication.

             exertion);
