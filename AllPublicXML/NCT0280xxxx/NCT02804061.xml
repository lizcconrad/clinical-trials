  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition and exercise behaviour change programs can prevent excessive gestational weight
      gain (EGWG). The Nutrition and Exercise Lifestyle Intervention Program (NELIP) is a
      previously published two-behaviour change program which was successful in preventing EGWG
      across normal weight, overweight and obese pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories
      (Ruchat et al. 2012; Mottola et al. 2010), however some women found it difficult to adhere to
      two lifestyle behaviour changes throughout pregnancy. The proposed pilot randomized
      controlled trial will address the issue of adherence by identifying the best way to offer a
      two-behaviour change program (NELIP) to pregnant women to increase the effectiveness of
      preventing early and total EGWG. Participants will begin the program at &lt;18 weeks gestation
      and will be randomized to one of three groups: A) Receive both behaviour changes (Nutrition
      AND Exercise) simultaneously at entrance to the study; B) Receive the nutrition component
      first followed sequentially by the introduction of exercise at 25 weeks gestation (Nutrition
      FOLLOWED by Exercise); C) Receive the exercise component first followed sequentially by the
      introduction of the nutrition component at 25 weeks gestation (Exercise FOLLOWED by
      Nutrition).

      A randomized parallel groups design will be used as a pilot project. Each participant will be
      medically pre-screened using the PARmed-X for Pregnancy (2015) in early pregnancy (&lt;18
      weeks), stratified by pre-pregnancy BMI status (normal weight [18.5-24.9 kg/m2]; overweight
      [25.0-29.9 kg/m2], obese [=&gt;30.0 kg/m2]) and randomized into one of 3 groups: Group A) NELIP
      (full intervention); Group B) Nutrition intervention given at study entry followed
      sequentially by the exercise intervention starting immediately after 24 week mid-way visit
      (N+E); or Group C) Exercise intervention started at study entry followed sequentially by the
      nutrition intervention starting immediately after 24 week mid-way visit (E+N). Infant sex,
      body weight, length, complications will be recorded at birth and the last known maternal body
      weight. Neonatal morphometrics will be assessed with diaper only (6 skinfold sites from
      umbilical, suprailiac, biceps, triceps, subscapular, and anterior thigh; circumferences from
      the head, chest, abdomen, hips, thigh, leg, arm, and arm, forearm, thigh and leg length
      measured to the nearest mm) and will be measured within 6-18 hours of delivery by a member of
      the research team visiting the woman either at hospital or home. Each maternal-infant pair
      will be asked to return to the lab at 2, 6 and 12 months post-delivery for follow-up and
      assessment of chronic disease risk.
