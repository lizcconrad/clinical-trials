  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Field hockey players, recruited from clubs in Jamaica, will be randomized to either a water
      training or land training groups. Persons will be exposed to 6 weeks of plyometric training
      with two sessions per week. Pre and post test measures will be done for lower limb power,
      flexibility and agility. Distance covered, pace, heart rates and exertion during a match will
      also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plyometric training has been used in a variety of sports to improve power. There is minimal
      research however regarding its use among hockey players and even less research exploring
      water based training. International field hockey competitions are played on wet turf and it
      is felt that water training may be beneficial to these players. The study will explore
      whether water based plyometrics will prove to have additional benefits compared to land based
      plyometrics for the Jamaican hockey athletes. The members of the Jamaica hockey clubs will be
      recruited to participate in this study. Recruitment will be done by the principal
      investigator Dr. Roopchand-Martin. A total of 34 persons will be recruited and they will be
      randomly allocated to aquatic or land based training. All training programmes will be
      conducted at the section of physical therapy and training will be done two times per week for
      6 weeks. Baseline assessments will be done independent evaluators for lower limb power using
      the Standing Broad Jump and Vertical Jump Test, anaerobic power using the Running Anaerobic
      Sprint test, agility using the Illinois agility and T tests, flexibility using the Sit and
      Reach Test and performance during game play on wet artificial turf in relation to time-motion
      analysis for total distance covered, and total time, average and maximum pace, average and
      maximum heart rate, time in heart zones 1-5, and changes in rate of perceived exertion.

    <measure>Vertical Jump</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical jump will be measured using the Brower vertical jump apparatus. The standing height with one arm extended upward is recorded and then the athlete jumps off two feet and the sensor on the bar records the jump height. Each person will complete 3 jumps and the best trial recorded. The jump height recorded is the difference between the jump height and the standing reach height.</description>

    <measure>Standing Broad Jump</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant will stand with feet together and then jump forward as far as they can. The trials will be completed and the best jump recorded. Distance jumped will be measured with a tape measure.</description>

    <measure>Agility T test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with sit on a bed with legs outstretched and their back and buttock against a wall. They will place one hand over the other and then be asked to reach forward as far as they can without bending their knees. Three trials will be allowed and the furthers reach distance recorded.</description>
