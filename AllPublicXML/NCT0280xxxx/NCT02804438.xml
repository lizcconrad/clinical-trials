  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect a large amount of data that may assist in addressing
      the gap in knowledge of understanding pupillometer readings using a pupillometer device.

      The aim of this project is to establish normative values for pupillometer data. Measures of
      central tendency will be developed for the variables provided by automated pupillary exams,
      which will provide an enhanced understanding of clinically appropriate pupil values for size,
      reactivity, and neurological pupil index.

      Data will be collected on patients in the intensive care units at the selected hospitals on
      patients who have been assigned, by the attending physician, to have regular pupillary
      assessments, and in whom staff nurses are performing pupillary assessments with the
      pupillometer. While a sample size estimate would be considered inappropriate for registry
      development, power analysis techniques were used to examine the potential of this registry to
      generate adequate information to begin to fully describe normative data for pupillary exams.
      Using the assumption that the desire is to understand neurological pupil index (NPi) and size
      differences within 0.1, and that the spread of data would be approximately normally
      distributed, a minimum of 3,250 observations is required (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.80). It
      must, however, be repeated that this is simply a rough estimate. The registry data generated
      will, in fact, be the source of data from which future studies will be powered.
