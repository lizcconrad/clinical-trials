  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon α-2b gel (Yallaferon®) for
      the treatment of patients with cervical HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 infections; to analyze the HPV
      type infections and clinical negative conversion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 patients with positive HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection are randomized into interferon gel
      group and control group at ratio of 1:1 (50 patients in treatment group and 50 patients in
      control group). The patients in treatment group received 1g recombinant human α-2b interferon
      gel every other day for consecutive 6-10 courses of treatment, whereas no treatment was
      conducted in control group.
