  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common endocrine disorder in children. In France, T1D
      prevalence is estimated to 12.2 per 100 000. Worldwide T1D incidence increased rapidly in the
      last decades, around 3% per year. T1D is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta
      cells, leading to hyperglycaemia. T1D was recently associated an important loss in life
      expectancy compared with the general population. To date, the precise aetiology of T1D onset
      and the mechanisms involved in T1D remain unknown and no preventive treatment of T1D exists.

      It is now well admitted that T1D results from a combined effect of genes, environmental
      factors and gene-environment interactions. Several genetic factors have been reported as
      associated to T1D, the most important being the human leukocyte antigen class II genes. Whole
      genome association studies suggested more than 50 T1D other susceptibility locus, but
      conferring individually a modest risk to develop T1D. Longitudinal studies demonstrated that
      only a low fraction of genetically predisposed subjects develop T1D and all these genetic
      factors cannot explain the increase in prevalence of T1D in the latter half of the 20th
      century, suggesting the implication of environmental factors.

      Literature has accumulated a lot of evidence for the role of enterovirus in T1D. Several
      retrospective, prospective, post-mortem human studies, as well as animal studies, strongly
      suggest contribution of human enteroviruses to the pathogenesis of T1D. Enterovirus probably
      play a dual role in T1D, some enterovirus being associated with an increased risk of T1D and
      others with a protective effect. Interestingly, several T1D susceptibility loci are
      implicated in antiviral response. Epidemiologic and genetic approaches have led to new
      insights into T1D causation, but a collective explanation is still lacking.

      The project aims at (1) demonstrating the gene-enterovirus interaction effect on T1D onset
      and (2) characterizing the &quot;precipitating&quot; effect of enterovirus on T1D by a follow-up study
      of T1D high-risk subjects (first degree unaffected relatives with positive autoantibodies to
      islet antigens).

      A structural originality of this project is to perform a family-based study of
      gene-enterovirus interaction in T1D using innovative and robust methods. This project will be
      conducted in close collaboration between our INSERM unit, the Inter-regional network of
      paediatric diabetology, labelled biobanks (CBC Biotec of Hospices Civils de Lyon and CRB-LRB
      of Lariboisière' hospital at Paris), the Centre National de Référence des Enterovirus at Lyon
      and the Centre National de Génotypage at Evry.

      The investigators will first conduct a 3-years pilot study (2016-2019), based on a sample of
      250 nuclear families ascertained through a paediatric T1D proband in four centres. Families
      will be ascertained during the hospitalization of the proband at the time of T1D diagnosis.
      The study will be then extended to whole Inter-regional network of paediatric diabetology.

      This research is a unique opportunity to explore further the implication of enterovirus and
      their interactions with genetic factors involved in T1D susceptibility and aims to target
      high-risk T1D subjects. This innovative project opens the door of the development of
      preventive therapy for T1D.

    <description>The investigators choose to use a family-based approach in order to capture the underlying complexities of gene-environment interactions by identifying families with combinations of risk factors (genetic and enterovirus) that lead to disease expression. The gene-environment studies will be conducted for different candidate genes significantly associated with T1D. Families will be ascertained during the hospitalization of probands at the moment of T1D diagnosis. DNA, plasma, serum and stool samples will be collected for viral detection and genotyping. Gene-enterovirus effect will be estimated by using the &quot;sibling-augmented case-only&quot; approach based on logistic models.</description>

    <description>Confirmation of the role of enteroviral infection in T1D and characterization of gene-enterovirus interactions should open up new avenues for understanding the pathogenesis of T1D and give clues on possible new therapeutic perspectives. Clinical applications might be further developed in order to extend the lag period might between positive autoantibodies detection and T1D age at onset in genetically predisposed subjects. This innovative project opens the door of the development of preventive therapy for T1D, as enterovirus vaccination.</description>
