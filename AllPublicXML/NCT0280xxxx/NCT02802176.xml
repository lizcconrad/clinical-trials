      The purpose of this study is to evaluate implantation rate with intra-vaginal culture with
      the INVOcell device versus traditional IVF while using minimal stimulation protocols

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, single center randomized controlled trial evaluating intra-vaginal
      culture using INVOcell versus traditional IVF using oral stimulation or minimal gonadotropin
      stimulation protocols. The pilot aims to includes 40 women who will be randomized to either
      the intra-vaginal culture group (N=20) using INVOcell or to the traditional IVF group (N=20).

      Primary aim is implantation rate, which is defined by number gestational sacs seen on early
      pregnancy ultrasound divided by number of embryos transferred.

      Secondary aims are:

        -  Embryo quality, which is measured by the Gardner grading system.

        -  Fertilization rate, which is defined by the total number of fertilized oocytes divided
           by total number of mature oocytes retrieved. This comparison will take place on day-3,
           as that is when the IVC embryos will be assessed.

        -  Clinical pregnancy rate, which is defined by the number of fetal poles with heartbeat
           seen on ultrasound divided by the number of embryos transferred.

        -  Live birth rate, which is defined by the number of living babies delivered divided by
           the number of transfers
