    <textblock>
      Invasive Candida infections are serious complications in immunocompromised patients including
      those undergoing treatment for cancer but occur also in patients treated in ICUs. Survival
      rate of invasive candidiasis is associated with early initiation of antifungal therapy (15%
      mortality rate for candidemic patients with antifungal therapy on day 0 related to the
      culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeasts compared to 41% for patients who
      received antifungal therapy on day 3). Up to date, no laboratory method or clinical decision
      rule is available for correct anticipation of invasive candidiasis which would avoid delays
      in appropriate antifungal therapy initiation. In clinical practice culture based methods
      (e.g. blood cultures) miss up to 50% of invasive candidiasis cases. Preemptive antifungal
      therapy is therefore often initiated in critically ill patients after Candida has been
      isolated from various non-sterile patient samples even without any sufficient evidence for
      invasive candidiasis. The disadvantages of this approach include over- and undertreatment of
      patients (up to 50% of candidemia cases are missed, and on the other hand 89% patients are
      treated unnecessarily), increased selective pressure for the development of antifungal
      resistance, potential risk of adverse drug reactions, and increased costs (expenses for
      antifungal therapy account for half of the antimicrobial medication budget in tertiary care
      hospitals). In addition, no survival benefit could be demonstrated by this strategy in ICU
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to identify biological markers to anticipate or support the
      diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in ICU patients, to overcome current deficiencies in
      detection of invasive candidiasis and consequently to differentiate between Candida spp.
      colonization and invasive Candida infection. The investigators intend to examine time
      dependent courses of potential host and pathogen derived biomarkers as well as innate or
      acquired predispositions for invasive candidiasis; e.g. automated (1→3) ß- D- Glucan tests,
      DNA in serum blood samples, pathogen recognition receptors and serum markers like interleukin
      (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23, Tryptophan, Kynurenine,
      composition of indigenous microbiota of gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract and
      skin, and risk factors for invasive candidiasis like underlying diseases and treatments. The
      study should contribute to improved assessment of ICU patients at risk for invasive
      candidiasis and to improved diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in ICU patients. In clinical
      practice the reliable differentiation between infection and colonization will allow more
      targeted antifungal therapy leading to enhanced antifungal treatment initiation on the one
      hand (in cases of true invasive candidiasis) and to reduction of unnecessary antifungal
      treatments and treatment costs on the other hand.
