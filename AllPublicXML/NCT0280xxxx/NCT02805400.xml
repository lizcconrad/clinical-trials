    <textblock>
      The main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the alterations in brain cortical
      activity induced by micro- and hypergravity conditions.

      A secondary objective is to correlate changes in brain cortical activity and brain
      oxygenation level with neurocognitive performance.

      Another secondary objective is to differentiate between the influences of hemodynamic and
      electro cortical changes and the influence of stress on cognitive performance alterations

    <description>Cortical activity will be determined under changing gravity level by electroencephalography (EEG/LORETA). Brain hemodynamics change will be evaluated by NIRS. Heart rate and respiratory evaluation will be indicators of cardio-vascular and central nervous arousal and stress. Cognitive performance will be evaluated by computerized tests.
For these methods only commercially available CE marked devices will be used.</description>
