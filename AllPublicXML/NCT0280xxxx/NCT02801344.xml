  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein requirements in individuals who participate in endurance-based exercise training have
      been suggested to be greater than the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA).

      Our recent study using the minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique
      have suggested that protein requirements in young men are at least 30% higher than the
      recommended protein intake.

      The present study will investigate the impact of protein sufficiency on protein metabolism
      and performance during intensified training periods as a means to further our understanding
      of the nutritional requirements for the endurance athlete.
