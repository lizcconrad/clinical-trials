  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis have multiple etiologies but share a similar bronchial injury associated with
      inflammation, which leads to a progressive lung deterioration. This disease is responsible
      for a frequent access to care with an exacerbation rate of 1.8 per year with a high risk of
      hospitalization. Natural history is marked by recurrent infectious diseases which are the
      main prognosis factor. This disease is associated with an inflammation rate in the lung as
      well as in the blood. Up to now, no study has been described comorbidities associated with
      this chronic disease but our hypothesis is that cardiovascular diseases will be more frequent
      in these patients. In fact systemic inflammation driven by bronchial infections may increase
      frequency of cardiovascular diseases.

      The investigators decide to conduct a monocentric observational study to define the
      prevalence and characterization of cardiovascular comorbidities as well as markers of
      accelerated aging. We would like to test the hypothesis that cardiovascular comorbidities are
      frequent in bronchiectasis and may be associated with markers of inflammation and aging.

      Phenotype of the lung disease will include: spirometry, plethysmography, DLCO measurement
      according to the ATS/ERS guideline. 6M walking test and echocardiography will be also
      performed.

      Frequency of comorbidities will be calculated with data from questionnaire as well as
      standardized explorations.

      Aging related manifestations will be measured: arterial stiffness using aortic pulse wave
      velocity, bone mineral density using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Appendicular skeletal
      muscle mass and grip test were also performed.

      Blood test were also performed to measure inflammatory markers, cytokines and length of
      telomere in circulating leucocytes.
