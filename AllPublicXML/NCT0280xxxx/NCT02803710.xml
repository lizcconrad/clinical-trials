  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upon penicillins' introduction, inactivation of beta- lactam antibiotics by enzymes produced
      by bacteria was demonstrated. Until recently, carbapenems were a relatively spared subclass
      by these enzymes which makes the molecules of last resort in serious infection. Recently the
      prevalence of enzymes hydrolysing carbapenem, the carbapenemases, was increasing in some
      countries. But these carbapenemases are not the only mechanism involved in a decreased
      susceptibility to carbapenems which is sometimes linked to the conjunction of several
      resistance mechanisms. Data available on the epidemic situation of this new resistance are
      essential for improving their detection, the management of infections in patients and prevent
      the occurrence of epidemic. In this context, the investigators propose a study in the
      North-East inter-region to estimate the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae with decrease
      susceptibility to carbapenems and look for risk factors for infection with this type of
      bacteria. The study is conducted in five teaching hospitals (Besançon, Dijon, Nancy, Reims
      and Strasbourg) and two general hospitals (Colmar and Troyes) in North-Eastern France. For
      one year, all the Enterobacteriaceae isolates with a decreased susceptibility to carbapenems
      (CDSE) according to the 2012 Antibiogram Comity of the French Microbiology Society (CA-SFM)
      (MIC of ertapenem &gt; 0.5 μg/mL) are collected and sent to the bacteriology laboratory of the
      Reims University Hospital. Among these strains 105 are randomly selected. The clinical study
      is conducted as follow: for each patient with CDSE isolate included in a center, 2 control
      patients are selected. They are the patients having the 2 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with
      no reduced susceptibility to carbapenems and following the CDSE isolate in the same center.

      Microbiological study : identification of isolates is performed using MALDI-TOF (Bruker
      Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Antibiotic susceptibilities is determined by the disc diffusion
      method according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)
      guidelines (www.EUCAST.org) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) are detected by the
      double-disc synergy test and carbapenem minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs to Imipenem,
      Ertapenem, Doripenem and Meropenem) determined using E-test® strips. Metallo-β-lactamase
      production was screened with the MβL Etest (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).
      Beta-lactamases detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Carbapenemase-encoding genes
      (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24-like, blaOXA-58-like and
      blaOXA-48-like) were screened using multiplex PCRs and blaIMI and blaGES with simplex PCRs.
      All the blaOXA-48-like detected were subsequently sequenced. Genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M
      and blaOXA were detected by PCR using specific primers. Plasmid-mediated AmpC-type genes
      blaACC, blaFOX, blaMOX, blaDHA, blaCMY and blaMIR were screened using multiplex PCRs. All the
      beta-lactamases are sequenced. Mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region
      (QRDR) are identified by PCR and sequencing in the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. Qnr and
      qepA genes are detected by real-time PCR, aac(6')-Ib-cr by pyrosequencing and oqxAB by
      conventional PCR. Genotyping is performed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and
      multilocus sequence typing (MLST).

      Statistical analysis : qualitative variables are analysed with the Chi2 test and the
      two-tailed Fisher exact test. Quantitative variables are compared using the Mann-Whitney
      test. Then, a multivariate analysis is conducted: logistic regression with stepwise factors
      as explanatory variables with p &lt;0.20 in the univariate analysis as input threshold and
      output set at 0.20.The results are considered statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05.

      Expected results : this study will give the proportion of the different species involved, of
      the carbapenemase in comparison to the other mechanisms, the level of resistance in MIC. Risk
      factors such as previous antibiotic treatment, underlying disease severity or clonal strain
      transmission will be evidenced, allowing to identify prevention control measure to implement.
