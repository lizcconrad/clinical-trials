  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) is a challenging task. These infections
      include different clinical and microbiological settings calling upon various treatment
      strategies according to infection type (acute or chronic), bone quality, the involved
      micro-organism and the patient's general condition and willing.

      Treatment of PJI combines surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy. In some patients with a
      high operative risk prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy can be used.

      Lack of large prospective studies motivated the conception of this cohort with a long term
      follow up, regardless to PJI management procedures.

    <textblock>
      Large prospective cohort study in a French referral center for bone and joint infections.

      Population

        -  all patients who consented to participate in the study with PJI treated with:

        -  debridement-synovectomy for acute infection

        -  with one-stage, two-stage exchange arthroplasty for chronic infection

        -  other procedures (complete removal of the prosthesis) and antibiotic therapy

        -  patients (non-operated or operated) receiving prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy

      Outcome:

        -  Follow-up at least 2 years

        -  Events monitored: reinfection including relapse and new infection, joint revision for
           mechanical failure, PJI related or non-related death Study duration: 10 years.
           Recruitment period: 4 years. Maximal duration of data collection: 6 years. Investigator
           center: monocenter study. Mean patient inclusion per year: 100 patients per year.
