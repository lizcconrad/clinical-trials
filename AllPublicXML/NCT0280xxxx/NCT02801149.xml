  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that: 1) various clinical complications may arise from a misdiagnosed scaphoid
      fracture; and 2) clinical and radiographic diagnosis of scaphoid fracture is often
      challenging, particularly at the time of presentation, this study aims to evaluate whether
      the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the investigation of patients presenting with
      a suspected scaphoid fracture, with negative findings from the initial conventional
      radiography (4-view plain x-ray), leads to improved levels of efficiency, quality of care and
      patient experience.

      This study is a single centre randomised, non-blinded, prospective study. Participants will
      be randomised, following the initial negative conventional radiography, to either: no further
      imaging at A&amp;E (consistent with current clinical practice); or 2) wrist MRI. The study
      considers a follow-up period of 6 months.

      The scaphoid bone is an obliquely orientated bone on the radial (thumb) side of the wrist,
      between the distal carpal row and the radius. Wrist injury is a common presentation to the
      Emergency Department (ED) in the UK. Amongst these patients, the scaphoid is the most
      commonly fractured carpal bone, accounting for 51-90% of carpal fractures and between 2-7% of
      all fractures.

      fracture; and 2) clinical and radiographic diagnosis of scaphoid fracture is often

      the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the investigation of patients presenting with

    <measure>3-month costs (measured in £ per patient) associated with the two clinical groups following the A&amp;E/UCC initial episode</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to estimate the 3-month costs associated with two clinical pathways at A&amp;E/UCC: (i) the current pathway, with x-ray as the only imaging modality (no further imaging group); or (ii) the proposed pathway (MRI group), with a hybrid approach i.e. using x-ray as the initial imaging modality and subsequently MRI for patients with negative findings on the initial x-ray.</description>

    <description>This objective aims to estimate the 6-month costs associated with two clinical pathways at A&amp;E/UCC: (i) the current pathway, with x-ray as the only imaging modality (no further imaging group); or (ii) the proposed pathway (MRI group), with a hybrid approach i.e. using x-ray as the initial imaging modality and subsequently MRI for patients with negative findings on the initial x-ray.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A cost-effectiveness analysis takes into account both the costs and outcomes related to the interventions. An unique incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured as £ per QALY, will be estimated comparing both interventions at 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Cost per correctly diagnosed scaphoid fracture (measured in £ per correct diagnosis)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cost per correctly diagnosed scaphoid fracture with the proposed intervention compared to standard care will be considered to evaluate whether overall potential cost-savings are aligned with the benefits of an improved diagnostic pathway.
Findings from the treatment group (with MRI) and the control group (no further imaging) will be compared against the 3-month 4-view plain x-ray (gold standard). If both imaging findings are consistent, it is considered that a correct diagnosis was achieved.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction in both groups (to be assessed using non-standard questionnaires, based on a 1-5 likert scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient experience will be evaluated using patient questionnaires. The underlying hypothesis is that the use of MRI will promote an improvement in the patient's overall experience, due to: i) a decrease in the need for secondary care contacts; ii) the reduction of plaster casts utilisation; and (iii) an improved and definitive diagnosis and subsequent treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Likelihood ratio of the proposed pathway (i.e. wrist MRI group) in the detection of scaphoid fracture compared to the current pathway (no further imaging group)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The overall likelihood ratio and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the MRI for the early identification of scaphoid fractures in the proposed pathway will be assessed against a 3-month conventional 4-view plain x-ray as the comparator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time (measured in days) taken to reach a definitive diagnosis and the first major treatment decision based on the MRI in comparison to the current pathway</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will evaluate the time required to achieve a definitive diagnosis and deliver the subsequent appropriate treatment. It is considered that a definitive diagnosis is reached once there is agreement between the initial (at A&amp;E/UCC) and/or the follow-up (at fracture clinic) imaging exams and the final 3-month plain x-ray.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of agreement between radiographers and radiologists in the diagnosis of suspected scaphoid fractures</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of agreement between radiographers and radiologists in the diagnosis of suspected scaphoid fractures (i.e. rule in/rule out) using MRI datasets will also be assessed. This information will provide pivotal insight as to how the proposed clinical pathway can operationally be rolled out, as well as future areas of research.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time off work or informal care needs (measured in days) due to the suspected scaphoid fracture.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study aims to assess potential benefits from a broader societal perspective. For this purpose, time off work and informal care required due to the suspected scaphoid fracture will be recorded. The underlying hypothesis is that the use of MRI might reduce the amount of unnecessary plaster casts (i.e. in patients with no scaphoid fracture) and translate into a reduction in days off work and subsequent need for informal care.</description>
