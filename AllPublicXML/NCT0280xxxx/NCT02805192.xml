  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smart phones are omnipresent. Apps exist to calculate size of medical equipment and doses of
      medication if a valid weight or age is entered. During emergency situations, these values are
      often unknown. An App has been developed to measure the size of a child noninvasively. This
      App is now to be validated in clinical practice. App measured size is calculated and compared
      to the real size of a child. Via known percentiles of age/weight of the child is calculated
      upon the App measured size. This value is compared to the mother`s, physician`s and nurses
      estimation of the size and weight.

      Depending on the size multiple algorithms exist to estimate weight, age and medical values.
      (&quot;Kindersicher ®&quot;, &quot;Notfalllineal ®&quot; and &quot;Broselow Tape ®&quot;). These estimations by the
      calculations will also be compared to actual weight and age.

      Children from 0-12 years of age are included in the emergency Department of the Children`s
      Hospital of the University of Zurich after informed consent obtained by the parents. No
      therapy decisions from these calculations will be made. The therapy is independent of this
      study.
