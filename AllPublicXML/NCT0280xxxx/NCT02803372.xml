  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether circulatory management based on
      LiDCOrapid hemodynamic monitoring can reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients
      undergoing partial nephrectomy when compared with routine circulatory management based on
      blood pressure and urine output monitoring

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies found that the incidence of acute kidney injury afer partial nephrectomy is
      higher than 30%. In addition to nephron loss induced by renal parenchyma resection,
      ischemia/reperfusion injury produced by clamping/unclamping of renal arteries is also an
      important reason. However, studies investigating the effect of circulatory management on the
      incidence of acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy are limited.

      It has been shown that perioperative hemodynamic optimization protected renal function in
      surgical patients. And in patients undergoing renal transplantation, adequate hydration and
      optimal perfusion enhances early graft function. The investigators hypothesize that hydration
      and circulatory management to guarantee optimal renal perfusion may decrease the occurrence
      of acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      whether circulatory management based on LiDCOrapid hemodynamic monitoring can reduce the
      incidence of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy when compared
      with routine circulatory management based on blood pressure and urine output monitoring.

    <description>In addition to routine monitoring, invasive LiDCOrapid is used to monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume variation (SVV) and cardiac index (CI). Intraoperative goal-directed circulatory management is performed, i.e., to maintain MAP &gt; 95 mmHg, SVV &lt; 6%, and CI 3.0-4.0 L/min/m2, started from renal artery clamping and maintained until the end of surgery.</description>

    <description>In addition to routine monitoring, invasive LiDCOrapid is used to monitor MAP, SVV and CI. Intraoperative circulatory management is performed according to the goal-directed principal, i.e., to maintain MAP &gt; 95 mmHg, SVV &lt; 6%, and CI 3.0-4.0 L/min/m2, started from renal artery clamping and maintained until the end of surgery. Crystalloid solution is firstly infused to maintain SVV at the target level, dobutamine and/or noradrenaline are then infused to maintain MAP and CI at the target levels.</description>
