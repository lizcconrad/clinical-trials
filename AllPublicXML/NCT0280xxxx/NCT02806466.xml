      -  Background: Asthma is a frequent disease characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness,
           inflammation and remodeling. Consistent epidemiological data indicate that outcome of
           asthma in adults may be determined in early childhood. This may be due to bronchial
           remodeling, an abnormal repair process that contributes to the development of poorly
           reversible airway narrowing. It appears very early in the natural history of the disease
           and involves increased mass of bronchial smooth muscle (BSM). The mechanism of such an
           increase has been related with an increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation.
           Recently, we have demonstrated that in severe asthma, BSM increased proliferation is
           induced by an enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, we have also shown that
           immature human, non-asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) proliferate to a greater
           extent than normal adult ASMC, in a similar fashion to adult asthmatic ASMC. Immature
           ASMC may thus have great potential to stimulate airway remodeling. We thus hypothesized
           that remodeling is an early process and certain characteristics of ASMC in severe
           preschool asthma may predispose such children to persistent remodeling with airway
           obstruction later in life.

        -  Purpose: To investigate prognostic factors of airway remodeling in preschool children,
           with special attention to ASMC proliferation (mitochondrial mass &amp; biogenesis).

        -  Methods: In the initial phase of the project, 75 severe asthmatic preschool children (&lt;5
           yr) will be prospectively recruited from the &quot;CHU de Bordeaux&quot; and the &quot;CHU de Toulouse&quot;
           according to the &quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot; criteria. Inclusion visit will include
           written informed consent, asthma control evaluation, clinical examination, lung function
           testing (exhaled NO, plethysmography), prick tests, chest X Ray and blood sample for
           total IgE levels. Bronchial specimens from all subjects will be obtained by fiberoptic
           bronchoscopy at visit 2. Airway remodeling will be evaluated by morphological analysis.
           After smooth muscle mitochondria will be analyzed by electronic microscopy &amp;
           immunoblotting. Comparison between the 2 groups will be performed by unpaired t tests
           for parametric data and x2-tests for non-parametric data. In the second phase of the
           project, patients will then be followed-up till the age of 7-10 yrs, when another
           bronchoscopy with biopsies will be performed.
