  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether ELECT, a new adhesive foam dressing, can offer an alternative
      to traditional wound care methods.

      Patients will be treated with ELECT for 14 days. Data relating to wound healing, the
      performance of the dressing and the opinion of the doctor will be collected.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the ELECT foam adhesive dressing is 'fit for purpose'
      and will be effective at treating a variety of wounds.

          3. Participant must have a partial thickness burn, acute or chronic wound that would
             benefit from the application of an advanced wound dressing to help facilitate moist
             wound healing

          4. Presence of a suitable wound which can be treated with the available sizes of the
             ELECT Adhesive Foam Dressing (7.5cm x 7.5cm, 12.5cm x 12.5cm, 15cm x 15cm and 17.5cm x
             17.5cm)

          5. Participant is under the direct observation of the investigator for the duration of
             the study (i.e the participant's wound must not be treated by another clinician
             throughout the duration of the study).

             willing to consent to the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Participants with a known history of poor compliance with treatment (including if the
             participant has a known , diagnosed emotional or neurological condition such as mental
             disorders/illnesses, mental retardation, drug or alcohol abuse, that would pre-empt
             their ability to understand and consent)

          2. Participants who are unable to understand the aims and objectives of the study.

          3. Participant is a prisoner.

          4. Participants with a known sensitivity to any of the constituents of the evaluation
             products, including polyester, polyurethane, and acrylic adhesive

          5. Participants with facial wounds as the reference wound

          6. Participants with confirmed or suspected clinically infected reference wounds (unless
             wounds are being treated per standard protocol for wound infection)

          7. Participant is likely to undergo foreseeable definitive surgery within 2 weeks from
             screening

          8. Participants where a reference wound cannot be treated in isolation from other wounds

          9. Participants who have participated in this evaluation previously and closed/100%
