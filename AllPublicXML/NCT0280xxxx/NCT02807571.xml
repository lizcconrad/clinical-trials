  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at determining if office based surgery is an effective way of cutting
      health care cost while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a retrospective chart review with prospective patient satisfaction and
      functional outcome surveys.

      Patients that have had office based procedures that otherwise could be performed in the
      outpatient surgical setting from January 1, 2015 to December 4, 2015 will be contacted for
      study enrollment. Patient satisfaction and functional outcome surveys will be administered to
      those patients that consent to the research study.

      The data to be collected will include but is not limited to: age gender limb dominance,
      complications and co-morbidities.
