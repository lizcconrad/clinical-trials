      The aim of this randomized placebo- controlled clinical trials is to evaluate the effects of
      Lactobacillus reuteri containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct to scaling and root
      planning (SRP). Material and methods: Thirty six gingivitis patients will be recruited and
      monitored clinically at baseline, 3 and 6 month after therapy. All patients will receive
      scaling and periodontal treatment and randomly will be assigned over an experimental (SRP +
      probiotic, N=18) or control (SRP+ placebo, n=18) group. The lozenges will be used once per
      day during 3 month.

      Gingivitis is the most prevalent worldwide periodontal disease, is characterized by
      inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tooth without causing periodontal attachment
      loss. Preventive and / or therapeutic measures to facilitate or improve their control are
      therefore very important, much more if you consider that gingivitis and periodontitis are
      considered part of an ongoing inflammatory process. Treatment of gingivitis, like that of all
      periodontal diseases has been based on the implementation of control measures personal and
      professional plaque. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it has been reported that although
      mechanical therapy achieved significantly decrease the periodontopathogens, this may be only
      temporary since bacteria can recolonize the treated niches in the oral cavity. In this
      context, it has emerged as a new treatment strategy complementary use of probiotics such as
      Lactobacillus reuteri, which possess anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
      Generally speaking, probiotics would promote health by competitive exclusion of some or
      positive pathogenic bacteria. Objective: To evaluate the effect of the administration of
      Lactobacillus reuteri as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy in adolescent and
      young adult patients with gingivitis. Methodology: A randomized double-blind clinical trial
      to evaluate the effect of probiotic lozenges Lactobacillus rhamnosus as an adjunct to
      conventional periodontal treatment of patients with gingivitis will be performed. Expected
      Results: Statistically significant decrease in bleeding and gingival index in the
      experimental group compared with the control.
