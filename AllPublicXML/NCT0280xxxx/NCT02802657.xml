    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different regimens of Conbercept
      (Treat-and-Extend Regimen vs. PRN) in patients with wet AMD. This study is to provide
      long-term safety data in the treatment of patients with wet AMD.

    <description>For the T&amp;E regimen,we recorded patients' data after retreatment by 3 monthly intravitreal injections of Conbercept. Patients were examined 6 weeks after the third injection, with ETDRS visual acuity testing, fundus ophthalmoscopy and photography, and OCT, and treated on the same day. The interval between treatments was extended by 2-week (12-week was a maximum) provided that OCT and fundus examination did not show either exudative manifestations or new macular hemorrhage or active CNV or reduced by 2 weeks (4-week was minimum) in case of such manifestations or hemorrhage. The persistence of pigment epithelium detachment was not considered a condition that justified shortening the interval between injections.</description>

    <description>For the PRN group, we recorded patients'data after retreatment by 3 monthly intravitreal injections of Conbercept.Subsequent reinjections were given as needed according to the changes in patients'visual acuity and/or the exudation shown by OCT. Four to five weeks after the third and last injection, all patients in the PRN group underwent an examination, including ETDRS visual acuity, fundus photography,and OCT. In case of persistent subfoveal or perifoveal fluid, macular intraretinal edema, visual loss of &gt;5 letters, or the occurrence of a new hemorrhage, patients were retreated. The persistence of hemorrhage without evidence of fluid was not considered a criterion for retreatment. In the absence of retreatment criteria, no further injections were given and another examination was proposed usually 4 weeks later.</description>
