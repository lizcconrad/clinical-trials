  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study will enroll participants from routine
      clinical practice in Germany who are receiving tocilizumab for RA. The objective of the study
      is systematic collection of data on use of tocilizumab in daily routine with special emphasis
      on treatment decision by the prescriber, compliance with Summary of Product Characteristics
      (SmPC), and documentation of relevant activity scores and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The
      maximum observation period will be 12 months per participant.

    <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and low platelet count to guide dose decisions. Laboratory values for ALAT and ASAT were to be categorized in reference to the institution-specific upper limit of normal (ULN). Laboratory values for ANC and platelet count were to be categorized in reference to a normal range outlined in the SmPC. This range was 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells per liter (cells/L) for ANC and 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells per microliter (cells/μL) for platelet count. The percentage of participants with greater than or equal to (≥) 1 documented/evaluable laboratory value at Baseline was reported, along with the percentage of participants with categorized laboratory data available for each individual parameter.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With MCII According to DAS28 at Week 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 was derived from assessments of ESR, TJC, SJC, and general health according to 100-mm VAS. DAS28 scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of tender joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in mm/h. DAS28 scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. MCII was defined as DAS28 reduction of ≥1.2 points from Baseline to Week 36.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With AEs Considered Causally Related to Tocilizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (up to 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of tocilizumab. Worsened pre-existing conditions and laboratory or clinical tests that resulted in change or discontinuation of treatment were reported as AEs. The percentage of participants with treatment-related AEs (also known as adverse drug reactions) was reported as a separate endpoint and included both serious and non-serious AEs. Those AEs with a causal relationship reported as &quot;definite&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;, &quot;possible&quot;, or &quot;unlikely&quot; were considered to be related to tocilizumab. If the causal relationship was reported as &quot;unrelated&quot;, the AE was considered not related to tocilizumab treatment. Terms were reported verbatim as coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 12.0. The most common treatment-related AEs were reported, using those from the 10 highest incidence rate levels.</description>

        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 8.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 12</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 12.</description>

            <description>Participants from routine clinical practice in Germany who received tocilizumab for RA according to SmPC were observed for up to 12 months. Tocilizumab must have been selected by the treating physician in advance of the study and was not provided by the Sponsor. According to SmPC, tocilizumab was given as 8 mg/kg via IV infusion at 4-week intervals.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 16</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 16.</description>

        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 20.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 24</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 24.</description>

            <description>Participants from routine clinical practice in Germany who received tocilizumab for RA according to SmPC were observed for up to 12 months. Tocilizumab must have been selected by the treating physician in advance of the study and was not provided by the Sponsor. According to SmPC, tocilizumab was given as 8 mg/kg via IV infusion at 4-week intervals.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 28</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 28.</description>

        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 32.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 36</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 36.</description>

            <description>Participants from routine clinical practice in Germany who received tocilizumab for RA according to SmPC were observed for up to 12 months. Tocilizumab must have been selected by the treating physician in advance of the study and was not provided by the Sponsor. According to SmPC, tocilizumab was given as 8 mg/kg via IV infusion at 4-week intervals.</description>

        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 40.</description>

        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 44.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 48</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 48.</description>

            <description>Participants from routine clinical practice in Germany who received tocilizumab for RA according to SmPC were observed for up to 12 months. Tocilizumab must have been selected by the treating physician in advance of the study and was not provided by the Sponsor. According to SmPC, tocilizumab was given as 8 mg/kg via IV infusion at 4-week intervals.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With or Without Tocilizumab Dose Adjustment or Interruption at Week 52</title>
        <description>SmPC recommendations were specified in the collection of routine laboratory samples for ALAT, ASAT, ANC, and platelet count to guide dose decisions. Dose adjustment was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;1 to 3 × ULN. Dose interruption was recommended in response to ALAT/ASAT values &gt;3 to 5 × ULN, ANC of 0.5 to 1 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count of 50 to 100 × 10^3 cells/μL, until the values returned to acceptable ranges as per the SmPC. Discontinuation of tocilizumab was recommended for any ALAT/ASAT values &gt;5 × ULN, ANC &lt;0.5 × 10^9 cells/L, or platelet count &lt;50 × 10^3 cells/μL. The percentage of participants from each laboratory value category with (&quot;Yes&quot;) or without (&quot;No&quot;) tocilizumab dose adjustment or interruption was reported at Week 52.</description>

        <title>28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Baseline</title>
        <description>The DAS28 was derived from assessments of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and general health according to 100-millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS). DAS28 scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of tender joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h). DAS28 scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The score at Baseline was reported.</description>

        <title>Change in DAS28 From Baseline to Week 20</title>
        <description>The DAS28 was derived from assessments of ESR, TJC, SJC, and general health according to 100-mm VAS. DAS28 scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of tender joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in mm/h. DAS28 scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The change from Baseline to Week 20 was reported, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change in DAS28 From Baseline to Week 44</title>
        <description>The DAS28 was derived from assessments of ESR, TJC, SJC, and general health according to 100-mm VAS. DAS28 scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of tender joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in mm/h. DAS28 scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The change from Baseline to Week 44 was reported, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <description>Participant-assessed disease activity was scored on a 100-mm VAS, where the distance from 0 mm represented the participant's self evaluation of disease activity. Higher scores corresponded to increased disease activity (0 mm = no disease activity and 100 mm = maximum disease activity). The change from Baseline to Week 24 was reported, where negative changes indicated a decrease in participant-assessed disease activity.</description>

        <description>Physician-assessed disease activity was scored on a 100-mm VAS, where the distance from 0 mm represented the physician's evaluation of disease activity. Higher scores corresponded to increased disease activity (0 mm = no disease activity and 100 mm = maximum disease activity). The change from Baseline to Week 52 was reported, where negative changes indicated a decrease in physician-assessed disease activity.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 was derived from assessments of ESR, TJC, SJC, and general health according to 100-mm VAS. DAS28 scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of tender joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in mm/h. DAS28 scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. MCII was defined as DAS28 reduction of ≥1.2 points from Baseline to Week 36.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of tocilizumab. Worsened pre-existing conditions and laboratory or clinical tests that resulted in change or discontinuation of treatment were reported as AEs. The percentage of participants with treatment-related AEs (also known as adverse drug reactions) was reported as a separate endpoint and included both serious and non-serious AEs. Those AEs with a causal relationship reported as &quot;definite&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;, &quot;possible&quot;, or &quot;unlikely&quot; were considered to be related to tocilizumab. If the causal relationship was reported as &quot;unrelated&quot;, the AE was considered not related to tocilizumab treatment. Terms were reported verbatim as coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 12.0. The most common treatment-related AEs were reported, using those from the 10 highest incidence rate levels.</description>
