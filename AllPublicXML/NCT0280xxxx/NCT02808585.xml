  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a sequential multiple-dose escalation study that will enroll (randomize
      and dose) approximately 28 subjects in four cohorts consisting of 3 active and 1 placebo in
      Cohort 1 and 6 active and 2 placebo in subsequent cohorts. Randomized subjects will receive a
      fixed weekly dose of study drug or placebo for a 4 week dosing period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualifying subjects will have a diagnosis of NYHA Class II or III heart failure with a
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), be in stable condition, and be taking clinician-directed
      appropriate pharmacological therapy (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
      angiotensin receptor blockers or an evidence based beta blocker) for heart failure at stable
      doses (with the exception of diuretics) for at least 1 month prior to screening.

      During the period between screening and randomization (planned first dose), the study subject
      will remain on stable pharmacological therapy for heart failure. Also the study subject will
      be in stable health with no hospitalizations or clinically significant acute illnesses
      between screening and randomization that would put the subject at increased risk for study
      participation.

      Randomized subjects will receive a fixed weekly dose of study drug or placebo for a 4 week
      dosing period. Dose escalation in subsequent cohorts will continue if the safety and
      pharmacokinetic profile are deemed acceptable as assessed by the Study Review Committee.
