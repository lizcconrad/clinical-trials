  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies on menu labels have been conducted in mostly non-Hispanic white individuals, and
      how menu labels affect calories and macronutrients ordered in Hispanics is not clearly
      understood. This study evaluated the impact of menu labels on calories and macronutrients
      ordered in Hispanics.

      According to review studies, calorie labels on menus is not effective in reducing the number
      of calories ordered or consumed. Adding contextual information such as the energy needs per
      meal or interpretive information such as minutes of walking needed to burn the food calories
      or rank-ordering the food items from the lowest to the highest calorie content may be more
      effective in making food selections with fewer calories. Most studies on menu labels have,
      however, been conducted in mostly non-Hispanic white individuals, and how menu labels affect
      food choices in Hispanics in not well understood. This study evaluated the impact of menu
      labels on calories and macronutrients ordered in Hispanics by randomly assigning the
      participants to a menu with no labels (no labels), a menu with rank ordered calorie labels
      and a statement on the energy needs per meal (calorie labels), and a menu with rank ordered
      exercise labels (exercise labels). Calories and macronutrients ordered by the participants
      was assessed.
