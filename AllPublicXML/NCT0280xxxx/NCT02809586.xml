  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social media provides frequent interaction with online social networks, increasing exposure
      to peer influences, which could affect alcohol use in negative or positive ways. The proposed
      study will recruit adolescents and emerging adults using social media ads, and conduct online
      screening, enrolling 900 risky drinkers in a randomized controlled trial comparing three
      conditions: 8-week Social Media Intervention + Incentives, 8-week Social Media Intervention
      Only, and an e-news attention control condition. These innovative design features will
      provide the critical next step in harnessing social media to reduce alcohol misuse, which
      could have enormous public health impact by altering the alcohol use trajectories of youth.

      The proposed study will recruit adolescents and emerging adults (ages 16-24) using social
      media ads and conduct online screening, enrolling 900 risky drinkers (i.e., using AUDIT-C
      screener) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing three conditions: 1) Social Media
      Intervention + Incentives (n=300), 2) Social Media Intervention Only (n=300), and 3)
      Attention Control E-News condition (n=300), with post baseline follow-up assessments at 3, 6,
      and 12 months. Interventions will include access for 8 weeks to unique, secret group pages
      facilitated by e-coaches (supervised by therapists), with dynamic content emphasizing
      reducing alcohol use/misuse as well as concomitant risk behaviors (other drug use based on
      co-ingestion and common motives for use).
