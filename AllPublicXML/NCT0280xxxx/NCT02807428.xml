  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of a single
      preoperative intrathecal administration of AYX1 Injection in patients undergoing unilateral
      total knee arthroplasty.

      This is a multi-center, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AYX1 Injection administered intrathecally before surgery
      in patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Subjects will be
      randomized on the day of surgery to receive either intrathecal AYX1 Injection or intrathecal
      placebo just prior to surgery. Study assessments will be conducted during the inpatient
      period through 48 hours; follow-up visits will be performed through Study Day 90.

          -  Medically stable as determined by the Investigator based on pre-study medical history,
             physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
             findings

          -  Body Mass Index of 18-45 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 2 other current focal areas of pain, any pain areas greater in intensity
             than the target knee, or any other active chronic pain conditions that would

          -  Surgery in either knee within 3 months prior to randomization, or surgery in either
             knee greater than 3 months prior to randomization with residual symptoms that would

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids (IV or oral) within 3 months prior to randomization
             through Day 28; planned use of intra-articular steroid injections in the operative
             knee from the time of randomization through Day 28

          -  Current neurologic disorder, which could confound the assessment of pain (e.g.,
             Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis)

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated (in the opinion of the Investigator) active
             depression

          -  Mini Mental State Exam score &lt; 24 at screening

          -  History of alcohol-related complications within 1 year of randomization including, but

          -  Known or suspected history of illicit drug use within 1 year before randomization, or
             current or planned use of marijuana (including medical approved use) within 1 month
             before randomization and/or through the duration of the study

          -  Any confirmed malignancy within the past year, with the exception of basal cell
             carcinoma or uncomplicated or stable skin cancers documented to not require further or
             immediate treatment
