      The purpose of this study is to compare the exercise endurance between oxygen therapy with
      rehabilitation and nasal high flow therapy with rehabilitation for the patients with chronic
      respiratory failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic respiratory failure, pulmonary rehabilitation is recognized as an
      evidence-based treatment in improving exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and
      quality of life. Oxygen supplementation during exercise induced dose-dependent improvement in
      endurance and symptom perception in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Recently,
      nasal high flow therapy which consists of high flow gas with an FiO2 ranging from 0.21 to
      nearly 1.0 adjusted by an oxygen blender, brought to body temperature, and saturated with
      water through an in-line humidifier is available.

      The present study is randomised to compare the effect of exercise endurance between oxygen
      therapy with rehabilitation and nasal high flow therapy with rehabilitation for the patients
      with chronic respiratory failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy.

    <description>The nasal high flow therapy has enabled high flow oxygen to be derived through nasal cannula. This mode not only allows constant FiO2 during peak inspiratory flow but also confers benefits including a low level of continuous positive airway pressure with increased end-expiratory lung volume and reduced work of breathing, partly through intrinsic positive end-expiration pressure compensation and dead space washout. The inspired gases are warmed and humidified, improving comfort and possibly reducing airway inflammation, leading to improved drainage of respiratory secretions.</description>
