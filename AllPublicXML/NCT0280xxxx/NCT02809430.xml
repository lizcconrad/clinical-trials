    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with impaired stroke recovery. Treatment with
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may prevent this but is limited by poor adherence.
      In this study, the investigators will enroll eligible stroke patients undergoing inpatient
      rehabilitation into an intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) with an aim to increase
      tolerance and adherence to auto-titrating CPAP (APAP). The iCAP will include patient
      education and encouragement, device adjustments, close monitoring of adherence and a 3-night
      run-in period of APAP to identify those patients who 1. have OSA and 2. have APAP tolerance.
      If both criteria are met, APAP treatment with iCAP will continue during the rehabilitation
      stay and over a 3-month period. The goal of the intervention is to achieve 50% of subjects
      meeting APAP adherence (an average â‰¥ 4 hours per night) over the 3-month treatment period.
      The investigators will evaluate if demographic, co-morbid or stroke-specific factors predict
      APAP adherence and assess the relationship between APAP adherence and neurological recovery.
      Successful completion of the project will establish the feasibility of a definitive trial
      assessing the ability of APAP to improve stroke recovery in the short-term and reduce the
      risk of recurrent stroke in the long-term.

    <description>Participants will receive 3 nights of auto-CPAP in order to identify those with OSA using flow resistance detected by the device. After 3 nights, those without apparent OSA or with central apnea, and those who simply do not tolerate CPAP will be excluded from the study. An intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) will be initiated, including collaborative care with rehabilitation nurses, the study's sleep technologist and overnight respiratory therapists. After the run-in period, the sleep technologist will meet at least twice weekly with CPAP-tolerant participants during their rehabilitation stay for further OSA education and encouragement with a target adherence of 4 hours per night. Participants diagnosed with OSA by the device and tolerant will continue CPAP therapy during rehabilitation and at home for a treatment period of 3 months. Adherence will be downloaded remotely from participant's machines to encourage adherence to treatment and troubleshoot any problems with the device.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients admitted after acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke to an inpatient
             rehabilitation units

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will exclude participants if: their stroke was a subarachnoid

             tumor, head trauma, or predisposition to bleeding); they have active CPAP use,
             advanced chronic lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen, heart failure (NYHA class
             III or IV); or they needed a nasogastric feeding tube.
