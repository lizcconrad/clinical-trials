      Background: environmental influences in the first years of life have a great impact on
      adulthood. Adequate environmental stimulation in the first years of life positively influence
      cognitive, emotional and neurological development. Studies show that high quality education
      for 3 to 6 years old children are cost-effective for diverse outcomes, such as socioemotional
      and cognitive development, as well as school performance. However, it is not clear why
      specific types of interventions are most effective on school readiness, an important
      precursor of literacy status and later life outcomes. Objectives: adapt to the Brazilian
      context two well-known intervention programs: (1) executive functions training developed by
      Diamond, and (2) oral language skills based on the Nuffield Programme developed by Snowling
      and colleagues. Methods: a randomized controlled trial involving 720 children (4 to 5 years
      old) allocated to three groups: (1) adapted school curriculum focusing on executive functions
      training, (2) adapted school curriculum focusing on oral language skills training, and (3)
      regular school curriculum.
