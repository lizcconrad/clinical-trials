      This is an observational study which aims to evaluate the possibility of using data from a
      capnography device to assess obstructive airway severity in both COPD and Asthma patients.
      The study will include adult asthma and COPD patients (age &gt;18). Patients will be enrolled on
      a continuous basis and will be monitored by capnograph and oximeter before and after lung
      function assessment and also during and after medical treatment.
