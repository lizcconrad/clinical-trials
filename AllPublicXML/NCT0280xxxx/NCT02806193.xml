    <textblock>
      The Global CMR Registry aims to promote collaboration of CMR sites worldwide in setting
      imaging and reporting standards, assessing its diagnostic impact on patient care, and
      determining the cost-effectiveness of CMR imaging. It will be the largest collective body of
      evidence reflecting the current clinical applications in patient care, which healthcare
      payers and governing bodies alike can depend on when metrics such as testing appropriateness,
      common indications, and diagnostic effectiveness are called for. It will also be able to
      reflect any changes in patient impact from CMR over time as technical development evolves.
      Furthermore, it will allow an assessment of improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic
      thinking, risk stratification, and cost-effectiveness relevant to current patient management.

      A global CMR registry can be a crucial infrastructure of our CMR community that has many
      benefits. First, it is the largest collective body of evidence reflecting the current
      clinical applications in patient care, which healthcare payers and governing bodies alike can
      depend on when metrics such as testing appropriateness, common indications, and diagnostic
      effectiveness are needed. Second, it reflects any change in patient impact from CMR over time
      as technical developments evolve. Third, it allows an assessment for improvement of
      diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation, risk stratification, and cost-effectiveness analysis
      relevant to patient management.

      Some practical questions that a global CMR registry may be able ot address include:

        1. Variations in CMR protocols within specific clinical indications

        2. Variations in CMR post-processing, analysis, and reporting

        3. Practice adherence to appropriateness criteria and guidelines

        4. Clinical effectiveness of CMR over a long period of clinical application and/or
           technological advance

        5. Differences in CMR utility across centers, regions, or countries

      The data collection process will be a collective effort on part of specialized health
      professionals across various CMR sites worldwide. All of the data will be extracted from
      existing registries and databases. Health professionals in the U.S. and abroad will first
      upload patient data and images onto the registry/database that they currently use. Then if
      they choose to, they can transmit relevant patient de-identified data onto the global
      registry using a user-friendly web interface. CMR sites without a database will be invited to
      use CMR Cooperative or REDCAP. De-identified data (usually submitted in excel or CSV format)
      will be harmonized and uploaded to the registry website (www.gcmr-scmr.org), which is a
      firewall and password-protected database that resides at an IT vendor (Center for Systems
      Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital) in Boston, Massachusetts. The pooled data will be
      used for retrospective analysis/research approved by the GCMR steering committee and SCMR.

    <description>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as both a remarkably powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for the assessment of cardiovascular disease. The high spatial resolution of CMR and the ability to characterize soft tissue provides the opportunity for unique diagnostic assessment of a myriad of cardiac pathology, including ischemic heart disease (IHD), preoperative assessment, intra- cardiac mass and thrombus, pericardial disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy evaluation.
Between individual CMR programs, GCMR will offer information useful in assessing the differences in protocol, performance, and clinical adaptation by varying geographic regions, institutional environments, and expertise. Such an assessment is critical for uncovering possible reasons for disparities in performance and obtaining opportunities for advancement.</description>

    <ipd_description>Participating sites will send relevant de-identified to the data management team for harmonization. The aggregate data will be used for retrospective analyses and research. Researchers requesting data access for either grant proposals or sub-studies will be required to submit a proposal to the GCMR steering committee (composed of various experts in the CMR community) for approval.
If approved, data access will be given to the researchers for a specific time period determined by the magnitude of the work involved, and only for the purposes of the grant proposal or sub-study.</ipd_description>
