    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study
      design to comprehensively investigate the impact of 8-weeks of dietary nitrate
      supplementation on skeletal muscle blood flow, mitochondrial function, and exercise capacity
      in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) demonstrate a reduced exercise capacity, a powerful
      predictor of cardiovascular mortality, which may be due to reductions in skeletal muscle
      perfusion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key molecule involved in in
      the regulation of blood flow to contracting muscles, as well as a critical mediator in
      mitochondrial respiration. However, there appears to be a decreased enzymatic synthesis of NO
      and an overall reduction of bioavailable NO in patients with T2D, which likely contributes to
      the reduced exercise capacity and tolerance. Accumulating evidence suggests that exogenous
      nitrate supplementation is an effective option for increasing NO bioavailability in vivo. The
      purpose of the proposal is to use a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study design
      to comprehensively investigate the impact of 8-weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation on
      skeletal muscle blood flow, mitochondrial function, and exercise capacity in patients with
      T2D. The central hypothesis is that increasing NO bioavailability via dietary nitrate
      supplementation in patients with T2D will lead to improved oxygen delivery and utilization
      during exercise. To address this hypothesis a highly mechanistic and translational
      experimental strategy will be used to explore whether increased NO bioavailability via
      dietary nitrate supplementation improves skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise (Aim 1),
      enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Aim 2), and improves exercise capacity and
      efficiency (Aim 3). Collectively, these studies will provide important mechanistic insight
      into the therapeutic potential of dietary nitrate supplementation for improving skeletal
      muscle blood flow, mitochondrial function and exercise capacity in patients with T2D.

    <description>Muscle biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis using a Bergstrom needle with suction under local anesthesia, which will yield ~200-250mg of tissue. Mitochondrial function will be assessed as follows: Fiber bundles will be chemically permeabilized with saponin and mitochondrial respiration will be analyzed by in situ high-resolution respirometry at 37Â°.</description>
