  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators could hypothesize that age-related changes in body composition parameters
      play a role in the variable tolerance to chemotherapy in the elderly.

      However none of the studies relating body composition and chemotoxicity included elderly as a
      specific subpopulation. Furthermore in the majority of studies, body composition analyses are
      based on the estimation of muscle mass by CT scanner (axial L3 section). This method is to
      date not validated in the elderly cancer patients. Nevertheless some studies used Dual Energy
      X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), which is considered the gold standard in the assessment of body
      composition in older adults.

      The investigators main hypothesis is that the appendicular muscle mass (I.e. muscle mass of
      the 4 limbs) operationalized as an index by dividing the muscle mass by squared height
      following Baumgartners' approach (Baumgartner, 1998) measured by DEXA (total of muscle mass
      of 4 limbs / height ²) represents a predictive factor of chemotoxicity in the elderly.

      The finding that body composition is associated with poor tolerance of chemotherapy could
      lead to consider these parameters in the treatment decision of the elderly cancer patients
      and improve the current decision-making algorithms when treating older adults.
