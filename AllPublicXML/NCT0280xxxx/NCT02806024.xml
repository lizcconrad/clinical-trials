  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) is
      effective for reducing blood loss during high risk surgical procedures related to placenta
      previa and placenta accreta. TXA is currently used in other types of surgery for patients who
      are expected to have a large blood loss, such as orthopedic or open heart surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no novel or pharmacologic methods of reducing blood loss have been described for
      women at risk for placenta accreta. Intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA), a drug with
      anti-fibrinolytic activity, is routinely used in elective orthopedic and cardiac surgery to
      reduce blood loss. Intravenous tranexamic acid is currently FDA approved for use in patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery or total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty to reduce
      peri- and post-operative blood loss and to reduce the need for blood transfusion. There has
      been growing interest in the application of tranexamic acid in obstetrics and gynecology. In
      multiple international studies, intravenous TXA has been shown to significantly reduce blood
      loss when given prophylactically with cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery without an
      increase in morbidity from adverse thrombotic events. TXA has not been studied in the
      particular population of patients requiring cesarean hysterectomy for placenta previa or
      accreta. This inexpensive, low risk medication has potential to greatly reduce perioperative
      morbidity and cost when used in a high risk obstetrical population.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to treatment or placebo arms preoperatively. In our treatment arm of pregnant patients with suspected placenta accreta or at high risk for placenta accreta, patients will receive 1 gram intravenous TXA administered over 10 minutes immediately after delivery of the infant. The drug will be prepared and ready to hang at the beginning of the case. The study drug will be administered only once.</description>
