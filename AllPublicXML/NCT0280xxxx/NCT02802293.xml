  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical effects (if any) of
      connectivity-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of
      major depressive disorder (MDD) to provide clues about the ideal neural networks to target
      for more robust clinical outcomes, and to identify potential biomarkers of treatment response
      including changes in brain network connectivity.

      The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, 4-week trial of TMS to the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for subjects with MDD all of whom at the patient's
      treatment clinic are concurrently receiving pharmaceutical and psychotherapeutic
      interventions. Arm 1 delivers active rTMS to the left DLPFC using the standard aiming
      strategy. Arm 2 delivers active rTMS to the left anterior DLPFC using connectivity-based,
      image-guided aiming. Arm 3 delivers active rTMS to the left posterior DLPFC using
      connectivity-based, image-guided aiming. In all three arms, rTMS is administered in an
      image-guided, robotically-positioned TMS (irTMS) manner to ensure therapist blinding and
      equivalent subject experiences across arms. In all three arms, the following stimulation
      protocol will be used: 10 Hz irTMS delivered in 4 sec trains with 26 sec inter-train
      intervals, 37.5 minutes/session (i.e. 3,000 pulses/session), 5 sessions/week, for 4 weeks.
      Neuroimaging will be used both for treatment planning and to characterize any TMS-induced
      network plasticity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) at
      week 4 of each treatment arm. Clinical assessments will be administered weekly throughout
      treatment (weeks 1-4) at the patient's treatment clinic. Additional psychological tests will
      be performed at UT Healthâ€”San Antonio's Research Imaging Institute (RII) at the baseline and
      post-treatment visits in order to track patient progress.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Males or females with MDD receiving treatment at the iKare Mood Trauma Recovery Clinic
        between the ages of 18-65 years; 2) Meeting the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and
        Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for MDD as determined using the
        Mini-International Psychiatric Interview (MINI) 3) Meeting the Patient Health
        Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9 &gt; 14) and/or the Structured Interview Guide for the
        Montgomery-Ashberg Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA&gt;18) criteria for treatment resistance in
        MDD despite completing at least one adequate trial of an Selective Serotonin Reuptake
        Inhibitor (SSRI) or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) at an
        FDA-recommended dose for at least 6-8 weeks. 4) Subjects on SSRIs or other antidepressants,
        hypnotic medications including modulators of Gamma-Aminobutryic Acid (GABA)-A receptor
        function, trazodone, atypical neuroleptic or other psychotropic medications such as
        prazosin may enter the study if they are deemed to be on a stable dose of their medication.
        5) Able to provide written informed consent. 6) Able to read and write English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Subjects with a diagnostic history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective
        disorder or currently exhibiting psychotic features as confirmed by MINI. 2) Serious,
        active suicidal risk as assessed by evaluating psychiatrist. Serious active suicidal risk
        is determine as imminent risk of suicide reflected in a subject having a plan and intent to
        end his or her life. History of suicidality in itself is not exclusion for participation in
        this protocol so long as the evaluating psychiatrist determines that there is an absence of
        serious active suicidal risk and the means to keep subjects safe. 3) Substance use disorder
        during the 3 months prior to screening; except for Mild or Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder
        according to DSM-V criteria. 4) Any history or signs of serious medical or neurological
        illness including seizure disorders. Except for seizures, a subject with a clinical
        abnormality may be included only if the study clinician considers the illness will not
        introduce additional risk and will not interfere with the study procedures. 5) Females will
        be excluded if they are pregnant (i.e. positive pregnancy test identified after their
        intake at the treatment clinic). 6) History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with loss of
        consciousness for 20 minutes or more as determined by the Brief Traumatic Brain Injury
        Screen (TBI Screening Tool). 7) Any history or signs of metal objects (e.g. surgical clips,
        cardiac pacemakers, metal implants, etc.) in the body at the time of screening. MRI can
        have risks for persons with foreign bodies implanted in their body.
