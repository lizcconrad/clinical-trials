    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter aortic
      valve replacement in Chinese population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled are those who undergo physical exams and screening tests and were
      classified as a patient with symptomatic aortic stenosis or severe aortic regurgitation. They
      are then performed transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
