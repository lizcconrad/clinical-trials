  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label, single dose, 5 parallel-group study in which a single 400 mg
      dose of pacritinib will be administered orally to patients with renal impairment (mild,
      moderate, severe, and patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis) and sex-, age- and
      weight-matched healthy subjects.Patients with ESRD will receive a single 400 mg dose of
      pacritinib during 2 different treatment periods: Dialysis and Inter-Dialysis. The primary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of pacritinib in renal
      impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Groups 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 8 patients each with mild, moderate, or severe renal
      disease, respectively, based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated
      by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation). Each of these patients
      will receive a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib.

      Group 4 will consist of 8 patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis who have been on a stable
      dialysis regimen for at least 6 months. In this cohort only, patients will participate in 2
      treatment periods, Dialysis and Inter-Dialysis, separated by a 14-day period between
      pacritinib administration. In the Dialysis Treatment Period, a single 400 mg dose of
      pacritinib will be administered 4 hours prior to each patient's normally scheduled
      hemodialysis. In the Inter-Dialysis Treatment Period, a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib will
      be administered immediately after the end of the patient's normally scheduled hemodialysis
      session.

      Group 5 will consist of 8 healthy subjects enrolled to match the sex-, age-, and weight of
      the patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and patients with ESRD enrolled
      in the study. Healthy subjects will be administered a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib.

             Check-in:

               -  Clinically significant (as judged by the Investigator in consultation with the

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL

             Laboratory testing may be repeated once prior to dosing (to rule out any possible
             laboratory error)

         31. Planned surgery during the study period

         32. Subjects who are deemed vulnerable by way of imprisonment, remand or detention

             Patients with Renal Impairment Only

             In addition to the exclusion criteria specified for &quot;All Subjects&quot; above, any patient
             with renal impairment who meets the following criteria will be excluded from entry
             into the study:

         33. Any condition that would compromise patients' safety during study participation

         34. Participants in Groups 1-3: Difficulty voiding or urinary tract obstruction at
             Check-in or undergoing any method of dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis)

         35. Screening physical exam or ECG finding considered of clinical significance by the
             Investigator, or a laboratory evaluation outside of the normal reference range with
             the exception of values that are related to renal impairment

         36. Any significant acute or chronic disease (except renal impairment) which is unstable
             or can interfere with the objectives of the study

         37. Any change in stable dose regimens, either over-the-counter or prescription, for
             chronic medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, dyslipidemia, renal impairment) within 4
             weeks preceding dosing

             Healthy Subjects Only

             In addition to the exclusion criteria specified for &quot;All Study Participants&quot; above,
             any healthy subject who meets the following criteria will be excluded from entry into
             the study:

         38. Any screening or baseline physical exam, EKG, or laboratories outside the normal range
             and deemed clinically significant by the Investigator. Results deemed not clinically
             significant by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor are allowable.

         39. Use of any prescription medications and/or products within 14 days prior to Check-in
             (Day -1) and during the entire study

         40. History of renal impairment
