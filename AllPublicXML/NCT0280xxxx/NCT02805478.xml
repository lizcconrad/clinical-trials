    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of cardiovascular risk factors and arterial or cardiac
      function in subjects with overweight or obesity. Subjects must be between 30 and 65 years of
      age, have a body mass index &gt;27.0 kg/m2 and free from known heart disease and digestive or
      psychiatric disorders. Study aims include identifying sex-differences in traditional
      cardiovascular risk factors and structural and functional abnormalities in arteries and the
      heart in subjects with overweight or obesity, and how this is influenced by physical fitness.

      FATCOR is an observational study of women and men with overweight or obesity. In particular
      prevalences of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical arterial or cardiac
      dysfunction are explored. The study aims at identifying sex differences in presence and
      clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and presence of subclinical cardiovascular organ
      damage. The influence of physical fitness on these factors will also be assessed. All
      participants undergo extensive cardiovascular risk factor assessment including oral glucose
      tolerance test and ambulatory blood pressure recording. Subclinical cardiovascular
      dysfunction is assessed by carotid and femoral vascular ultrasound, echocardiography and
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity using applanation tonometry. Physical fitness is assessed
      from peak oxygen uptake during maximal exercise testing on a treadmill.
