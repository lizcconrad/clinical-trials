      Evaluate the feasibility of an autologous cell preparation composed of a mixture of cells
      enriched for endothelial progenitor cells (EnEPCs) and multipotent adult hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) (BGC101), in the treatment of patients suffering from peripheral
      arterial disease (PAD) with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who have not responded to optimal
      pharmacological treatment or control of risk factors and/or had a revascularization failure,
      and do not have the option of further revascularization treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have the time and ability to complete the study and comply with instructions.

          2. Capable of understanding the purpose of the study and the contents of the informed
             consent form

          3. Age &gt; 18 Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female

          4. At least one of the clinical diagnostic indications of CLI:

               -  Clinical assessment as Rutherford 4-5

               -  Rest pain

               -  Non-healing ischemic ulcers

               -  Minor tissue loss

          5. At least one of the hemodynamic indicators of severe peripheral arterial occlusive
             disease:

               -  Ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.45

               -  Toe brachial index (TBI) &lt;0.4

               -  TcPO2 &lt; 40mmHg

               -  A poor candidate for standard revascularization treatment options for peripheral
                  arterial disease due to (1) unfavorable anatomy (e.g. small vessel disease with
                  no major vessel stenosis/obstruction) OR (2) continued presence of smaller vessel
                  microvasculature) disease six weeks or more after revascularization (performed as
                  part of standard care) based on patency of the treated vessel(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for this study.

          1. Concurrent therapy that, in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the study medication.

          2. Treatment with any investigational product within the last 6 months or enrollment in
             any active study involving the use of investigational devices or drugs.

          3. Presence of any other condition or circumstance that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, might increase the risk to the patient or decrease the chance of
             obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study.

          4. Based on clinician opinion - prognosis of a major amputation (below or above the knee)
             within 4 weeks from the assessment visit

          5. Lack of femoral artery blood flow

          6. Based on clinician opinion inability to perform intramuscular injections in cases such
             as sever skin lesions, severe edema or morbid obesity

          7. Blood transfusions during preceding 4 weeks (to exclude the potential of
             non-autologous cells in the harvested blood)

          8. Heart failure (NYHA 3-4)

          9. Hgb Less than 9gm

         10. Myocardial infarction, brain infarction, uncontrolled myocardial ischemia or
             persistent severe heart failure (EF&lt; 25 %) during the preceding 3 months

         11. Significant valvular disease or after valve replacement (based on medical record)

         12. Renal failure (eGFR &lt;30, Chronic Kidney Damage Stage 4-5)

         13. Liver function tests are more than three times normal upper limit (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT,
             LDH).

         14. Abnormal coagulation tests (PT(INR) &gt;2)

         15. Pregnant or lactating women at entry to study

         16. People who are unwilling to agree to use acceptable methods of contraception such as
             condom from screening during the study to prevent pregnancy and chronic infectious
             diseases (such as HIV-1,HIV-2, HBV, HCV)

         17. Malignancy within the preceding 3 years, except for BCC

         18. Concurrent acute infectious disease with septicemia

         19. Chronic infectious diseases (HIV-1,HIV-2, Hepatitis viruses B and C)

         20. Immunodeficiency syndrome

         21. Cytotoxic drugs treatment

         22. Inability to communicate (that may interfere with the clinical evaluation of the
             patient)

         23. Patient unlikely to be available for follow-up
