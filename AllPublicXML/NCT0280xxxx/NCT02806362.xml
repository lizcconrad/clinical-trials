    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, single-arm, combination-drug study, which includes 12 weeks
      of treatment and 24 weeks of follow-up, is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in Japanese adults infected with HCV
      GT1b, who are treatment-na√Øve or treatment-experienced to an IFN-based regimen and who have
      ESRD on HD.

    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving a 12-week sustained virologic response (SVR12).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 defined as the hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) level less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with on-treatment virologic failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>On-treatment virologic failure was defined as the following:
Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements greater than 1 log10 IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during treatment; or Confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to LLOQ after HCV RNA is less than LLOQ during treatment; or HCV RNA greater than or equal to LLOQ persistently during treatment with at least 6 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with a confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to the LLOQ between Final treatment visit and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants completing treatment and with HCV RNA less than LLOQ at Final treatment visit.</description>
