    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study will be to determine whether the proposed study protocol
      will allow for reliable detection of the human Laryngeal evoked brainstem responses (LEBR).
      Laryngeal evoked brain stem responses will be recorded from five test subjects under general
      anesthesia in the operating room with the assistance of an electrophysiologist with expertise
      in evoked potentials. Once the feasibility of obtaining tracings are established on the first
      few subjects, responses will be recorded from other test subjects with the aim of determining
      the optimal placement of stimulating electrodes and detection leads necessary to elicit an
      adequate response. The effect of varying the stimulus intensity will also be studied. Once
      parameters for testing have been standardized, normative configurations for the laryngeal
      evoked brainstem response tracings can be determined by patients both in the office setting
      and in the operating room.

    <description>Endoscope will be connected to a camera and monitor. Needle electrodes will then be positioned into the false vocal fold mucosa bilaterally, under direct visualization of the needle tip on the monitor, but the needles will be passed trans-orally in the operating room. For those participating during an open-neck surgery, the surgery will commence as planned and once exposure of the superior laryngeal nerve is obtained, the surgeon will insert the electrodes directly into the nerve trunk for the purposes of recording. In Surgery or cervical lymphadenectomy, the electrode will be placed at a superficial depth and needle placement will be performed with one on each side at a location approximately mid-fold.</description>
