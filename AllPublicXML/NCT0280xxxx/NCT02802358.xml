      Objectives: To describe social and health care provided to our older patients who have been
      admitted in the emergency department (ED) after suffering from a hip or wrist fracture due to
      a fall. To compare among the different hospitals and town halls, the health and social care
      that participants received. To compare the functional dependency and health related quality
      of life (HRQoL) presented by the patients immediately and six months after a fall.

      Methodology: Prospective Cohort study. One hundred and fifty patients suffering from each
      type of fracture (hip or wrist) will be recruited consecutively in the Basque Health System's
      participant hospitals sub-project. Within 3 sub-projects, more than 3000 cases are expected
      to be collected. Data will be collected from ED and hospital clinical records and by means of
      questionnaires to measure functional dependency (Barthel and Lawton indexes) and HRQoL
      (SF-36) requesting information on status before the fall, immediately and six months later.
      In addition to this, data referred to care provided to the patients by traumatologist,
      rehabilitation or primary care provider as well as social services in their homes after the
      index episode will be collected.
