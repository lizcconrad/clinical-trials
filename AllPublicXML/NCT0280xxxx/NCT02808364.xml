  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma is limited. Immune cell based therapy for
      glioblastoma has shown some efficacy. This study is designed to perform a personalized
      clinical trial by first analyzing the expression of tumor associated antigens in patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma and then immunizing the patients with personalized cellular
      vaccines including autologous tumor cells, antigen pulsed DCs and allogeneic peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Safety and efficacy will be observed in this study.

      This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I/II study designed to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular vaccines for patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Recurrent GBM patients will undergo tumor resection. The tumors
      will be analyzed for the expression of a panel of glioma-associated antigens and
      immune-related genes. The tumor cells will be irradiated and used as vaccines. Patients will
      undergo leukapheresis to collect mononuclear cells for DC generation. Based on the expression
      profiles of tumor-associated antigens, in vitro transcribed mRNA will be generated to pulse
      autologous DCs or allogeneic PBMCs. Patients will be conditioned with immune adjuvants before
      and during immunization. Patients will receive a total of twelve vaccines consisting of
      autologous tumor cells, DCs or PBMCs. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The primary
      objective is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines. The secondary
      objective is to assess the efficacy of the vaccines using iRANO criteria, progression-free
      survival and overall survival. In addition, the antitumor specific T cell responses will be
      measured.
