    <description>The WallFlex™ Pancreatic RX Fully Covered Soft Stent System consists of a flexible delivery system preloaded with a self-expanding pancreatic metal stent. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will receive the WallFlex Pancreatic stent for up to 6 months stent indwell and 6 months follow-up after stent removal. A patient is considered &quot;enrolled&quot; after signing the study-specific Informed Consent Form (ICF). Patients who sign the ICF but subsequently do not meet one or more of the selection criteria will be considered screen failures and excluded from the study.</description>

          -  Chronic pancreatitis induced stricture of Cremer Type IV, namely distal dominant
             stricture with upstream ductal dilation.

          -  For patients with one prior plastic pancreatic stent: VAS Pain Score and Frequency of
             Pain sectors of the Izbicki pain scale at the time of placement of the plastic stent.

          -  Availability of narcotic dosage for at least one month prior to baseline visit for
             patients who do not have a prior plastic stent or availability for one month prior to
             placement of prior plastic stent, where applicable.

          -  VAS Pain Score of ≥ 20 before study stent placement for patients without a prior
             plastic pancreatic stent. VAS Pain Score of ≥ 20 before initial plastic pancreatic
             stent placement for patients with a prior plastic pancreatic stent indwelling for 90
             days or less before study stent placement. VAS Pain Score is captured via Izbicki pain
             scale.

          -  Pain occurring weekly or more frequently (assessed by Frequency of Pain sector of the
             Izbicki pain scale) as reported before study stent placement for patients without a
             prior plastic pancreatic stent, or before placement of initial plastic pancreatic
             stent for patients with a prior plastic pancreatic stent indwelling for 90 days or
             less before study stent placement.

          -  Minimum 5 mm diameter of dilated duct immediately upstream of pancreatic duct
             stricture

                  procedure at the discretion of the Investigator, for example, if there is concern
                  about stone fragments of stone sludge in side branches of the pancreatic duct,
                  and may be left indwelling for 30-90 days.
