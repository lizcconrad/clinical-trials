  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates from the patient's perspective which elements of the own artistic
      creative process are the source of a beneficial change for him/her and how those elements
      influence in their end of life experience.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous quantitative studies about the effect of an art therapy intervention in adult
      cancer inpatients of the Palliative Care Unit, the investigators evidenced significant
      improvements in the symptom control of malaise, anxiety, depression and pain.

      This study is designed to deepen the understanding of specific action mechanisms which lead
      to those therapeutic benefits and quality of life implications for patients with
      life-threatening illness in which a situation of suffering is frequently detected.

      The investigators will determine from the subjective patient's experience which specific
      elements of the artistic creative process (including production of art and art products) may
      lead to changes in the symptom perception, in meaning and healing process and in the personal
      perspective about the end of life situation.
