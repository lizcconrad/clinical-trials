  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The great majority of cardiac surgery patients develop a degree of post-operatory respiratory
      failure. This is due to several factors. The predominant element in the onset of this
      respiratory impairment is the constitution of foci of pulmonary atelectasis, caused by
      peroperative hypoventilation (in the presence or absence of ECC). The incidence has been
      evaluated at between 54% and 92%, depending on the study. The use of NIV (non-invasive
      ventilation) might (through the application of continuous positive expiratory pressure) help
      to counter the development of these atelectasic foci.
