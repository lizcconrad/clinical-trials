  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance study of 400
      mg [14C]pacritinib (containing 100 μCi radioactivity) administered orally as a single dose to
      6 healthy male subjects following at least a 10-hour fast (not including water) on Day 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to investigate the absorption, metabolism, excretion as well as
      safety/tolerability of pacritinib following the administration of a single oral dose to
      healthy male volunteers. The pacritinib dose is administered with a [14C]-labeled form to
      enable detection and quantitation of dose-related material independent of possible
      biotransformation. The study design allows detection of potential human specific metabolites
      that have not been detected in the animal species. Subjects are confined at the clinical site
      from the time of Check-in until Day 14 post-dose, but may be discharged from the clinical
      site between Day 10 and 13 post-dose if study discharge criteria are met (i.e. completion of
      sufficient radioactivity excretion). All remaining subjects will be discharged from the
      clinical site on Day 14 post-dose irrespective of the study discharge criteria. The data
      obtained in this study will be used for the further clinical development of the compound.

             systolic and 50-90 mmHg diastolic, resting heart rate (HR) between 40-100 beats/min,
             temperature (T) less than or equal to 37.6 degree C])

          -  Body mass index of 19.0-29.0 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Negative history of drug abuse or alcoholism within 1 year prior to Day 1

          -  Negative tests on drug and alcohol screen at Screening and Check-in

          -  Negative hepatitis panel including hepatitis B-surface antigen HBsAg], hepatitis C
             antibody [anti-HCV] and negative human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV)

          -  No clinical laboratory value outside of the normal reference range unless deemed not
             clinically significant by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor

          -  Fertile male subjects and fertile female sexual partners of male subjects agree to use
             effective birth control methods throughout the entire study. Female partners of
             childbearing potential must use highly effective methods (defined as those resulting
             in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly). The
             contraceptive methods considered highly effective are intrauterine devices and
             hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal
             vaginal devices, or injections with prolonged release). Male subjects must use a
             condom with spermicide paste for the duration of the study and for 90 days after the
             EOS evaluation. When abstinence is used as a method of birth control, only true
             abstinence is acceptable, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the subject. Periodic abstinence (calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  Agreement to not donate sperm throughout the entire study and for 3 months after the
             end of the study

          -  Willingness to comply with the protocol, including restrictions on diet, physical
             activity, and use of alcohol, medications, and other drugs during the study

             interpretation of study results (such as gastrointestinal surgical history (except
             appendectomy), ileus or obstructive uropathy)

          -  Diarrhea, nausea or vomiting within 7 days of Day 1

             Investigator

          -  Any history of severe allergic reaction (including drugs, food, insect bites,
             environmental allergens)

          -  Known history or presence of food allergies or any condition known to interfere with

          -  Donation of blood 30 days prior to Screening through end of study

          -  Employment in a position that exposes the subject to radiation or requires that the
             subject's degree of radiation exposure be monitored (e.g. radiology technician)
