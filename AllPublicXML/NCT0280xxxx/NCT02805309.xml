  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure for older
      adults with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical
      aortic valve replacement. Despite symptomatic and survival benefits, many patients experience
      functional decline after TAVR. This pilot study aims to test the feasibility of a home-based
      exercise intervention targeting endurance, strength, and balance as well as cognitive
      behavioral intervention to improve physical functioning and disability after TAVR.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that a home-based exercise program with cognitive behavioral intervention is
      more effective than home-based exercise alone; home-based exercise program with and without
      cognitive behavioral intervention is more effective than attention control educational
      intervention in preventing decline in physical function and disability after TAVR.

    <description>Exercises will target balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). Home visits will take place twice a week for week 1 and 2; once a week for week 3 and 4; every other week for week for week 5 through week 8. Participants are instructed to do prescribed exercises for 30 minutes daily. The duration of this intervention is about 40 mins.</description>
