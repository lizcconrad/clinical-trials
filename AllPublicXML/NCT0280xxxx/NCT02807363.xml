  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study will determine the safety and provide
      evaluation of the PK/PD metrics of three different oral doses selected upon the results of
      the study LOPDT-PH1-01 - 4 mg oral tablets administered over 28 days as QD and BID regimens
      and 10 mg oral tablets administered over 28 days as a BID regimen. The PK/PD profiles of the
      study drug will be compared to the leuprolide formulation approved for the treatment of
      endometriosis (a monthly intramuscular injection, Lupron Depot 3.75 mg). Major PK (e.g., a
      total exposure to leuprolide) and PD parameters (e.g., rates of the estradiol suppression and
      cessation of the menstrual period) will also be evaluated against the Lupron Depot historical
      data.
