      The purpose of this project is to develop an intervention to improve psychosocial functioning
      and quality of life for older Veterans with partial or full PTSD.

    <textblock>
      This project will develop, implement, and evaluate a group protocol geared toward restoring
      older Veterans to better, fuller functioning. This project will determine the feasibility and
      acceptability of such an intervention. The intervention developed will then be compared to a
      support group control condition. Primary outcomes are psychosocial functioning and quality of
      life, with PTSD and depressive symptoms as secondary outcomes. A complementary objective is
      to improve attitudes toward mental health treatment and to increase readiness for change and
      engagement in evidence-based psychotherapies, as appropriate. Results from this study will
      provide feasibility data for future development and testing of the intervention protocol.

    <measure>Change in the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to follow-up at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLI is a 32 item self-report measure that assesses life satisfaction across 16 life domains (e.g., health, work, recreation). For each domain, the respondent rates how important the domain is on a 0-2 scale and how satisfied he or she is in this area of life on a 7-point scale. Satisfaction scores on the measure are weighted based on the respondent's rating of the importance of the life domain in order to achieve a total score. The measure was validated across a number of samples, including psychiatric inpatient and outpatient VA samples. Test-retest reliability was excellent over a one-month interval (r = .91) as was the internal consistency of the measure (alphas ranged from .86-.89). The measure also demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity with other measures of life satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to follow-up at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IPF is an 80-item self-report measure designed to assess multiple domains of functional impairment experienced by Veterans. Respondents rate how often they have acted a certain way over the past 30 days. Items are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 6 (&quot;always&quot;). The IPF yields a total score and scores for seven subscales: romantic relationships, family, work, friendships and socializing, parenting, education, and self-care functioning. Respondents have the option to skip sections that do not apply to them. The IPF has excellent internal consistency reliability (overall alpha = .93) and the scale correlates with other self-report measures of quality of life and functional impairment, such as the QOLI (r = .59).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to follow-up at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VR-12 is a 12-item scale that assesses the effects of physical and mental health on well-being, and is often used to assess quality of life. Item scores are used to compute two broad component scores: the physical component score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS). The component scores are standardized T-Scores (M = 50, SD = 10) and the population standard for this measure was recently updated</description>
