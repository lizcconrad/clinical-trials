  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well the body absorbs the carotenoid
      beta-cryptoxanthin (BCX) from a type of corn that has been naturally bred (not genetically
      engineered) to contain higher amounts of BCX than traditional breeds of corn. Because this
      new type of corn contains higher amounts of BCX, it appears more orange in color than
      traditional types of corn. Understanding how well the body can absorb the BCX from the corn
      may help companies develop food products that may have improved nutritional quality.

      Randomized, blinded, 3 x 3 crossover intervention. Each treatment will last 12 d, followed by
      a 7-d wash-out period. After the washout, subjects will go back to their regular diet for two
      weeks before beginning the next cycle. Subjects will report to the research kitchen in the
      Nutritional Sciences building for their breakfast. Maize will be incorporated into two
      muffins. Other food choices will be yogurt and other low-fiber foods. Blood samples will be
      taken at baseline and days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 19. Natural abundance measurements of
      13-carbone to 12-carbon will be taken at baseline, day 12 and day 19. Retinol isotope
      dilution testing will be done at the end of the study to determine total body stores of
      vitamin A in the subjects. This will include the day 19 blood sample of intervention phase 3
      and a final blood sample 14 days after the isotope dose administration.
