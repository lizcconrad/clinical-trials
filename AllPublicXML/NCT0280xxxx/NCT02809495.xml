  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-skin tumor in men and the second leading cause of
      death from cancer in Brazil. It accounts for 13.8% of deaths from cancer in males, similar to
      what happens with breast cancer in females, corresponding to 15.8% of cancer deaths in women.
      Mobile applications, software developed for smartphones and tablets used for many different
      purposes (games, communication, entertainment etc) have become important tools of mHealth
      (Mobile Health in Portuguese - mobile health) as they allow remote support to patients or
      self-promotion of health care. It has been used globally to assist in the treatment and
      control of various diseases such as diabetes, physical inactivity, and many others. In
      oncology there are several applications developed to assist in the monitoring and treatment
      of various cancers such as gastric and breast cancer. So far it has not developed an
      application for follow-up of patients with PC, to capture data on satisfaction of
      post-treatment patient regarding the comorbidity of surgery, and also loyalty and adherence
      of patients to follow-up in offices allowing a possible intervention it is done at the right
      time. Nor was made compared to assess whether there is benefit in using this application.
      Thus, the objective of this work is to develop an application for smartphones facing the
      postoperative follow-up of patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy and compare
      adherence to treatment compared to accompanied by traditional way patient. In addition, we
      will evaluate the progress of the IPSS, ICIQ and IIEF-5 compared to preoperatively in
      patients undergoing prostatectomy robotic radical.

        This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. We will select prospectively 100
        patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. These patients will be divided into two groups
        using randomisation tables (www.random.org), which are: 1. Patients who will use the
        clinical application (n = 50) 2. Patients who do not use the application (n = 50 - group
        control).
