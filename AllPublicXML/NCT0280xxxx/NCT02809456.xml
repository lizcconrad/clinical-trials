  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the effect of nicorandil to mitigate the lung damage that can occur as
      a side effect of radiation therapy for lung cancer. Thousands of veterans develop lung cancer
      every year, and are treated by radiation therapy. Studies of lung radiation injury in
      laboratory animals show that with nicorandil, investigators can significantly reduce the
      severity of lung fibrosis and heart toxicity.1,2 Nicorandil is FDA approved and in common use
      for treatment of angina. These studies will advance that work to human use. Successful
      mitigation of lung radiation damage and heart toxicity will improve the quality of life in
      veterans and non-veterans who are treated for lung cancer by radiation, and may also improve
      cure rates of radiation therapy for lung cancer.
