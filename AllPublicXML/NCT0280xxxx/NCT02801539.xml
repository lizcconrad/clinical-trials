  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) in patients
      with late-onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) who have weakness of their breathing muscles. The
      results of this study will help design future research studies about RMT in LOPD. The goals
      of this study are to decide if sham-RMT is a useful control condition for RMT and to choose
      the best ways to measure the health benefits of RMT in LOPD.
