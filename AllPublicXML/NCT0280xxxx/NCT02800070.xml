  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study for the treatment of Fabry disease. Eligible patients will
      have an autologous stem cell transplantation using CD34+ cells that are transduced with the
      lentivirus vector containing the human alpha-gal A gene. The researchers of this study would
      like to see if the re-introduction of transduced cells will help increase the levels of
      alpha-gal A enzyme levels and to determine the safety and toxicity of autologous stem cell
      transplantation using CD34+ cells transduced with lentivirus vector containing the alpha-gal
      A gene. This study's objective is to determine the safety and toxicity of lentivirus
      alpha-gal A transduced CD34+ cells in adult males with Fabry disease.
