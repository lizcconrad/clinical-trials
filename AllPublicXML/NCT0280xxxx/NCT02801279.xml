      The purpose of the present study is to develop a long term cost-effectiveness (efficient
      protocol, playful context, and practical strategy) training program for school-age children
      with Cerebral Palsy. Also, evaluate efficacy of Kinect-assisted bilateral arm training
      program for children with Cerebral Palsy.
