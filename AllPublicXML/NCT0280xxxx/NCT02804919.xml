      Phase 1:The study is to evaluate the product reliability, therapy effectiveness and user
      feedback of a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device in-home for up to 6 months.

      Phase 2: To evaluate the CPAP device with communication functionality with data upload.

      Phase 1:Existing and Na√Øve CPAP users will be recruited into a 6 month in-home study
      Participants will attend 5 study visits at day 0, 7, 30, 60 and 180. Outcome of the clinical
      investigation include downloadable device data reports, device error reports and participants
      perception questionnaires.

      Phase 2: 10 participants from Phase 1 will be recruited to use the device for up to 6 month
      in-home. Participants will attend 3 study visits at day 0, 7 30. The trial may be extended to
      60 days if longer term data is required.
