  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, inpatient study in male and female subjects seeking at least a
      4 mg reduction of their buprenorphine maintenance dose. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the relative exposures of lofexidine and its 3 major metabolites in subjects tapering
      from buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Lofexidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist under
      development for the treatment of acute withdrawal from short-acting opioids.

    <description>Enrolled subjects must be on a daily dose of between 8 - 24 mg of buprenorphine for at least 30 days. Once enrolled, subjects will receive lofexidine as follows: Days 1 through 3, 0.6 mg 4 times daily (QID; 2.4 mg daily); Days 4 through 6, 0.8 mg QID (3.2 mg daily), and Day 7 0.8 mg at 8 AM. Subjects will take their scheduled lofexidine doses at approximately 8 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM and 11 PM. Subjects will also reduce their current buprenorphine dose by at least 4 mg on Day 1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have current dependency such that the subject is maintained on a daily dose between 8
             and 24 mg of buprenorphine and is seeking reduction of their buprenorphine dose by at
             least 4 mg.

          -  Urine toxicology screen positive for buprenorphine at Screening.

          -  Agree to collection of blood samples for genotyping of CYP2D6 metabolizer status.

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, subject must have been using birth control
             for at least 30 days and must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control through
             at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

          -  If male, must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control throughout the entire
             study period and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Must not donate sperm
             for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a female subject who is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have a very serious medical illness not under control.

          -  Have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30 days.

          -  Received any drugs that are known strong, moderate or weak inhibitors of cytochrome
             P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6, within 14 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is more) before Day -1.

          -  Abnormal cardiovascular exam at Screening.

          -  Subjects requiring the following will be excluded: Tricyclic antidepressants, which
             may reduce the efficacy of imidazoline derivatives; Beta-receptor blockers, to avoid
             the risk of excessive bradycardia.
