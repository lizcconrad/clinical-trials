    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine if the cell therapy NC1 administered in the spinal
      cord is effective for the treatment of a post-traumatic syringomyelia. The post-traumatic
      syringomyelia is the development and progression of cyst filled with cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) within the spinal cord. The cell therapy NC1 consist on cells obtained from the bone
      marrow of the patient, that are cultured in vitro and administered in the spinal cord of the
      same patient.

      Phase II, Open, prospective, not controlled, not randomized clinical trial in patients
      affected by post-traumatic syringomyelia. The trial evaluates the efficacy of the cell
      therapy NC1 administered via intrathecal in the location of the injury. After the
      administration of the cell therapy, patients will undergo physiotherapy during the follow-up
      period (6 months). Patients will be evaluated at month 3 and month 6 after the NC1
      administration.
