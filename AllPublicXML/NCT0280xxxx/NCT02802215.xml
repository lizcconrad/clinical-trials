      Randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial that evaluate the role of taking metformin

      The study will include a total of 80 pregnant women who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Participants will be distributed into two groups :

      Group A: Active one (40 women) will receive metformin in a dose of 1500mg per day (500mg
      every 8hrs in the middle of meal), starting from 12th week of gestation till delivery.

      Group B: control group (40 women) will receive placebo which will be folic acid 500 micro
      gram which looks like metformin tablet.

      80 opaque envelope will be numbered serially from 1-80, in each envelope paper containing the
      group to which the participants will be allocated according to randomization table .The
      envelopes will be put in one box and when the first patient arrives the first envelope will
      be open and the patient will be allocated according to the paper inside.

      Detection of glucose intolerance will be done using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which
      based on 75 gm to exclude any case of pre-gestational DM. BMI and blood pressure will be also
      assessed for all cases at entry of the study.

      Follow up of all cases in antenatal care clinic, with clinical assessment including weight
      gain, blood pressure, urine examination for proteinuria and fetal well being tests.

      Detection of development of GDM or even glucose intolerance will be by using (OGTT), which
      based on 75 gm glucose between 24th-28th wk and also can be repeated between 32th- 34th wk of
      pregnancy.
