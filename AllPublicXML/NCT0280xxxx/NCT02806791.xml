  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endogenous growth factor granulocyte (G-CSF) stimulates the proliferation and
      differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors commissioned to mature as neutrophils and
      activated granulocytes mature neutrophils. In the field of hematology oncology G-CSF it is
      used to reduce the duration and complications of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to
      stimulate the mobilization and subsequent collection of circulating hematopoietic stem cells
      in order to use them for autologous transplantation procedure.

      Filgrastim and Lenograstim originator are marketed for many years and are considered the
      reference molecules for the production of biosimilar.

      For several years it is available and entered into common clinical practice the use of
      filgrastim biosimilar (Bio-GCSF) in treating the patient oncohematologic.

      Aim of the study is to analyze retrospectively a large series of patients and assess the
      impacts of the Bio-GCSF on the collection of hematopoietic stem cells and recovery of blood
      counts post autologous transplantation; the data will be compared with a historical cohort of
      reference that has been treated with G-CSF originator.

      The study results will not generate any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients
      still alive.
