  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral tissues (e.g. liver, adipose, muscle) express self-sustained circadian clocks that
      coordinate daily metabolic rhythms. The timing of clock rhythms in peripheral tissues is
      highly sensitive to feeding-fasting signals across the sleep-wake transition. Nutritional
      insults such as high fat overfeeding (HF-OF) have been shown to attenuate clock gene
      expression in peripheral tissues resulting in a deleterious re-programming of the circadian
      metabolome. Studies in humans have only superficially investigated how the circadian clock
      machinery is impacted by nutritional signals. The overall goal of this pilot project is to
      take the first steps toward developing translational methods to investigate links between
      changes in energy flux and the circadian system in human tissues. Using an innovative ex vivo
      cell culture approach the investigators will examine the impact of 3-days of HF-OF compared
      to eucaloric (EU) feeding on the expression of core clock genes in human subcutaneous adipose
      tissue (SAT). The Investigators hypothesize that compared to EU, the amplitude of clock gene
      expression in SAT measured over 24hrs will be attenuated following short-term HF-OF. This
      pilot project will serve as a launch point for designing future studies into the effects of
      diet and exercise on the circadian control of metabolism in adipose tissue depots as well as
      other tissues (e.g. muscle).
