      Some patients with heart failure require treatment called cardiac-resynchronisation therapy
      (CRT) which involves putting a pacemaker into your heart to make both ventricles (the lower
      chambers of your heart) contract together, making the pumping of the blood to the rest of
      your body more efficient.

      it is important to get the CRT pacemaker checked to make sure that it is working correctly
      and performing its job. However it can be difficult to adjust the settings of the pacemaker
      just the right amount to ensure the heart is pumping efficiently.

      One of the ways this can be done is by using a special machine which uses ultrasound to make
      a 2-dimensional image of the heart called echocardiogram. This technique can also be used to
      measure the flow of blood in your heart and calculate how efficient it is at pumping blood.
      However adjusting the settings of the pacemaker with this device is difficult to use and time
      consuming.

      Electrocardiogram (ECG) a 2-dimensional electrical tracing of the hearts activity is another
      tool used to help adjust the settings of pacemakers, to make the heart pump more efficiently.
      Furthermore, recent research has shown that this is better than echocardiogram at optimising
      pacemaker device settings.

      A new type of ECG called cardiogoniometry (CGM) has recently been developed which creates a
      3-dimensional view of the hearts electrical activity and has already been shown to be better
      than normal ECG at diagnosing certain conditions like angina and heart attacks. However it
      has never been used to try optimise the settings of the pacemakers used in CRT and we hope it
      will be a quicker and easier to use than then other methods available. More importantly we
      hope by doing this it will reduce the symptoms that patients suffer as it is making the heart
      pump more efficiently.

      As it has been untested and never used in this setting before, we need to know first if the
      CGM machine will recognise when the settings on the pacemaker are changed.

      The aims of this study is to see if the CGM machine can pick up changes to pacemaker
      settings, with the hope of running a later study to see if it can be used to optimise
      settings on the pacemaker used in CRT.

      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) improves symptoms and quality of life and improves
      the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure. CRT works by improving co-ordination of
      cardiac contraction, and is indicated in people with heart failure and left bundle branch
      block (LBBB) on an ECG. The importance of LBBB is that it indicates that the electricity is
      spreading only very slowly over the surface of the heart with each heart beat, thereby making
      contraction very &quot;dyssynchronous&quot;; that is, instead of all the heart muscle contracting
      simultaneously, parts contract and are relaxing before other parts even start to contract.

      With a standard pacemaker, a pacing lead is implanted in the right ventricle. In those
      patients with a normal heart rhythm (&quot;sinus rhythm&quot;), a second lead is usually placed in the
      right atrium close to the heart's natural pacemaker. The lead in the ventricle can then track
      the heart's natural heart rate as detected by the lead in the atrium, or, if the natural rate
      is too slow, the pacemaker can sequentially pace the atrium and then the ventricle.

      A CRT system is similar, but with the addition of an extra lead positioned to pace the left
      ventricle. Now, the pacemaker is able to stimulate both left and right ventricles
      simultaneously, restoring the normal co-ordination of ventricular contraction.

      Approximately 25% of patients do not achieve significant clinical benefit with CRT. Such
      patients are termed &quot;non-responders&quot;, and lack of response is typically measured as a failure
      to improve exercise capacity with CRT, or a failure of the heart to improve on
      echocardiography. One option to reduce the number of non-responders may be to optimise the
      CRT device by adjusting its settings based on clinical variables (such as ECG and
      echocardiogram findings). Both ECG and echocardiogram optimisation give similar results in
      terms of clinical response to CRT, but patients who had their CRT optimised using ECG
      variables had a significantly greater impact on echocardiographic response, that is a greater
      proportion of that group had a LV end-systolic volume reduction &gt;10%) 3. Another possibility
      for optimising CRT is cardiogoniometry (CGM), which is what our study aims to investigate.
      CGM is form of 3D vector electrocardiography which can provide quantitative analysis of
      myocardial depolarisation and repolarisation. Like standard 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG),
      CGM uses different electrodes to identify electrical potential gradients produced by cardiac
      electrical activity. The ECG can only visually represent this information in a two
      dimensional way, whereas CGM can create a three dimensional display. Electrode placement is
      important: and complex mathematical modelling is used to generate the displays. CGM gives the
      same output as a standard ECG. One additional output is vector loop graphs. These are
      sequentially plotted values of electrical activity of the heart in the x, y and z axis, in
      three orthogonal planes. When the vector loops follow the same pathway it means that the
      electrical activity of the heart is following the same pathway with each ventricular
      depolarisation and repolarisation. By contrast, when there is abnormal electrical conduction,
      the vector loop pathways can vary. CGM is useful for identifying stable coronary artery
      disease and recognising the acute coronary syndromes, but its clinical value outside patients
      with acute ischaemic heart disease is unclear. We aim to conduct a feasibility study to see
      if CGM can detect the different settings of a CRT device, by assessing the CGM vector loops
      with different device settings. Based on the results of the study, we aim to investigate
      whether CRT can be optimised by trying to align vector loop pathways using CGM.

They will undergo each of these during different pacemaker settings. These are: 1) No pacing, 2) Paced from the right ventricular lead; 3) Paced from the left ventricular lead and 4) Paced from both ventricular leads. After this has been done the participants involvement in the study will have finished.</description>
