      facilitate breast cancer clinical trial participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge and participation in clinical trials is disproportionately low among minorities.
      The purpose of this study is to test a program designed to increase African American and
      Hispanic American women's scientific literacy, knowledge of clinical trials, and to
      facilitate breast cancer clinical trial participation.

      A validation study was also conducted to validate several measures for the Hispanic American
      and African American populations.

      The experimental group watched an education program concerning breast cancer clinical trials
      while the control group watched an education program on neighborhood safety.

      To examine willingness to participate in research was assessed by a post-intervention
      invitation to complete a sleep diary.

    <measure>Educational Post-Intervention Changes in Participants' Breast Cancer Clinical Trials-Using Standardized Personal Health Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline data using Personal Health Survey were collected immediately prior to participants' randomization to either the experimental or control study arms.</time_frame>
    <description>The study administered standardized psychosocial measure (Personal Health Survey) at baseline. Data were gathered to measure participants' knowledge and attitudes. The overall data from all measures were then used to evaluate the impact of the intervention, as well as what factors may have moderated and mediated that outcome. To measure changes in participations' behavior, they were immediately offered the opportunity to take part in another study that required a new consent document and collection of saliva samples. Regardless of whether the participants agreed to take part in this second study, they were next invited to be a part of the Ambassador for Clinical Trials Program, which meant they would periodically receive flyers about open clinical trials to share with family, friends, and community contacts.</description>

    <description>Breast Cancer Clinical Trials Education program is offered to women in the experimental arm. This program was designed to promote increased clinical trials literacy among African American and Hispanic American women. Increased clinical trials knowledge and a better understanding of clinical trials is anticipated to create more positive attitudes, and perceptions about clinical trials among these two groups of women who are traditionally underrepresented in breast cancer clinical trials.</description>
