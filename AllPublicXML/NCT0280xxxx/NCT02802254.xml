  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a minimal intervention on risk
      perception of physical inactivity in patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) and
      patients at risk for CHD. Therefore half of the patients (intervention group) get a personal
      feedback on their individual level of physical activity measured by pedometers and
      self-report questionnaires plus information about the risk factor 'physical inactivity' for
      heart diseases. Following the hypotheses the feedback should increase the patients risk
      perception of physical inactivity and furthermore increase physical activity.
