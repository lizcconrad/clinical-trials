      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the magnetic compressive anastomosis has a
      better outcomes than traditional manual anastomosis on superior bilioenteric anastomosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The superior bilioenteric anastomosis is one of the most common and difficult operations in
      Hepatobiliary Surgery. The traditional manual anastomosis has become one of the main
      prognosis factors because of the length of suture time, the difficulty of operation, the high
      incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture. Magnetic compressive anastomosis can realize
      the fast anastomosis, reduce the difficulty, and reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage
      and stricture. Currently, the majority of studies of magnetic compressive bilioenteric
      anastomosis are merely confined within clinical case report and single-center, small sample,
      retrospective study, thus they are lack of convictive evidence of evidence-based medicine for
      the security, reliability and convince.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. To evaluate the
      security, reliability and convince of magnetic compressive superior bilioenteric anastomosis,
      this study compared the incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture between magnetic
      compressive anastomosis and traditional manual anastomosis among patients who need superior
      bilioenteric anastomosis operation. The study design plan to enroll 70 patients and divide
      into Study Group (Group A: Magnetic compressive anastomosis) and Control Group (Group B:
      traditional manual anastomosis) as 1:1 ratio randomly by stratification factors. The
      incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture, length of bilioenteric anastomosis time,
      value of serum bilirubin, length of discharge time of magnetic device and mean time of
      hospital stay will be evaluated. The patients will drop out of the study if adverse events
      happen, active request for dropping out, new-onset severe disease or death. The primary and
      secondary end point will be observed by regular follow-up.
