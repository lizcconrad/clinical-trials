      The purpose of this study is to determine whether specific nutrient supplementation can
      improve dynamic stability in older adults.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single nutrient dietary
      supplement on dynamic stability in an older population. Dynamic stability, or walking
      stability, will be assessed with accelerometers while subjects are walking on a flat surface
      for about 60 seconds. Dynamic stability will be defined by the maximum Lyapunov exponent
      (maxLE), Floquet multiplier, or motor control timing, change from baseline. Postural
      stability will also be measured in a still and standing subject, with foot placement
      standardized on a force plate, and with the subject looking in the forward direction with
      arms by their sides. Two visual conditions will be given: eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed
      (EC). Each measurement will last for 60 seconds and will be repeated twice for each
      condition. A three-minute rest will be provided between measurements.
