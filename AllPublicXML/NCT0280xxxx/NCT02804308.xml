  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease affecting women, and one of the treatments for its
      healing and survival is hormone therapy. Aromatase inhibitors are third-generation drugs that
      promote lower chance of metastasis, but their side effects include the loss of bone mineral
      density and increased fat percentage. In this way, the Combined Training (combined resistance
      and endurance training) may be an interesting strategy to minimize the side effects of
      aromatase inhibitors, providing better quality of life, survival and changes in body
      composition.
