      This study evaluates the effect and mechanism of low dose naltrexone for treatment of pain in
      patients with fibromyalgia. It s a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over
      study.

      It is a 2-center study that takes place at The Multidisciplinary Pain Center in Copenhagen
      and at The Multidisciplinary Pain Center in Give.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder characterized by pain, profound
      fatigue, sleep disorder, mood disturbance etc. The prevalence is estimated to be 2-8%.

      Treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia is often based on opioids. However, opioids
      may lead to tolerance, addiction and hyperalgesia and alternative treatments are therefore
      warranted.

      Low dose naltrexone (3-5mg) (LDN) has shown promising results in the treatment of pain in
      patients with fibromyalgia, but there is a need for further research.

      At the typical dose of naltrexone, 50 mg, it is an opioid antagonist. However LDN
      demonstrates analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, possibly involving an antagonism of
      microglia in the CNS.

      The investigators hypothesize, that LDN has a better pain relieving effect than placebo in in
      patients with fibromyalgia (FM). The investigators also hypothesize that LDN has a better
      effect upon experimentally induced pain in FM-patients, compared to placebo. A tentative
      mechanism is a central facilitation of the endogenous pain inbitory system.

    <description>The patient indicates using a questionnaire-based numerical rating scale (0 = no pain; 100 = worst imaginable pain) mean values of pain at rest, pain during household activity and pain during personal hygienic procedures in the preceding 24 hrs.

    <description>The FIQR is a fibromyalgia-specific questionnaire containing three domains: function domain, impact domain and symptom domain. The total score of FIQR is calculated by:
the function domain sum is divided by 3 (upper limit 30)
the impact domain sum is unchanged (upper limit 20)
the symptom domain sum is divided by 2 (upper limit 50) The three resulting processed domain scores are summed to obtain the total score of the FIQR (range 0-100)</description>
