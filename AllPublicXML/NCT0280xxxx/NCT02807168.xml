  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a health problem of great magnitude, because it
      is the most frequent cause of hospitalization of patients over 65 years old. Of these
      patients, more than 50% will be readmitted within the next six months with the consequent
      worsening prognosis, increased mortality and high costs associated. In fact, two-third parts
      of the costs of this condition are due to hospitalizations. Hence the increased importance of
      ADHF and its associated hospitalizations as an essential event in the natural history of the
      disease on to address therapeutic efforts.

      However, at the present time there is a change of scenario that makes that more than half of
      these patients show HF with preserved ejection fraction (PEF), so that acute heart failure
      with preserved ejection fraction (AHF-PEF) is a fact with high prevalence and epidemiological
      relevance. To this the investigators must add that, unlike patients with depressed EF, HF-PEF
      has no therapeutic strategies that may have proven a recovery of the affected patients. All
      this makes that overall heart failure with PEF and AHF-PEF represent a major health problem.

      However, despite of the lack of effective treatments, there are also opportunities for
      improvement both in terms of morbidity and mortality that should be evaluated. Rather than
      looking for therapies or new specific drugs, these opportunities may be in the use of
      management strategies among which the use of biomarkers and their monitoring could be key. In
      this regard, NT-proBNP has been shown to correlate with severity and prognosis, including the
      risk of decompensation. Nevertheless, whilst the latest guidelines for heart failure
      management recommend its use in the diagnosis of HF, the use of biomarkers to monitor and
      guide treatment has not been included yet.

      The assumption of this study is that the use of NT-proBNP may serve as a therapeutic and
      management guideline for the in-patient with HF-PEF who is to be discharged, allowing a
      reduction of decompensations and hospitalizations as well as a better functional situation at
      6 months.

      Several criteria have been proposed to define the syndrome of HFpEF according to the 2013
      ACCF/AHA Heart Failure Guideline including (a) clinical signs or symptoms of HF; (b) evidence
      of preserved or normal LVEF; and (c) evidence of abnormal LV diastolic dysfunction that can
      be determined by Doppler echocardiography or cardiac catheterization The assay N‑terminal
      proB‑type natriuretic peptid is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals suspected
      of having congestive heart failure and detection of mild forms of cardiac dysfunction. The
      test also aids in the assessment of heart failure severity in patients diagnosed with
      congestive heart failure. This assay is further indicated for the risk stratification of
      patients with acute coronary syndrome and congestive heart failure, and it can also be used
      for monitoring the treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
