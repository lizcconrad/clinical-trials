  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this study is to analyse perinatal risk factors leading to hypoxic ischaemic
      encephalopathy in term and near term neonates born in Switzerland who were admitted to the
      neonatal and intensive care units offering hypothermia therapy.

      Further, investigators would like to analyse the influence of these perinatal risk factors on
      the severity of encephalopathy during and after hypothermia therapy.

    <textblock>
      Encephalopathy of the neonate could have different aetiologies. Perinatal asphyxia leading to
      hypoxia-ischaemia is frequent ,1-2 per 1000 life born neonates are affected. Hypoxic
      ischaemic encephalopathy is one of the most important causes for adverse neurodevelopmental
      outcome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and hearing and vision deficiencies in term and near term
      neonates. Til now, hypothermia therapy is the only therapy reducing the risk of adverse
      neurodevelopmental outcome and is nowadays standard of care. In this study investigators
      would like to analyse perinatal risk factors causing HIE and their influence on the Sarnat
      Score on day 1 and 3 of life (during hypothermia therapy) and on day 4 of life (after
      hypothermia therapy).

    <description>The investigators evaluate the incidence of the known antepartal and intrapartal risk factors and analyze if there is a statistically significant difference of the influence of intrapartal or antepartal risk factors on the progression of the encephalopathy during and after hypothermia therapy. The investigators analyze sarnat staging on day one and three as a subject to the forementioned risk factors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study includes data of neonates suffering from hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
             born with a gestational age &gt; 35 0/7 weeks, who were admitted to the neonatal and
             intensive care units in Switzerland between 2011-2013 and were treated with
             therapeutic hypothermia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonates with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, born with a gestational age &lt; 35 0/7
             weeks or without hypothermia treatment or syndromal diseases or with malformations
             were excluded.

          -  Further, children without consent to research use were excluded.
