  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is frequent in patients with advanced cancer and decreases the tolerability
      of other symptoms and impairs quality of life. A detailed description of sleep disturbance
      and its association with other symptoms, and intervention studies on sleep medications are
      scarce in patients with advanced cancer. A well-designed randomized controlled trial is
      needed to determine the short time effectiveness of zopiclone on sleep quality, one of the
      currently available therapies of insomnia, and further to contribute to the clinical
      management of insomnia in patients with advanced cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter trial investigating the short time effectiveness of zopiclone on self-reported
      sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer who use opioids and who report insomnia.
      Patients with advanced cancer who use opioids and who report insomnia are randomized to
      either a hypnotic, zopiclone (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) for six nights. For this study
      zopiclone Actavis 3.75 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg (active comparator) and placebo are defined as
      Investigational Medicinal Products. The initial dose is zopiclone/placebo 3.75 mg/day.
      Evaluation of sleep quality is performed in the morning after night 2 and 4 with evaluation
      of sleep quality by using a numerical rating scale 0-10 with the question &quot;Please circle the
      number that best describes how you feel now&quot; 0= Best sleep, 10= Worst possible sleep.
