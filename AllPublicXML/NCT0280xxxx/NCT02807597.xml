  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' preclinical data have demonstrated the feasibility of fluorescence-guided
      tumor resection by Cancer Vision Goggles (CVG) with LS301 in animal models. In this study,
      the investigators will conduct intraoperative imaging procedures that have minimal
      interference with ongoing surgery. The underlying hypothesis is that the accurate detection
      of all cancer cells highlighted by LS301 during surgery will reduce the number of breast
      cancer patients with margin positivity to less than 5%, compared to the current surgical
      paradigm of greater than 20%. The pilot study will obtain critical data required to address
      the larger question of surgical margin assessment in a full Phase I clinical trial.

At least 4 specimens from excised tissue will be analyzed, including suspected tumor and suspected healthy tissue.</description>

    <description>Patient will undergo intravenous injection of the appropriate cohort dose of LS301 at least four hours before surgery (24 hours is the preferred time point wherever possible)
Starting dose level will be 100 µg/kg, dose level 2 will be 150 µg/kg, and dose level -1 will be 50 µg/kg
Before removing the tissues, the surgeon will determine the presence of NIR fluorescence in the tumor or SLN.
After removing the tumor tissue, the CVG will be used to assess LS301 fluorescence in the surgical margins, as well as the cavity where the tumor was removed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed Stage I-II breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy
             and SLN biopsy.

          -  Negative nodal basin clinical exam.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for surgery.

          -  Receiving any investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to ICG or other agents used in the study,
             include known iodide or seafood allergy. We do not expect many of these adverse
             reactions with LS301 because it is not radioactive and does not possess iodinated
             counterions.

          -  Pregnant. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test no more than 7 days before start of participation.

          -  Breastfeeding. Patients who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with LS301.
