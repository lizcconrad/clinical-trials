    <textblock>
      Individuals with IBD are at risk for nutrient deficiencies. This prospective, non-randomized,
      open-label study will assess the effect of a nutrition support product on nutritional status
      in adults with IBD. Up to ten adults with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will be
      enrolled in the study and asked to take the product for 12 weeks. The primary measures of the
      study are several blood markers of nutritional status.

    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 1-1.3 million people in the United States suffer from the Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). The pathophysiology of
      IBD involves malnutrition, malabsorption, altered intestinal permeability, inflammation, and
      gut flora alterations. Individuals with IBD are at risk for nutrient deficiencies due to
      decreased intake, decreased absorption and/or increased enteral losses. The most common
      deficiencies involve many micronutrients including vitamins and minerals; less commonly,
      adults may also be at risk for macronutrient deficiencies involving protein and total energy
      intake. The product being studied is a comprehensive nutrition support product that was
      formulated to meet the nutritional needs of individuals with digestive complaints. This study
      will assess the effect of the study product on blood markers of nutritional status in adults
      with IBD.

    <description>The effect on overall nutritional status will be determined by aggregating data from multiple measures (albumin, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamin B12, folate, sodium, potassium and calcium) into one reported value. The proportion (percentage) of abnormal values present at baseline will be calculated and compared to the proportion of abnormal values present at the end of the study. Mean change, pre-to-post treatment, will also be assessed for each individual measure.</description>
