    <textblock>
      For preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric
      adenocarcinoma, usage of serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA
      19-9 may be helpful. Additionally, the prognosis of the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma
      treated with gastrectrectomy may be associated with serum and peritoneal levels of tumor
      markers.

    <textblock>
      Clinical usage of tumor markers on preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal
      dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma is a controversial issue. It has been thought that
      there is a positive correlation between serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic
      antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 and pathologic features of gastric tumors and peritoneal
      dissemination.

      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of serum and peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 to
      predict TNM stages and peritoneal washing cytology in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma
      after curative gastrectomy, and to determine predictive value of these measurements to the
      development of recurrence and death.

    <description>After thoroughly examination of the peritoneal cavity revealing the absence of peritoneal dissemination, the peritoneal cavity was washed with 200 ml of saline, and at least one third was aspirated from several regions of the peritoneal cavity, including near the primary tumor, the left and right subphrenic areas and the pouch of Douglas with suction tubes to a clean bottle and designated as the peritoneal sample for determination of peritoneal levels of CEA and CA 19-9.</description>
