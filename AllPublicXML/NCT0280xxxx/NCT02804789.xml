      Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease may precede symptoms of Alzheimer's
      Dementia by over 20 years. The Investigators hope to be able to identify Alzheimer's disease
      at its very earliest stages when in theory treatments are most likely to be successful in
      preventing further spread of the disease in the brain and causing dementia. The aim of EPAD
      programme is to develop new treatments more quickly to prevent Alzheimer's dementia. A major
      component of the EPAD programme is the EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study which can provide
      subjects for the EPAD trial as well as data to improve understanding of disease before
      dementia develops.

      The Investigators will approach a broad range of people over the age of 50 who have
      previously taken part in various research studies and consented to being recontacted for
      further research. Participants will be asked questions to assess their memory and other
      cognitive function. The participants will also undertake a brain scan, provide a sample of
      spinal fluid, blood, urine and saliva to look at markers in these bodily fluids that may
      change in Alzheimer's disease. The Investigators will then follow these participants until
      December 2019 repeating these tests annually. This will be called the EPAD Longitudinal
      Cohort Study (EPAD LCS). The main reasons for EPAD developing a cohort are to help the
      Investigators understand more about what happens to people before dementia develops, and to
      help recruit people more quickly into the EPAD trials of new medications or other
      interventions expected to prevent dementia.

      People in the EPAD LCS may be invited to take part in the EPAD Proof of Concept prevention
      studies to see if interventions can modify the probability of developing dementia or
      cognitive problems (this will be subject to separate ethics approval and consent). Together
      EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC make up the full EPAD Programme.

    <textblock>
      The EPAD project has been established to overcome the major hurdles hampering drug
      development for secondary prevention of AD dementia, by conducting the EPAD LCS (fed mainly
      from existing Parent Cohorts (PC) across Europe) in alignment with the adaptive design EPAD
      PoC trial. Both EPAD LCS and EPAD PoC trial will be run in an exclusive network of highly
      selected, expert Trial Delivery Centres (TDC) that will be selected on the basis of strictly
      applied criteria to ensure the highest possible data quality, successful recruitment and
      adherence to the EPAD principles.

      While interventions must start early in the course of AD, accurate disease models covering
      the entire course of AD before dementia onset are lacking. Estimating with reasonable
      confidence an individual's overall probability of developing AD dementia over a defined time
      period must take into account multiple dimensions simultaneously (e.g. cognition, biomarkers,
      traditional risk factors - genetic and environmental). This will allow any given individual
      to be placed somewhere on a probability spectrum from negligible probability to high
      probability. Because individuals with similar overall probability may have very different
      contributions from various components in each dimension, flexible algorithms are needed
      instead of simple cut-offs to identify a probability-spectrum population adequate for both
      disease modelling and for providing a sufficient number of potential trial participants
      (especially in adaptive trials with multiple arms testing drugs with different mechanisms of
      action).

      EPAD LCS is designed to address the dual need for development of accurate longitudinal models
      for AD covering the entire disease course, and development of adequate infrastructure for
      facilitating identification of research participants and clinical trial recruitment. EPAD LCS
      will have a probability-spectrum population selected mostly from already existing PCs across
      Europe to facilitate fast recruitment. Different types of PCs will be considered (e.g. memory
      clinic-based, population-based). Due to the variety of PCs, some EPAD LCS research
      participants will be e.g. memory clinic patients without dementia, while others will be e.g.
      participants without dementia from the general population. The variety of PC settings will
      ensure that the EPAD LCS probability-spectrum population can cover the entire continuum of
      probability for AD dementia development. Regular EPAD LCS follow-up with clinical, cognitive
      and biomarker assessments will provide a well-phenotyped probability-spectrum population,
      generating high-quality data for updating disease models, for easier identification of
      individuals suitable for trial inclusion, and for use as trial run-in data and reference for
      evaluating intervention efficacy.

      The flow of research participants from the population at large to the trial is divided into
      the following stages: firstly, EPAD will engage existing PCs from across Europe who may have
      eligible research participants for the EPAD LCS. The next step is drawing research
      participants from the PCs into the EPAD LCS to maintain a suitable population of
      approximately 6,000 research participants. Recruitment will be complemented with research
      participants who are recruited from a clinical setting by their referring clinician. To
      enable access to the EPAD LCS for these potential participants, the referring clinician will
      check if they match the flexible algorithm. Finally, research participants in the EPAD LCS
      who fulfil trial inclusion criteria (approximately 1,500 research participants), will be
      invited to enter the EPAD PoC (PoC) trial for evaluation of treatment for secondary
      prevention of AD dementia. This trial is a standing, adaptive, PoC trial that could involve
      multiple arms running concurrently. Successful graduation through PoC into phase 3
      confirmatory trials of single or combinatorial interventions will be based on success against
      an intermediary, target specific biomarker and then success against a cognitive measure.

      Once recruitment is completed, at any given time there should be approx. 6,000 research
      participants in the EPAD LCS and approx. 1,500 in the EPAD PoC, hence the need to replenish
      each from PCs as participants are lost through attrition. EPAD LCS will initially run until
      the end of December 2019, and extension of consent will be sought after 4 years.

        Research participants will mainly be recruited from existing Parent Cohorts (PC) across
        Europe. PCs considered for EPAD are: active cohorts without dementia aged at least 50
        years; the PC PI is willing to provide research participants for EPAD trials; with existing
        consent for re-contact or possibility to obtain consent to re-contact. Potential research
        participants will be identified based on data in the PC, using a flexible search algorithm
        adapted to the types of data available in each PC. Recruitment will be complemented with
        research participants who are recruited from a clinical setting by their referring
        clinician. In case an individual or their referring clinician contacts a TDC, the referring
        clinician will check the flexible algorithm to confirm their suitability.

             status of research participants based on data collected at the EPAD screening/baseline
             visit, so that decisions on selection/deselection can be made with reference to the
             dual needs of having sufficient heterogeneity across the entire probability-spectrum
             population for disease-modelling work, and suitable research participants for the EPAD
             PoC trial (Balancing Committee decision)

          3. Able to read and write with a minimum of 7 years of formal education.

          4. Willing in principle to participate in the EPAD Proof of Concept Trials (with
             additional consent).

          5. Have a study partner or can identify someone willing to be a study partner. The
             primary role of the study partner will be as informant. They will also receive oral
             and written information about the EPAD LCS, and will sign an Informed Consent Form
             (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Clinical Dementia Rating &gt;=1

          3. Known carriers of a Presenilin (PSEN) 1, PSEN 2 or Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)
             mutation associated with Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's dementia or any other
             neurodegenerative disease.

          4. Presence of any neurological, psychiatric or medical conditions associated with a
             long-term risk of significant cognitive impairment or dementia including but not
             limited to pre- manifest Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
             disease, Down syndrome, active alcohol/drug abuse; or major psychiatric disorders
             including current major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar

             participation in an investigational trial unsafe, e.g., uncontrolled or unstable
             disease of any major organ system; history within the last 6 months of any acute
             illness of a major organ system requiring emergency care or hospitalization, including
             revascularization procedures; severe renal or hepatic failure; unstable or poorly
             controlled DM, hypertension, or heart failure; malignant neoplasms within the last 3
             years (expect for basal or squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the skin, or localized
             prostate cancer in male participants); any clinically relevant abnormalities in blood
             parameters included in local TDC routine assessments; severe loss of vision, hearing
             or communicative ability; or any conditions preventing co-operation or completion of
             the required assessments in the trial, as judged by the investigator.

          7. Contraindications for MRI/Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan.

          8. Contraindications for Lumbar Puncture.

          9. Any evidence of intracranial pathology which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             affect cognition including but not limited to brain tumours (benign or malignant),
             aneurysm or arteriovenous malformations, territorial stroke (excluding smaller
             watershed strokes), recent haemorrhage (parenchymal or subdural), or obstructive
             hydrocephalus. Research participants with a MRI scan demonstrating markers of small
             vessel disease (e.g. white matter changes or lacunar infarcts) judged to be clinically
             insignificant, or microbleeds are allowed.

         10. Participation in a clinical trial of an Investigational Product (CTIMP) in the last 30
             days (continued participation in the parent cohort is expected). Participation in a
             non-CTIMP is not an exclusion criterion.

        Diminished decision-making capacity/ not capable of consenting at Visit 1 or Visit 2. If at
        a subsequent annual EPAD LCS visit health professionals suspect diminished consent capacity
        according to local TDC routine procedures, a formal assessment of the research
        participant's capacity to consent will be conducted. The participant will be offered the
        opportunity to continue in the EPAD LCS under suitable local regulations regarding
        capacitous participants who have consented to enter a longitudinal study who subsequently
        loose capacity. Capacity will be assessed at each study visit using the correct legal
        framework.
