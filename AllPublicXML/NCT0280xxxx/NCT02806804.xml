      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent influenza virus
      vaccine in healthy people aged years 3-60.Subjects will be randomly divided into 3
      groups,receiving the test vaccine, commercially available trivalent influenza vaccine and
      trivalent influenza vaccine containing new influenza B component respectively. Each group has
      800 subjects,2400 in total.
