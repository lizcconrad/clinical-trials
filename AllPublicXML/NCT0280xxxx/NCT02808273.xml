    <textblock>
      A comparative study to reveal if the use of Bemiparine (Hibor) versus Enoxaparin (Clexane) as
      an antithrombotic agent, shows an advantage on the rate of thrombotic and haemorrhagic events
      in microsurgicals free flaps during head and neck reconstruction.

      This is an observational post-authorization study on a group of patients undergoing
      microsurgery on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
      Service at Ramon y Cajal Hospital, Madrid for processes that require reconstruction with a
      flap microvascular. A group of 67 patients treated according protocol postoperative
      prevention of deep vein thrombosis with Bemiparina will be compared with data collected
      retrospectively from a group of 134 patients treated previously with an earlier protocol with
      enoxaparin as main antithrombotic agent.

        Patients who will undergo Oral and Maxillofacial or Plastic surgery that require
        reconstruction with microvascular flap at Hospital Ramón y Cajal, Madrid. A group of 67
        patients treated according to a protocol for prevention of postoperative deep venous
        thrombosis with Bemiparina that will be compared with data collected from a group of 134
        patients previously treated with a similar protocol but enoxaparin as antithrombotic agent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that will undergo reconstructive surgery for defects in any part of the body,
             especially in head and neck, after cancer, traumatic or infectious pathology, which
             will require the use of techniques of microsurgery.

          -  Patients who have given their informed consent

          -  Patients in which it has been decided to use thromboprophylaxis with bemiparina before
             proposing them to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not eligible for repair through the use of free flaps, and therefore the use
             of Microsurgical techniques for vascular anastomosis

          -  Patients with an underlying pathology that may interfere to a clinically significant
             or contraindicated the use of Bemiparina, such as: serious hepatic or renal
             insufficiency, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, history of gastroduodenal,
             thrombocytopenia, nephrolithiasis or uretrolitiasis and vascular disease ulcer of
             choroid and retina.

          -  Refusal of the patient or their family members to participate in the study.

          -  Pregnancy and breastfeeding

          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drugs or any of its components
