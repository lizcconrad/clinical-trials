  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperatively, the surgeon will interrogate the liver with ultrasound. The time spent by
      the surgeon using the ultrasound is recorded. If all lesions seen on pre-op imaging were
      found, the patient does not have the Pathfinder Explorer system applied. If one or more
      lesions cannot be found, then the Pathfinder Explorer system is calibrated and a tracking
      device is attached to the ultrasound probe, which the surgeon will use to reattempt
      localization of the missing tumor. The Pathfinder Explorer system operates in real-time in
      conjunction with the ultrasound.
