  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to screen tumor molecular profile for better selection of anticancer
      treatment, in particular, allocation to clinical trials if available.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular profiling will be performed on archival tumor tissue or freshly collected tumor
      tissue from re-biopsy. Blood and/or saliva may be collected to study the genetic makeup and
      also to compare the tumor molecular profile. Personalized therapy will be given based on
      molecular profile.
