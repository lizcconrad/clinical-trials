  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of thrombus formation in the left
      heart, especially in the auricula and the atrium. Their presence increases the risk of
      ischemic stroke, especially during cardioversion, performed either by drug or by external
      electric shock. The gold standard to exclude this thrombus and consider cardioversion is the
      transesophageal echocardiography.

      D-dimers, products of the degradation of fibrin, have been studied several times to assess
      the presence of thrombi in the body, especially in pulmonary embolism. In cardiology and
      despite several studies on the matter, there is currently no blood D-dimers value allowing to
      detect the presence of a thrombus with a good predictive value. Correlating the D-dimer
      values with age, as has been done for some years in pulmonary embolism, would give the
      opportunity to create a simple, inexpensive and widely applicable tool to eliminate the
      presence of a thrombus in the left heart.

      If the results are satisfactory, the investigators might consider not using transesophageal
      echocardiography as this examination is unpleasant for the patient and operator dependant,
      unlike a standard blood sampling.

      This study aims to test the following hypothesis: D-dimers values superior or equal to ten
      times the patient's age is predictive of a thrombus.
