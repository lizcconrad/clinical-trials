  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VMI-CFA study investigates the efficacy of the Supera Stent in the treatment of common
      femoral artery stenosis or occlusion. 100 patients will be included with a RF of 2 to 4. The
      lesion is located within the native CFA and treated with predillation prior to stenting with
      the Supera Peripheral Stent System. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6
      and 12 month post procedure. The primary endpoint of the study is the primary patency at 12
      months and periprocedural events up to 30 days post procedure. Secondary endpoints include
      technical success, primary patency rate at 1 &amp; 6 month, freedom from TLR at 1-, 6- and 12
      month follow-up and clinical success at 1-, 6- &amp; 12-month follow-up.

             times

          -  Patient is &gt;18 years old

          -  Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent,
             prior to enrolment in the study

          -  Patient has a projected life expectancy of at least 12 months

          -  Prior to enrolment, the guidewire has crossed target lesion

          -  De novo lesions located in the common femoral artery, suitable for endovascular
             therapy

          -  The target lesions are located within the native CFA: localized between the origin of
             the circumflex iliac artery and the proximal (1cm) superficial femoral artery.

          -  There is angiographic evidence of a patent deep femoral artery

          -  The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis &gt; 50% or occlusion

          -  There is angiographic evidence of at least one-vessel-runoff to the foot, irrespective
             of whether or not outflow was re-established by means of previous endovascular
             intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

             that has not reached the primary endpoint.

          -  Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF, severe COPD, metastatic malignancy,
             dementia, etc.) or other medical condition that would preclude compliance with the
             study protocol or 1-year life expectancy

          -  Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or non-study
