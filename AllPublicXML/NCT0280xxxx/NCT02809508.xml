    <textblock>
      The purpose of FiSK Junior is to investigate whether intake of oily fish compared to poultry
      affects cardiovascular risk markers, cognitive function, and behaviour in healthy children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FiSK Junior study compares the effects of consuming oily fish versus poultry (control) in
      healthy 8-9 year-old Danish children. The children will be randomized to consume
      approximately 300 g/week of either oily fish or poultry for 12 weeks. Measurements and
      biological sampling will be performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention.

      The main objective of the study is to investigate the effect on cardiovascular risk markers,
      primarily blood pressure and plasma triacylglycerol. Moreover, the effects on cognitive
      function, behaviour, emotions and physiological stress response will be assessed. In
      addition, change in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid status (compliance),
      anthropometry, body composition, vitamin D status, inflammatory markers, growth markers,
      physical activity and diet will be measured. Outcomes will be analysed with focus on
      potential gender- and genotype-specific effects.
