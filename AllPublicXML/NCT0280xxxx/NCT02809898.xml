  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary cancer ranked fifth in all gastrointestinal malignant cancer. Epidemiological surveys
      showed a significant increasing trend in recent years. How can make an early diagnosis of
      bile duct cancer as well as prognostic evaluation and efficacy monitoring, has become the
      hotspot. &quot;liquid biopsy&quot;, which is meant to detect cancers by sequencing the DNA in a few
      drops of a person's blood. It may detect cancers early, even before symptoms arise, when
      there is just a few cells in the blood circulation.

      cf-DNA in cancer patients often bears similar genetic and epigenetic features to the related
      tumor DNA. There is evidence that some of the cf-DNA originates from tumoral tissue. This,
      and the fact that cf-DNA can easily be isolated from the circulation and other body fluids of
      patients, makes it a promising candidate as a non-invasive biomarker of cancer. And we call
      the cf-DNA of tumor as ct-DNA.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is any peripheral blood cell having a round
      nucleus. These cells can be extracted from whole blood using ficoll, a hydrophilic
      polysaccharide. PBMC contains genetic material of tumor and may be applied as a biomarker.

      This study aims to evaluate the role of ct-DNA and PBMC as biomarkers in the treatment of
      biliary tract cancer.
