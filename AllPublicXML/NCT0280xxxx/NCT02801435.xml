      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Icotinib
      Hydrochloride Cream in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Icotinib Hydrochloride is a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment of advanced nonsmall- cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) in China in its oral form. As EGFR is implicated in the pathogenesis of
      psoriasis, icotinib hydrochloride is being developed as a cream for the treatment of mild to
      moderate psoriasis. This is a single-center, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled
      study of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 4.0% icotinib hydrochloride cream by topical administration.
      Icotinib hydrochloride cream will be applied to subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis.
      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled.
