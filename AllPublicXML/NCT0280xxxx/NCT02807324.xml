  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is considered a cardiovascular (CV) stress test, and complicated pregnancies are
      associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. Moreover,
      it is known that often the pregnancy induced CV adaptation does not resolve completely after
      a short postpartum (PP) period and it is not clear whether these induced changes will resolve
      over a longer period of time (i.e. in the upcoming months/years after delivery).
      Understanding the cardiac adaptation during pregnancy and the reversal process in the
      postpartum period, as well as the factors that influence this these processes, may provide us
      not only insight in this mechanism, but may help us in identifying factors that may be target
      points for modification.

      The main goal of this study is to explore the pattern of physiologic and pathophysiologic
      cardiac recovery after a preeclamptic pregnancy compared to a normotensive pregnancy, up till
      18 months PP.

      This study is a longitudinal cohort study. The first measurement will be performed upon
      admittance for induction of labour or caesarean section, which corresponds with 48-24 hours
      before delivery. Further measurements will be performed in clusters at PP intervals of: 24-48
      hours, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months. Cases will also receive
      an additional baseline measurement upon PE diagnosis.

      Cases consist of women with preeclampsia (PE) and/or HELLP syndrome in the current pregnancy
      (early and late PE, with or without intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR)), whereas
      controls are women with an uncomplicated pregnancy. 290 women in total will be included.
      Inclusion will of case subjects will occur upon diagnosis, inclusion of controls will occur
      before delivery.

      The first visit of this study will be performed upon admittance after PE diagnosis for cases,
      and for controls while the participant is administered for the induction of labour or
      caesarean section, thus an extra visit is not necessary. This is also true for the first
      postpartum (PP) measurements. The next 6 visits will be after the participant is discharged
      from the hospital and extra visits are necessary, except for the 6 weeks PP visit, which is a
      routine visit. The frequent visits may cause some discomfort, especially since our
      participants are young mothers who still need to take care of their child. During the
      measurement, one of our co-workers will assist in taking care of the newborn if necessary, so
      that the participant can bring her child with her. Each of the visits will last approximately
      2 hours in the MUMC+. The only invasive procedure is a venapunction where 75 ml blood will be
      extracted. The only unfavourable side effect can be a small hematoma (rare). Clinically,
      participants will be advised based on their risk profile following standard &quot;cardiovascular
      (CV) risk management&quot;. Transthoracic echocardiography, glycocalyx measurements and a
      FibroScan will be performed. Experience shows that this investigation is not experienced as
      uncomfortable. Also, 3 liters of exhaled air will be collected for VOCs analysis. All
      measurements will be performed or supervised by an experienced researcher. These
      investigations are already approved previously in other METC applications (CMO-nr: 2008/226;
      2009/004; 10-2-066). The other measurements (questionnaires, blood pressure (BP), weight
      measurement, urine collection, glycocalyx measurement, FibroScan and exhaled air collection)
      do not cause any discomfort for the patient besides the time that it takes. On the other
      hand, potential health improvement and early detection of CV risk profiles and initiation of
      already existing effective prevention strategies that improve lifestyle are important
      benefits.

      For potential participants who find the number of extra visits too great a burden, a short
      track version of the study is available with less postpartum visits. the first 3 measurement
      moments do not differ between both versions. However, after the first PP measurement,
      24-48hrs after delivery, they will only have one more additional visit at 12 months PP, but
      we will include a coronary CTA, an MFD and carotid IMT measurement.

    <description>The prevalence of abnormal cardiac findings amongst participants, such as, Concentric remodeling (based on relative wall thickness (RWT) and LVmass (gr/m2)), left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (based on LVmass (gr/m2)), LV segmental myocardial impaired relaxation, LV segmental myocardial impaired contractility, Global systolic and diastolic dysfunction (based on ejection fraction (%) and E/A ratio respectively).</description>

    <measure>Overall health and lifestyle - Metabolic syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The MetS is a cluster of risk factors which consists of cardio-metabolic abnormalities (insulin resistance and/or impaired glucose tolerance, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides (TG)) and cardiovascular mechanical stress indicators (elevated BP, micro albuminuria, obesity). We will define the MetS based on The World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. It consists of impaired glucose regulation, diabetes mellitus or insulin resistance with at least two of the following criteria: Elevated TG (≥1.7 nmol/l) or reduced HDL-cholesterol (&lt; 1.0 mmol/l),Elevated BP (≥140/85mmHg), Central obesity (waist-hip ratio &gt; 0.85 or BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2), Micro-albuminuria (&gt; 0.30 g/mmol creatinine)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall health and lifestyle - Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors amongst participants (determined via questionnaires).The questionnaires contains questions about daily exercise, eating and drinking habits (mainly the consumption of fruits and vegetables), and smoking/alcohol/drugs consumption. Lifestyle is known to affect the risk for CVD.By exploring lifestyle factors in both subjects and controls, we will be able to determine the (confounding) contributio of lifestyle factors for the increased risk of CVD after PE. Consequently, we will be able to study the contribution of PE independent of lifestyle on the development of CVD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall health and lifestyle - Microcirculation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with an increased perfused boundary region (PBR), as measures with Glycocheck. The main read-out parameter of the glycocheck machine is the perfused boundary region (PBR). In short, the endothelial glycocalyx constitutes a protective barrier for the vessel wall, which limits the proximity of erythrocytes to the endothelial cells in the microvasculature, causing the PBR to be small in healthy conditions. In contrast, perturbation of the glycocalyx allows deeper cell penetration into the glycocalyx, leading to an increase in PBR. Monitoring of the PBR, therefore, gives information about the barrier properties of the glycocalyx and the state of the microvascular system.</description>

        Controls will be recruited at the outpatient clinic if a planned induction or C-section is
        indicated due to any obstetric reason other than placental insufficiency or pregnancy
        related hypertensive disease. Cases will be recruited at the MUMC+, since the current
        guideline in the Netherlands states that women diagnosed with preeclampsia should be
        referred to specialist care in the hospital.
