  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The KOrea COpd Subgroup Study team (KOCOSS) cohort is an ongoing, longitudinal, prospective,
      non-interventional and observational study within the Korean COPD patients. The prevalence of
      early COPD (mild to moderate COPD based by 2011 GOLD(the Global Initiative for Chronic
      Obstructive Lung Disease) guideline) is high in Korea. However, the patients with early COPD
      are not underdiagnosed due to mild symptom. The purpose of this study is to investigate early
      COPD characteristics and disease course and to form a guideline for early detection of COPD
      patients and prevention of progression to severe COPD.

      This study is a multicentered, observational study of the patients with COPD who were
      enrolled in 45 tertiary and university-affiliated hospitals from December 2012 to now.

      The initial evaluation for all patients includes pulmonary function tests (PFT), 6-min walk
      distance (6MWD), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea
      scale, and the COPD-specific version of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C),
      exacerbations in the previous 12 months, smoking status, patient-reported education level,
      medications and comorbidities.

      Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are performed every 6 months and CAT, mMRC and SGRQ-C are
      evaluated every 6 months and 6 min walt test is performed every years during the whole period
      of study.

      All of the data were reported using case-report forms (CRFs) which are completed by
      physicians or trained nurses, and the patients are to be evaluated at regular 6-month
      intervals after the initial examination.

    <description>COPD severity will be assessed based on post-bronchodilator Forced expiratory volume in one second(FEV) and FEV1/FVC(Forced vital capacity). FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) :Mild - FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7, FEV1 â‰¥80% normal Moderate - FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7, FEV1 50-79% normal; Severe - FEV1/FVC&lt;0.70, FEV1 30-49% normal; Very Severe - FEV1/FVC&lt;0.70, FEV1 &lt;30% predicted.
