      Single site, double blinded, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial. 40 subjects will
      be selected based on the inclusion criteria and then randomized to either the intervention
      group or the placebo control group. Prior to the start of this study, a Controlled Substance
      Utilization Review and Evaluation (CURES) reports will be acquired to establish baseline
      number of opioid prescriptions for each subject. Subjects will track how consistently they
      are using pain medications, both opioids and non-opioids, during the two weeks prior to the
      start of the study. They will also provide twice daily recordings of their pain intensity via
      a mobile application. At the end of this two-week period, each subject will be fitted with a
      Quell or a sham device, including initial calibration to the subject's comfort level as
      described in the background section.Once the study subjects have started using the device, we
      will also be able to monitor and track their sleep wirelessly via the mobile application as
      long as they are wearing the device. Subjects will receive weekly check in's to monitor the
      functionality of the device and to help troubleshoot any issues with the device for the
      duration of subject participation in the study. These check-ins will take place in person, by
      phone, and or per subject's usual outpatient oncology visits. Each subject will use their
      device for 8 weeks, during which they will continue to track their pain, sleep and frequency
      of pain medication use as stated above. Study investigators will receive automated alerts via
      email to ensure that study are participants using their devices and that the devices are
      powered on at regular intervals for the duration of the study.Total duration of subject
      participation will be 10 weeks.
