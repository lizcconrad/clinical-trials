  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of rifampin, a potent cytochrome P450 3A4
      inducer, at steady-state on the systemic exposure of a single dose of pacritinib in healthy
      subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, open-label, one-way crossover, drug-interaction study. On Day 1,
      subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib. Following a 7-day washout period,
      600-mg oral doses of rifampin were administered once daily (QD) on Days 8 through 17. It was
      anticipated that steady-state concentrations of rifampin would be achieved by Day 17. On Day
      17, a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib was co-administered with the final 600-mg dose of
      rifampin.

             gamma-glutamyl transferase &gt; ULN; or total bilirubin

             &gt; ULN) or kidney function tests (serum creatinine &gt; ULN); laboratory values may be
             confirmed by repeat;

          3. history of malignancy, except the following: cancers determined to be cured or in
             remission for ≥5 years, curatively resected basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers,
             cervical cancer in situ, or resected colonic polyps;

          4. history of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound,
             food, or other substance, including rifampin, unless approved by the Investigator in

         18. participation in strenuous exercise for 48 hours prior to Check-in (Day -1) and during
             the period of confinement at the CRU; subjects will otherwise maintain their normal
             level of physical activity throughout the entire study (ie, will not begin a new
             exercise program nor participate in any unusually strenuous physical exertion);

         19. poor peripheral venous access;

         20. any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit
             the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study
