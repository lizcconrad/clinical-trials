  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients with brain metastases (BM) have poor prognosis. Current treatments produce
      limited efficacy. Recent advance in cancer immunotherapy has provided important new means to
      treat cancer patients at advanced stages. This study is designed to perform a clinical trial
      to treat advanced caner patients with brain metastases with personalized cellular vaccines.
      The patients will receive vaccines consisting of autologous tumor cells, tumor antigen pulsed
      DCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Safety and efficacy will be observed in
      this study.

      This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I/II study designed to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular tumor vaccines for cancer
      patients with brain metastases (BM). BM patients will undergo tumor resection or biopsy and
      the tumor tissues will be analyzed for the expression of tumor antigens and immune-related
      genes. Tumor cells will be irradiated and used as vaccines. The patients will be immunized
      with DCs and PBMCs pulsed with mRNA encoded tumor antigens. Patients will be immunized with a
      total of twelve tumor vaccines. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The primary objective
      is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines. The secondary objective is to
      assess the efficacy of the vaccines using RANO-BM criteria, progression-free survival and
      overall survival. In addition, the antitumor specific T cell responses will be measured.
