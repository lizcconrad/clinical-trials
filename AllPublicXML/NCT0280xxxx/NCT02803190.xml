  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' previous studies in 2014 and 2015 have demonstrated that among
      community-dwelling older adults with high osteoporotic fracture risks. many sarcopenia
      indices can be improved and bone mineral density (BMD) maintained with different exercise
      programs. In 2016, the investigators aim to determine the effects of 2 exercise interventions
      on posture corrections and further improvement of sarcopenic indices

      The current study enrolled subjects who already participated in the 2015 study (n=109) at the
      National Taiwan University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch (NTUHBB). Subjects will be maintained in
      their original integrated care group (ICG, target n=50) and muscle training group (MTG,
      target n=50) when possible. If target sample size is not reached, clinic patients are
      screened for high risk of fall, osteoporosis/fracture by standardized questionnaires or FRAX
      for enrollments. New participants are randomized into the ICG and MTG groups. Other than
      assessments provided in 2015, digital photography on posture and low back pain assessments
      are done in 2016. All participants received a CD-ROM and one hour education on osteoporosis,
      sarcopenia, frailty, fall prevention, nutrition, low back pain, good posture, and coping
      strategy and another hour of professional led exercise program with more focus on central
      muscle groups. ICG subjects received once weekly group exercise while MTG subjects received
      twice weekly machine-based resistance training on major muscle groups. Major outcomes were
      muscle mass (measured by bio-impedance analysis), grip strength, walking speed, and lower leg
      extension power, Chinese version of Oswestry Disability Index v 2.1 score (for low back
      pain), and spine curve angle (by photography) at baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention.
