      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness
      of ExAblate thermal ablation of a subcortical focal epileptic target area in the brain of
      patients suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the ExAblate transcranial
      system to produce multiple sonications targeted in the lesion of interest. The investigators
      will establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness
      of ExAblate thermal ablation of a subcortical focal epileptic target area in the brain of
      patients suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the ExAblate transcranial

      will establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.

      The hypotheses tested are that:

        1. MRgFUS treatment of subcortical lesional epilepsy is feasible and safe, with a low risk
           of adverse effects as evaluated during the follow-up period.

        2. ExAblate treatment of subcortical lesions in patients with subcortical lesional epilepsy
           reduces the seizure frequency.
