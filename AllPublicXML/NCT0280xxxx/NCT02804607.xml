  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic skin lesions and in particular the burns which happen to growing children are
      complex and require an adapted and early patient care management. A child presents physical,
      psychological, and physiological characteristics which involve a specific functional
      prognosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the functional outcome after a mid-term
      period from a severe skin traumatism occurring during childhood and which had required an
      initial graft.
