  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block
      to prevent shoulder tip pain following primary laparoscopic gastric banding, band revision,
      band replacement, primary sleeve gastrectomy or revision of sleeve gastrectomy. Shoulder tip
      pain (STP) is a common problem after laparoscopic surgery, manifesting in the post-anesthesia
      care unit and for days or possibly weeks thereafter (Dixon 2005). Systemic analgesics
      including opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not reliably relieve
      STP. This study is designed to determine if the SPG block, a simple and low-risk procedure,
      effectively treats STP after laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group prospective, double-blind study. The
      primary outcome variable will be change in STP from &gt; 4 before to after treatment in the PACU
      after primary laparoscopic gastric banding, band revision, band replacement, sleeve
      gastrectomy, or revision of sleeve gastrectomy. Investigators hope to achieve a decline in
      STP in 2 units after treatment.
