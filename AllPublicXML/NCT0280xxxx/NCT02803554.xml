      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the beneficial effects of infusions of plasma from
      young donors using blood biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will receive an infusion of plasma derived from a young donor (16-25 years of
      age). A panel of age-associated biomarkers will be measured before and after treatment.

      We have drawn biomarkers from clinical measures of aging and physiology, biomarkers of
      disease advancement, as well as biomarkers of aging from animal and human studies. These will
      represent a spectrum of physiologic pathways with evidence-based connections to aging. They
      include the physiologic processes of inflammation, neurogenesis, stem cell proliferation,
      blood clotting, immune function, and amyloid plaques. Organ function which will be
      specifically measured includes the liver, bone marrow, kidneys, pancreas, muscles,
      cardiovasculature, cerebrovasculature, and the thyroid. Specific disease states connected to
      these biomarkers include anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, obesity, diabetes, high
      cholesterol, elevated risk of cancer, atherosclerosis, dementia, and cataracts.
