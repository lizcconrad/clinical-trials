  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence to support early mobilization（EM）for critically ill patients,current status
      in Chinese ICUs is unknown.Understanding current practice patterns and challenges is
      essential to inform future research and strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Practice guideline recommend EM in ICU,feasibility, safety and efficacy are confirmed by
      evidence-based data.However,the prevalence of EM in ICU patients is still low.Moreover,most
      of the prevalence studies come from developed countries, such as: Australia and New England
      the United States and Europe. Many ICUs in non-western countries are suffering from a lack of
      medical resources including health care personnel and medical equipment.

      A retrospective observational study.To access the implementation of Chinese intensive care
      units and hospitals to early mobilization.Secondary objectives were to evaluate structure and
      process parameters of Chinese hospitals that were associated with implementation.
