  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MASTER study is a 4-year prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study (PROBE)
      comparing 2 management strategies 1) office BP as a guide to treatment, or 2) 24-hour ABP as
      a guide to treatment. Study objectives are to investigate whether a management strategy based
      on out-of-office BP (Ambulatory BP monitoring) versus a management strategy based on office
      BP measurements is associated with differences in outcome, including cardiovascular and renal
      intermediate end points at one year; cardiovascular events at 4 years and changes in a number
      of blood pressure-related variables throughout the study. Patients will be followed-up during
      the first year focusing on changes in left ventricular mass index (LVMI, co-primary endpoint)
      and Urinary albumin excretion (UAE, albumin/creatinine ratio, co-primary end-point), and
      during the whole 48 month period for both changes in LVMI and UAE and events including
      all-cause mortality, CV morbidity and mortality, cerebral morbidity and mortality.A total of
      1240 subjects will be recruited by 30 centers, taking into account a dropout rate of 15% (620
      subjects per randomization arm).
