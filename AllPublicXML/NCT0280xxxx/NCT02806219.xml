  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, Phase 1 bioequivalence (BE) study in healthy subjects
      designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a single dose of certolizumab pegol (CZP) 200mg
      when injected by means of a prefilled syringe (PFS, reference) or injected by means of a
      injection device (e-Device, test).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female and between 18 and 55 years of age at Screening.

          -  Subject is in good physical and mental health status determined on the basis of the
             medical history and a general clinical examination.

          -  Subject has no evidence of active or inactive Tuberculosis (TB).

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test at
             study entry and should be using a medically accepted method of contraception during
             the entire duration of the study and for 10 weeks after the final dose of CZP.

        Female subjects who are postmenopausal for at least 2 years and have a serum follicle
        stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40mIU/mL at the Screening Visit, or have undergone a
        hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, and/or bilateral ovariectomy, or have a congenital
        sterility are considered not of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject receiving any live (includes attenuated) vaccination or immunoglobulins within
             56 days preceding the CZP injection.

          -  Subject has taken any drugs (including over-the-counter medications) within 56 days
             preceding the CZP injection (with the exception of those noted in Section 7.8.1.).

          -  Subject is known to be intolerant to pegol.

          -  Subject has previously received CZP.

          -  Subject has received TNFÎ±-inhibitors within 12 months or other biologic within 6
             months before randomization into the study.

          -  Subject has an active or chronic/latent infection including TB, hepatitis C virus
             (HCV), hepatitis B core antigen (HBc), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).--
             Subject has symptomatic herpes zoster infection (shingles) within 6 months prior to
             Screening.

          -  Subject has chronic, serious, opportunistic recurring infection or condition within 6
             months prior to Screening.
