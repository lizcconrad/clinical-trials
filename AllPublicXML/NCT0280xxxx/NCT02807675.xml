    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study to
      evaluate the safety of CVT-301 levodopa (l-dopa) when co- administered with the first daily
      dose of oral levodopa/carbidopa for early morning OFF symptoms in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD).

      An &quot;OFF state&quot; is defined as the time when medication is no longer providing benefit with
      respect to mobility, slowness, and stiffness. OFF episodes may be heralded by non-motor
      symptoms (e.g., pain, anxiety) prior to the appearance of motor symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  have idiopathic PD (i.e., not induced by drugs or other diseases) as defined by
             fulfilling Steps 1 and 2 of the United Kingdom (UK) Brain Bank criteria, diagnosed
             after the age of 30 years

          -  diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations and early morning OFF symptoms

          -  classified as Stage 1 to 3 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale for staging of PD
             severity (in an ON state)

          -  subjects who are on a l-dopa-containing therapy, not including Rytary (or equivalent),
             must be stable on oral l-dopa-containing therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to the
             Screening Visit with a l-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI)-containing regimen

          -  subjects who are on a l-dopa-containing therapy, when including Rytary (or
             equivalent), should be on a stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to the Screening
             Visit

          -  the frequency of l-dopa administrations must be at least 3 times during the waking day
             and a total daily l-dopa dose of ≤ 1600 mg.

          -  on a stable regimen of their standard PD medications

          -  on a stable regimen of any blood pressure reducing medications (if applicable) for at
             least 30 days prior to screening

          -  forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥60% of predicted for race, age, sex,
             and height and FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio ≥70%

          -  no clinically significant abnormalities that would affect ability to complete study as
             determined by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, clinical
             laboratory test results

          -  negative drug and alcohol testing

          -  negative pregnancy test for all women.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  participated in any prior study with CVT-301

          -  dyskinesia of a severity that would significantly interfere with the subject's ability
             to participate or perform study procedures (as determined by the UPDRS Part 4)

          -  any contraindication to performing routine spirometry or who are unable to perform a
             spirometry maneuver

          -  have a current history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension or are treated with
             medications to treat orthostatic hypotension (for example droxidopa, fludrocortisone),
             if they have severe dysautonomia

          -  have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or another chronic
             respiratory disease within the last 5 years.
