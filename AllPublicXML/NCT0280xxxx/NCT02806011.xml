  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year (+30 days) long term follow up study to evaluate the safety of Livercellgram
      in subject who participated in and completed the Livercellgram Phase 2 trials (refer to
      ClinicalTrials.gov.Identifier: NCT01875081).

      This trial is planned to evaluate the safety of Livercellgram in patients with alcoholic
      liver cirrhosis. Subjects who signed this follow-up observation informed consent form will
      participate in a safety assessment (tumor marker test, occurrence of adverse events and
      serious adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign, physical examinations.).
