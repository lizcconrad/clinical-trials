  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot proof of concept, open-label clinical trial. Twenty-five subjects
      will be enrolled in 6 sites.

      Metastatic breast cancer patients with disease progression to bevacizumab-alone maintenance
      treatment will be potential candidates.

      Bevacizumab maintenance will be considered as six weeks of bevacizumab treatment in
      monotherapy after the last dose of chemotherapy in the context of bevacizumab plus
      chemotherapy first-line regimens.

      When progression to bevacizumab-alone maintenance treatment occurs, patients will enter the
      trial and will start receiving DURVALUMAB 750 mg (equivalent to 10 mg/kg Q2W) IV infusion, if
      ≥ 30 kg, every 2 weeks together with bevacizumab 15mg/kg IV infusion every 3 weeks. The
      patients will undergo a tumor biopsy before the first dose of DURVALUMAB, and after one month
      of combined treatment - the blood sampling will continue on a monthly basis. The treatment
      will continue until disease progression or for a maximum of 50 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired resistance against chronic administration of the monoclonal antibody antiangiogenic
      agent like bevacizumab in breast cancer is caused in a fraction of patients by an immune
      reprogramming. The immune reprogramming can be detected by elevated counts of Tregs in
      peripheral blood, aberrant pattern of cytokines, and elevated concentrations of kynurenine
      and immunosuppressive/vasodilator prostaglandins. The addition of DURVALUMAB to a
      bevacizumab-based treatment would delay or abrogate these changes and be of therapeutic
      interest in this scenario.

    <description>Durvalumab is an investigational human monoclonal antibody directed against programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 can be expressed by tumours to evade detection by the immune system through binding to PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Durvalumab blocks the PD-L1 interaction with PD-1, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics.</description>
