  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major global health concern which has resulted in an
      estimated 39 million deaths world-wide. Although it is now a treatable medical condition
      there is still avoidable morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection in the UK.
      Late diagnosis (CD4 count of &lt;350 cells/mm3 or AIDS-defining illness irrespective of CD4
      count) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, increased risk of transmission,
      impaired response to antiretroviral therapy and increased healthcare costs. In Grampian, 49%
      of patients were diagnosed late between 1984 and 2011. Therefore, the aim of the study is to
      determine the factors associated with late HIV diagnosis in Grampian between 2009 and 2014 to
      ascertain whether diagnoses could have been made earlier.

      The study constitutes a secondary data analysis. Individuals newly diagnosed with HIV between
      January 2009 and December 2014 were identified from a Health Protection Scotland (HPS)
      database. The majority of outcome data were extracted from the existing HPS database. Missing
      data were collected via a retrospective review of patient case-notes, laboratory reports and
      an electronic patient management system. Patients were classified as early or late diagnosis
      and comparisons were made between the groups using statistical tests. The study sought to
      provide a basis for recommendations for improvement of information and services to facilitate
      earlier HIV diagnosis in Grampian.
