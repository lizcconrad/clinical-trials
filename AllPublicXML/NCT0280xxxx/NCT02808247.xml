  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentric, randomized, open label Phase II trial investigating
      whether the oral angiogenesis inhibitor nintedanib, as compared to the intravenous cytotoxic
      compound ifosfamide, given for patients with advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic STS after
      failure of first line chemotherapy prolongs progression-free survival.

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate whether nintedanib given as second-line
      therapy for advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic STS prolongs progression-free survival
      when compared with ifosfamide.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of nintedanib as compared to ifosfamide in
      terms of progression-free survival rate at 12 weeks, overall survival, objective response
      rate, patient benefit rate, response duration, total duration of treatment with nintedanib
      safety, Health related Quality of Life and Health Economics.

      Exploratory objectives include an analysis of putative predictive biomarkers for the
      anti-tumor effects of the investigational agent nintedanib.treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria/Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic malignant STS of
             intermediate or high grade, excluding the:

          -  Well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipoma

          -  Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma

          -  Chondrosarcoma (extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is eligible)

          -  Osteosarcoma (extraskeletal osteosarcoma is eligible)

          -  Ewing family of tumors/primitive neuroectodermal tumor

          -  Gastro-intestinal stromal tumor

          -  Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

          -  For STS where no established grading system exists, or sarcoma subtypes which are very
             indolent or have an unpredictable clinical behavior, patient entry requires
             prospective approval in writing, on a case-by-case basis by the Study Coordinator of
             this trial and EORTC Headquarters (HQ).

          -  Representative formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor blocks or unstained tissue
             slides, either from the primary tumor or a metastatic lesion, must be available for
             histological central review. Histological central review is not required before
             treatment start but it is mandatory to send unstained tumor slides (blocks optional)
             at time of study entry. Local histopathological diagnosis will be accepted for entry
             into this trial.

          -  Prior to study enrolment, all patients need to have confirmed RECIST 1.1 disease
             progression based on local investigator's assessment.

          -  Presence of measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.

          -  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to
             other loco-regional therapy, are considered non-measurable unless there has been
             demonstrated progression (20 % increase) in the assessed lesion since the local
             treatment.

          -  No radiographic evidence of cavitary lesions (either primary tumor or metastatic
             lesions).

          -  No centrally located tumors with radiographic evidence of local invasion of major
             blood vessels.

          -  No history of central nervous system metastasis or leptomeningeal tumor spread.

          -  No active brain metastases (e.g. stable for &lt;4 weeks, no adequate previous treatment
             with radiotherapy, symptomatic, requiring treatment with anti-convulsants;
             dexamethasone therapy will be allowed if administered as stable dose for at least one
             month before randomization).

          -  One (and no less or more than one) line of previous systemic chemotherapy for
             advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic malignant STS.

          -  Prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant and or first-line maintenance systemic chemotherapy for
             locally advanced or metastatic STS is allowed and does count as zero lines of
             treatment, provided that the disease did not progress during neoadjuvant and/or
             adjuvant therapy or within 12 weeks after completion of the perioperative treatment.
             In case the disease progressed during neoadjuvant, adjuvant and or first-line
             maintenance systemic chemotherapy or within 12 weeks after its completion, the
             treatment is counted as one line and the patient can theoretically participate in the
             trial, provided all other selection criteria are met.

          -  No prior exposure to an oxazaphosphorine agent, including but not limited to
             ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, trofosfamide or evofosfamide (TH-302).

          -  No prior exposure to oral or intravenous angiogenesis inhibitors, including but not
             limited to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib,
             axitinib or similar or monoclonal antibodies targeting angiogenesis.

          -  No other anti-cancer therapy (systemic therapy, radiotherapy (except for brain and
             extremities), surgery, limb perfusion, immunotherapy) within 28 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  No treatment with another investigational agent within 28 days prior to randomization.

          -  No treatment with another investigational agent concomitantly with the trial.

             significant cardiac arrhythmia or pericardial effusion.

          -  No uncontrolled arterial hypertension defined at baseline as blood pressure ≥ 150/100
             mmHg despite adequate medical therapy.

          -  No known inherited predisposition for bleeding or thromboembolism.

             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, resected
             prostate cancer staged pT1-2 with Gleason Score ≤ 6 and postoperative PSA &lt; 0.5
             ng/ml). Patients with a history of other malignancies who are disease-free from that
             condition for more than 5 years are eligible.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those

             the trial.

          -  No active alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to randomization.

          -  Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control
             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for at
             least 3 months (nindetanib) and 6 months (ifosfamide) after the last study treatment.
             A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Since
             the effect of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been
             investigated, barrier methods should be applied as a second form of contraception, to
             avoid pregnancy.

          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to
             randomization and until 6 months after the last study treatment.

          -  Sexually active male participants must use a barrier method of contraception (e.g.,
             condom) during the study treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last
             study treatment.

          -  Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be obtained
             according to international conference on harmonisation/Good clinical practice
             (ICH/GCP) and national/local regulations.

          -  Patients can only be randomized in this trial once. Important note: All eligibility
             criteria must be adhered to, in case of potential deviation a discussion with EORTC
             Headquarters and study coordinator is mandatory.
