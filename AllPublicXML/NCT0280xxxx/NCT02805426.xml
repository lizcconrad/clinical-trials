  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial that will enroll 250 women
      (125 per study arm).

      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of oral tranexamic
      acid when used as an adjunct to misoprostol for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).
      Women will be diagnosed with postpartum hemorrhage if blood loss reaches 700ml in the
      calibrated receptacle. If diagnosed with postpartum hemorrhage , the woman will be randomized
      to receive either tranexamic acid or placebo, both in tablet form. All participants will
      receive 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol (4 tablets 200mcg each).

      The investigators hypothesize that tranexamic acid (in tablet form) as an adjunct to
      misoprostol will be more effective than misoprostol alone in stopping postpartum bleeding
      without recourse to further treatment in significantly more women.
