  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe alcoholic hepatitis, defined by a &quot;Maddrey discriminant function&quot; above 32, is
      associated with significant short-term mortality. In patients with liver disease, studies
      have shown alterations of intestinal bacterial flora and an increase in intestinal
      permeability leading to bacterial translocation across the intestinal barrier. The mechanism
      involved may be an activation of intestinal macrophages with a local release of cytokines
      like interleukin-8 (IL-8).

      Calprotectin is a protein present in large amounts in the cytosol of neutrophils. Its
      presence in feces is related to neutrophil migration in intestinal lumen. Thus, fecal
      calprotectin may be used as a marker of intestinal inflammation. There is evidence that fecal
      calprotectin levels are increased in cirrhotic patients dependent on the severity of the
      disease. The predictive value of fecal calprotectin for the outcome of severe alcoholic
      hepatitis has never been evaluated.

      The main objective of this study was to determine if the initial level of fecal calprotectin
      and its variation after 7 days had a predictive value for the outcome of severe alcoholic
      hepatitis. Secondary objectives were to determine if fecal calprotectin concentration was
      correlated with blood concentration of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein and
      predictive of infections.
