      This pilot clinical trial studies how well fluorine F 18 d-FMAU (18F-FMAU) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in diagnosing and characterizing prostate
      cancer. A PET/CT scan is an imaging test that uses a small amount of radioactive tracer that
      is given through the vein to take detailed pictures of areas inside the body where the tracer
      is taken up. Radiotracers such as 18F-FMAU may help to find the cancer and see how far the
      disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform a prospective clinical imaging evaluation of 18F-FMAU PET/CT in addition to
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and standard transrectal ultrasound
      (TRUS)-guided 12-core biopsy for detection and localization of primary tumor in 40 men with
      suspected prostate cancer based on elevated/rising prostate specific antigen level, abnormal
      digital rectal exam, or those with prior negative standard biopsy who are now returning for a
      standard of care follow-up.

      II. To examine the associations between the PET derived imaging parameters, serum PSA, mpMRI
      parameters (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], Ktrans) and the biopsy histopathology
      parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive radiotracer F 18 d-FMAU intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and then undergo
      18F-FMAU PET/CT on day 1. Patients then undergo standard of care multiparametic MRI and
      standard of care transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24-96 hours.
