      The investigators aim to retrospectively map the delays in the acute care of traumatic brain
      injury patients necessitating emergent craniotomies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the high numbers of emergent
      craniotomies for TBI performed worldwide, publications reporting on temporal delays in these
      patients are very scarce. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, there are only 3
      publications providing data on the intra-hospital delay and no publications on pre-hospital
      delay specifically for TBI patients undergoing emergent craniotomies.

      The aim of the present study is to retrospectively map delays between the emergency call of
      the national emergency telephone dispatch to the hospital's medical emergency service (EC)
      and the surgical skin incision in emergent TBI craniotomies in the investigators' level 1
      trauma center and to propose possible measures to improve performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  every patient undergoing 1 of 3 surgical procedures ('removal of epidural hematoma';
             'removal of acute subdural hematoma'; and 'decompressive craniectomy'), performed
             between February 1, 2010 and January 31, 2016, as recorded in the surgical database of
             our institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  who had a delayed clinical or radiological deterioration as a surgical indication;

          -  who did not have traumatic brain injury as the origin of the intracranial
             abnormalities;

          -  in whom not all aforementioned temporal or clinical data were readily available from
             the electronic patient file; and/or

          -  who were not admitted via our emergency department.
