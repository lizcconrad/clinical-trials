    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open trial to be conducted in overweight and obese
      individuals. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the Elipse™ Intragastric
      Balloon System for the treatment of overweight and obese individuals. The secondary objective
      is to collect efficacy and device performance information to assist with future trial design
      and device iterations.
