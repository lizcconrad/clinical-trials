  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to determine the mechanisms of vascular
      healing. The study will evaluate subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) who require an
      endovascular intervention of the femoro-popliteal (SFA) artery to restore blood flow to the
      leg.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects at least 12 million Americans annually with more than
      half a million patients undergoing an endovascular or surgical revascularization procedure in
      order to treat the disease. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of patients still have blockages
      in the leg arteries, even after these procedures.

      Advances in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer promise for understanding the mechanism of
      failure through insights into vessel wall composition, remodeling, and inflammation.
      Restenosis has a known relationship to inflammation. Advances in micro-catheter technologies
      offer the ability to deliver anti-inflammatory medications such as Dexamethasone (DEX)
      directly to the adventitia and advances in drug delivery on balloon surfaces to deliver
      paclitaxel to the intima of the artery.

      This study aims to investigate if patient-specific parameters affect angioplasty outcomes, if
      DEX has a biological effect on the vessel wall, and if this effect is through the reduction
      of inflammation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female ≥ 35 years of age

          2. Atherosclerotic, infrainguinal PAD

          3. Rutherford Clinical Category 2-6

          4. Stenosis detected by radiology that in the clinician's opinion is the reason for the
             PAD symptoms

          5. Patient is willing to provide informed consent and comply with the required follow up
             visits, testing schedule, and medication regimen

          6. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 and/or threshold established by the
             local Institutional Review Board or Committee of Human Research

        Procedural Criteria:

          1. De novo atherosclerotic lesion qualifying for angioplasty

          2. A patent artery proximal to the index lesion. Concomitant inflow procedures, including
             open femoral artery endarterectomy and/or stenting of the iliac arteries, are
             permissible.

          3. &gt;50% diameter stenosis of the superficial femoral artery and/or popliteal artery
             (between the profunda and tibioperoneal trunk)

          4. Reference vessel diameter ≥3 mm and ≤ 8mm

          5. Successful wire crossing of lesion

          6. Successful angioplasty of the index lesion or part of the index lesion, defined as
             ≤30% residual lumen stenosis compared with adjacent non-diseased lumen diameter,
             without flow-limiting dissection

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Screening Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication to receiving an MRI

          2. Pregnant, nursing, or planning on becoming pregnant in &lt; 2yrs

          3. Life expectancy of &lt; 1 yr

          4. History of solid organ transplantation

          5. Patient actively participating in another investigational device or drug study

          6. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months of index procedure

          7. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 30 days of index
             procedure

          8. Chronic renal insufficiency with eGFR &lt; 30

          9. Prior bypass surgery, stenting, atherectomy or angioplasty of the index lesion

         10. Inability to take required study medications

         11. Contra-indication or known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone sodium phosphate,
             contrast media, gadolinium, aspirin or Plavix

         12. Systemic fungal infection

         13. Acute limb ischemia

         14. Prior participation of the index limb in the current study (contralateral treatment is
             allowed)

         15. Patient is being treated with long-term steroids (not including treatment of a
             bronchial condition with inhaled steroids)

        Procedural Criteria:

          1. Index lesions extending into the tibial trifurcation or above the profunda. Note: the
             outflow tibial artery can be treated concomitantly. Similarly, the common femoral
             artery can be treated concomitantly, either with open endarterectomy and patch
             angioplasty or with endovascular methods. However, the index lesion cannot be
             contiguous with either the CFA or the tibial trifurcation.

          2. Circumferential calcification at index lesion, which in the judgment of the
             investigator would prevent penetration of the Micro-Infusion catheter needle through
             the vessel wall

          3. Inadequate distal outflow defined as no patent tibial arteries (&gt;50% stenosis). The
             outflow vessel can be established at the time of primary treatment

          4. Use of adjunctive therapies other than angioplasty. Chocolate balloons and/or scoring
             balloons are allowed, if used below reference diameter.
