  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fats and oils are made up of &gt;90% triacylglycerol fat molecules which consist of a glycerol
      backbone to which 3 esterified fatty acids are attached. The positions of fatty acid
      attachment are referred to by stereospecific numbers, sn -1, -2 and -3. There is existing
      evidence to show that vegetable oils having unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position with
      predominantly palmitic acid (16:0) or stearic acid (18:0) in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of
      fat molecules do not raise serum cholesterol levels. These observations have come to be known
      as or explained by the &quot;sn-2 hypothesis&quot;. New evidence have also emerged to show that
      saturated fatty acids (16:0, 18:0) in the sn-1 and -3 positions reduces fat deposition in a
      rat model. In this proposed study, the effects on the outcome measures investigated of three
      test fats [namely palm olein IV64 (POP), virgin olive oil (OOO) and cocoa butter (POS)], with
      oleic acid primarily at the sn-2 position but differing amounts of palmitic, stearic and
      oleic acids at the sn-1/sn-3 positions of the triglyceride molecule, are investigated
