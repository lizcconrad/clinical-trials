    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging disease. The genotype 1 and 2 are predominant in Asia
      and Africa, and are responsible for recurrent epidemics. Genotype 3 is the main genotype
      found in Europe and North America and is responsible for sporadic infections except for
      travel associated diseases.

      HEV had a principally asymptomatic form. However, it was recently demonstrated that it could
      lead to a chronic form, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Moreover, in liver
      transplanted patients the infection could mimic a rejection and lead to the loss of the
      transplant. In other immunosuppressed patients, chronic hepatitis lead to cirrhosis and its
      well-known complications (ascitis, digestive hemorrhage, liver failure...). There is a lack
      of information about the prevalence of this disease.

      In Canada the incidence of HEV infection was high (15-86% for liver transplanted children
      with liver tests disturbed). In Germany the prevalence was lower: 3,2% in liver &amp; kidney
      transplanted children whereas 7,4% in control. It was shown in a retrospective study that in
      liver (and liver+kidney) transplanted children the prevalence in Lyon was around 8,3%.

      This study will determined in a prospective approach the HEV prevalence in kidney, lung,
      heart and bone marrow transplanted children in Lyon.
