  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute confusional states known as delirium frequently occur in Intensive Care Units (ICU),
      mostly after cardiac surgery, leading to serious consequences. Sleep deprivation has been
      described in ICU patients and is considered as a risk factor for delirium but its role is
      still unknown. It is therefore essential to identify whether sleep deprivation and more
      specifically REM sleep alterations could facilitate occurence of delirium in ICU.
