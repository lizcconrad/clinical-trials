    <textblock>
      This study is a post-market clinical follow-up study. A post-market, prospective clinical
      trial will be conducted. The data collected from this study will serve the purpose of
      confirming safety and performance of the FLXfit™ implant.

    <textblock>
      As detailed by Expanding Orthopedics Inc., the FLXfit™ is an expandable, articulated
      interbody fusion device (IBFD) used in conjunction with supplemental fixation to provide
      structural stability in skeletally mature individuals following total or partial discectomy.

      The FLXfit™ is a unique titanium cage which articulates laterally as well as expands in
      height. This enables larger footprint support as well as restoration of disc height and
      lordotic angle correction. A bullet-nose design facilitates self-distraction and ease of
      insertion. The open architecture of the device allows it to be packed with autogenous bone
      graft.

          -  Endocrine or metabolic disorders known to affect osteogenesis (e.g. Paget's disease,
             renal osteodystrophy, hypothyroidism)

          -  Systemic disease that requires the chronic administration of nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory or steroidal drugs

          -  Suspected or documented allergy or intolerance to implant's materials

          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease

          -  Patient unwilling to cooperate with postoperative instructions.

             to achieve a successful result.

          -  Patient having inadequate tissue coverage over the operative site or inadequate bone
             stock or quality.

          -  Any patient in which implant utilization would interfere with anatomical structures or
             expected physiological performance.

          -  Prior fusion at the level to be treated.

          -  Back VAS &lt; 4/10
