  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are one of the lipid lowering drugs that help in reducing cholesterol levels in the
      body by specifically inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; which is a
      rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. Rosuvastatin (RSV) and atorvastatin (ATV)
      have shown to have bone stimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.. The present study aims to
      explore the efficacy of 1.2% RSV and 1.2% ATV gel as a local drug delivery and redelivery
      system as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of degree II
      furcation defects.

      system as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of degree II
      furcation defects.

      Methods: Ninety patients with mandibular buccal class II furcation defects were randomly
      allocated into three treatment groups: SRP plus placebo gel (group 1), SRP plus 1.2% RSV gel
      (group 2) and 1.2% ATV gel (group3). Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded at
      baseline then after 6 months. The gels were redelivered at the respective sites at this 6
      month appointment. Then again all clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded after 3
      months. (9 months from baseline)
