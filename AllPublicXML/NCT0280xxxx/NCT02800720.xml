      A Randomised Controlled Trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a Second-Generation
      Mindfulness-Based Intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) for treating
      fibromyalgia syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain disorder that frequently leads to
      poor quality of life. The need for more effective FMS treatments has prompted empirical
      investigations into the applications of mindfulness for treating the condition. However,
      studies have predominantly focused on first-generation mindfulness-based interventions
      (FG-MBIs). To date, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness of a
      second-generation mindfulness-based intervention (SG-MBI) for treating FMS has not been
      undertaken. SG-MBIs are distinct from FG-MBIs because they are overtly spiritual in nature
      and employ (i) a greater range of (normally secularised) meditative/spiritual techniques,
      (ii) ethics as a key component of the taught programme, and (iii) an instructor training
      programme that typically requires several years of supervised mindfulness practice.

      Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) - an SG-MBI - for
      treating FMS.

      Method: Adults with FMS will receive MAT or an active control intervention known as
      Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Groups. Assessments will be performed at pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, and follow-up phases.
