    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-continuous local anesthetic fascia iliaca
      blocks performed in the emergency department are effective for preoperative analgesia in hip
      fracture patients. Investigators hypothesize that patients with these blocks will have lower
      opioid requirements than patients in a historical group in whom blocks were not performed.
