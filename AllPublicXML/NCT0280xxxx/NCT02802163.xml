  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study for Phase l is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      panobinostat given in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in 28-day
      cycles as induction (initial) therapy to participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      In Phase ll, investigators will evaluate the safety (side effects) and efficacy
      (effectiveness) of panobinostat in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone.

    <description>Response rates by International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC). Complete Response (CR): Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt; 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. sCR: CR plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.</description>

    <description>Overall response rate will be the proportion of participants who achieved Stringent Complete Response (sCR), Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), or Partial Response (PR). Response rate determined by IMWG-URC will be calculated based on the number of participants with each of response categories (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, and progressive disease) at each treatment cycle.</description>

Participants will receive up to 8 cycles of the combination as induction after which will proceed with consolidation therapy with transplant as per institutional standards. After transplant, participants receive maintenance with panobinostat/lenalidomide. The maintenance dose and schedule of panobinostat will be same given during induction for 1 year. The maintenance dose of lenalidomide will be 10 mg given for 21 days of 28 days cycle until disease progression.</description>
