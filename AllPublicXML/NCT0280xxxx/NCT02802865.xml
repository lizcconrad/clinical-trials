  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of clomid to letrozole for the treatment of infertility in
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Half of the participants will receive letrozole and
      clomid in combination, while the other half will receive letrozole alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Letrozole and Clomid are both used for ovulation induction, but they have different
      mechanisms of action. Letrozole has been shown to be superior to clomid in achieving live
      birth rates in women with infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the combination
      of these medications has not been studied. This is a pilot study to evaluate if the
      combination treatment has improved efficacy as measured by ovulation rate.

      This is a randomized controlled trial of letrozole versus letrozole and clomiphene citrate
      (CC) for one menstrual cycle. Women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive letrozole
      2.5 mg or combination of letrozole 2.5 mg and clomiphene 50 mg for 5 days on days 3-7 of
      menstrual cycle. The women and their partners will be instructed to have regular intercourse
      with the intent to conceive during the cycle. Patients will have an transvaginal ultrasound
      mid cycle and to evaluate number of follicles (&gt;15 mm), follicle size, endometrial thickness
      and pattern. Patients will have mid- luteal phase progesterone level drawn to evaluate
      ovulation. Side effect profile will also be monitored.

             study

          2. Diagnosis of infertility: Inability of couple to achieve successful pregnancy after 12
             months of regular timed unprotected intercourse in women less than 35 years of age;

             years and older

          3. Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome based on Revised Rotterdam criteria

          4. Ability to have regular intercourse during the ovulation induction phase of the study

          5. Normal sperm concentration of 15 million/mL and with normal motility of &gt; 40%

             the previous year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current pregnancy
