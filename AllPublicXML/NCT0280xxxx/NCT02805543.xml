      Objective: The main target of this study was to research the early changes of retrobulbar and
      intrarenal hemodynamics, then to research the correlation between them in type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) patients without diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).

      Method: 35 T2DM patients (diabetes group) without vascular complications and 30 healthy
      people (control group) were recruited to research the early changes of renal function,
      retrobulbar and intrarenal hemodynamics, and then to research the correlation between them.
      The primary endpoints were the intrarenal hemodynamic (bilateral kidney RI) in bilateral
      interlobular renal arteries were evaluated using Doppler Sonographic; the secondary endpoints
      were the retrobulbar hemodynamics RI in the bilateral central retinal artery (CRA), posterior
      ciliary artery (PCA), and arteria ophthalmica (OA) were evaluated using color doppler imaging
      (CDI); the tertiary endpoints were the biochemical endpoints: blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C,
      and TG), FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and renal function parameters (BUN, Cr, and GFR); in addition, the
      albumin excrete rate (AER), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured.

        The investigators selected 45 T2DM patients (25 males, 20 females) without microangiopathy
        (DR and DKD) as diabetes group and 38 healthy people (21 males, 17 females) as control
        group from the diabetic outpatient clinic in Shenyang the Fourth Hospital of People, but
        only 34 patients (19 males, 15 females) in the diabetes group and 32 healthy people (17
        males, 15 females) can be researched in our study, all the participants were the Chinese
        Hans. All patients were provided a diet and exercise program by professional nutritionists.
