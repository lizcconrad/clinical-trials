  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Details regarding the degenerative spine disorders will be collected with a specific focus on
      the use of osteobiologics in treating degenerative conditions and their impact on fusion, as
      well as patient-reported outcomes for these conditions.

      The registry is designed to be open-ended. However, a statistical evaluation of the content
      und structure of database and CRFs in order to investigate the feasibility and quality of
      data collection is planned to take place prior to the registry expansion.

      Variables applicable to patients with a degenerative spine disorder which will be collected
      in the registry include:

        -  Patient details

        -  Symptoms

        -  Diagnosis

        -  Imaging assessment

        -  Treatment details

      Feasibility phase:

      The statistical evaluation of the feasibility and quality of data collection will be
      performed after the first 5 sites have each enrolled 12 patients with a degenerative
      pathology and documented one follow-up visit. During this evaluation, enrolment of further
      patients can be continued.

      Based on the findings of this feasibility phase, adjustments to the existing database can be
      performed before the registry is rolled out on larger scale.

      Registry expansion:

      Following the evaluation process of the feasibility phase, the registry will be expanded to
      allow data entry in more sites globally. Multi-site participation of this registry will be
      rolled-out in stages, and will be offered to sites with appropriate expertise which are
      selected based on their potential (interest, resources and expected patient volume).

    <measure>Use of Osteobiologics - Within the registry information on the use of osteobiologis (autografts, allografts, BMA/cells, BMP, DBM, matrices/carriers, platelets) are collected</measure>
    <time_frame>Every standard of care scheduled follow-up visit up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Osteobiologics are classified as autogenous bone graft substitutes, extenders, or enhancers. Types of osteobiologics include demineralized bone matrices (DBM), allografts and allograft formulations, synthetic bone grafts, bone morphogenic proteins, bone marrow aspirate systems, stem cells and platelet-rich plasma systems. The biologics are generally defined as being derived from or replicating natural substances. The osteobiologics are defined as such by possessing one or more of the following properties: osteoinductivity, osteoconductivity, and osteogenicity. Although biologics are classically defined as being derived from or replicating natural substances, a broader definition of an osteobiologic includes synthetic derivatives that may not replicate natural substances, but serve as a bone graft substitute, extender or enhancer.
There is not yet defined how the data will be analysed. Data collected can help drive hypotheses and might help to answer unforeseen questions over time.</description>
