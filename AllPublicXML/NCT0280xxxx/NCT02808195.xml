  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Kinect-based upper limb
      motor rehabilitation system (ULMTS) program on motor performance and functional outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study project will be:

      To compare the effectiveness of intervention groups using Kinect-based ULMTS with
      constraint-induced therapy on motor improvement in children with hemiplegic CP. The
      investigators hypothesize that motor improvement in using Kinect-based ULMTS will be
      comparable to constraint-induced therapy.
