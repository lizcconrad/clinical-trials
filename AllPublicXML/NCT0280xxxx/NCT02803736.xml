    <textblock>
      This multicenter placebo-controlled trial focuses on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture
      on breast-cancer related lymphedema. 200 participants will be recruited, and randomized in
      two groups: the real acupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema (BCRL)
      is classified as &quot;edema&quot;, and is considered to be caused by qi (chi) deficiency and blood
      stagnation. Acupuncture, as an ancient therapy in TCM, is thought to have the efficacy to
      stimulate the transformation of qi and drainage of dampness, and is widely used for various
      diseases including edema in China. Early clinical trials as well as our own clinical
      observation have demonstrated that acupuncture can ameliorate limb swelling and decrease
      lymphedema. However, no randomized placebo-controlled trial has been performed to evaluate
      this efficacy of acupuncture. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the safety and
      potential efficacy of acupuncture to treat chronic upper-limb lymphedema.

    <description>Data of the absolute limb volume will be collected before the treatment (volume at baseline, B) and after the treatment (volume after therapy, A) for every participant. VL is the volume of the affected arm with lymphedema, and VC is the volume of the contralateral arm. Then, The ARLVR will be calculated using the following formula: ARLVR (%) = (VL−Vc)B−( VL−Vc)A/( VL−Vc)B ×100%.
The arm measurement will be conducted using perometer. This method is inspired by the method established by Anderson et al.</description>

    <description>Patients in the real acupuncture group will receive true acupuncture 3 times a week for 4 weeks (12 sessions). A standardized prescription of six acupuncture points is used unilaterally. Needles are inserted and manipulated manually until needling sensation (de qi) is obtained, and are retained for 20 minutes with manual manipulation at 10 minutes. Acupuncturists are trained to inquire about specific needle sensations when providing true acupuncture.</description>

    <description>Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through skin at strategic points on human body. Many Western practitioners view the acupuncture as a device to stimulate nerves, muscles and connective tissue, and believe that it can increases blood flow.</description>
