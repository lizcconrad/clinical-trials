      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of prophylactic anticoagulation Bemiparina (HIBOR®)
      for the prevention of peripheral and portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients with
      prolonged hospitalization.

      Secondary objectives are the following:

        1. To evaluate the incidence of thrombotic events in hospitalized cirrhotic patients.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (HIBOR 3.500UI) in preventing
           thrombotic events in hospitalized cirrhotic patients.

        3. To identify risk factors for development of portal vein thrombosis and deep vein
           thrombosis in hospitalized patients.

        4. Evaluate the morbidity and mortality associated with thromboembolic events.

        5. Evaluate prophylactic anticoagulation levels by determining antiXa and antithrombin III.

        6. To study the expression profile and functionality of Toll-like receptors as factors
           intimately involved in the inflammatory response, as well as the variability of
           different serum markers associated with proinflammatory state: I-FABP / IL6-IL8 / NO,
           endothelin and LPS-binding protein.

        7. Evaluate the effect on liver fibrosis (by Fibroscan®) and serum TGF

        8. Evolution of hepatocellular function estimated by the scores of Child-Pugh and MELD.
