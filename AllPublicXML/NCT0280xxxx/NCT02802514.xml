  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug effects will be studied after a single dose of 50 milligram (mg) albiglutide and a
      single dose of 10 microgram exenatide, to gain insight into the central mechanisms of nausea
      associated with Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. This study will explore
      the potential differences at the expected time of maximum concentration (Cmax) between a
      long-acting (albiglutide) and short-acting (exenatide) GLP-1R agonist in brain activation of
      healthy volunteers assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a phase IV, 2-part,
      2-period crossover (session), single dose, randomized, single blind (blinded to both the
      subject and the imaging evaluators analysing the MRI data), placebo- and active-controlled
      study in adult healthy volunteers who are susceptible to motion sickness. Part A and Part B
      are the same in design, both consisting of a screening stage, a dosing/assessment stage, and
      a follow-up visit. Data from Part A will inform progression, methods, and analysis plan for
      Part B. Each sequence includes three scanning visits: albiglutide plus scan, exenatide plus
      scan and an off-therapy -natural history scan with a 6-9 week washout period between the
      dosing scans. A total of 24 to 28 subjects will be randomized in the study (Part A and Part
      B). The cross over design is divided into 2 sessions and schedule is as follow, on Day 1
      (either Session 1 (S1) or Session 2 (S2) per, if randomized) subject will under go an
      off-therapy MRI scan, on Day 5 subject will receive a single dose of 50 mg albiglutide or
      albiglutide placebo, and Day 8 subject will receive a single dose of 10 microgram exenatide
      or saline placebo followed by a post-dose MRI scan. At each session subject will receive only
      one active drug (albiglutide or exenatide).
