  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a controlled release formulation of
      mazindol is more effective than a placebo in the treatment of Attention Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) in adults.

    <textblock>
      This study is an outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which
      adult subjects with ADHD will be randomized to either oral mazindol controlled release or
      placebo once daily. Subjects will be treated with study medication or placebo for 6 weeks
      with visits occurring weekly to measure efficacy and any adverse events with adjustment of
      medication dosing as necessary.

             examination, medical history, or clinical laboratory results during screening that, in
