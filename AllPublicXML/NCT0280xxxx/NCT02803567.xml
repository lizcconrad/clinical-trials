  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to develop a tailored screening, brief intervention and
      referral to treatment (SBIRT) model for youth with chronic medical conditions (YCMC) for
      delivery at point of care during a routine healthcare visit, through conducting a rigorous
      randomized control trial among adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes (TID) or
      rheumatologic conditions. The secondary goal is to assess the attitudes and knowledge of
      parents of these same adolescents, to explore links between parent beliefs and adolescent
      behavior around substance use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of an SBIRT model
      tailored to youth with chronic medical conditions. This trial is being built into a larger,
      longitudinal cohort study to assess whether a set of brief, substance specific questions can
      accurately predict adolescent substance use outcomes when compared to more lengthy, criterion
      standard assessment questions, in cross-sectional and prospective analysis. The first
      component of the project will consist of pre-testing an assessment battery and brief
      electronic intervention with a small sample of 14-17 year old youth. In the second component
      the investigators will randomize consented eligible participants into intervention or control
      arms of the study and administer the 1) Baseline Assessment Battery and the 2) Brief
      Intervention OR Treatment as Usual (TAU). In the third component the investigators will
      follow up with all participants at 6 and then 12 months after study entry to reassess rates
      of substance use through follow up assessment batteries.

      At baseline, the investigators will also attempt to enroll parents of all participants who
      are present at the time of enrollment. The investigators will separately consent and
      administer a brief assessment battery to parents to assess their knowledge and attitudes
      around substance use, as well as opinions and attitudes regarding other health and risk
      behaviors.
