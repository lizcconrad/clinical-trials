  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, single-blind, multiple dose study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of orally administered ATR-101 in subjects with classic congenital adrenal
      hyperplasia (CAH). Treatment duration will range from a minimum of approximately 2 months to
      6 months per subject. A subject may receive a minimum of one dose level or up to a maximum of
      5 dose levels, in sequentially increasing dose strengths. Each dose level will last 28 days.
