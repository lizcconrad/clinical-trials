  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is the confirmation of the efficacy of AM-111 in the
      recovery of severe to profound idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multi-center, efficacy and safety trial of AM-111 in the treatment of subjects suffering from
      severe to profound idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

      The active pharmaceutical ingredient of AM-111 is a JNK inhibitor (D-JNKI-1), a synthetic
      peptide consisting of 31 D-amino acids, which acts as a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ligand.

      The study consists of one treatment visit and a follow-up period until day 91.

      Study participants will receive, after topical anesthesia of the tympanic membrane, AM-111
      0.4 mg/mL or 0.8 mg/mL or placebo, administered into the affected ear. Following the
      administration, subjects will rest in a supine or reclined position for 30 minutes. Study
      participants will have the option for a course of oral corticosteroids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) with onset within 72
             hours prior to study treatment;

          2. Mean hearing threshold of equal to or worse than (≥) 60 dB averaged across those 3
             contiguous air conduction audiometric pure tone frequencies that show the highest mean
             hearing loss compared with the unaffected contralateral ear or, in case of history of
             asymmetric hearing, corresponding values from a pre-existing audiogram for the
             affected ear not older than 2 years prior to the ISSNHL incident (defined as &quot;pure
             tone average&quot;, PTA);

          3. Mean hearing loss of equal to or worse than (≥) 40 dB averaged across the air
             conduction thresholds at the pure tone average frequencies compared with the
             unaffected contralateral ear or, in case of history of asymmetric hearing,
             corresponding values from a preexisting audiogram for the affected ear not older than
             2 years prior to the ISSNHL incident;

             hydrops or Menière's disease in either ear;

          7. History of otosclerosis in the affected ear;

          8. Suspected perilymph fistula or membrane rupture in the affected ear;

          9. Congenital hearing loss;
