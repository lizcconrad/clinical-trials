      This is a confirmatory open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Recruited
      subjects are to be randomized to treatment group and controlled group, with ratio of 1:1.
      Treatment group will accept baseline BEACOPP regimen, while controlled group will accept ABVD
      regimen.

      The study design consisted of a screening phase of 1 week, a treatment phase of 24 or 32
      weeks, and a post treatment follow-up of at least 2 years.
