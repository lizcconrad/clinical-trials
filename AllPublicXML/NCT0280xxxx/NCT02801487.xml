  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) along with concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of
      locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment
      at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens along with
      concurrent chemotherapy (40 mg/m^2, weekly) to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in
      terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 4 months after the completion
      of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the
      MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the
      Phase II part of the trial.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) along with concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of
      locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment
      at the MTD in the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be treated with
      CIRT with escalating dose starting from 52.5GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) to potentially
      62.5GyE (2.5GyE/daily fraction) along with concurrent chemotherapy (40 mg/m^2, weekly) to
      evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed
      during and within 4 months after the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
      Time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) is used for the phase I dose
      escalating part of the trial and approximately 25 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD in
      the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD
      will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the
      Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II part of the trial will be a single phase single arm
      study.

    <description>Five dose levels (52.5GyE, 55GyE, 57.5GyE, 60GyE, 62.5GyE) are planned within the Phase I part. Daily fraction of 2.5 GyE will be delivered for all dose levels. After the recommended dose (RD), i.e., MTD, is determined or if the treatments to 62.5 GyE are safely delivered, the recommended dose (or 62.5 GyE) will be the prescribed dose in the Phase II part of the study. Ninety-five percent (95%) of the isodose line should cover the GTV+3~5mm. Cisplatin (40mg/m^2) monotherapy will be given weekly along with radiotherapy.</description>
