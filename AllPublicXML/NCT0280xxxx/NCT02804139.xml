      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a physical therapy program which includes
      scar management, core retraining, and lumbar and pelvic joint mobilization will significantly
      impact the postpartum recovery following Cesarean section during the immediate postpartum
      period and during the first 1.5 years following childbirth.

      All patients who enroll in the study will receive standard treatment following a C-section
      delivery. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups; one group will receive physical
      therapy in addition to standard post C-section treatment, and the other group will receive
      standard post C-section treatment with no additional physical therapy. Both groups will
      complete questionnaires regarding their pain and recovery from C-section delivery to
      determine if there is a difference in recovery between the group receiving physical therapy
      and the group not receiving physical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section (C-section) represents the most commonly performed inpatient surgical
      procedure, with recent prevalence estimates of 1.3 million annually (approximately 22% of
      first births) in the United States. Currently, postoperative recovery support is typically
      characterized by verbal and written instructions regarding lifting and pelvic rest as well as
      slow return to activity and exercise.

      There are multiple known complications during and after the postpartum period following
      Cesarean section deliveries. Some of the most common are back pain (up to 53% prevalence
      reported), bowel and bladder issues (20-30% prevalence reported), and scar tissue/adhesions.
      Multiple studies have indicated a higher incidence of low back and pelvic girdle pain in
      patients following Cesarean section compared to an unassisted vaginal delivery (estimates
      range from 2-5 times increase).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a physical therapy program which includes
      scar management, core retraining, and lumbar and pelvic joint mobilization will significantly
      impact the postpartum recovery following Cesarean section during the immediate postpartum
      period and during the first 1.5 years following childbirth.
