  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the therapeutic value of: (i) simultaneous endoscopic visualization of
      the inner bladder using white light and blue light excitations and (ii) high resolution
      panoramic images of the bladder inner wall.

      All participants will undergo fluorescence cystoscopy: the first half using first a reference
      medical device for fluorescence cystoscopy already on the market then using the innovative
      device specifically developped for the CyPaM2 project.

      The other half will undergo fluorescence cystoscopy using first the innovative then the
      reference medical device.

    <textblock>
      An innovative medical device was developped by the CyPaM2 project's partners.This device is
      made of a hardware and of a software part: (i) an imager (light source and sensors) for
      simultaneous and colocalized visualisation of the bladder using white light and blue light
      for fluorescence excitation and (ii) a mosaicing software for automatic building of
      high-resolution panoramic images of the bladder inner wall. The medical device's qualitative
      (human engineering, images qualitty) and quantitative (medical examination and panoramic
      images building durations) specifications will be evaluated during the clinical trial in
      comparison with a reference medical device already on the market. The main goals are to
      achieve (i) better sensitivity of bladder cancers' cystocopic diagnosis and shorter medical
      examination durations thanks to the simultaneous visualization of the bladder inner wall with
      white and blue lights and (ii) better patients' follow up thanks to the high resolved
      panoramic images.

    <description>Patients with a suspicion of a bladder cancer or suspected recurrence of bladder cancer will have a cystoscopy under their care.
Patients will be randomized to know the order of carrying out cystoscopy with one or the other medical devices.
24 hours and 48 hours after the exam, a nurse will contact the patient to detect potential adverse effects</description>
