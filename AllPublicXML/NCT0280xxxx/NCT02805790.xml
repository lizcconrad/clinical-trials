  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study which will
      enroll up to 36 subjects (anticipated) with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease who
      have completed participation in the SPIMM-201 (MMPOWER) study. Subjects will be randomized
      (1:1) to one of two sequence groups: 4-weeks of treatment with 40 mg elamipretide
      administered once daily subcutaneously in Treatment Period 1 followed by 4-weeks of treatment
      with placebo administered once daily subcutaneously in Treatment Period 2 (separated by
      4-week washout period), or vice versa

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject completed participation in the SPIMM-201 study without a significant protocol
             deviation that would suggest the subject may not be able to complete all study
             requirements in the opinion of the Sponsor

          -  Subject must reside in North America for the duration of the study

          -  Subject has not received study drug in the SPIMM-201 study within 3 weeks prior to
             Screening

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 of the methods of birth control
             specified in the protocol from the date they sign the ICF until two months after the
             last dose of study drug

          -  Subject has been on stable (unchanged and constant) medications (including over-the
             counter treatments, vitamins, or supplements) for at least 1 month prior to the
             Baseline Visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any prior or current medical condition that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing
             all study requirements (i.e. unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction)

          -  Subject has received any investigational compound and/or has participated in another
             interventional clinical study within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit or is
             concurrently enrolled in any non-interventional research of any type judged to be
             scientifically or medically incompatible with the study as deemed by the Investigator
             in consultation with the Sponsor

          -  Subject experienced an adverse reaction to study drug in the SPIMM-201 study that
             contraindicates further treatment with elamipretide in the opinion of the Investigator
             and/or Sponsor

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating

          -  Subject has undergone an in-patient hospitalization within the 1 month prior to the
             Screening Visit or is likely to need in-patient hospitalization or a surgical
             procedure during the course of the study

          -  Subject has a creatinine clearance â‰¤30 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft Gault
             equation

          -  Subject has QTc elongation defined as a QTc &gt;450 msec in male subjects and &gt;480msec in
             female subjects. Note: At the initial electrocardiogram (ECG), if QTc exceeds these
             parameters, the ECG may be repeated 2 more times, and the average of the 3 QTc values
             used to determine the subjects eligibility

          -  Subject has uncontrolled hypertension in the judgment of the Investigator (e.g.
             elevated above &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;100 mmHg diastolic despite appropriate treatment
             on two consecutive readings)

          -  Subject has a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity or allergy to any of
             the excipients contained in the study drug

          -  Subject has a history of active alcoholism or drug addiction during the year before
             the Screening Visit
