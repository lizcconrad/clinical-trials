    <textblock>
      At present, the literature does not account for much of scientific data on the assessment of
      osteopathic intervention for patients with (Fibromyalgia) FM. The investigators propose a
      pilot study evaluating the efficacy of osteopathic care, consists of several osteopathic
      interventions in the treatment of FM, in order to improve the painful experiences of FM
      patients. This study must include 44 patients with FM according to (American College of
      Rheumatology) ACR criteria and followed the University Hospital of Caen.

      The osteopathic care will last eight months and will be followed by a report three months
      after the end of osteopathic interventions. This in order to evaluate the effect in the short
      term and long term, of osteopathic care in patients with FM.
