    <textblock>
      A Phase 2 study to investigate the antitumor activity in terms of overall response rate (ORR)
      of tipifarnib in approximately 20 eligible subjects with CMML. Subjects will receive
      tipifarnib administered orally, twice a day (bid) for 7 days in alternating weeks (Days 1-7
      and 15-21) in 28 day cycles. In the absence of unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue
      to receive tipifarnib treatment until disease progression. If a complete response is
      observed, therapy with tipifarnib will be maintained for at least 6 months beyond the start
      of response.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in
      approximately 20 eligible subjects with CMML. This trial is planned as a single treatment
      trial with statistical comparison to historical ORR rate. The primary objective is to provide
      evidence that the TRUE underlying ORR in all subjects and/or in the KRAS/NRAS wild-type
      subgroup exceeds the historical rate. Only consented subjects who meet all eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled in the study. Eligible subjects will receive tipifarnib
      administered at a starting dose of 1200 mg or 900 mg, orally with food, bid for 7 days in
      alternating weeks (Days 1-7 and 15-21) in 28 day cycles. Stepwise 300 mg dose reductions to
      control treatment-related, treatment-emergent toxicities are allowed.

      If a complete response is observed, therapy with tipifarnib will be maintained for at least 6
      months beyond the start of response. In the absence of unmanageable toxicities, subjects may
      continue to receive tipifarnib treatment until disease progression. Provisions will be made
      for the continuation of study treatment in subjects whose disease has not progressed beyond
      the end of the study, e.g. a single patient treatment protocol.

      Determination of disease response will be performed by the Investigator according to the
      MDS/MPN IWG criteria. Similarly, disease progression will also be determined based on the
      MDS/MPN IWG criteria. Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed approximately
      every 12 weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months
      after accrual of the study cohort has been completed, whichever occurs first. Information on
      survival and subsequent anticancer therapy may be collected by phone.
