      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for phototoxicity of the
      sun care products SPF 50 Y65 110, SPF 50 Y51 002, and SPF 15 V27 104 compared to that of a
      negative control (0.9% sodium chloride [NaCl]) after a single 24 h application of test
      materials followed by irradiation with ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB).

      The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of the sun care products SPF
      50 Y65 110, SPF 50 Y51 002, and SPF 15 V27 104 combined with UVA/B irradiation by monitoring
      adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.
