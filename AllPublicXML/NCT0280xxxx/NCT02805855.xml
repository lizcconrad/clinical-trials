      The study seeks to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stromal cells to treat symptoms of mild to severe knee osteoarthritis.

    <textblock>
      Interventions to alter the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee are elusive and
      joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The
      Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal
      stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far,
      the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators'
      pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the
      investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat
      patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate
      the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded
      AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic
      mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ages 40-70 years

               -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
                  receiving the study drug and will agree use adequate contraception (hormonal or
                  barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year
                  following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing
                  potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or
                  post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed
                  prior to the administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the
                  urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the
                  result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be
                  performed at a central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be
                  performed by qualified personnel using kit

               -  Females becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the
                  duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer.
                  Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with
                  pregnancy will be recorded. Females in the multiple-dose cohorts (M50 and M100)
                  who become pregnant during the treatment cycle will not receive their remaining
                  injections.
