  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a robot-aided rehabilitation protocol that
      follows the &quot;assist-as needed&quot; paradigm provide statistically significant improvements in arm
      and hand motor functions when compared to robot-aided protocols that passively move patients'
      arms along pre-defined trajectories, in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).

    <description>Subjects in this group will interact with a robotic exoskeleton, the MAHI Exo-II, programmed with an &quot;adaptive mode&quot;. In this mode, the robot will continuously assist motion along pre-defined trajectories, but will employ an &quot;assist-as-needed&quot; protocol.
Here, the amount of assistance provided by the robot will not be always the 100% of that required to complete the task (as in the position control mode), but only a fraction of it. The robot will continuously estimate the residual movement capabilities of the subject, depending on the specific joint addressed in the movement, and will estimate the remaining contribution needed to complete the movement following a predefined trajectory, thus avoiding to over-support motion.</description>

    <description>Subjects in group B will interact with a robotic exoskeleton, the MAHI Exo-II, controlled via the subject-triggered mode, as in a previous clinical trial with the MAHI Exo II robotic system. In the subject triggered mode, the MAHIExo II is commanded to regulate joints motion following a position-control control scheme, and using as desired trajectories standardized single-joints profiles that require motion of one of the axes of the exoskeleton (i.e. elbow flexion and extension, forearm pronation and supination, wrist radial and ulnar deviation, wrist flexion and extension). The switch to position control of the exoskeleton is triggered by the application of sufficient force by the subject, in a previous phase where the robot implements a virtual wall.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Twenty adults with chronic incomplete SCI (according to American Spinal Injury Association
        (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) C-D level) will be recruited from TIRR and from the Houston
        area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Providing written informed consent prior to any study related procedures;

          2. Age between 18-75 years;

          3. Diagnosis of chronic complete or incomplete spinal cord injury as defined by the
             American Spinal Injury Association Impairment scale classification and at least for 6
             months;

          4. Not being involved in any specific exercise program (e.g., NMES, FES) within the
             previous 3 months;

          5. No planned alteration in upper-extremity therapy or medication for muscle tone during
             the course of the study;

          6. Eligibility for standard rehabilitation at the time of enrollment (i.e., absence
             medical comorbidities that would prevent standard rehabilitation);

          7. No condition (e.g., severe arthritis, extreme shoulder pain) that would interfere with
             valid administration of the measures or with interpreting motor testing;

        Exclusion Criteria: Subjects will be excluded if they have:

          1. Any joint contracture or severe spasticity in the affected upper extremity, as
             measured by a Modified Ashworth Score &gt; than 3 out of 4;

          2. Subject who cannot provide self-transportation to the study location.
