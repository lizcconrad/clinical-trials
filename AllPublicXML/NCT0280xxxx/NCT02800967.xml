  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The existing scientific evidence from both in vitro and clinical trials supports the notion
      that polyphenols can modulate platelet function. Beyond being central players in haemostasis
      and thrombosis, platelets have crucial roles in the development of atherosclerosis, mediated
      through their interactions with monocytes and endothelial cells. Disturbed platelet function
      correlates with other risk factors, including hypertension and obesity, and the progression
      of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), postulating platelets as rational targets in CVD
      prevention. Thus, the effects of polyphenols on disturbed platelet function would contribute
      to their pleiotropic beneficial effects of on cardiovascular health. Aronia juice is a rich
      source of polyphenols including anthocyanins, procyanidins, phenolic acids and flavonols.
      However, there is no clinical evidence on the effects of aronia juice consumption on platelet
      function and related CVD factors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of
      Aronia juice polyphenols on platelet function and other CVD risk factors in subjects with
      moderate CVD risk.

      To investigate the effect of Aronia (Aronia melanocarpa L.) juice polyphenols on platelet
      function and other CVD risk factors a three-arm, crossover design, randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial will be performed in apparently healthy subjects at
      moderate CVD risk.

      Recruited participants will be randomly assigned to one of three interventions (pure Aronia
      juice, Aronia beverage or placebo beverage) in the first phase and followed by cross-over in
      second and third phase. Two-week run-in period with low intake of polyphenols will precede
      the start of the intervention, ie. the first intervention phase. During each of three
      intervention periods (phases) subjects will consume 100 ml of each intervention product daily
      for 28 days, with 28 days of wash out period between different phases.

      Blood and urine samples will be taken at baseline, before and after 28 days after each
      intervention period. Platelet analyses by flow cytometry, biochemical analyses of plasma
      samples, full blood count, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements will be performed
      at each study visit.

      During the first study visit, regardless the allocation, blood samples will be taken before
      and 2h after the consumption of first 100 ml of intervention product (performed at the
      experimental site) and the analysis of markers of platelet function, biochemical parameters
      (glucose, triglycerides, and uric acid) and blood pressure will be assessed.

      Subjects will be instructed to avoid rich-sources of anthocyanins and procyanidins during the
      whole study. Dietary habits will be assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) performed
      2 times at the beginning and at the end of the study and 24h-recall performed at the
      beginning and after each wash out period.
