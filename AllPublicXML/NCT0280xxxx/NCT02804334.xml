  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to study ~45 molecules in blood cells that may differentiate
      patients with bipolar disorder from healthy controls.

      There is one study visit for this research protocol. Participants may complete this visit on
      the day that they sign consent. If there is an upcoming blood draw already scheduled for the
      participant, within the clinical research trial in which they are enrolled, they may decide
      to wait until then to receive their blood draw. In addition, if a subject has completed the
      protocol specific monitoring labs within the past 30 days, either for clinical or research
      purposes, they do not have to be repeated.

      After obtaining the informed consent, all potential research participants will be assessed
      with a systemic clinical interview and a structured interview with the Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Psychiatric assessments will be administered to all
      participants, both healthy controls and participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD).
      All eligible participants will also complete a Clinical Record Form. The form includes
      demographics, previous treatment history, the number of previous episodes, family history,
      and other historical correlates.
