  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy,
      either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the
      low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12
      months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately
      7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a
      significant unmet clinical need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression of EFGR
      (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), which is associated with poor prognosis. Several methods
      of inhibiting this receptor have been tested, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with recurring
      GBM, intracranial superselective intra-arterial infusion of Cetuximab (CTX), at a dose of
      250mg/m2 in conjunction with hypofractionated radiation, will be safe and efficacious and
      prevent tumor progression in patients with recurrent, residual GBM.
