    <textblock>
      Through comparative observation of robot vagus nerve preserving distal gastric cancer radical
      surgery and conventional robot distal gastric cancer radical surgery (not reserved vagus
      nerve) operative and postoperative indicators, and evaluating the feasibility and safety of
      vagus nerve preserving distal gastric cancer radical surgery in advanced gastric cancer.
