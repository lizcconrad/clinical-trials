  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The shock wave is a new and potential intervention for the reinnervation of peripheral nerve.
      The purpose of this study was to assess the dose effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy
      on carpal tunnel syndrome.

    <textblock>
      The investigator perform a prospective randomized, single-blinded study to investigate the
      dose effect of ESWT in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

      The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24 week
      after the treatment.
