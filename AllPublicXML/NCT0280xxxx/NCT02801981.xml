  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics following single dose of 10 milligrams (mg) to 180 mg of GSK2330672 in
      Japanese healthy subjects. This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      dose-escalating and incomplete block crossover study to be conducted in 16 Japanese healthy
      subjects. Study will be conducted in four periods; subjects will receive either placebo or
      GSK2330672 (10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg or 180 mg based on randomization) in each treatment period.
      Each period will be separated by washout period (at least 6 days from dosing). Total duration
      of study for each subject will be approximately 5 weeks from the first dosing to follow up
      visit.
