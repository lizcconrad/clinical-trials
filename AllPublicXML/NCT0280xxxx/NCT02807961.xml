  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in humans of ELX-02, an advanced synthetic aminoglycoside optimized
      as a translational read-through drug (TRID) for the treatment of genetic conditions caused by
      nonsense. mutations. This is a classical Phase 1a study designed as a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ELX-02 in healthy adult volunteers.

             pregnancy test at Screening.

             All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered
             to be of childbearing potential and may be enrolled if they have negative pregnancy
             tests on Screening and admission days and agree to use a reliable method of
             contraception for two weeks (14 days) before and four weeks (28 days) after dosing.

             Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to undergo repeated pregnancy
             tests.

             Reliable methods of contraception include: Abstention from sexual intercourse,
             Established use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal methods
             of contraception (provided the subject plans to remain on the same treatment
             throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an
             adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness), Copper-containing intrauterine
             device

          5. Male subjects must be willing to use an effective method of contraception during the
             course of the study until 28 days after drug administration. These include condom,
             having undergone a vasectomy or abstain from sexual intercourse.

          6. Be on no medications with potential to impair renal function, e.g., NSAIDs, or with
             ototoxic potential, e.g., quinine or salicylates.

          7. Non-smoking and no use of any tobacco or nicotine products (by declaration) for a
             period of at least 6 months prior to Screening visit.

          9. Negative HIV, HBsAg or HCV Ab serology tests at Screening.

         10. No personal history of hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, imbalance and unsteadiness.

         11. Normal Screening auditory and vestibular assessments.

         12. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19.0 to 30.0 Kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics/conditions will not be included in the
        study:

          1. Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             Investigator, or subjects who are the Sponsor employees directly involved in the
             conduct of the study.

          2. Participation in another clinical trial within 6 months prior to dosing (calculated
             from the previous study's last doing day). If the previous trial involved agents with
             delayed effects or prolonged metabolism, a 12 months interval is required.

          3. Evidence or history of clinically relevant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic
             disease (including drug allergies,). This includes any acute or chronic medical or
             psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated
             with study participation or ELX-02 administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make
             the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

          4. A positive urine drug screen (cannabinoids, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and
             opiates), at Screening and on admission.

             females or 14 drinks/week for males (1 drink = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45
             mL of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening. A positive alcohol breath test on
             admission.

          6. Screening supine blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥ 90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP exceeds protocol-required limits,
             BP measurement should be repeated for up to two more times and the last BP value
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          7. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec for men or &gt;470 msec for
             women, or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec.

          8. Subjects with ANY abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at Screening, considered
             by the Investigator as clinically relevant. In particular, subjects with ALT, AST and
             total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 upper limit of normal will be excluded.

          9. Pregnant or breastfeeding female subjects.

         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins, herbal and/or dietary
             supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to
             administration of ELX-02. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at
             doses of ≤ 2 g/day. Aspirin and NSAIDS should not be administered within 1 week of
             study dose. Limited use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to
             affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a
             case-by-case basis following approval by the Sponsor.

         11. Subjects who donated blood or received blood or plasma derivatives in the 3 months
             preceding study drug administration.

         12. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any drug and/or to any of the excipients of
             ELX-02.
