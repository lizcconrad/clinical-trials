  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated the 24-hour efficacy and ocular surface health with preservative-free
      tafluprost and a combined preservative-free regimen (tafluprost and dorzolamide/timolol fixed
      combination) in open-angle glaucoma patients insufficiently controlled on latanoprost
      monotherapy and showing signs, or symptoms of ocular surface disease with
      preservative-containing latanoprost monotherapy. This trial randomized open-angle glaucoma
      patients insufficiently controlled (IOP &gt; 20 mm Hg) on branded, or generic latanoprost
      monotherapy who required further IOP reduction and who demonstrated clinical signs, or
      symptoms of ocular surface disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          -  Open-angle glaucoma patients (primary open-angle glaucoma, exfoliative, or pigmentary
             glaucoma) insufficiently controlled on branded, or generic latanoprost monotherapy
             (IOP &gt; 20 mm Hg as determined by 2 separate IOP measurements at 10:00 ± 1 hour)

          -  Patients with signs, or symptoms of ocular surface disease.

          -  Only those open-angle glaucoma subjects who, according to the opinion of the principal
             investigator, require further IOP reduction.

          -  Patients must have demonstrated at least 20% IOP reduction at 10:00 (± 1 hour) and who
             are treated with branded, or generic latanoprost monotherapy for at least 3 months.

          -  Only subjects with open-angle glaucoma that have exhibited (prior to latanoprost
             therapy) untreated, sitting IOP evaluated with Goldmann tonometry between 25-39 mm Hg
             at 10:00 (± 1 hour).

          -  Age between 21-85 years

          -  Mild to moderate glaucomatous disc damage and visual field loss (less than -12 dB mean
             deviation visual field loss attributed to glaucoma

          -  Those with 0.8 or better vertical cup-to-disc ratio and visual acuity greater than 0.1
             in the study eye.

          -  Open anterior chamber angles.

          -  Those who have to demonstrate a reliable visual field (at least two visual fields with
             less than 20% fixation losses, false positives, or negatives)

          -  Patients who understand study instructions, are willing to attend all follow-up
             appointments and will comply with study medication usage.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients with a history of less than 10% IOP decrease on any IOP-lowering medication.

          -  Those with evidence of concurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, or uveitis in either eye.

          -  Subjects with a history of inadequate adherence; intolerance, or contraindication to
             either prostaglandins, β-blockers, dorzolamide, or benzalconium chloride (BAK)

          -  Patients with severe ocular surface disease, previous intraocular conventional or
             laser surgery in the study eye (within 6 months prior to enrolment); previous history
             of ocular trauma; use of corticosteroids (within 3 months before the enrolment) and
             use of contact lenses.

          -  Those that on baseline examination show clinical evidence of inflammation, signs of
             ocular infection (except blepharitis), signs of any corneal abnormality that will
             affect subsequent IOP measurements

          -  Subjects that show unwillingness to participate in the trial.

          -  Females of childbearing potential or lactating mothers.
