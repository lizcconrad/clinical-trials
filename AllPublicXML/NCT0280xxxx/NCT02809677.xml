  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a one-year, repeated measures, within-subject design to examine the
      impact of improved caregiver depression on child asthma outcomes. A cross-lagged panel
      modeling (CLPM) for longitudinal data will be fit using a maximum likelihood structural
      equation model (SEM) in order to explore longitudinal mediation between asthma outcomes
      (asthma control, spirometry, quality of life (QOL)) and depressive symptoms. CLPM will test
      whether caregiver improvement preceded child asthma improvement, and SEM will test whether
      improved adherence and/or decreased child anxiety/depression mediated the effect. The
      investigators considered a randomized control trial, but it would not be ethically acceptable
      to withhold medication from caregivers diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) for the
      proposed one-year duration of the study. It is unlikely that potential participants in the
      study would find this acceptable. Furthermore a controlled design is not necessary since the
      investigators are not testing the efficacy of antidepressants for depression, but rather the
      impact of improvement on caregiver depression on the child.

      Caregiver will be consented for his/her and the child's participation. The child will assent
      to participate before study procedures begin. The proposed study will last 52 weeks and
      consist of study visits every 4 weeks (14 visits total).

      Screening (roughly 5 mins):

      2 item Self-Report Screening Tool for Depression (2-SRSD) This tool will be used to help
      screen caregivers for the study.

      This screening will only be performed in the clinic. Additional screening will be performed
      at the Baseline visit including:

        -  Obtaining demographic information

        -  Physical exam,

        -  Medical and psychiatric history

        -  Physical health assessments

        -  Urine Pregnancy Test for women of childbearing potential

        -  Mood assessments

      The baseline visit is described below:

      Baseline (approx 3 hrs):

      The following assessments will be given to the Caregiver only:

        1. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM V (SCID)

        2. Urine Pregnancy Test (UPT) for women of child bearing potential

        3. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)

        4. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (QIDS-SR)

        5. State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)

        6. Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQOL)

        7. Psychobiology of Recovery in Depression III Somatic Symptom Scale (PRD-III)

      The following assessments will be given to the child:

        1. Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI)

        2. Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)

        3. Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED)

        4. Pediatric Asthma Quality of life Questionnaire (PAQOL)

        5. Asthma Control Test/Childhood Asthma Control Test (ACT/cACT) (which version is given
           will be determined by the child's age)

        6. Spirometry measurement

        7. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)

        8. Relatedness Scale

      The following assessments will be given to both the caregiver AND the child:

      1. Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study Medication Adherence Interview
      (CAMPCS)

      Weeks 4-48 (visits every 4 weeks, each approx 2 hours):

      Caregiver only:

      CAMPCS

      Week 52 (approx 2.5 hrs):

      Caregiver only:

      HRSD, QIDS-SR, STAI, PACQOL, PRD-III, UPT

      Child only:

      CASI, CDI, SCARED, PAQOL, ACT/cACT, Spirometry, PSS, Relatedness Scale

      Both caregiver AND child:

      CAMPCS, Debriefing interview

      Electrocardiograms (ECG) and blood tests may be collected during this study as is clinically
      indicated.

    <description>This is a 52 week non-placebo controlled and non-randomized clinical research study to see whether treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in caregivers of children with asthma will improve asthma outcomes in children. Caregivers may choose to receive an antidepressant medication that is considered standard medical care for MDD, or may opt out of antidepressant treatment. No treatment is withheld from participants and no placebos are used, thus there is no active intervention in this study.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Caregiver: Severe cognitive impairment that could impair their ability to provide
             informed consent; member of a vulnerable population (incarcerated, pregnant or
             breastfeeding women); women of childbearing age who will not use acceptable methods of
             birth control or abstinence during the study; severe psychiatric disorder in addition
             to MDD that should be a primary focus of treatment (e.g. severe and disabling eating
             or anxiety disorders); treatment refractory depression defined as failing ≥ 3 adequate
             trials of antidepressants (≥ 4 weeks at a therapeutic dose); electroconvulsive therapy
             or repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation during the current episode; depression
             as part of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, or current
             depression secondary to substances or general medical condition, or with psychotic
             features or accompanied by severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or high risk
             for suicide defined by multiple recent suicide attempts (&gt; 2 in the past year) or any
             attempt in the past month, or current suicidal ideation with a well-formed plan or
             intent.

          -  Child: Severe cognitive impairment that could impair their ability to provide informed
             consent; high risk for suicide defined by multiple recent suicide attempts (&gt; 2 in the
             past year) or any attempt in the past month, or current suicidal ideation with a
             well-formed plan or intent; severe or life-threatening medical illness, such as other
             serious cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g. congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis,
             alpha-1-antitrypsin disease) or cancer, which would confound the assessment of asthma,
             anxiety, depression or quality of life; severe psychiatric illness, such as autism,
             bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or current drug/alcohol abuse/dependence. If an
             eligible caregiver presents with more than one child meeting inclusion criteria for
             the study, only one child, randomly selected, will be enrolled.
