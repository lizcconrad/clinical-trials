  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidity between problem gambling and mental health concerns such as anxiety and
      depression is common. Further, the treatment needs of people with co-occurring gambling and
      mental health concerns may be different from those of problem gamblers who do not have a
      co-occurring mental health concern. The present study is a two-arm, double blinded, parallel
      group randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate whether there is a benefit to
      providing access to mental health Internet interventions (G+MH intervention) in addition to
      an Internet intervention for problem gambling (G-only intervention) in participants with
      gambling problems who do or do not have co-occurring mental health concerns.

      People with gambling concerns will be recruited using targeted advertisements. Potential
      participants will be screened using an online survey to identify participants meeting
      criteria for problem gambling. As part of the baseline screening process, measures of current
      depression and anxiety will be assessed. Eligible participants agreeing to take part in the
      study will be randomized to one of two versions of an online intervention for gamblers - an
      intervention that just targets gambling issues (G-only) versus one that contains
      interventions for anxiety and depression in addition to an intervention for gamblers (G+MH).
      It is predicted that problem gamblers who do not have co-occurring mental health concerns
      will display no significant difference between intervention conditions at a six-month
      follow-up. However, for those with co-occurring mental health concerns, it is predicted that
      participants receiving access to G+MH website will display significantly reduced gambling
      outcomes at six-month follow-up as compared to those provided with G-only website.

    <description>The gambling only Internet intervention (G-only) will consist of a new online version of self-change tools that have previously been translated successfully into an online form and shown to have a significant impact on gambling in three trials. A major focus of this intervention is to provide individuals with clear and concise behavioral and cognitive strategies for meeting the goal of reducing or quitting gambling.</description>
