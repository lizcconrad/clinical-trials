    <textblock>
      Improved local control of chordoma initially treated with surgery or not, thanks to adjuvant
      radiotherapy oriented by conventional imaging Computed Tomography /Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (CT / MRI) and guided by the [18Fluor] ([18F]) Fluoroazomycin Arabinofuranoside (FAZA)
      Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET / CT) to target the radioresistant
      hypoxic cells.

    <textblock>
      Due to the close contacts of the lesion with the neurovascular structures, in the case of
      skull base chordoma and mobile spine, surgery is often incomplete. On the contrary, surgery
      of the sacral region (for which the block excision is often possible) brings a better
      therapeutic outcome. Radiotherapy with high-dose supplement improves the outcomes for all
      these lesions.

      Intratumoral hypoxia is a primary factor of radioresistance, it's known since long by
      radiation oncologists. [18F]FAZA gives an image of the hypoxic volume target. Investigators
      propose to increase the radioactive dose in the hypoxic volume target but in order to
      succeed, radiation oncologists have to precisely identify this hypoxic volume. Radiation
      oncologists would increase of 10% the radioactive dose that will allow us to improve local
      control at 3 years of 15% without any additional side effect.

    <description>In residual chordoma tumors after surgery, Investigators propose a protontherapy guided by conventional imaging (CT/MRI) and a boost guided by FAZA PET/CT, in order to target the hypoxic zones and to increase the dose in an adequate manner, which could result in improving long-term local control and reducing complications.</description>

    <description>The operative approach and operating time will be performed according to neurosurgical practices (for head and neck) or surgical orthopaedic team (for sacrum) depending on the location, the extension and the relationship of the lesion to critical structures.
The surgery can be macroscopically complete or incomplete.</description>
