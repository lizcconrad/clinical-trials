  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practicality of most ADHD medications is not or only moderately examined under long term
      routine conditions. Therefore, in this multi-centre, multi-national prospective
      non-interventional study, a recommended follow-up time of 12 months will investigate the
      course of the therapy in children and adolescents with ADHD with prior MPH treatment and
      their medication change to dexamfetamine in several European countries under daily routine.

      It consists of a baseline visit under MPH or another ADHD drug therapy, a change to
      dexamfetamine, the prospective description of the titration phase and a 12 month maintenance
      phase. Data on the use of dexamfetamine in routine clinical practice will be collected to
      describe how dexamfetamine is prescribed, titrated and used in the population of ADHD
      patients and how these factors influence the general intensity of ADHD and safety events.
      This study will collect real world data of dexamfetamine and compare descriptively the
      general intensity of ADHD according to ADHD classification and the impairment due to ADHD
      under therapy with dexamfetamine to the general intensity of ADHD according to ADHD
      classification and the impairment due to ADHD under the prior therapy with MPH. Furthermore
      the utilization of dexamfetamine will be assessed with regards to treatment persistence,
      compliance, proportion of patients discontinuing treatment and reason for discontinuation.
      Due to the fact that patients will be treated according to local medical practice it is
      possible that medication will be changed during the observation period.

        Children and adolescents (Age ≥ 6 to 17.11 years) with ADHD, who were treated with
        methylphenidate (MPH) in the past and, when response to previous MPH treatment is
        considered clinically inadequate, will be treated with dexamfetamine in this
        non-interventional study. ADHD was classified according to a classification system of the
        DSM or ICD and the patient should have no contraindication against dexamfetamine.
