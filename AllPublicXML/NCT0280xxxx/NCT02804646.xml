      The purpose of this study is to discuss the efficacy and safety of recombinant human
      endostatin(endostar) durative intravenous transfusion combined with pemetrexed plus cisplatin
      or carboplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma with wild-type
      EGFR or ALK-negative,compared with chemotherapy without endostar.

      With the progress of molecular biology and translational medical research, the treatment of
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer goes into the era of personalized medicine. Lung
      adenocarcinoma accounts for about 50% of non-small cell lung cancer.In recent years, although
      individualized targeted therapy in lung adenocarcinoma progress by leaps and bounds, but the
      research of wild-type EGFR or ALK-negative lung adenocarcinoma is extremely lag, lack of
      clinically effective targeted drugs.As time goes on,almost all of the EGFR-TKI treatment of
      lung adenocarcinoma will be resistant one day,and patients need other treatments, such as
      chemotherapy.Currently, chemotherapy is still the main treatment for advanced lung
      adenocarcinoma with EGFR wild-type and unkown.Many researches has reported that:endostar
      combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC can significantly improve the
      patient's RR,TTP and did not increase the adverse effects of chemotherapy.Recently,endostar
      durative intravenous transfusion has been widely accept and use because of the lower
      toxicity.The purpose of our study was to discuss the efficacy and safety of endostard
      durative intravenous transfusion combined with chemotherapy.In our study,Patients with Ⅲb/Ⅳ
      lung adenocarcinoma were divided into two groups randomly,one group was treated with endostar
      durative intravenous transfusion combined with chemotherapy,while the other group with
      chemotherapy pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin only.In the end,PFS,ORR,DCR and OS were
      compared between these two groups.
