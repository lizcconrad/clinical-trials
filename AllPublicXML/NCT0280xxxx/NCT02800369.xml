      This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat human cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) without invasion.

      Persistent infection with specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV, most frequently types
      16 and 18) may lead to precancerous lesions(CIN). If untreated, these lesions may progress to
      cervical cancer within many years. In the infected cells, HPV expresses the oncoproteins E6
      and E7, both of which play key roles in maintaining viral infection and promoting
      carcinogenesis. Previous studies has demonstrated that E7 alone, but not E6, is sufficient to
      immortalize human keratinocytes in vitro and induce high-grade cervical dysplasia in a
      transgenic mouse model. These data indicated that E7 may dominate the malignant progress in
      HPV-infected cells.

      The agents zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), called ZFN-603 and ZFN-758, which can cleave the
      HPV16 and HPV18 E7 oncogene specifically. ZFN-mediated disruption of HPV16 and HPV18 E7 DNA
      directly decreased the expression of E7, induced type-specific apoptosis in HPV16- and
      HPV18-positive cells, and inhibited cell growth.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ZFN-603 and ZFN-758 are effective in the
      treatment of HPV16- and HPV18-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

    <textblock>
      Laboratory studies have shown that ZFN-603 and ZFN-758 could induce significant cleavage of
      E7 DNA in HPV16- and HPV18-positive cells. The disruption to viral DNA directly led to
      downregulation of E7 expression and restoration of the tumor suppressor genes retinoblastoma
      1 (RB1), resulting in apoptosis and growth inhibition of ZFN-treated HPV16- and HPV18-
      positive cell lines. On the basis of these laboratory results, there is the potential that
      this may work in humans infected with high-risk HPV (especially HPV16 and HPV18) and block
      the progression of CIN The new treatment to be studied will involve transfecting ZFNs into
      HPV-infected cervical epithelials. Cells modified by ZFN-603 and ZFN-758 will lose the
      ability of immortalization and progress to apoptosis.

      Researchers hope that these agents will be able to block the malignant progression of CIN and
      reduce the incidence of cervical cancer
