      The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the potential role of Ketamine as
      an analgesic agent in pediatric sickle cell disease patients with refractory symptoms in
      acute (VOC). Our study design is as follows: Prospective observational study of 20 pediatric
      sickle cell disease patients with refractory pain to conventional analgesic regimens seen in
      the pediatric emergency medicine department. Consenting patients with refractory pain meeting
      inclusion criteria will be given a single intravenous bolus of Ketamine at a set dosage of
      0.25 milligrams per kilogram of weight. Participants' perception of pain will then be
      recorded using standard pain scoring scales (FLACC score). Physiologic criteria such as heart
      rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, total analgesic pharmacologic requirements for
      adequate analgesia during hospitalization, and duration of hospitalization will be measured.
      Observational study group will continue to get standard of care outside of single bolus of
      Ketamine. 48 hour follow up after hospital discharge will be obtained to assess degree of
      pain control and general clinical status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients (&gt; 3 yrs and &lt;18yrs) with a previous diagnosis of sickle cell
             disease (including Hgb S Beta Thalassemia +, Hgb S Alpha Thalassemia, Hgb S HPFH) )
             seen in the pediatric emergency room setting for acute vaso-occlusive pain crisis.

        Exclusion Criteria:
