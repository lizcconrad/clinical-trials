      Primary Goal: To compare the clinical outcomes of spinal anesthesia and general anesthesia in
      surgery for lumbar disc herniation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included: All patients in the neurosurgery department of the University Hospital of
      Reims or in the neurosurgery department of CHG Chalons en Champagne for surgical management
      of lumbar disc herniation and agreeing to participate in the research. The types of
      anesthesia (general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia) will be randomized.

      Investigation Plan: Participation in the research will be available to any eligible patient
      during the anesthesia consultation prior hospitalization for surgery. If the patient agrees
      to participate in research, randomization of the anesthetic technique will be realized. The
      anesthetist and the patient will be informed of the outcome of this randomization.
      Hospitalization of patients will not be changed. They will be hospitalized in inpatient, as
      usual, with an entry the day before surgery and an outlet the next day (without
      complications). The surgery itself will not be changed. The patient's postoperative
      monitoring will not be changed. Data will be collected for each patient: demographic data,
      medical data, data about the intervention and anesthesia, postoperative data management.
