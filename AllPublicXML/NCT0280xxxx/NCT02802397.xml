  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early ovarian reserve decreased is one of the main causes of infertility for women after 35
      years. The relationship between this decreased and exposure to chemicals, including
      persistent endocrine disruptors or organic solvents, has been little studied. However,
      several in vivo or in vitro experimental studies suggested that these chemicals may impaired
      ovarian function.

      The main objective is to study the relationship between early ovarian reserve decreased and
      exposure to persistent organic pollutants.

      The secondary objectives are to study the relationship between early ovarian reserve
      decreased and exposure to organic solvents and heavy metals.

      Multicenter case-control study. This project will permit to increase the knowledge concerning
      the etiology of early decreased ovarian reserve. Considering that exposure of interest are
      frequent, the results may be important in a public health perspective. If associations are
      observed in this study, the results may encouraged prevention strategy.

      Cases and controls will benefit, as usual in France concerning infertility etiology
      examinations, of a follicle antral count by transvaginal ultrasound and AMH measurement.

      At baseline, physicians will complete a short questionnaire to check the inclusion criterion,
      the results of the measurement of follicle count and hormone measurement (including AMH).
      Cases and controls will respond to self-administered questionnaire at inclusion with
      information about their medical history, their demographics, their tobacco and alcohol
      consumption, their occupation and products handled in the workplace. Blood samples (for
      measure of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals) and urine (for measure of
      metabolites of glycol ethers) will be collect at baseline. Occupational exposures to solvents
      will be defined using job exposures matrices. The risk of decreased ovarian reserve will be
      analyzed using logistic regressions for each exposure of interest adjusting for potential
      confounders.
