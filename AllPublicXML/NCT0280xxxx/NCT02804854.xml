  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients often succumb to acute respiratory disease (rapidly developing
      disease affecting the lungs). The lungs are the commonest organ to fail and require support
      in the intensive care environment. However, no accurate methods exist that can be used at the
      bedside to tell what is causing deterioration in a person's lungs. There are various examples
      of acute respiratory diseases that can occur as a result of numerous different causes, have a
      high risk of death and cannot be treated easily with drugs. When trying to accurately
      diagnose and classify these lung diseases there is a risk that the type of respiratory
      disease is misdiagnosed, missed or the level of severity is not captured. By using the field
      of optical molecular imaging and employing novel techniques and technologies, the
      investigators hope to demonstrate here that a bespoke chemical probe administered in micro
      doses (tiny doses) directly into the distal lung can rapidly and accurately detect activated
      neutrophils (cells of the immune system that are implicated in the development of these
      severe conditions), and so work towards a bedside test which could be used to diagnose,
      monitor and classify the disease in patients who are critically ill in the future. The
      population for this study are in intensive care where patients are normally intubated (have a
      breathing tube) due to the severity of their illness, this may be because of respiratory
      problems or respiratory problems can rapidly develop. Participants will have the chemical
      probe administered into their lungs and pictures taken through the tube already in place. As
      this probe lights up when it comes into contact with neutrophils the investigators will be
      able to tell if neutrophils are present. This will inform a larger study in which it's hoped
      that the method can be used to inform clinical decisions. The first procedure will take place
      within two days of initiation of mechanical ventilation and the direct contact with the study
      team will be completed within nine days.

             pre-specified time

          -  Treatment withdrawal documented to take place within the next 24 hours
