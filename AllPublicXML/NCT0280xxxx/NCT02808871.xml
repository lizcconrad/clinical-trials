      The purpose of this study is to to assess the safety and tolerability of pirfenidone 2403
      mg/day for the treatment of RA-associated interstitial lung disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of pirfenidone for the
      treatment of RA associated interstitial lung disease. Approximately 270 subjects will be
      randomized to receive Pirfenidone 2403 mg per day or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary
      outcome of this study is to assess the efficacy of pirfenidone 2403 mg/day versus placebo in
      patients with RA associated interstitial lung disease, as defined by progression free
      survival over the 52 weeks of treatment. Patients will receive blinded study treatment from
      the time of randomization until the Week 52 Visit.

      Eligible patients aged 18 to 85 years must meet 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA (Aletaha,
      Neogi et al. 2010) as well as RA-associated ILD, as determined by imaging and, when
      available, lung biopsy. Patients will be required to have a % predicted FVC ≥40 and ≤80 and %
      predicted DLCO ≥30 and ≤80 at screening.

      The dose of study treatment will be titrated over 14 days. Patients will receive a telephone
      assessment at Week 1 and visit the clinic at Weeks 2, 4, 13, 16, 26, 39, and 52. Patients
      should complete a compliance diary between visits. If patients discontinue study treatment
      for any reason before the end of the study, they should continue with all scheduled study
      procedures through Week 52. If subjects are unable to complete the study visits as scheduled,
      all efforts should be made to complete an early termination visit.

      The primary outcome variable of this study will be progression free survival, defined as
      progression free from decline in FVC of 10% or greater during the 52 week study period.
