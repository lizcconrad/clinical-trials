  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The shock wave is a new and potential intervention for the reinnervation of peripheral nerve.
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on
      cubital tunnel syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Investigators perform a prospective randomized, single-blinded study to investigate the
      effect of ESWT in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome.

      Patients were randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention
      group received three-sessions of ESWT and single one session of ESWT was given in control
      group. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and
      24 week after the treatment.
