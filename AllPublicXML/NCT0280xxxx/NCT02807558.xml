    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of SY-1425 in relapsed/refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, relapsed/refractory higher-risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) patients (SY-1425 administered as a monotherapy or in combination with
      daratumumab), newly diagnosed treatment naïve AML patients who are unlikely to tolerate
      standard intensive chemotherapy (SY-1425 administered as a monotherapy or in combination with
      azacitidine), or lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (SY-1425 administered as
      a monotherapy) who are positive for a RARA biomarker.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label study exploring the activity of SY-1425 in
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-APL AML, relapsed or refractory higher-risk MDS,
      newly diagnosed treatment naïve AML, or transfusion dependent, lower-risk MDS. All patients
      must be positive for the RARA super-enhancer associated biomarker or RARA pathway biomarker
      at the time of the study screening evaluation. Patients will accrue to each of the five arms
      based on diagnosis, prior treatment, risk group, and investigator choice of treatment
      (SY-1425 single agent or in combination with azacitidine or daratumumab). SY-1425 will be
      administered at 6 mg/m2/day orally divided in two doses. SY-1425 will be given on a 28-day
      treatment cycle and dosing will be continuous. For those newly diagnosed treatment naïve AML
      patients receiving the combination of SY-1425 and azacitidine, azacitidine will be
      administered at 75 mg/m2/day IV or SC days 1-7, and SY-1425 will be administered at 6
      mg/m2/day orally divided in two doses days 8-28 on a 28-day treatment cycle. For those
      relapsed or refractory non-APL AML and relapsed or refractory higher-risk MDS patients
      receiving the combination of SY-1425 and daratumumab, SY-1425 daily dosing (dose level
      described above) will begin with a 7-day lead-in followed by continuous dosing on a 28-day
      treatment cycle. Daratumumab will be administered at a dose of 16 mg/kg starting on Cycle 1
      Day 1 weekly for 8 weeks (8 dose total), followed by dosing every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8
      doses total), followed by dosing every 4 weeks.

      Dosing will continue unless: the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, disease
      progression/relapse, pursues post-remission therapy other than SY-1425 (single agent or in
      combination with azacitidine or daratumumab), or the Investigator determines it is in the
      best interest of the patient to discontinue treatment. Newly diagnosed AML patients who
      achieve a CR/CRi or PR while on SY-1425 single agent treatment and then relapse, or who fail
      to achieve a CR/CRi or PR after completing at least 4 cycles of SY-1425 single agent
      treatment, are eligible to receive SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine.

      Lower-risk MDS patients will be withdrawn from the study at week 24 if they do not have at
      least a minor erythroid response. Lower-risk MDS patients who in the opinion of the
      investigator are receiving clinical benefit, but do not meet the minor erythroid response
      criteria can remain on study with sponsor approval. Lower-risk MDS patients who continue past
      week 24 will continue to receive treatment until erythroid relapse, disease progression, or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      An end of treatment visit will be conducted for all AML and higher-risk MDS patients within
      30 days of the last dose of study drug, but prior to the start of any subsequent therapies to
      monitor for safety and resolution of adverse events. For lower-risk MDS patients, the end of
      treatment visit will also be the end of study visit which will be conducted 30 days after the
      last dose of study drug. All AML and higher-risk MDS patients will be followed every three
      months for survival for up to 2 years and patients who are withdrawn prior to relapse will
      also follow-up for event free survival.

             potential not willing to use two highly effective methods of birth control, one being
             barrier method. Intrauterine Devices (IUD) and birth control pills are not barrier
             methods, but are highly effective especially when combined with a barrier method (e.g.
             latex condom or a diaphragm or cervical cap) while taking investigational product
             (SY-1425) and continuing contraception use for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug. Men/women should not donate sperm or ova during this time frame.
