  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tafenoquine (TQ) is an 8-aminoquinoline anti-malarial drug which is in development as a
      single-dose treatment for the radical cure of P.vivax malaria when given with standard doses
      of chloroquine. Currently, the only available drug for radical cure is primaquine (PQ) which
      requires administration over 14 days, resulting in poor compliance. In Indonesia, chloroquine
      has been replaced by artemisinin-based combination therapy (i.e. ACTs) due to widespread
      chloroquine resistance. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
      tafenoquine when co-administered with an ACT (i.e. DHA-PQP). This single-center,
      double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study will test the superiority of DHA-PQP plus TQ
      against DHA-PQP alone in the prevention of P. vivax malaria relapse at 6 months. The study
      will be conducted in male Indonesian soldiers diagnosed with P.vivax malaria on return from
      deployment to a malarious region of Indonesia. A PQ plus DHA-PQP comparator arm is included
      to provide an informal comparison against the standard 14 day treatment for P.vivax malaria
      in Indonesia. Subjects who are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient (G6PD deficient)
      will be excluded due to the risk of acute hemolysis following dosing with 8-aminoquinolines
      drugs. Subjects who have a recurrence of P.vivax malaria during the study will be treated
      with an ACT plus PQ (0.5mg/kg for 14 days), in line with local treatment guidelines. At the
      end of the 6 month follow up period, any subject who has not relapsed will be given open
      label PQ (0.5mg/kg daily for 14 days) to minimize the likelihood of relapse after the study.
      Approximately 200 subjects will be screened to achieve 150 randomized subjects. The total
      duration of study for each subject will be 180-195 days. This study is being carried out to
      support registration of TQ in Indonesia and other countries where ACTs are first line
      therapy.
