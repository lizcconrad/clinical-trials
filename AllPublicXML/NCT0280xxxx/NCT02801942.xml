  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that early changes in the immune system in New Onset Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus (NOT1D) subjects can be detected in immune cells from the inguinal lymph nodes
      (iLN), which will be distinct from changes observed in peripheral blood derived immune cells.
      Therefore this study will assess and compare the molecular immune profile of cells derived
      from the iLN in healthy and NOT1D subjects, to understand the immunological processes that
      may lead to beta cell destruction. It is a multi-center, non-drug treatment study. Up to 15
      subjects in each group, namely healthy subjects and NOT1D subjects, will be evaluated in the
      study. A data look will be carried out after the recruitment of a cohort of up to 5 healthy
      subjects, to determine if the quality and quantity of cells derived from aspirate or core
      biopsy or from peripheral blood are likely to be sufficient to continue the study to meet its
      primary objective. An interim analysis will be carried out after the recruitment of 5
      evaluable healthy subjects and 5 evaluable NOT1D subjects. The primary purpose of this
      interim analysis will be to facilitate decision making and study design for a potential
      follow-up interventional study.
