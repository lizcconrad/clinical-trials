  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ireland is predicted to have the highest older adult population growth of any European Union
      country. A substantial economic and social challenge of this projected growth is the
      increased incidence of cognitive impairment and the likelihood of progression to dementia.
      Dementia's, such as Alzheimer's disease, typically have a long prodromal stage with brain
      changes identifiable from the earliest stages of neuropathology, providing an opportunity for
      intervention. Switching to a strategy of earlier identification and prevention would
      significantly reduce prevalence and the associated cost.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of vitamin D supplements in community
      dwelling older adults as a lifestyle approach that may support cognitive and physical
      functioning. The research will incorporate several stages including an initial in-depth
      screening process, a novel and sensitive cognitive battery, 6 month double blind placebo
      controlled intervention of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and a concluding participant feedback
      interview.

      These results will be used to assess the feasibility of recruiting and assessing community
      dwelling older adults for extensive nutrition related cognitive studies.
