      The purpose of this study is to understand how the opioid system is involved in eating
      behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, diabetes,
      and mortality, and is a heterogeneous condition with various causes and thus a diversity of
      intervention targets. Compulsive overeating afflicts 30% of people seeking obesity treatment
      and increases risk for CVD factors. This trial involves two participant visits to test
      whether opioid blockade (Day 1 or 2, depending on randomization), compared to placebo (Day 1
      or 2, depending on randomization), will elicit common symptoms of opioid withdrawal,
      including nausea. Participants will receive each condition on separate days.
