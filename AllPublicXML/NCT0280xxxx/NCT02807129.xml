  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate frailty in patients aged â‰¥ 65 years with cancer. The
      elderly population is very heterogeneous, it is necessary to evaluate these elderly patients
      before treatment to assess the risk-benefit balance. To date, this assessment relies on
      subjective clinical methods often not optimal, and slow to implement. An innovative method of
      evaluation could be the determination of elastin peptides. Indeed, the rate of these
      peptides, which are linked to serious conditions associated with age, rising inexorably with
      age and dose could help determine more objectively the type of treatment to offer older
      patients.

      Expected results : This study will allow better identification of the group of frail elderly
      through more relevant biological marker that clinical assessment, often subjective and not
      available within a period compatible with the treatment of newly diagnosed cancer. This
      biological assessment will also enable optimal management of elderly patients in particular
      by allowing the geriatrician better efficiency.
