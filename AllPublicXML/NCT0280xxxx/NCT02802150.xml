  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 10-weeks oral
      consumption of Zanthoxylum schinifolium seed Oil (ZSO) in patients with mild dry eye disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled trial, twenty participants
      experiencing dry eyes symptoms were recruited, and randomly assigned to consume 4 g/day of
      either ZSO or soy bean oil (SBO) as placebo for 10 weeks. All participants completed the
      study. Follow-ups of dry eye symptoms and objective signs, inflammatory and oxidative stress
      markers, and blood lipid analysis were performed.
