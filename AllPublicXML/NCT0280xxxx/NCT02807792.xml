    <textblock>
      This protocol will test a new prototype of a peri-anal access device, with increased flexible
      length and a captured operative field, for feasibility in patients immediately prior to their
      scheduled peri-anal procedure.

      Research Methods: The insertion of the modified access device in five patients before their
      planned peri-anal procedure, which will subsequently be performed with standard instruments,
      will allow us to observe the ease of insertion, the expansion of the blades, and the creation
      of the operative field achieved. If necessary, we will modify our design based on these
      findings. When a successful, operating room prototype is established, the device will be
      suitable for clinical use and the stated benefits thereof.

    <description>The Outcome Measure Title implies the visual measurement that will be used to describe the potential operative field delineated by our experimental perianal access device. The description will, therefore, be primarily a qualitative visual assessment with the addition of estimated dimensions measured in centimeters for the length of the longitudinal and transverse fields encompassed by the blades of the access device. The collected measurement data will be aggregated, the numerical data averaged, and the visual perceptions integrated. The Time Frame for the individual study of each insertion will be two minutes or less. There is no chronic component to this feasibility analysis.</description>
