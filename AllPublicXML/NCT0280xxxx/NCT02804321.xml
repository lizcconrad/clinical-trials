    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmias with a constantly growing
      prevalence. Two main techniques are used today to restore sinus rhythm: electrical
      cardioversion and radiofrequency ablation.

      Radiofrequency ablation has become a recognized and effective treatment of AF. Despite a
      relatively high success rate (about 80%), a substantial number of patients require a second
      procedure to obtain sinus rhythm. Many publications have led to the study of predictors of
      failure of this ablation factors (BMI, uncontrolled hypertension, size of the OG...) but to
      date no parameter is reliable and usable in daily practice.

      It is the same for electrical cardioversion. Despite a relatively high immediate success rate
      of approximately 80%, a significant number of patient relapse arrhythmia in short and long
      term. Many publications have led to the study of predictive factors of failure (seniority and
      type of AF, uncontrolled hypertension, size of the OG, mitral valve disease...) but so far
      the results are disappointing.

      In AF patients with heart disease underlying, it has been well demonstrated that the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) was strongly activated. In addition, it is now well
      established that elevated plasma aldosterone as in primary hyperaldosteronism is associated
      with a significantly increased risk of occurrence of cardiovascular events. The high plasma
      concentrations were also highlighted in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, or heart
      failure and are associated with an increase in major cardiovascular event rate, especially
      arrhythmias. In some experimental models of heart failure, it has been demonstrated a
      suppression of the occurrence of spontaneous FA by an anti-aldosterone treatment. The
      arrhythmogenic effect of aldosterone has also been shown in animal models. All these results
      indicate a potential role of aldosterone in the genesis of an arrhythmogenic substrate and
      the FA.

      The hypothesis of this study is that aldosterone plasma levels in pre-reduced patients is
      predictive of recurrence risk of atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias
      (flutter or atrial tachycardia) after FA reduction, either in using a radiofrequency ablation
      or via electrical cardioversion.

        The study population corresponds to all patients referred for atrial fibrillation
        cardioversion by radiofrequency ablation or electrical cardioversion, clinically stable, at
        Caen University Hospital, Pitié-Salpêtrière and Ambroise Paré clinic.

        These patients have a strict, rigorous and systematic follow after these cardioversion at
        1, 3 and 6 months with routine ECG.
