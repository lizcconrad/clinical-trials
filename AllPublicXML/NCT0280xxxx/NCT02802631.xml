    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Minocin®
      (minocycline) for injection in healthy adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect safety, tolerability, and PK data on ascending dose
      regimens of Minocin® (minocycline) for Injection. The safety, tolerability, and PK data will
      support the compound as a potential clinical candidate in Europe and allow recommendations of
      dose levels to be used in future Phase 2/3 studies.

    <description>Minocin (minocycline for injection) for will be supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder in single-use 10-mL glass vials. Each vial contains 108 mg of minocycline hydrochloride equivalent to 100 mg of minocycline. Each cohort receives one of the following dosages of Minocin (minocycline) for Injection: 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, or 500 mg. Within each cohort, subjects will receive a single dose on Day 1, followed by 7 days of multiple-doses (Days 4-10, given every 12 hours), followed by a single dose on Day 11.</description>
