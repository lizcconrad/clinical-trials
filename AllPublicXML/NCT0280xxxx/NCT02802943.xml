      The aim of this study is to induce a peptide-specific immune response in chronic lymphatic
      leukaemia (CLL) patients by multi-peptide vaccination with a patient-individualized peptide
      cocktail and, dependent on minimal residual disease (MRD) status, the immunomodulatory drug
      lenalidomide.

      Study Duration and Schedule:

      The duration of the trial for each subject is expected to be 24 months. The duration for each
      individual patient includes 6 months first-line therapy according to treating physicians
      choice with HLA ligandome analyses of chronic lymphatic leukaemia cells and selection of
      patient-individual multi-peptide vaccine being performed in parallel, 12 months study
      treatment and 6 months follow-up time. The overall duration of the trial is expected to be
      approximately 4 years including preparatory phase. Recruitment of subjects will start in
      06/2016. The end of study is determined as the date of the last visit of the last patient
      (Last Subject Out (LSO) 01/2020).

      General Criteria for Subject Selection:

      For the screening procedures of this study, physically fit subjects with a confirmed
      diagnosis of a chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) according to the International Workshop on
      chronic lymphatic leukaemia (IWCLL) guidelines requiring treatment are eligible. First line
      treatment will be performed according to treating physicians choice. The trial population
      will consist of both genders. Gender distribution in the trial is supposed to reflect the
      distribution in the real patient's population (approximately 60% male and 40% female
      patients), i.e. there will be no prior defined quantitative ratio between females and males.
      To assure that the included patients have the ability to mount an immune response, immune
      response to an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)/ Cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide mix will be assessed
      in the screening phase. 60ml blood will be taken at the prescreening study visit. Peripheral
      mononuclear cells will be isolated and analysed in a 12 day IFNy ELiSPOT for memory T cell
      response to an EBV/CMV peptide mix. Only patients showing a positive immune response will be
      included in the study. For the study treatment, physically fit subjects with a confirmed
      diagnosis of CLL according to the IWCLL guidelines, which were treated with a first line
      therapy according to physicians choice. Subjects must have achieved at least a partial
      remission (IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL) due to treatment with
      first line therapy.

      Study Design:

      Interventional, open·label, multi-center phase II trial with use of a patient·individualized
      multipeptide vaccine and imiquimod as adjuvant with or without the immunomodulator
      lenalidomide based on MRD levels in individual patients.

      Blinding:

      No blinding will be performed to avoid unnecessary complications of intradermal injections
      with sodium acid solution. Method against bias in patient selection: The patient selection
      will be documented. Reasons for refusal will be assessed.Method against bias in treatment
      manualized treatment protocol, monitoring and treatment reports. Method against bias in data
      analysis: Monitoring, analysis by intention to treat; independent statistician.

      Chronic lymphatic leukaemia-peptide vaccine (CLL-VAC) drug product (DP):

      Each patient enrolled in the individualized VAC-L-CLL trial will receive a CLL·VAC DP
      specifically tailored to the individual HLA ligandome of Cll cells. The DPs are composed of
      peptides that are first manufactured as drug substances. A process named CLL-VAC_v1 enables
      the selection of drug substances to compose the unique, patient-individual CLL·VAC DPs.
      CLL·VAC DPs will be composed based on a peptide warehouse consisting of 40 individual
      peptides (drug substances; 35 HLA class I peptides (5 A*01, 5 A*02, 5 A*03, 5 A*24, 5 B*07, 5
      B*08, 5 B*44) and 5 HLA class II peptides. 25 HLA class I peptides and all 5 HLA class II
      peptides are shown to be immunogenic and therefore available for vaccine cocktail composition
      (5 A*01, 5 A*02, 5 A*03, 5 B*08). For each patient, 5 HLA class I peptides are selected from
      the warehouse based on patient individual HLA ligandome analysis of CLL cells and are
      subsequently formulated into the personalized drug; the 5 HLA class II peptides will be
      included in each 'peptide vaccine cocktail.

      All warehouse peptides are manufactured by BCN PEPTIDES, S.A, Eis Vinyets-Els Fogars 11,08777
      Sant Quinti de Mediona (Barcelona), Spain, or by Wirkstoffpeptidlabor, University of
      Tubingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076 Tubingen, Germany. Both production sites hold
      certificates for the production of good manufacture practice (GMP) grade synthetic peptides.
      All peptides are synthetic peptides, which will be manufactured by well·established solid
      phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) procedures using Fmoc chemistry.

    <description>The rate of patients with induction of peptide-specific T cell responses within a maximum of 6 month after start of therapy will be the primary endpoint for efficacy.
Analysis of the primary endpoint= induction of immune response:
The induction of peptide-specific T cell responses will be determined by IFNγ ELISPOT.
T cell responses will be considered to be positive when &gt;15 spots/well (IFNγ ELISPOT) were counted and the mean spot count per well is at least 3-fold higher than the mean number of spots in the negative control wells (according to the cancer immunoguiding program guidelines).</description>

    <description>Individualized multi-peptide cocktail consisting of 257µg each of 5 HLA class I and 5 HLA class II restricted peptides. The peptides for each individual patient will be selected from a warehouse consisting of 40 different peptides restricted by the 7 most common HLA class I allotypes (A*01, A*02, A*03, A*24, B*07, B*08, B*44) and 5 HLA class II peptides. HLA class I peptides to be applied in each CLL patient will be selected in a personalized manner guided by the mass spectrometric analysis of the patient-individual HLA ligandome. Peptides will be administered subcutaneously. Vaccination will take place on d1, d4, d8, d15, d22 followed by vaccinations every 4 weeks for 1 year. The peptide warehouse is selected based on our data on the non-mutant HLA-presented antigenome of CLL identified as frequently presented CLL-associated T cell epitopes with a high potential for broad clinical application.</description>
