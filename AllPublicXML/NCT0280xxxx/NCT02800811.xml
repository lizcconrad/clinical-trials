      This study is a first-in-human, phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      center study evaluating single and multiple ascending intravenous doses of FR104 in healthy
      subjects.

      64 healthy male and female subjects are selected according to the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, i.e., 50 subjects in Part 1 (SAD: 2 cohorts of 22 [Cohort A], 28 [Cohort B],
      respectively) and 14 subjects in Part 2 (MAD). The total duration of the study is 10 months.

      All FR104 doses are administered intravenously by a slow infusion of at least 30 minutes. A
      staggered approach is observed within all dose levels. An interval of at least 14 days (last
      to first administration) is observed between all dose levels. Individual subjects on a same
      day of dosing are dosed at least 60 minutes apart.

             deviations, as judged by the investigator; Note: a retest can be done in case of an
             out of range ECG value that can determine a subject's eligibility.

        this study:

          1. A history of any clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac,
             endocrinology, hematology, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, and/or other major disease or malignancy
             excluding non-melanoma skin cancer;
