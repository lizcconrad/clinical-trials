  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, two-part, multiple-dose, dose-finding, single-blind study in adult
      participants undergoing elective colonoscopy for screening or diagnostic purposes. This study
      is designed to test various ABP-700 infusion regimens for rational selection of one or more
      dosage regimen(s) to be used for future clinical development of ABP-700 in procedural
      sedation.

    <textblock>
      In Part 1, three ABP-700 two-stage infusion regimens will be evaluated. A sample size of 75
      evaluable participants will be randomly assigned to dose regimens in a 1:1:1 ratio. Following
      the completion of Part 1, a Data Review Committee (DRC) will review the dose-response,
      efficacy, and safety data and provide recommendations on whether to continue the study to
      Part 2 and the number of ABP-700 infusion regimens to be included in Part 2. The Sponsor
      (MDCO) will make the final decision to proceed with Part 2 (whether to conduct Part 2 and
      number of dose regimens if the study continues to Part 2) based on the recommendation from
      the DRC.
