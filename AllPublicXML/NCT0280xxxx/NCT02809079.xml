  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system that leads to blindness and paralysis. Since disability accrues incrementally
      related to attacks, attack prevention with immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of
      preventing disability. However, there is no standard immunosuppressive treatment strategy for
      NMO relapse prevention. In a previous study, the investigators provided evidence supporting
      the use of azathioprine plus a low dose corticosteroid as an effective strategy which is
      associated with a reduction in the risk of relapse in Chinese patients with NMO, but
      azathioprine has bone marrow suppression and other side effects. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
      is a new immunosuppressant with rapid onset, fewer side effects and other advantages. In
      recent years, MMF has been used in different immune-related neurological diseases; some
      literature shown the possible efficacy of MMF in NMO treatment.

      In this research, a multi-center (Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University,
      Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre of Sun Yat-sen University, Nangfang Hospital of Southern Medical
      University) study will carry out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil
      therapy in NMO spectrum disorders.
