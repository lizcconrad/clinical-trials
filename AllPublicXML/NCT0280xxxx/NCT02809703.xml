      The objective of the study is to determine the quality of life of patients in the years
      following treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The study population
      will include all adults treated with any configuration of ECMO at Duke University Medical
      Center during the period of Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2015. Patient's will be contacted by
      direct mail, in conjunction with a surgeon who performed their ECMO procedure or managed them
      while on ECMO, and asked to complete a validated survey (WHOQOL-Bref) which assesses quality
      of life. In addition, patients will be asked to opt-in to participate in a phone survey in
      which they can give a narrative about their ICU experience and answer specific questions
      regarding long-term comorbidities. Data will be stored in a secure online server which is
      HIPAA compliant and analyzed by the department of anesthesiology statistical support
      services. De-identified data will be shared with the WHO as specified in their usage
      agreement.
