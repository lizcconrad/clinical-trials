  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does the use of periarticular Exparel in total knee arthroplasty prove to more effectively
      manage post operative pain control than another local analgesic, Ropivacaine, when both are
      used as part of a multimodal pain management approach?

      The investigators hypothesize that Exparel, a bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension,
      will improve total knee arthroplasty postoperative pain with significant improvement of early
      function outcomes.

      The investigators use a double blind, controlled, randomized study to examine the
      effectiveness of periarticular Exparel in total knee arthroplasty postoperative pain control
      as well as effect on early mobilization and length of hospital stay when compared to another
      local analgesic (Ropivacaine) when both are used as part of a multimodal pain management
      approach.
