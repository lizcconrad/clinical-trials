  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's syndrome is a relatively rare disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels
      of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. Cushing's syndrome may result from elevated
      endogenous or exogenous sources of cortisol. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome resulting from
      cortisol overproduction by the adrenal glands is the subject of this protocol.

      Patients with exogenous Cushing's syndrome, which develops as a side effect of chronic
      administration of high doses of glucocorticoids, are not eligible for enrollment in this
      study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CORT125134 for treatment
      of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The multicenter study will be conducted in the United
      States and in Europe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label study with two dose groups, each with a two-step dose
      escalation, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CORT125134 for the treatment of
      endogenous Cushing's syndrome. CORT125134 will be administered orally once daily for 12 weeks
      with dose escalations occuring every 4 weeks.

      PK profiles will be generated at every dose level. A data review committee will review PK and
      safety data and will recommend the final plan for dose escalation in Group 2.
