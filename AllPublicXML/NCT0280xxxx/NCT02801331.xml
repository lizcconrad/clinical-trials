  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a specially-constructed crib mattress
      that delivers gentle vibrations (stochastic vibrotactile stimulation) as a complementary,
      non-pharmacological intervention for treating drug withdrawal in newborns exposed to opioids
      in utero.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the therapeutic efficacy of stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS)
      for reducing withdrawal symptoms, pharmacological requirement and hospitalization, and for
      improving neurobehavioral developmental outcomes in opioid-exposed newborns.

      Candidates at-risk for NAS due opioid exposure in utero will be identified to investigators
      by medical caregiver and/or prescreened using HIPAA Waiver for recruitment
      (maternal-prenatal; infant-postnatal). Infants will be randomized into either SVS
      (complementary to standard of care) or Standard Clinical Care (SCC), restricted by equipment
      (mattress) availability. Infants will be enrolled within 24 hours post birth and participate
      throughout hospitalization. Infants assigned SVS will receive daily intervention of
      continuous SVS throughout hospitalization using a specially constructed crib mattress that
      delivers gentle vibrations at preset intervals.

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the efficacy of SVS as a non-pharmacological therapy complementary
      to standard clinical care (SCC) for reducing severity and duration of opioid withdrawal in
      newborns compared to SCC alone. Quantify clinical variables: NAS severity, days in hospital,
      velocity of weight gain, cumulative morphine dose.

      Specific Aim 2. Compare neurobehavioral outcomes in fetal drug-exposed infants between
      infants who received SVS and those who received SCC. Longitudinal outcomes assessment at 1
      month, 6-months and 1 year to test whether early intervention with SVS compared to standard
      care improves physical, social, emotional and cognitive development.
