      &quot;Holding-cuddling&quot; plus oral sucrose versus oral sucrose for reducing venipuncture pain in
      newborns and infants.

      Neonates and infants routinely undergo venipuncture in pediatric and neonatal intensive care
      units.

      Such procedure is painful and several units administer 24% oral sucrose with pacifier during
      venipuncture, as this non-pharmacological intervention is considered safe and effective for
      procedural pain relief in infants from birth to 3 months of age. However, several studies
      point out that further research is needed to assess its efficacy in combination with other
      behavioral interventions for analgesia during painful procedures. Current knowledge suggests
      that multisensorial stimulation associated with oral sucrose could allow even more effective
      analgesia. To date, the studied stimulation strategies are based on massage, voice, eye
      contact and fragrance during heel prick. The &quot;holding-cuddling&quot; - that is the fact of holding
      the child in a safe, reassuring and warm position during the examination or medical
      intervention is promoted by various hospitals in order to favor the comfort of all the
      caregivers during such a procedures. This intervention should be primarily parents-driven
      but, in case of unavailability, it can be performed by the nursing staff. The hypothesis of
      this study is that the combination of &quot;holding-cuddling&quot; plus oral sucrose in more effective
      than oral sucrose in diminishing behavioral pain response during a venipuncture in newborns
      or infants less than three-month-old.
