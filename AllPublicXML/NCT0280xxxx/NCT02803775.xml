  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a well established clinical therapy for patients
      with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction and electrocardiographic QRS duration
      of 120 ms or greater. Multicenter trials have consistently demonstrated CRT &quot;non responder&quot;
      rates of 32-43% at 6 months. Subsequent studies have shown that utilizing
      echocardiographic-guided device reprogramming for optimal atrio-ventricular (A-V) and
      interventricular (VV) delays at rest have improved clinical response. Recently, an
      echocardiographically validated automated pacemaker programmer-based intra-cardiac
      electrogram (IEGM) algorithm has been developed for rapid optimization of sino-ventricular
      (P-V), A-V and V-V delays at resting heart rates that is partially based on the
      interventricular conduction time delays. Nevertheless, controversy still persists as to the
      applicability of both echocardiographic and IEGM derived algorithms at elevated heart rates,
      as with physical activity, when patients are more likely to experience symptoms related to
      poor cardiac output.

      Recent studies have shown clinical benefits of pacing from sites of late intrinsic activation
      or intra-ventricular conduction delays (IVCD). Some studies have utilized the intrinsic
      SENSED IVCD method while others used the right ventricle (RV)-PACED IVCD. There have not been
      any studies to date that compare both methods to determine if one may yield a better clinical
      outcome with lower non-responder rates.

      This study predicts that the RV paced IVCD method will provide better clinical outcomes than
      the longest RV sensed IVCD as determined by the clinical composite score.

      The study is a prospective double blind study with an additional cross-over group consisting
      only of non-responders to compare the clinical response in 72 patients receiving CRT therapy.
      After successful CRT-D implantation and before hospital discharge patients will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 fashion to Group 1 (SENSED) or Group 2 (PACED). The patient will complete a
      Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, compare echocardiographic data and be
      assessed by a blinded nurse and physician prior to discharge and at each follow up visit to
      maintain the double blind design.

      After 3 months of follow-up, non-responders from each group will be crossed-over to the other
      group and followed for an additional 3 months. Clinical data will be collected at the end of
      that 3 months and compared looking at changes in symptoms, ejection fraction (EF) and other
      echocardiographic measurements, New York Heart Assocation Function Class ( NYHA) class,
      clinical composite scores (CCC), device interrogation data and hospital admissions between
      the two groups to see if there is a statistical difference.
