      The objectives of this research study are to screen 750 pregnant women at risk of
      trauma-related stress symptoms, and adapt and test an evidence-based intervention for
      pregnant women with PTSD and sub-threshold PTSD symptoms served by two public payer community
      health centers.

      Studies of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in pregnant women in public payer settings
      have shown rates 5 or more times that of other populations, and rates as high as 33% of
      lifetime PTSD sub-threshold symptoms. PTSD during pregnancy has been linked to poor prenatal
      care and high risk behaviors such as drug and alcohol use and smoking. Further, PTSD may pose
      a barrier to care as obstetric procedures and pregnancy may trigger PTSD symptoms and
      avoidance of care. PTSD is also associated with pregnancy and birth complications and
      negative postpartum outcomes including excessive weight gain, preterm birth, low birth
      weight, risk for parenting problems, and increased barriers to breastfeeding. However,
      screening, identification, and support for PTSD is lacking. This study will screen 750
      pregnant women at risk of trauma-related stress symptoms, and adapt and test an
      evidence-based intervention for pregnant women with PTSD and sub-threshold PTSD symptoms
      served by two public payer community health centers.
