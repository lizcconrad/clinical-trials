  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics and clinical
      activity of RRx-001 administered in combination with irinotecan.

      RRx-001 is associated with resensitization to irinotecan in tumors that are previously
      refractory. This effect has been attributed to the ability of RRx-001 to restore the
      expression of aberrantly silenced genes, thus re-establishing pathway functions. However,
      resensitization may have more than one mechanism, among them Pgp pump inhibition and vascular
      modulation, leading to improved penetration of standard chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This dose escalation study consists of 4 sequential dose cohorts each administered RRx-001 in
      increasing dose volumes with a fixed dose irinotecan. After the first 3 subjects of each
      cohort complete Cycle 1, the safety will be assessed before moving to the next dose level.
      Subjects in the current cohort will continue treatment immediately following the completion
      of Cycle 1, for as long as therapy is tolerated and the RECIST v.1.1 definition of
      progression is not met.
