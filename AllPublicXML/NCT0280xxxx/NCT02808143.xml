    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (the effect of drug on tumor) and the
      tolerability (the effect of drug on the body) of pembrolizumab, when given as a single agent
      in patients with bladder tumors. Another purpose of the study is to see what tumor
      characteristics are associated with increased efficacy of the pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) is an antibody (a human protein that sticks to a part of the tumor and/or immune
      cells) designed to allow the body's immune system to work against tumor cells. Pembrolizumab
      is Food and drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma (a type
      of skin cancer) and some types of lung cancer. It is not yet approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for bladder cancer, hence it is considered an
      investigational agent for this disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the study drug (pembrolizumab [MK-3475])
      when administered intravesically in combination with BCG in patients with high risk or
      BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (up to the individual maximum tolerated
      dose of each drug alone).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MK-3475 in combination with BCG in this
      population.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of MK-3475 and BCG in subjects
      with high risk or BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK-3475 in both blood and urine when
      administered intravesically in combination with BCG.

      II. To measure humoral and cellular responses to tumor antigens on serum and urine samples by
      measuring the levels of cytokines (ie, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18,
      interferon gamma [IFN-gamma] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) and peripheral
      blood lymphocyte phenotype throughout treatment.

      III. To determine the response rate in terms of complete pathologic response in this
      population assessed when patient undergoes cystoscopies (weeks 17, 25, 33, 41, and 49 if
      applicable).

      IV. To document the progression rate associated with the combination of intravesical MK-3475
      and BCG in patients with high risk or BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

      V. To evaluate the relationship between tumor biomarkers programmed cell death (PD)-ligand
      (L)1, PD-L2, PD-1 as defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and adverse effects and recurrence
      rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab.

      PRE-INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravesically once on day -14.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive BCG solution intravesically once weekly for 6 weeks at
      weeks 0-5 and pembrolizumab intravesically every 2 weeks at weeks 0, 2, and 4.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Beginning 2 weeks after the last dose of BCG solution, patients receive
      pembrolizumab intravesically every 2 weeks for 12 weeks at weeks 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 for
      a total of 6 doses. Patients then receive pembrolizumab intravesically every 4 weeks at weeks
      21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, and 49 for a total of 8 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

          -  Patients with an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the
             past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (eg. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment

          -  Patients with a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a
             syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents; subjects with
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule;
             subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections
             would not be excluded from the study; subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone
             replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study

          -  Patients with history of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious
             pneumonitis are not eligible

               -  NOTE: history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is
                  permitted

          -  Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to IFNs,
             IL-2) within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to
             study registration are not eligible

          -  Patients who received prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2,
             anti-CD137, or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody
             (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell
             co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways) are not eligible

          -  Patients who have a history of prior malignancy are not eligible; please NOTE the
             following exceptions when patient has undergone potentially curative therapy with no
             evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since initiation of that therapy

               -  Basal cell carcinoma of the skin

               -  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
