  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the prophylactic effect of exogenous L-CARNOSINE in Oxaliplatin induced
      peripheral neuropathy, Thus half of the patients will receive L-CARNOSINE with Oxaliplatin
      and the other half will not receive L-CARNOSINE with their chemotherapy (oxaliplatin),And
      then neuropathy together with some oxidative stress markers will be assessed at the end of
      treatment duration (three months) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin causes peripheral neuropathy , L-CARNOSINE is supposed to prevent this side
      effect possibly by reducing oxidative stress and enhancing the growth of nerves.This study is
      intended to clarify the effect and mechanism of action of L-CARNOSINE in preventing
      Oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients.

      Blood samples will be collected from the patients before starting the chemotherapy and at the
      end of treatment duration (3 months) and then oxidative stress markers will be measured in
      these samples
