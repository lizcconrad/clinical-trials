  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cis-9-cetylmyristoleate (CMO) is a naturally occurring fatty acid complex (FAC).
      Nutraceuticals containing CMO are used to improve knee pain despite the lack of
      placebo-controlled studies in humans. The aim of the double-blind controlled clinical trial
      is to explore the minimal effective dose of CMO for relieving knee joint pain.

      Methods: Twenty-eight subjects, who are clinically or radiologically diagnosed as having mild
      degree arthritic knee joint pain, are randomized into 3 groups; Groups A, B, C that contained
      100%, 80%, and 62.4% of fatty acid component with 12.5% of Cis-9-cetylmyristoleate (CMO), and
      control Group D (starch 100%). The pain intensity, functional disability state and change in
      the general status were assessed for a 12-week ingestion period.
