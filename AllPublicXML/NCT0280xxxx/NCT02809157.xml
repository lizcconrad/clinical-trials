    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a very common cause of heart failure affecting millions of
      people worldwide, which is caused by build-up of plaque inside arteries of the heart.
      Build-up of plaque eventually impacts the blood supply to the heart. In medicine, techniques
      (invasive or non-invasive) such as coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, computed
      tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and transthoracic
      echocardiography can be used to diagnose CAD.

      The investigators aim to study Coronary Artery Disease significance with the combination of
      computed tomography angiography (CTA), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. CTA is
      a non-invasive technique to visualize arterial vessels, which uses computer-processed x-rays.
      Computational Fluid Dynamics employs digital computers and numerical methods to solve complex
      flow patterns inside arterial vessels. Combining these two methods, the investigators are
      able to provide detailed blood flow information and mechanical stress distributions on the
      vessels. This study therefore, aims to propose a non-invasive methodology to assess the
      significance of CAD.

      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Singapore, and accounts for 31.9% of
      all deaths in 2010. Coronary vascular dysfunction has been linked to the development of
      cardiovascular-related events, such as death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and unstable
      angina. Recently, impaired coronary vaso-motion has been suggested as an independent
      predictor of poor prognosis, which can predict cardiovascular events in patients with
      epicardial Coronary Artery Disease . Coronary vaso-motion refers to the change in diameter of
      a coronary vessel in response to vasoactive agent, which is measured via quantitative
      coronary angiography (QCA). Better coronary vaso-motion response has been associated with
      improved survival for both obstructive and non-obstructive CAD.

      Another widely used invasive clinical imaging technology to assess CAD is intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS), which uses ultrasound technology for imaging the endothelium of vessels.
      Since detailed histological information of plaques on the endothelium of coronary arteries
      can be provided by IVUS, it is used as gold standard in evaluating progression or regression
      of plaque.

      Although coronary vaso-motion, FFR and IVUS have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and
      procedural cost-efficiency in terms of guiding percutaneous interventions, they are invasive
      procedures. Non-invasive option for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia is required to
      relief the patients' pain and medical cost due to the invasive cath. This study aims to fill
      in the gap. The investigators hypothesize that non-invasive FFRCT can be obtained by
      combining CT images and CFD methods, which can be used to assess the physiologic significance
      of CAD.
