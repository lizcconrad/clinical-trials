  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ceftaroline is a piece of new cephalosporin very active on resistant staphylococci in
      methicillin (SEMR: Staphylococcus Epidermidis Resistant in Methicillin, SMAR: Staphylococcus
      Aureus Resistant in Methicillin)and/or in vancomycin ; Ceftaroline is also very active on
      pneumococci resistant in penicillin and/or 3rd generation of cephalosporins.

      Ceftaroline was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of complicated
      skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.

      Scientific literature describes a good efficiency in septicemy and/or SAMR endocarditis.

      Besides, a study on animal shows the efficiency of ceftaroline in meningeal infections with
      gram-negative Bacilli.

      The rationale of this study is based on the antibacterial spectra of ceftaroline that could
      be used for the antibacterial treatment (curative and prophylactic) of CSF shunt associated
      infections.

      To validate this hypothesis, it is necessary to evaluate the concentration of ceftaroline in
      meningeal compartment after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (≥ 18 years)

               -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential may be entered if pregnancy testing is
                  negative and the patient agrees to abstain from procreational sexual intercourse
                  or must use double-barrier contraceptive measures for the duration of the study

          -  Presence of an indwelling external cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) access device
             (ventriculostomy or lumbar drain)

          -  Presence of inflamed meninges as a result of documented or suspected meningitis or
             ventriculitis. Patients with both clinical symptoms (fever, headache, meningismus, and
             altered mentation) and laboratory parameters (CSF leukocytosis, defined as a CSF white
             blood cell count [WBC] of &gt;10 3, elevated CSF protein, defined as CSF protein of
             &gt;1g/l, reduced CSF glucose, defined as CSF glucose of &lt;0.3g/l, or a positive CSF Gram
             stain or culture) indicative of CNS infection were deemed to have definitive bacterial
             meningitis/ventriculitis. Inflamed meninges were defined as the presence of &gt;5
             leukocytes/mm3 of CSF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has documented history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction (urticaria,
             angiooedema, anaphylaxis, desquamative rash) to any β-lactam antimicrobial including
             cephalosporins (contraindication to cephalosporins)

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating and intends to continue breastfeeding

          -  Severe renal insufficiency defined as creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min.

          -  Patients with conditions known or suspected to alter pharmacokinetics (i.e., burn or
             cystic fibrosis patients)

          -  Refusal to participate

          -  Person not affiliated with the social security
