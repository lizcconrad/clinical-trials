      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether autologous fat grafting is safe and/or
      effective to prevent expanded skin from expansion failure.

      The repair of skin defects is a common problem for reconstructive surgeons.Soft tissue
      expansion is a widely used technique for the repair of skin defects. Early expansion-related
      complications such as skin thinning, telangiectasia, and striae may result in expansion
      failure and ultimately jeopardize final outcome. In the past years, discontinuation of the
      expansion procedure was the only therapeutic option, when early alarm signs such as
      semitransparent appearance and telangiectasia of the expanded skin were encountered. We aimed
      to overcome these complications by therapeutic fat grafting to prevent skin necrosis and
      enable continuation of the expansion procedure.

      Patients undergoing soft tissue expansion treatment for resurfacing skin lesions including
      scars and nevi that required therapeutic intervention due to early complication signs were
      included in this study. Patients were randomly divided into treatment group using autologous
      fat grafting and control group with discontinued expansion and expectant management. The
      treatment group received autologous fat transfer to the expanded skin.
