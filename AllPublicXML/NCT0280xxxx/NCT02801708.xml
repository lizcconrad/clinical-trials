      The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of continuous 7-day Holter ECG for
      detecting covert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with recent embolic stroke or
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) of undetermined cause after completion of a standard clinical
      work up including an initial 24-hour Holter monitoring.

    <textblock>
      Covert atrial fibrillation (AF) is a relevant potential cause of a recently proposed clinical
      construct, &quot;Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS)&quot;. However, routine post-stroke work
      up including 24-hour Holter monitoring may fail to detect paroxysmal AF. A recent systematic
      review has shown an increased AF detection rate with longer monitoring durations. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ambulatory 7-day Holter ECG (EV-201,
      Parama-Tech inc.) for detecting AF in patients with recent ESUS after completion of a
      standard clinical examination.
