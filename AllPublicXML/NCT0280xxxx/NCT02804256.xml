  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Heart Centre Singapore has recently created a biorepository that is IRB approved
      for the use in genetic studies: &quot;molecular and imaging studies of cardiovascular health and
      disease (CIRB Ref: 2013/605/C)&quot;. This repository enables IRB approved projects within the
      National Heart Centre Singapore to access the samples for use in biomarker or genetic studies
      with consent from patients for these studies. The IRB approved biorepository process also
      allows for patients, when they have consented to this, to be approached for inclusion in
      additional studies at National Heart Centre Singapore.

      In this study, the investigators will examine the genetic variation in genes known to cause
      inherited cardiac conditions and also look for circulating biomarkers (ICC) in 600 patients
      with ICC and in 500 patients with ischemic heart disease (e.g.IHD) who will be used as
      controls. Healthy controls will also be used (800) as they become available in the
      biorepository. All samples have already been collected in the NHCS biorepository.

      These patients would have been recruited and consented to the biorepository. This will enable
      all to better understand heart disease in Singaporean patients. In addition, the
      investigators will invite a subset of 10 patients with ICCs to provide a second blood sample
      (20mls - 2 tablespoons) on top of the samples that will be collected for the biorepository.
      The second blood sample will be used for antibody biomarkers that will be developed in the
      basic science laboratories. These antibodies will be used to develop new biomarkers of human
      heart disease to improve human health.

      In young adults and children inherited cardiac conditions (ICCs) that affect cardiac
      structure and electrical activity, account for most cases of sudden cardiac death. Of the
      ICCs, SCD due to Brugada Syndrome is particularly prevalent in SE Asia where it causes early
      loss of life in young men. While there have been major advances in the treatment of coronary
      artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF) and acute MI, it remains very difficult to identify
      individuals at risk of SCD due to ICCs even when these diseases run in families and/or the
      mutation is known. This, in large part, relates to our limited understanding of the effects
      of gene mutations on clinical phenotypes due to variation in mutation penetrance and
      expressivity. In Singapore, and SE Asia in general, the issue of mutation interpretation is
      very difficult, if not impossible, as population-specific variant annotation is limited or
      completely absent for the common ICC genes. In addition, while DNA variants are important
      other protein biomarkers in the heart and in the vessels may be equally important, and these
      remain completely unaddressed in all populations.The investigatorswill address these issue in
      cases and controls using advanced sequencing and informatics approaches and by generating
      novel antibody libraries using patient samples.

      Overall, the research performed in this study will find new ways of diagnosing patients at
      risk of sudden death both in the hospital environment and also in the general population.
      This will enable effective screening and stratification of patients at risk of sudden death
      due to inherited causes or following myocardial infarction.
