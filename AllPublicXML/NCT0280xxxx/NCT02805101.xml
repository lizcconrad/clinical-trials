  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study aimed to compare two materials: (1) Biodentine and (2) MTA. These two
      materials are going to be tested in sealing accidental root perforations at the bifurcation
      areas. The study is going to be conducted as a randomized controlled trial.
