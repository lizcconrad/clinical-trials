        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Knee pain in at least one knee for more than half the days in the month prior to
             screening

          2. X-rays showing evidence of knee osteoarthritis by Kellgren and Lawrence Score two or
             three, with definite osteophytes and possible or definite joint space narrowing,
             consistent with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. If both knees are affected,
             patients would choose the more severe knee for outcomes assessments.

          3. Willingness to maintain stable analgesic regimen throughout the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia

          2. Presence of an underlying inflammatory disease in the affected knee, including
             Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Gout, Pseudogout, or other inflammatory
             disease.

          3. Patients who cannot give consent will be excluded, as will patients who cannot speak,
             read and understand English, as we will not have translated documents, consent forms,
             and surveys for them.

          4. While this supplement is considered very safe and low risk, patients with underlying
             significant cytopenia (white blood cell count less than 4.0, hemoglobin less than 10,
             or platelets less than 100), or with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration
             rate less than 60) or elevated liver enzymes will be excluded as well.
