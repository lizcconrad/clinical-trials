      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Design Study of CERC-501 in a Human
      Laboratory Model of Stress-precipitated Smoking Behavior.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in subjects who are heavy cigarette smokers currently not seeking
      treatment for tobacco use disorder.

      The study is a crossover design study (within-subject analysis), which allows for subjects to
      be their own control.

      Each period of the crossover consists of a 7-day out-patient treatment period followed by a
      single out-patient testing day on Day 8. Subjects will participate in a laboratory session
      following the McKee Stress-Smoking Lapse Test. Upon completion, subjects will undergo a 7 day
      washout period followed by the second period of the crossover design and a 7-day follow-up
      visit.
