  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the success of US guided peripheral IV
      placement between single vs dual-operator technique among a convenience sample of patients
      with moderate or difficult vascular access in a tertiary care Emergency Department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaining intravenous (IV) access is a common and important procedure in the emergency
      department (ED). IV access is needed to deliver drugs, enable fluid resuscitation and sample
      blood, and delays in gaining access can lead to patient harm. Ultrasound (US) is a commonly
      used tool in the ED, and the utility of ultrasound in the placement of IVs in patients with
      difficult access has been well described. This study aims to further guide the use of this
      evidence based tool by ED Registered Nurses. The focus will be comparing single-operator
      technique, in which the same provider manipulates the ultrasound probe while simultaneously
      placing the IV, to a dual-operator technique whereby a second provider manipulates the probe.
      Any measured advantage has implications in guiding education and practice, as well as
      informing future ED policy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (18 years and older) patients predicted to require intravenous cannulas and
             identified at triage as having moderate or difficult access based on the following
             criteria:

        Moderate: peripheral vein is visible or palpable but difficulty is expected based on
        patient characteristics both clinical and historical.

        Difficult: No peripheral veins visible or palpable, or two failed attempts by traditional
        landmarking (LM).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include patients who have already undergone successful
             pre-hospital IV placement, patients with an indwelling vascular device, patients who
             are critically ill (Canadian Triage Acuity Score I) or objection to study enrolment by
             the attending MD for any reason. If no suitable target vein can be identified with US
             the patient data will be collected and the patient will be excluded from the
             statistical analysis.
