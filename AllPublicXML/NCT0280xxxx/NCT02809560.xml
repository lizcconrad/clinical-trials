  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects about 10% of children and 6% of adults in industrialized countries.
      Lymphocytes (L) Th2, a T cell population (LT) producing interleukin (IL) -4, 5 and 13 are
      broadly involved in this pathology in experimental models and in humans. Many studies show
      that the signaling pathways activated by the commitment of T receiver differ depending LT.
      The identification of specific signaling pathways links to Th2 offer new therapeutic
      approaches. Precedent study showed that mouse Th2 selectively expressed related to calcium
      channels sensitive channels Cav1 voltage, normally found in excitable cells where they are
      defined as receivers dihydropyridine (DHP).

      The goal of the present study is to show the presence of Cav1 channels in inflammatory cells
      in allergic asthmatics and show overexpression of these channels in the peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells from asthmatic subjects before and / or after stimulation with the TCR in
      comparison with controls.
