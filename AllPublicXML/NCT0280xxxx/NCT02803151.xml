  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymph node metastasis is one of the most common sites to develop disease recurrence or
      progression after initial local treatment for primary solid malignancies or systemic
      treatment for advanced metastases. No specific treatment modality has been established as the
      standard therapy. Systemic therapy is usually considered since lymphadenopathy is considered
      as a sign of disease dissemination though aggressive local treatment, including surgical
      lymphoadenectomy or radical radiotherapy might result in long-term survival in selected
      patients. The concept of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), a high dose of radiation
      targeted to a pathological entity and delivered in a few fractions, has proven so successful
      at treating both benign and malignant lesions that it changed the paradigm for radiation
      therapy. The radiobiology of SABR has been shown to be very favorable for tumor control.
      Clinical experiences suggested that SABR might offer excellent in-field tumor control with
      low toxicity profile in selected patients, although the majority of reports are retrospective
      and include small patients series with heterogeneous tumor sites and dose-fractionation
      schedules.

      At present, there is lack of validated prognostic factors to identify the patients who might
      benefit most from ablative local therapy for metastatic lymph node(s). The mechanism of
      effect of SABR on the cancer lesions is not yet clear. Apart from its direct effect on
      clonogenic cancer cells, an immune-mediated process was also hypothesized. Therefore, the
      present study is aimed to provide a better understanding about utilization of SABR for
      metastatic lymph node(s). The associated translational researches will also advance our
      knowledge in the immune system reactions to SABR.

      This is a single institutional, single-arm, phase II trial to assess the local control rate
      of oligo-metastatic or oligo-progressive lymph node treated by stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy at 1 year.

      Patients with pathologically proven non-hematopoietic malignancy patients with radiographic
      evidence of evaluable regional recurrent, oligo-metastatic or oligo-progressive lymph nodes
      are eligible for enrolment.

      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy:

      The lymph node planning target volume (PTV) will receive the prescribed dose according to the
      assigned treatment group. The dose is prescribed such as 90-95% of PTV is covered by the
      prescription dose. If the critical structures exceed the defined dose limitation, a dose
      reduction method is applied as protocol defined. Dose inhomogeneity can exist within the
      clinical target volume (CTV).

      Treatment will be delivered in six fractions to the target volume and given once per day, 2-3
      fractions per week with no more than 2 daily consecutive fractions, over 2 to 2.5 weeks.

      Target Radiation Dose: SABR with 45 Gy in six fractions to the defined target volume with met
      organ-at-risk constraint criteria using intensity modulated radiotherapy or volumetric
      modulated arc therapy (VMAT or RapidArc).

      Radiation Dose Reduction:

      Reduced Dose 10%: SABR with 40.05 Gy in six fractions to the defined target volume with met
      organ-at-risk constraint criteria

      Reduced Dose 20%: SABR with 36 Gy in six fractions to the defined target volume with met
      organ-at-risk constraint criteria
