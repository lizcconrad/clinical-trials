  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated whether vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism is altered in primary
      open-angle glaucoma subjects carrying the risk allele.Primary open-angle glaucoma patients
      and age-matched people in the Han population were enrolled. Vitamin D receptor polymorphic
      analysis was studied by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
      technique.
