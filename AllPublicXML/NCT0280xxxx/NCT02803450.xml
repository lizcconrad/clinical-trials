      This prospective, randomized, single blinded control trial will investigate the effects of
      epidural loading with a high volume, low concentration local anesthetic solution via the
      epidural needle versus the epidural catheter. Control patients will receive local anesthetic
      in lower volume more concentrated solution via the epidural catheter which is current
      standard practice. Outcome measures will include quantifying pain relief with respect to time
      using VAS scores. In addition, post delivery patient satisfaction regarding anesthesia
      regimen, blood pressure changes, heart rate, anesthetic level, total dose of epidural used
      during labor, rescue doses and incidence of fetal bradycardia will be assessed. 35 patients
      will be recruited for each of the three arms of the study, totaling 105 patients, in order to
      obtain significance when performing statistical analyses following complete enrollment in the
      study. The impetus of this study involves investigation of the effects of loading the
      epidural space with high volume, low concentration local anesthetic via two different
      modalities and studying which method is more efficacious.

    <description>Epidural loading: Participants will receive 20ml of 0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 1mcg/ml epidural loading dose in 10ml increments five minutes apart via epidural needle followed by catheter placement.
For continuous infusions: The continuous patient controlled epidural anesthesia (PCEA) pump will contain 0.03125% bupivacaine with 1mcg/ml fentanyl. The infusion rate will be set at 20ml/hr basal rate and 8ml every 15 minutes on demand with lockout of 52ml/hr.
For inadequate analgesia: One additional 10ml boluses of the experimental 0.0625% bupivacaine with 1mcg/ml will be provided spaced 5 minutes apart via the epidural catheter.</description>
