      INcheon-Bucheon cohorT of patients undERgoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for
      acute ST-ELevation myocardiaL infARction (INTERSTELLAR) registry is a retrospective,
      observational, 4-regional-hospital based registry reflecting current practices of management,
      risk factors, and clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at cities of
      Incheon and Bucheon located in the mid-western part of the Korean peninsula between 2007 and
      2014. Diagnosis of acute STEMI was based on clinical data findings including typical
      symptoms, 12-lead electrocardiography, and blood test. Decisions regarding primary PCI were
      made by at least 2 attending cardiologists at the time of presentation.

      Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, laboratory data and clinical follow-up data
      were collected. Baseline blood test was obtained and recorded as part of the routine care for
      patients who visited the emergency room for chest pain and in whom acute coronary syndrome
      was suspected. Standard medical management was provided by responsible physicians.
