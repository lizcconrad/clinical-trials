    <measure>CLUE Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>CLUE Handling is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Performance (LogMar)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Distance time controlled Visual Performance (LogMAR) was assessed for each subject eye under bright-illumination high-contrast lighting conditions at 4m using an ETDRS chart. The average visual performance (LogMAR) was reported for each study lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Acceptable Mechanical Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanical lens fit will be assessed for each subject and eye using a slit lamp. Lens fit is a binary response and 'Yes' = Acceptable Fit and 'No' = Unacceptable Fit. Lens fit is assessed using Lens centration, limbal exposure, primary gaze movement, up-gaze movement, edge lift, lens tightness. Unacceptable fit will be declared if there is any of the following present: limbal exposure, edge lift, excessive movement in primary or up-gaze or insufficient movement in primary gaze and up-gaze. The Percentage of subject eyes with acceptable lens fit will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Acceptable Cosmetic Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes Post Insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmetic lens fitting is assessed for each subject eye in the primary gaze position without a slit lamp. Cosmetic lens fit is a binary response and is reported as acceptable or unacceptable. The Percentage of subject eyes with acceptable cosmetic lens fitting is reported.</description>

        <description>CLUE Handling is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

        <description>Mechanical lens fit will be assessed for each subject and eye using a slit lamp. Lens fit is a binary response and 'Yes' = Acceptable Fit and 'No' = Unacceptable Fit. Lens fit is assessed using Lens centration, limbal exposure, primary gaze movement, up-gaze movement, edge lift, lens tightness. Unacceptable fit will be declared if there is any of the following present: limbal exposure, edge lift, excessive movement in primary or up-gaze or insufficient movement in primary gaze and up-gaze. The Percentage of subject eyes with acceptable lens fit will be reported.</description>
