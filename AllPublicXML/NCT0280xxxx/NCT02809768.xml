    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of concomitant administration with
      fluconazole, itraconazole, and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single 20-mg dose
      of avatrombopag in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, open-label, drug-drug interaction study in healthy
      participants. The study will consist of 3 parts: In Part A, the effects of steady-state
      dosing of a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A (fluconazole) on the single-dose PK of
      avatrombopag will be assessed. In Part B, the effects of steady-state dosing of a strong
      CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed. In
      Part C, the effects of steady-state dosing of a strong CYP3A and moderate CYP2C9 inducer
      (rifampin) on the single-dose PK of avatrombopag will be assessed.

      Each Part of the study will consist of 2 phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment
      Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline Period 1.The Treatment Phase will
      consist of 2 treatment periods: Treatment Period 1 (administration of a single oral dose of
      avatrombopag 20 mg alone under fed conditions); and Treatment Period 2 (administration of
      oral doses of each inhibitor or inducer alone and concomitant administration of a single oral
      dose of avatrombopag 20 mg with each inhibitor or inducer [fluconazole in Part A,
      itraconazole in Part B, or rifampin in Part C] under fed conditions).

             their medical history (e.g., history of splenectomy); history of arterial or venous
             thrombosis, including partial or complete thromboses (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic
             attack, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism); known family
             history of hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g., Factor V Leiden, antithrombin III
             deficiency).

          3. Hemoglobin less than lower limit of normal at Screening and Baseline Period 1.

          4. Liver functions tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], or
             total bilirubin) greater than the upper limit of normal Screening and Baseline Period
             1.

          5. Any history of gastrointestinal surgery that may affect the pharmacokinetics (PK)
             profiles of avatrombopag (e.g., hepatectomy, nephrectomy, cholecystectomy or digestive
             organ resection) at Screening.
