  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer
      using a biomatrix (The Gore Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20
      million cells. 15 adult patients (age 18 and greater) with persistent symptomatic
      post-surgical gastrointestinal leaks despite current standard radiologic and endoscopic
      therapies will be enrolled. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response
      and closure for 18 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used
      only for the same patient.

      Visit 1: Patients will be evaluated for eligibility (inclusion/exclusion checklist) and
      written, informed consent will be obtained. Patients will undergo general exam with vital
      signs. Patients will be scheduled for a fat biopsy to collect the tissue needed to grow MSC.
      In the event there is no cell growth from the tissue obtained from the first biopsy, one
      further attempt will made from a second tissue sample from this patient. However, if the
      second attempt fails to grow cells, no further attempts will be made, and the subject will
      not continue in the study.

      Visit 2 (Week 0; Day 0): Patients will undergo an interventional endoscopy, the fistula tract
      will be assessed and the stem cell coated will be placed endoscopically.

      Study visit will be as follows:

      Visit 3 (Week 0; Day 1) Visit 4 (Week 2; Month 1) Visit 5 (Week 4; Month 1) Visit 6 (Week 8;
      Month 2) Visit 7 (Week 12; Month 3) Visit 8 (Week 24; Month 6) Visit 9 (week 52; Month 12)
      Visit 10 (Week 78; Month 18)

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females 18-75 years of age.

          2. Residents of the United States.

          3. Patients with persistent symptomatic fistulas arising after gastro-esophageal
             resections, enteric or colonic resections or Bariatric surgeries.

          4. Single-tract fistula

          5. Have no contraindications to imaging evaluations: e.g. contrast allergies

          6. Ability to comply with protocol

          7. Competent and able to provide written informed consent

          8. Must have failed standard conservative therapy which includes at least one endoscopic
             attempt to resolve fistula. Standard conservative management includes drainage of
             sepsis, antibiotics, nutritional support, etc. Endoscopic closure attempt with devices
             such as, but not limited to; endo-stitch, clipping, surgical sealants, etc. This
             attempt may be with or without diversion of the luminal contents by stenting.

             of MSCs: e.g. myocardial infarction, active angina, congestive heart failure or other
             conditions that would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of
             the patient.
