  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before this study, there will be an open-label, dose-escalation pilot study with a total of
      30 participants with 10 per dosage group. The aim of the pilot study is to explore the
      preliminary safety of an experimental recombinant staphylococcus aureus vaccine.

      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo control, dose-escalation phase 1 clinical
      trial. This study will determine the safety and side-effect profile, and immunogenicity of an
      experimental recombinant staphylococcus aureus vaccine. The study will be carried out
      following a dose-escalation method from the low dosage to the high dosage, i.e. the higher
      dosage vaccine could only be administrated after the first seven-day safety of the lower
      dosage vaccine is confirmed after safety observation.

             product in the last 30 days.

          -  Woman who is breast-feeding.

          -  Prior administration of attenuated vaccine in last 28 days.

          -  Prior administration of subunit vaccine, inactivated vaccine or allergic therapy in
             last 14 days.

          -  Current anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis or therapy

          -  Any other conditions may compromise the safety or availability of participants in the
             judgment of the investigator.

        Following Immunization exclusion standard:

          -  Any grade 3 or more serious adverse reaction happen since the last vaccination.

          -  Other condition violates the inclusion criteria or meets the exclusion criteria is
             noticed after the first immunization.

          -  Acute or chronic infections at the vaccination day (axillary temperature＞37.0°C).

          -  According to the investigator, the participant should not continue participating in
             the study.
