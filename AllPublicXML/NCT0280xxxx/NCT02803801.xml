      This pilot project is a cooperative effort between the Leisure in Fun Environments (LIFE)
      Program and the Specialized Communication Resources for Children (SCRC) Program at the
      Rehabilitation Centre for Children (RCC). The investigators will blend and enhance two
      pre-existing programs in order to provide a new, specialized program for parents of children
      with ASD or developmental delay. The two programs that will be blended together are
      &quot;Promoting Flexible Thinking and Interaction with Your Child at Home&quot; and &quot;Saturday Cooking
      Club.&quot; This new program will be a series of ten workshops that alternates between &quot;parents
      only&quot; learning sessions and practical &quot;cooking club&quot; sessions that allow parents to focus on
      practicing what they are learning with their child. These programs are based on the
      principles of Relationship Development Intervention (RDIÂ®), which focuses on providing
      opportunities to establish a guided participation relationship, which will lead to
      development of dynamic intelligence and important social thinking abilities. The program is
      individualized to each child and builds on the principles of typical development to assist
      the child in achieving social competence. Using this program, children are expected to
      develop sociability in a naturally progressing order of complexity.

      Parenting children with developmental disabilities or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can be
      challenging. Often, these children process information in an atypical manner and they may
      struggle to learn through social engagement. At times, regular parenting techniques do not
      work with these children, which may leave parents feeling distressed and confused. In their
      ground breaking interpretation of the International Classification of Functioning, Health and
      Disability (ICF), The 'F-words' in childhood disability, (2011) Dr. P. Rosenbaum and Dr. J.
      Gorter state that, &quot;Family represents the essential environment of all children.&quot; They point
      to research that confirms that parental physical and mental health is challenged in families
      who have a child with a disability. Specifically, behavioural issues of these children
      significantly contribute to parental stress scores, impact attachment, the relationship with
      a spouse, parental depression and in particular, a sense of competence. By providing parents
      the opportunity to understand their child's unique learning style, and the opportunity to
      learn how to mindfully engage their child, it is the investigators' goal to restore parental
      competence and the natural parent/child relationship.

      The objectives of this new learning series program are to help parents understand their
      child's unique learning style and to give parents the practical tools to become their child's
      best teacher and guide. Becoming a mindful parent requires a solid understanding of the
      child's underlying social learning challenges, and it requires parents to be both
      self-reflective and analytical. Behaviour change takes time and repeated experience. Parents
      also need the opportunity to practice in a safe and supportive environment. This learning
      series will consist of ten in-person sessions, over a period of 12-14 weeks.
