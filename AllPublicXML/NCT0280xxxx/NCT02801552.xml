    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical effect of regenerative endodontic procedure using PRF in
      immature permanent teeth with apical periodontitis. Half of participants will receive the PRF
      instead of blood clots in the regenerative endodontic procedure, while the other half will
      receive a blood clots in the regenerative endodontic procedure.

    <textblock>
      The conventional method of regenerative endodontic procedure using a blood clot as scaffold
      materials has shown successful results. However, it is very difficult to induce bleeding and
      place mineral trioxide aggregate over a blood clot. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), a
      second-generation platelet concentrate. PRF is a matrix of autologous fibrin containing a
      large quantity of platelets, growth factors and leukocytes. PRF preparation technique is very
      simple, inexpensive and doesn't require any chemical agents. The purpose of this study is to
      test the hypothesis that the use of PRF in regenerative endodontic procedure of immature
      permanent teeth with apical periodontitis will accelerate periapical bone healing and
      stimulate the root maturation.

The blood sample is centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min. The prepared PRF membrane is cut into segments, the fragments are placed into the canal space. The coronal is sealed mineral trioxide aggregate and composite resin.</description>
