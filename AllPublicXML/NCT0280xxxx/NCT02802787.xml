      Implementation and Evaluation of an Activity Based Program to Improve Quality of Life, Pain
      and Fatigue Outcomes in Women Diagnosed With Cancer. Demonstrate improved life satisfaction,
      decreased pain and decreased fatigue (with evidenced gathered at three consecutive periods
      Quality of Life, Pain and Fatigue surveys).

      This research study will focus on developing and implementing two one-week activity camps in
      the summer of 2016 for women diagnosed with cancer. One camp will be held in West
      Philadelphia and another in Camden, New Jersey, both of which have been identified as
      underserved areas for health access. The focus of this programming is to allow women to
      engage in activities they may not be engaged in since the diagnosis of cancer and to provide
      them with opportunities to socially interact and communicate with individuals who may have
      encountered the same difficulties as them. Quality of life, pain and fatigue information will
      be collected before, during and after implementation of the activity program. The main
      objective is to demonstrate improved life satisfaction, decreased pain and decreased fatigue
      (with evidenced gathered at three consecutive periods and geographical locations through
      Quality of Life, Pain and Fatigue surveys). The intended sample size is 57 women.
