  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) management is complex and requires prosthesis replacement
      when symptoms duration is greater than 30 days or debridement with modular set replacement
      when symptoms duration is lesser than one month. Nevertheless, the prolonged suppressive
      antibiotherapy (PSA) is the single treatment we can provide to high risk surgical patients
      and those who refuse reoperation.

      There is limited data available on PSA modality, its tolerance and efficacy, this lack of
      data motivated us to concept a prospective study of long term patient follow up with PJI
      treated with prolonged suppressive antibiotherapy.

      Main objective:

      Quality of life assessment of patients undergoing prolonged suppressive antibiotherapy for
      PJI.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Depressive symptoms assessment in patients undergoing prolonged suppressive
           antibiotherapy for PJI.

        2. Functional assessment in patients undergoing prolonged suppressive antibiotherapy for
           PJI.

        3. Evaluation of PSA side effects

        4. Evaluation of nutritional status

        5. Evaluation of of PSA termination criteria

      Methods:

      The follow up oh this cohort will be conducted using 3 questionaries related to quality of
      life, joint stiffness and depressive symptoms.

      Study type:

      This is a study of health care procedure, evaluating the quality of life of patients
      undergoing prolonged suppressive antibiotherapy for PJI.

      Sample size: all patients cared by our referral center of bone and joint infection, who meet
      protocol selection criteria will be included in the study, thus we are expecting to recruit
      60 patients.

      Study duration: 6 years.

      Recruitment period: 4 years.

      Maximal duration of data collection: 2 years.

      Investigator center: Single center study.

      Mean patient inclusion per year: 15 patients per year.
