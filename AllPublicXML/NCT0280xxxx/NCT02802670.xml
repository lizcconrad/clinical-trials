  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study to determine the excretion kinetics and mass
      balance of GDC-0810, and to determine metabolites present in blood, feces, and urine in
      healthy participants following a single 300-milligram (mg) oral dose of GDC-0810 containing
      approximately 100 microcuries of [14C] labeled GDC-0810 using conventional absorption,
      metabolism, and excretion (AME) methodology. The entire duration of the study is up to
      approximately 8 weeks.
