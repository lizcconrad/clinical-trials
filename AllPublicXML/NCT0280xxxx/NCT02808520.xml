  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to determine the influence of social factors on participation and
      activity among children and adolescents aged 10-18 years with hodgkin-lymphoma. Furthermore
      personal and treatment-related factors and their impact on participation will be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hodgkin-lymphoma is a rare malignancy among children and adolescents (about 140 each year in
      Germany) which is highly curable. Beside this therapeutic success, a lot of therapy-related
      long-term problems arise (e.g. fertility disorders, thyroid diseases, secondary
      malignancies). While most of the studies focused on mental and physical impairments, little
      attention has been drawn to social dimensions of health. Due to the disease and the
      requirements of the therapy, participation of children with hodgkin-lymphoma can be impaired
      acutely or chronically. This can be of serious consequences, because participation in daily
      life is an important component of the development of children and adolescents. To determine
      the influence of social, personal and treatment-related factors on participation, all
      patients who were actual treated in the international therapy study EuroNet-PHL-C2 in all of
      Germany (N ≈ 700) and their parents will be interviewed. Statistical analyses will be done
      using descriptive and multivariate methods taking account of treatment-related issues (e.g.
      stage of disease, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, progression/relapse).
