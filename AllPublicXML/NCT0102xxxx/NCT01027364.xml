  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study were: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFIXFc;
      to evaluate the efficacy of rFIXFc in all treatment arms; to evaluate the effectiveness of
      prophylaxis over on-demand (episodic) therapy by comparing the annualized number of bleeding
      episodes between participants receiving rFIXFc on each prevention (prophylaxis) regimen and
      participants receiving rFIXFc on an episodic regimen. The secondary objectives of the study
      were: to evaluate and assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of rFIXFc and rFIX
      (BeneFIX®) at baseline in the Sequential PK subgroup as well as rFIXFc at Week 26 (±1 week);
      to evaluate participants' response to treatment; to evaluate rFIXFc consumption.

    <description>Number of participants with clinically relevant abnormalities or relevant changes from baseline in temperature, pulse (beats per minute [bpm]), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are presented. Baseline (BL) is defined as the last non-missing evaluable assessment taken prior and closest to the first rFIXFc dose. Because the perioperative management period represents a unique clinical situation, safety data obtained during the surgical/rehabilitation period for participants in Arm 4 were included in listings and reviewed separately. Review of the listing was sufficient to assess this endpoint.</description>

Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>

Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>

Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>

Serious AE (SAE)=AE resulting in death, immediate risk of death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital/anomaly/birth defect, or any other medically important event. Related=related, possibly related, and relationship missing. Data include AEs emergent during the surgical/rehabilitation period; AE data are included in each treatment arm only for the time each participant was enrolled in that arm.</description>

Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>

Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>

        <title>Annualized rFIXFc Consumption Per Participant</title>
        <description>Consumption is calculated for the efficacy period (EP). In Arms 1 and 2, the EP started with date and time of first prophylactic dose following a completed PK sampling period and ended with last dose administered (for prophylaxis or a bleeding episode). In Arm 3, the EP started following last PK sampling timepoint and ended with either date of last contact or date of last entry into the eDiary, whichever was later. The EP was interrupted for the repeat PK period in Arm 1 (sequential PK subgroup) and for all surgical/rehabilitation periods (for both major and minor surgeries) in all 3 arms. Overall units (IU/kg) of annualized rFIXFc consumption = [Total rFIXFc IU/kg received during the EP / number of days in EP]*365.25.</description>

        <description>Annualized bleeding episodes = (number of bleeding episodes/number of days in efficacy period)*365.25. Please see the definition of the efficacy period (EP) in the Outcome Measure 4 Description. The EP was interrupted for the repeat PK period in Arm 1 (sequential PK subgroup) and for all surgical/rehabilitation periods (for both major and minor surgeries) in all 3 arms. A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed, and ended 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleeding, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location, or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, were considered the same bleeding episode. Any bleeding at a different location was a separate bleeding episode regardless of time from the last injection.</description>

        <title>Number of Injections Required for Resolution of a Bleeding Episode by Location of Bleed</title>
        <description>Please see the definition of the efficacy period (EP) in the Outcome Measure 4 Description. The EP was interrupted for the repeat PK period in Arm 1 (sequential PK subgroup) and for all surgical/rehabilitation periods (for both major and minor surgeries) in all 3 arms. A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed, and ended 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleeding, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location, or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, were considered the same bleeding episode. All injections given from the initial sign of a bleed until the last date/time within the bleed window were counted. The resolution of a bleed was defined as no sign of bleeding following injection for the bleed. Bleeding episodes that presented in multiple locations are included as a single event in the overall summary for the number of injections to resolve that bleeding episode but are included in summaries for each location.</description>

The areas covered by this instrument are: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment (all 7 domains, during the last month) and future, family planning, and outlook for the future (all 3 domains, recently). Changes from baseline for the Haem-A-QoL questionnaire are summarized by prestudy treatment regimen (pooled for Arms 1 and 2). Lower scores represent better QoL; therefore, a negative change from baseline represents improvement during the course of the study. Scores on a scale range between 0 and 100.</description>

        <title>Haem-A-QoL Questionnaire for Adults: Change From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL consists of items pertaining to 10 domains specific to living with hemophilia and was administered to adult participants (&gt; 17 years). The areas covered by this instrument are: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment (all 7 domains, during the last month) and future, family planning, and outlook for the future (all 3 domains, recently). Changes from baseline for the Haem-A-QoL questionnaire are summarized by prestudy treatment regimen (pooled for Arms 1 and 2). Lower scores represent better QoL; therefore, a negative change from baseline represents improvement during the course of the study. Scores on a scale range between 0 and 100.</description>

          <title>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index for Children (Haemo-QoL) Questionnaire: Change From Baseline to Week 26 and Week 52</title>
          <description>The Haemo-QoL, a quality of life (QoL) assessment instrument for children and adolescents with hemophilia, was administered to participants from 13- to 17-years-old. This instrument assesses domains specific to living with hemophilia. For the Haemo-QoL, higher scores indicate a worse quality of life. Scores on a scale range between 0 and 100.</description>
          <population>No summary analysis was done for this outcome measure due to the small number of participants completing the questionnaire.</population>

Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>

            <description>Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.
All participants in Arm 1 received 50 IU/kg rFIXFc via intravenous (IV) injection once every 7 days initially, then at a dose indicated by the participant's baseline pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment that ensured a target trough of 1% to 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated. Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.</description>

A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.
All participants in Arm 1 received 50 IU/kg rFIXFc via intravenous (IV) injection once every 7 days initially, then at a dose indicated by the participant's baseline pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment that ensured a target trough of 1% to 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated. Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.</description>

A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.
All participants in Arm 1 received 50 IU/kg rFIXFc via intravenous (IV) injection once every 7 days initially, then at a dose indicated by the participant’s baseline PK assessment that ensured a target trough of 1% to 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated. Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.</description>

            <description>Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.
All participants in Arm 1 received 50 IU/kg rFIXFc via intravenous (IV) injection once every 7 days initially, then at a dose indicated by the participant’s baseline PK assessment that ensured a target trough of 1% to 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated. Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.</description>

Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.</description>
