  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-center pilot trial of term and near term (≥ 36
      weeks gestation) infants with encephalopathy or seizures comparing a &quot;EEG Seizure Treatment
      Group&quot; or ESG with a &quot;Clinical Seizure Treatment Group&quot; or CSG.

      The investigators hypothesize that the accurate detection and treatment of EEG seizures will
      decrease the seizure burden and improve outcomes in newborn infants with seizures and/or
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

      This is a prospective, randomized, pilot trial of term and near term (≥ 36 weeks gestation)
      infants with encephalopathy or seizures comparing a &quot;EEG Seizure Treatment Group&quot; or ESG with
      a &quot;Clinical Seizure Treatment Group&quot; or CSG. Eligibility is based on clinical criteria for
      moderate/severe encephalopathy or seizures. We will recruit near term or term infants (≥ 36
      weeks gestation) with a diagnosis of seizures or encephalopathy admitted to the neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) at St. Louis Children's Hospital within the first 72 hours of
      life. Infants will be randomized into an EEG Seizure Treatment Group (ESG) or a Clinical
      Seizure Treatment Group (CSG) (n=20 in each group). Patients in both groups will have EEG
      monitoring. While treating physicians will have access to EEG data in the ESG, no EEG data in
      the CSG will be available to the clinician for treatment of seizures. AED treatment will be
      initiated/escalated using stringent EEG seizure criteria (EST) or clinical criteria (CST)
      with the goal being seizure cessation. The specific AED, dosage, and duration of treatment is
      standardized in both groups. Monitoring will continue for a period of upto 96 hours in both
      arms. Other than the anticonvulsant drugs, treatment thresholds and dosing schedules,
      treatment in both arms will be at the discretion of the bedside physician.All infants will
      undergo an assessment of neuromotor disability and neurodevelopmental evaluation at 18 to 24
      months.
