  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to reduce the risk for anterior cruciate ligament
      injuries by designing a targeted intervention that will alter the known kinematic and kinetic
      risk factors associated with ACL injuries.

      This study will address the following specific aims: 1) To optimize a wearable, targeted,
      active training feedback device to reduce the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by
      inducing patterns of movement that alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors
      associated with ACL injuries. 2) To evaluate the efficacy of the active device and determine
      if the device reduces the risk of ACL injury among healthy subjects by effectively inducing
      patterns of movement that alter the known kinematic and kinetic risk factors associated with
      ACL injuries.

    <description>The feedback system consisted of three small inertial measurement units affixed on the chest, thigh, and shank segment respectively. These units were connected to a computer that recorded the signal from the inertial sensors at 240 Hz during the jump task. Using custom software, the knee flexion angle, trunk lean, and coronal thigh angular velocity were calculated immediately after the subject completed the jump trial. A projector was used to display the results of the jump analysis. It took less than 10 minutes to place this system on a subject and less than five seconds to analyze a jump.</description>
