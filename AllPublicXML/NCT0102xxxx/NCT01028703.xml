    <textblock>
      Studies of patients with established kidney disease, even when this is mild, appear to show
      that they are at high risk of heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. This may be
      because kidney disease causes stiffening of the arteries in the body which means that the
      heart and brain are damaged by high blood pressure. By studying patients before and after the
      removal of a kidney (uni-nephrectomy) for transplantation the investigators will find out for
      the first time in man the effect of an isolated reduction in kidney function on the structure
      and function of the arteries and heart.

      Hypotheses. An isolated reduction in GFR occuring after surgical uni-nephrectomy is
      associated with long term adverse cardiac and vascular effects which include:

        1. Increased arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass

        2. Abnormalities in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function

        3. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation and collagen turnover
