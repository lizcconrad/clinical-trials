      This is a single-arm, multicentre pilot study designed to provide an indication of the
      effectiveness and safety of the Cinatra™ Corolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System. The primary
      endpoint to be evaluated in this study is late lumen loss (in-stent) at 6 months
      post-procedure as measured by QCA in the 30 participants undergoing angiography at this
      timepoint. Late lumen loss is defined as the difference between the post-index procedure
      minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and the follow-up MLD.

               -  Lesion location is aorto-ostial, an unprotected left main lesion, or within 5 mm

               -  Involves a side branch &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter

               -  Is at or distal to a &gt; 45º bend in the vessel

               -  Is severely calcified
