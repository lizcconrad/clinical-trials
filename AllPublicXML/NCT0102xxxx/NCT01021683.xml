  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to investigate whether a sufficient concentration
      of itraconazole can influence disappearance of a fever (defeverscence) when intravenous (into
      the vein) itraconazole is administered for resolving unknown neutropenic fever of
      participants who are given itraconazole oral solution as a prophylaxis under general
      treatment conditions.

      This is a prospective (study following patients forward in time), open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than one center)
      observational study to examine the correlation between a sufficient blood concentration of
      itraconazole and disappearance of a fever (defeverscence) when itraconazole injection is
      administered for resolving unknown neutropenic fever of participants who are given
      itraconazole oral solution as a prophylaxis under general treatment conditions. The
      recommended dose of the drug will be 200 milligram (mg), which will be administered
      intravenously, twice daily for 2 days (a total of 4 doses) and then 200 mg once daily for 12
      days. After the administration for a total of 14 days, itraconazole oral solution 200 mg
      (which is equivalent to 20 ml) twice daily will be continued for a total of 14 days until
      clinically significant neutropenia is resolved.

    <description>Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of IC and HIC. The OSR was defined based on satisfaction of the following criteria: (1) participants if treated for baseline fungal infection, there was either eradication (removal of fungus in culture), or presumed eradication; no evidence in culture but appeared to be treated clinically, (2) absence of breakthrough fungal infection during the treatment and for 7 days after completing the treatment, (3) survival for 7 days after completing the treatment, (4) absence of early withdrawal due to adverse events or lack of efficacy, and (5) defervescence. The presence and absence of OS was reported.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Concentration of Itraconazole by Breakthrough Fungal Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of IC and HIC.

        <title>Plasma Concentration of Itraconazole by Breakthrough Fungal Infection</title>
        <description>Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of IC and HIC. A breakthrough fungal infection was defined as any fungal infection that was diagnosed more than (&gt;) 3 days on or during therapy or within 7 days after completion of therapy. Blood cultures were assessed to identify fungus.</description>

        <population>The ITT population included the participants who satisfied the eligibility criteria, received the study drug at least once, and in whom the primary efficacy endpoint was measured at least once. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) = participants evaluable for this measure and 'n' = participants evaluable for given category.</population>

Itraconazole was administered as an infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) over one hour at the dose of 200 milligram (mg) per dose twice daily for 2 days, followed by 200 mg once daily for 12 days, and then itraconazole oral solution at the dose of 200 mg per dose twice daily for 14 days until clinically significant neutropenia was recovered.</description>
