      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD8418 after
      single increasing oral doses.

      Another purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (also called PK - how the
      study drug enters and leaves the body and how your body acts on the study drug) of AZD8418.
      Part B of the study will assess the effect of food on the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      AZD8418.
