  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study is to evaluate the safety(first objective) and efficacy(second
      objective)of an experimental drug product,Stakel®, in the treatment of neovascular AMD. The
      drug product is activated in patients by exposure to light at a specific wavelength
      (&quot;Vascular Targeted Photodynamic therapy&quot;, &quot;VTP&quot;). The exploratory objective is to assess
      whether it is possible to delay or reduce the requirement for anti VEGF intravitreal therapy
      in the first 12 weeks after VTP.

      All subjects will have a 52 weeks safety follow up telephone call.

      The primary objective of this Phase IIa clinical study is to evaluate the safety of treatment
      with Stakel®-mediated VTP in subjects with neovascular AMD. The secondary objective of this
      Phase IIa clinical study is to explore the effect of treatment with Stakel®-mediated VTP in
      subjects with neovascular AMD. The exploratory objective is to assess whether it is possible
      to delay or reduce the requirement for anti VEGF intravitreal therapy in the first 12 weeks
      after VTP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Twenty eight days or more after at least one ranibizumab injection, recurrent leakage
             on FA from subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD.

          -  Total lesion size not exceeding 5400 μm in its greatest linear dimension.

          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letter score of 73 to 23 in the study eye at a
             starting distance of 4 meters.

          -  No contraindication to intravitreal ranibizumab injection.

          -  Postmenopausal for at least 12 months prior to enrollment or practicing medically
             acceptable form of birth control and not pregnant. Male subjects must be practicing a
             medically acceptable form of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatments:

               -  Previous subfoveal laser photocoagulation, external-beam radiation therapy, or
                  transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) in the study eye at any time.

               -  Using anti-VEGF therapies for other indications (e.g., cancer) in the 30 days

                  eye.

               -  Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye.

               -  Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye demonstrating
                  more-than eight diopters of myopia.
