  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of pre-surgical patients who are MRSA
      carriers. From an evidence-based practice perspective, findings from this study can be
      considered in the evaluation of the hospital SOP mandating pre-surgical MRSA screening
      requirements for patients with scheduled surgeries.

      The central hypothesis to be addressed in this study is whether the MRSA colonization and
      subsequent post-operative infection are the equivalent in these populations.

      Design and Methods: Subjects in this study of 975 pre-operative, scheduled surgical patients
      are in one of the three following groups:

        -  Group 1 (N=325): Allocation sample of surgical patients required to be MRSA screened per
           hospital SOP (including patients having a positive MRSA history, orthopedic surgery,
           undergoing dialysis, or transfer from another hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing
           facility, or jail).

        -  Group 2 (N=650): Randomized sample (1:1 ratio) of surgical patients not required to be
           MRSA screened per hospital SOP, to one of the following two groups:

             -  2a (N=325): MRSA screening; or

             -  2b (N=325): No MRSA screening. All subjects were followed for 30 days
                post-operatively to determine the incidence of post-operative infection. Treatment,
                diagnostic, and hospitalization data were collected for patients diagnosed with
                post-operative infection.
