      Ankle dorsiflexor weakness (paresis) is one of the most frequently persisting consequences of
      stroke. The purpose of this exploratory study is to compare two different treatments --
      Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES) and Cyclic
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (cNMES) -- for improved recovery of ankle movement and
      better walking after stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankle dorsiflexor weakness results in inefficient and unstable gait. While routine physical
      therapy is beneficial, for many individuals it remains limited in its effectiveness, and
      consequently many stroke survivors have difficulty walking safely or remain non-ambulatory.
      Ankle-foot-orthoses (AFOs) are often prescribed to provide ankle stability, but because they
      limit ankle mobility they may actually inhibit recovery of dorsiflexion. Advanced
      rehabilitation techniques that emphasize active, repetitive, goal-oriented movement of the
      impaired limb have produced measurable functional improvements, yet a significant degree of
      lower extremity disability often remains. In addition, some of these emerging therapies are
      difficult to administer and are applicable only to patients who retain at least some degree
      of ambulation. Thus, there is a need for alternative treatments.

      This is an exploratory study of an innovative neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)
      treatment for restoring lower extremity motor control following stroke. We will investigate
      whether stroke survivors with chronic footdrop recover voluntary ankle dorsiflexion after a
      novel treatment of NMES. Surface electrodes will deliver stimulation to dorsiflex the ankle
      with an intensity that is proportional to the amount of dorsiflexion of the other unimpaired
      ankle. Thus, voluntary dorsiflexion of the unaffected ankle produces stimulated dorsiflexion
      of the affected ankle. We refer to this stimulation paradigm as Contralaterally Controlled
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES). In contrast to existing peroneal nerve
      stimulators, CCNMES is not intended to be used to assist ambulation; rather it is intended as
      solely a motor retraining paradigm that may reduce lower extremity impairment and improve
      ambulation. The primary objective of the proposed study is to obtain pilot data so that an
      estimate can be made of the efficacy of CCNMES in reducing lower extremity impairment and
      improving ambulation.

      Twenty-six chronic stroke survivors (&gt;6 months post-stroke) will be randomized to either
      CCNMES or cyclic NMES, an intervention that provides electrical stimulation of the ankle
      dorsiflexors, but with preprogrammed timing and intensity. For both groups, the treatment
      will last 6 weeks. Assessments of ankle impairment and ambulation will be made at baseline
      and at end of treatment.

      This study is the first randomized controlled trial of CCNMES for restoring ankle
      dorsiflexion in patients with chronic hemiplegia.

    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 timepoints: Prior to treatment, and End of treatment at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) Assessment is a measure of lower limb motor impairment. Participants are asked to attempt to perform a list of isolated and simultaneous movements of the hip, knee, and ankle that take into account synergy patterns, isolated strength, coordination, and hypertonia. Each movement attempt is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; and 2, perform fully) and these subscores are summed to provide a maximum score of 34, minimum score of 0.
Higher scores are considered to be a better outcome. For each individual, the score prior to treatment was subtracted from the score at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gait Velocity (cm/Sec) at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 timepoints: Prior to treatment, and End of treatment at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Gait velocity was assessed using a motion capture and analysis system which collected spatio-temporal data as the participant walked 5-meters 10 times at a self-selected comfortable speed within the field of view of the motion capture system. A higher gait velocity is considered to be a better outcome. For each individual, the gait velocity prior to treatment was subtracted from the gait velocity at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change values were averaged.</description>

    <measure>Change in Time (Sec) to Complete the Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (MEFAP).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 timepoints: Prior to treatment, and End of treatment at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The MEFAP is a measure of functional ambulation, measuring the time to ambulate through 5 common environmental terrains: 1) 5-meter walk on a hard floor, 2) 5-meter walk on a carpeted floor, 3) rise from a chair, 3-meter walk, return to seated position, 4) standardized obstacle course (bricks to step over), 5) stair ascent and descent. The five times subscores were added to derive a total time.
Lower times are considered to be a better outcome.
For each individual, the MEFAP completion time prior to treatment was subtracted from the MEFAP completion time at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change values were averaged.</description>

Participants are asked to attempt to perform isolated and simultaneous movements of the hip, knee, and ankle. Each movement attempt is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; and 2, perform fully). These subscores are summed to provide a maximum score of 34, minimum score of 0. Higher scores are considered to be a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) Assessment is a measure of lower limb motor impairment. Participants are asked to attempt to perform a list of isolated and simultaneous movements of the hip, knee, and ankle that take into account synergy patterns, isolated strength, coordination, and hypertonia. Each movement attempt is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; and 2, perform fully) and these subscores are summed to provide a maximum score of 34, minimum score of 0.
Higher scores are considered to be a better outcome. For each individual, the score prior to treatment was subtracted from the score at end of the 6-week treatment. Then for each treatment group, these change scores were averaged.</description>
