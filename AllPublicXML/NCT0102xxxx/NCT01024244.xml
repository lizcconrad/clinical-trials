    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help answer the following questions:

        -  To test if taking LY2599506 for 12 weeks controls blood sugar better than taking placebo
           for 12 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the safety of LY2599506 in participants with diabetes.

        -  To determine if LY2599506 has the ability to control blood sugar in participants with
           diabetes.

        -  To determine how much LY2599506 should be given to participants.

        -  To determine if LY2599506 has an effect on a participant's weight.

      The study design consists of 4 study periods: a screening period, a 4-week dose adjustment
      period, an 8-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period.

    <description>HOMA2 is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain, and anxiety/depression with 3 options each. Total scores range from 5 (no problem) to 15 (more severe or frequent problems). An algorithm maps the 5 domain outcomes to a single index (0-1).

    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 weeks, Baseline through 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant elevations of ALT/SGPT were considered ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The percentage of participants above 2- and 5-fold ULN was not analyzed due to the early termination of the trial. The percentage of participants with ALT 3-fold ULN or higher is presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) at 12 Weeks and 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DTSQ, an 8-item questionnaire, measures satisfaction with treatment, perceived frequency of hyperglycemia, and perceived frequency of hypoglycemia. Response options range from 6 (best case) to 0 (worst case). Total scores for treatment satisfaction range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses 2 hypoglycemia domains, with each item score from 0 (never engages in behavior) to 4 (always engages in behavior): Behavioral (15 items; range 0-60) and Worry about hypoglycemia (18 items; range 0-72). Total score is the sum of both domains (range 0-132). Higher scores indicate greater negative impact. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants. Given the small sample size overall, and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading. As a result, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <description>Comprise 6 subscales (34 items). Each item score: 1 (not troublesome) to 5 (extremely troublesome) and transformed to 0-4 scale. Subscale score=sum of item scale in each subscale/total number of items. Global score=sum of scores by dimension. All scores standardized (0-100). Higher scores=greater symptom burden. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <description>The Cmax value measures the maximum plasma concentration at steady state following administration of doses of LY2599506. Due to the nature of the sparse sampling approach, Cmax was estimated using the posthoc pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters obtained from population PK (PopPK) modeling.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2) Pancreatic Beta Cell Function (%B) at 12 Weeks and 16 Weeks</title>
        <description>HOMA2 is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not calculated or analyzed.</description>

The percentage of participants above 2- and 5-fold ULN was not analyzed due to the early termination of the trial. The percentage of participants with ALT 3-fold ULN or higher is presented.</description>
          <population>Only randomized participants with a baseline value and at least 1 post-baseline value of the response variable were included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>DTSQ, an 8-item questionnaire, measures satisfaction with treatment, perceived frequency of hyperglycemia, and perceived frequency of hypoglycemia. Response options range from 6 (best case) to 0 (worst case). Total scores for treatment satisfaction range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) at a Dosing Interval (AUCtau) at the Steady State for LY2599506</title>
        <description>The AUCtau values measure the area under the plasma concentration time curve at a dosing interval at steady state for LY2599506. Due to the nature of sparse sampling approach taken for the study AUC tau was estimated using the posthoc pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters obtained from population PK (PopPK) modeling. Study GMAH was terminated after enrolling 78 participants. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>
