  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the final months of pregnancy, women need to know whether their 'water is broken'
      necessitating a race to the delivery room, or whether pressure of the foetus on their bladder
      has caused them merely to pass urine. They may also have faced the same dilemma on many
      occasions much earlier in the pregnancy. With this development the investigators will provide
      them with an immediate answer to this critical question.
