      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a natural health product
      among participants with elevated LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Disease [CVD] is one of the primary causes of illness, disability and death in
      Canada and in the United States. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are
      significant risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease.

      The investigational product used in this trial, has been specially formulated to help reduce
      elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels, and may provide a natural alternative in
      the prevention of CVD.

      This study is a prospective, 12 week study, where participants will be randomized to receive
      the treatment, placebo, or a comparator product for a period of 12 weeks. Blood lipids will
      be analysed at baseline, week 6 and week 12.
