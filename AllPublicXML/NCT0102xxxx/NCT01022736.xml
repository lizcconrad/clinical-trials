    <textblock>
      This open label investigation is to determine whether cardiopulmonary bypass affects plasma
      gabapentin concentration after preoperative administration in the setting of cardiac bypass
      surgery. Following signed informed consent, 16 patients scheduled for cardiac bypass surgery
      will be given gabapentin (600mg, oral) 1 hour prior to surgery, 1 hour following extubation
      and then every 8 hours for a total of 4 doses. Plasma gabapentin levels will be measured
      prior to induction, prior to bypass, 10 min into the bypass procedure, 10 minutes before
      separation from bypass, 30 minutes following bypass and then before and 2 hours following
      each of the next 3 doses of gabapentin. Pain scores, sedation scores, side effects and
      morphine equivalents will be documented for one day following surgery.
