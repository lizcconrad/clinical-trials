  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure effects of the combined treatment with GH and IGF-I on
      glucose sensitivity and body composition in patients with GHD and IGT or diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a 6 months randomised placebo controlled trial of adults with GHD and type 2
      diabetes. All receive GH (0.15 mg/day for 1 month, 0.3 mg/day for 5 months) and are
      randomised to IGF-I or placebo (15 µg/kg/day for 1 month and 30 µg/kg/day for 5 months).
      Glucose metabolism is evaluated with euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and body composition
      by computed tomography (CT) and bio impedance;.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Verified profound GH deficiency. If the patient is already on GH replacement therapy
             this must have been commenced at least 6 months prior to study entry.

          2. Impaired glucose tolerance test or diabetes (stable on oral antidiabetic medication
             for at least 3 months)

          3. HbA1C&lt;7.5%

          4. Age 18-70 years

          5. Each patient must sign an informed consent document before inclusion in the study

          6. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative pregnancy test before study
             start, and they must agree to use an effective method of contraception such as double
             barrier contraception, an injectable or implanted hormonal contraceptive, combined
             oral contraceptive or an intra-uterine device (IUD). The patient must agree to
             continue to use the contraceptive for two weeks after the last injection of IMP. Women
             without childbearing potential are defined as being postmenopausal for at least 1
             year, or permanently sterilised at least 3 months before study entry.

          2. Insulin treatment

          3. Proliferative retinopathy

          4. Previous malignancy or other serious diseases (ex severe cardiovascular diseases,
             severe infections). Patients with a history of cancer can be included if they have
             been treated with curative therapy and have been disease free for more than 5 years.
             Patients with cardiac failure are not included.

          5. Increased liver enzymes (ASAT or ALAT&gt;2.5 normal range)

          6. S-creatinine above 120 umol/L
