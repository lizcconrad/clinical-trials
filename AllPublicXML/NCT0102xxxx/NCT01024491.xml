      Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, prospective and parallel trial. Men with
      premature ejaculation using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth
      edition, text revision criteria for at least 6 months, with an intravaginal ejaculatory
      latency time (IELT) ≤ 3 minutes. Three treatments are to be compared: placebo, 15 mg or 20 mg
      paroxetine for 12 weeks.
