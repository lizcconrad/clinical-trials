      LAY ABSTRACT

        1. Statement of the health problem or issue: Of the estimated 24,000 Canadians who will be
           diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008, 21,000 will die of their disease. Based on this
           cancer incidence and survival data, the most promising current strategy for improving
           outcome is screening and early detection. It is suggested that if lesions are discovered
           at an earlier stage of disease, they will have a higher likelihood of being treatable
           and therefore, survival will be improved. CT detection of growing small lung nodules,
           many of which are non-cancerous (benign), raises the possibility of lung cancer and thus
           causes anxiety in patients and referring clinicians. Unfortunately, confident separation
           of benign from malignant small lung nodules cannot be reliably achieved using CT or PET
           criteria. Pathologic diagnosis using needle or excision biopsy is usually required.

           Excision biopsy removes the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling
           error associated with needle biopsy, making it appealing to physicians and patients. To
           reduce post-operative pain and breathing difficulties, excision biopsy is often
           performed using minimally invasive surgery (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery, VATS).
           Finding small pulmonary nodules is often difficult with the minimally invasive camera
           (VATS) and a bigger incision (thoracotomy) is necessary in more than 60% of our
           patients.

           We recently developed a technique of using platinum micro-coils, which are inserted in
           the lung nodule using CT guidance, to locate the nodule with fluoroscopy and then excise
           it with VATS. We have completed a pilot study (n=75 nodules; 69 patients) to determine
           the effectiveness of this technique. Seventy three (97%) 4-24-mm nodules were
           successfully removed at fluoroscopically guided VATS excision.

        2. Objective of your project: To improve our ability to successfully excise small growing
           lung nodules with minimally invasive VATS surgery using CT guided micro-coil
           localization techniques.

        3. How will you undertake your work? We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
           determine if the use of CT guided platinum microcoil markers for VATS excision of
           subcentimetre pulmonary nodules can reduce the rate of conversion to open thoracotomy
           from 50% to 10%.

        4. What is unique/innovative about your project? New image guided minimally invasive
           surgical technique for removing early growing cancers was developed at the Vancouver
           General Hospital and the University of British Columbia. This has been published in
           peer-reviewed journals and can potentially allow us to accurately locate and excise
           suspicious lung nodules

        5. Relevance to Lung Association's mission statement? Lung cancer remains a major health
           problem in Canada. Early detection and screening programs allow for discovery of nodules
           when they are still very small and therefore, likely curable. Excision biopsy removes
           the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling error associated with
           needle biopsy, making it appealing to patients and physicians. To reduce post operative
           morbidity, costs and volume of lung removed, excision biopsy is often performed using
           video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques. Using a pilot project grant from
           the BC Lung Association we have developed a new technique that allows preoperative CT
           marking of the nodule and minimally invasive removal of the lesion. We hope that this
           technique will allow earlier treatment of lung cancers and improve survival in this
           devastating disease.

      Intervention Description:

      The pre-operative CT scan will be reviewed by the surgeon with the radiologist to determine
      if the nodule can be excised using thoracoscopic staple wedge techniques. After informed
      consent, the patient will be seen by an anesthesiologist to determine risks and benefits of a
      general anesthetic. The patient will initially come to the CT scanner suite in the radiology
      department. The CT guided percutaneous microcoil nodule localization procedure, will be
      performed consciously under local anaesthesia Using sterile technique and local anesthetic, a
      biopsy needle (22 gauge) pre-loaded with an 6 cm long platinum microcoil will be placed 10mm
      deep to the suspicious pulmonary nodule using CT guidance. The coil will be deployed such
      that one end will be adjacent to the nodule and the other end will lie free on the: lung
      surface. The patient will be transferred to the Laurel OR where they will be placed under
      general anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube in order to allow collapse of the
      involved lung during the thoracoscopic excision of the marked lung nodule. The patient's
      blood pressures, oxygen levels, pulse and ECG will be monitored. The thoracoscopic excision
      of the nodule will be performed using the microcoil as a localizing device. Using the
      preoperative CT scan, the study surgeon will mark the insertion sites for thoracoscopic
      instruments. Instruments for video-assisted thoracoscopy include a rigid 5 mm thoracoscope, a
      light source, a video-camera and monitor, and 5 mm grasping forceps. The patient will be
      draped. A 5mm thoracoscopic port is inserted into the thorax percutaneously and the lung is
      examined with the thoracoscope. The nodule location will be identified by the end of the
      microcoil that sits on the surface of the lung. A second 5 mm port is put in place and the
      end of the microcoil grasped under thoracoscopic visualization. Multiple endoscopic are
      placed via a third 12mm port and the nodule and coil are completely excised under
      fluoroscopic guidance. The resected nodule is placed in an endoscopic bag and brought out
      through the large port site. If the lesion cannot be excised by the VATS technique the
      patient will undergo an open rib spreading thoracotomy for excision of the marked nodule. The
      indications for thoracotomy at this time are:poor visualization of the lung, pleural
      symphysis with scarring, uncontrollable bleeding or inability to completely resect the lesion
      with the thoracoscopic endostapler.

      The specimen is sent for frozen section pathological examination. If the lesion is benign the
      thoracic cavity is irrigated with saline and a small chest tube is put in place and attached
      to under water drainage. The incisions are then closed and the lung is re-expanded. The
      patient is then transported to the post-anesthetic room similar to other patients undergoing
      general anesthesia. If the lesion is a non-small cell cancer of the lung the patient may
      undergo a sampling of lymph nodes at that time followed by formal lobectomy. If the patient
      has inadequate pulmonary function to tolerate a lobectomy and the lesion has been completely
      excised the surgeon may choose to stop the operation at that time and follow the patient.
