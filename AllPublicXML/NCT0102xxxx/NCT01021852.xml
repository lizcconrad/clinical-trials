  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a cross-over, polysomnography (PSG) study to test the safety, tolerability and
      effectiveness of different doses of MK-6096 in the treatment of participants with primary
      insomnia. The primary efficacy hypothesis was that at least one dose of MK-6096 is superior
      to placebo in improving sleep efficiency (SE) as measured by PSG on Night 1 and at the end of
      4 weeks of treatment (Week 4).

    <measure>Sleep Efficiency (SE) on Night 1 and After 4 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 1 and end of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>SE was measured using a polysomnogram (PSG), which consisted of an electroencephalogram (EEG) for registration of brain activity during sleep, an electro-oculogram (EOG) for registration of the eye movements during sleep, and an electromyogram (EMG) for recording chin muscle activity during sleep. Sleep stage scoring was performed visually in 30-second epochs according to Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&amp;K) criteria and PSG data were read by a Central Reader. SE was defined as total sleep time (TST) in minutes divided by time in bed (measured from lights off to lights on; fixed at 8 hours on each PSG night) in minutes, multiplied by 100, where TST is defined as the total time (minutes) in Stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). SE= (total sleep time/time in bed) x 100. Least squares (LS) mean SE was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE) During Treatment Periods 1 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 29 in Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (58 days total)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants with AEs are presented for the first day of randomized treatment dosing (Day 1) through the last day of randomized treatment dosing (Day 29) in Treatment Periods 1 and 2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wake After Persistent Sleep Onset (WASO) on Night 1 and After 4 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 1 and end of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was measured using a PSG, which consisted of an EEG for registration of brain activity during sleep, an EOG for registration of the eye movements during sleep, and an EMG for recording chin muscle activity during sleep. Sleep stage scoring was performed visually in 30-second epochs according to R&amp;K criteria and PSG data were read by a Central Reader. WASO was defined as the duration of wakefulness measured in minutes (any epoch of Stage 0) from persistent sleep onset (first epoch of the first twenty consecutive epochs of non-wake) to lights on. LS mean WASO was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Latency to the Onset of Persistent Sleep (LPS) on Night 1 and After 4 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 1 and end of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>LPS was measured using a PSG, which consisted of an EEG for registration of brain activity during sleep, an EOG for registration of the eye movements during sleep, and an EMG for recording chin muscle activity during sleep. Sleep stage scoring was performed visually in 30-second epochs according to R&amp;K criteria and PSG data were read by a Central Reader. LPS was defined as the duration of time measured in minutes from lights off to persistent sleep onset. An epoch of non-wake was defined as a 30-second interval classified as either Stage 1, 2, 3, 4 or REM according to conventional R&amp;K scoring. LS mean LPS was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Sleep Efficiency (SE) on Night 1 and After 4 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>SE was measured using a polysomnogram (PSG), which consisted of an electroencephalogram (EEG) for registration of brain activity during sleep, an electro-oculogram (EOG) for registration of the eye movements during sleep, and an electromyogram (EMG) for recording chin muscle activity during sleep. Sleep stage scoring was performed visually in 30-second epochs according to Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&amp;K) criteria and PSG data were read by a Central Reader. SE was defined as total sleep time (TST) in minutes divided by time in bed (measured from lights off to lights on; fixed at 8 hours on each PSG night) in minutes, multiplied by 100, where TST is defined as the total time (minutes) in Stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). SE= (total sleep time/time in bed) x 100. Least squares (LS) mean SE was reported for each treatment arm.</description>
        <time_frame>Night 1 and end of Week 4</time_frame>

          <title>Sleep Efficiency (SE) on Night 1 and After 4 Weeks of Treatment</title>
          <description>SE was measured using a polysomnogram (PSG), which consisted of an electroencephalogram (EEG) for registration of brain activity during sleep, an electro-oculogram (EOG) for registration of the eye movements during sleep, and an electromyogram (EMG) for recording chin muscle activity during sleep. Sleep stage scoring was performed visually in 30-second epochs according to Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&amp;K) criteria and PSG data were read by a Central Reader. SE was defined as total sleep time (TST) in minutes divided by time in bed (measured from lights off to lights on; fixed at 8 hours on each PSG night) in minutes, multiplied by 100, where TST is defined as the total time (minutes) in Stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). SE= (total sleep time/time in bed) x 100. Least squares (LS) mean SE was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Latency to the Onset of Persistent Sleep (LPS) on Night 1 and After 4 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>LPS was measured using a PSG, which consisted of an EEG for registration of brain activity during sleep, an EOG for registration of the eye movements during sleep, and an EMG for recording chin muscle activity during sleep. Sleep stage scoring was performed visually in 30-second epochs according to R&amp;K criteria and PSG data were read by a Central Reader. LPS was defined as the duration of time measured in minutes from lights off to persistent sleep onset. An epoch of non-wake was defined as a 30-second interval classified as either Stage 1, 2, 3, 4 or REM according to conventional R&amp;K scoring. LS mean LPS was reported for each treatment arm.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants That Discontinued Study Medication Due to an AE During Treatment Periods 1 and 2</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants that discontinued study medication due to AEs are presented for the first day of randomized treatment dosing (Day 1) through the last day of randomized treatment dosing (Day 29) in Treatment Periods 1 and 2.</description>
