    <textblock>
      The purpose this study is to determine the effects of power mobility on the development and
      function of young children of young children whose severe physical disabilities limit their
      exploratory behaviors and may unnecessarily restrict their cognitive, communication, and
      social-emotional development.

    <description>Intervention included provision of power wheelchair and power mobility training program. Project staff will use structured power mobility training program to teach the children to use the power mobility devices. Project staff will schedule 1-hour sessions with each family 3 times per week for the first month of the project and will decrease in the following manner as the child becomes proficient and develops basic wheelchair maneuvering skills: two one-hour session per week for 4 weeks; one one-hour session per week for 4 weeks; two one-hour sessions per month for 4 weeks; one one-hour session per month for the remainder of the study.</description>
