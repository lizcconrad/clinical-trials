  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer
      deaths in western countries. Colonoscopy is a preferred colorectal screening modality since
      it has both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. Detection and removal of polyps at
      colonoscopy decreases the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer.

      Typical practice is to insert the colonoscope rapidly until it reaches the cecum (a
      pouch-like portion of the intestines, where the large bowel and the small bowel meet). The
      physician then withdraws the colonoscope slowly and looks for any polyps or abnormalities
      within the large bowel. The purpose of this study is to compare this standard practice to the
      approach whereby the physician examines the bowel as the scope is initially inserted AND as
      the colonoscope is withdrawn from patients' colons.
