      Context. Faciocraniosynostoses present with an insufficient growth of the craniofacial
      skeleton due to premature fusion of skull and facial sutures. There are prenatal conditions
      with functional (risk of raised intracranial pressure) and morphological consequences
      (exorbitism, and impairment of upper respiratory airways), the severity of which justifies an
      early surgical treatment based on craniofacial osteotomies and osteodistraction techniques.

      Distraction techniques were started in our unit eleven years ago, and never ceased to be
      modified: Recent improvements allowed better correction of exorbitism and therefore reduction
      of visual risks. But the improvements of the respiratory function remain insufficient. The
      initial evaluations of the respiratory functions were based on blood oxygenation monitoring,
      and showed real improvement. But we have routinely screened our patients with complete
      polysomnography examinations for the past year, and this has always revealed the existence of
      severe sleep apnea syndromes that we fail to correct completely, although there were slightly
      improved.

      The aim of this PHRC protocol is :

        -  the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the respiratory status with a reinforced
           task force group including the specialists in genuine multidisciplinary approach.

        -  A modification of the surgical technique including modifications of the existing
           distraction devices, an increased number of implanted devices, and maybe a change in the
           surgical strategy.

      Study design. This is a monocentric study, the patient being its own control. Due to the
      extremely low incidence of these conditions, it is foreseen to include twelve patients per
      year, during two years, which represent 24 patients in total with a minimum follow-up of one
      year.

      Evaluation criteria. The main evaluation criteria are the polysomnography variables (sleep
      apnea index, characterization of obstructive versus central respiratory events, the
      oxygenation pattern through the night), which will be performed before and after surgery (6
      and 12 months post-op). The secondary criteria are the exorbitism correction analysed with
      the globe protrusion index and the rate of infections. A multidisciplinary task force group
      has already been structured in Necker Hospital.

      Expected results. We expect to analyze and correct all the sleep apnea syndromes. Many
      modifications could be made on the distractors, including removal of the activation rods,
      bioresorbable parts, as well as the modification of the surgical techniques.
