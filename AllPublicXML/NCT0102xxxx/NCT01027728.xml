    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses
      of CCX354-C at a number of dose levels in subjects with stable rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II study will consist of two
      sequential stages, Stage A and B. This protocol describes the objectives, design, and
      procedures for Stage A of the study. The protocol will be amended in future when sufficient
      data from Stage A have been collected to initiate Stage B. The protocol amendment will
      describe the objectives, design, and procedures for Stage B of the study.

      Stage A will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, sequential dose
      escalation sub-study in 24 subjects with stable RA. Three sequential dose cohorts of 8
      subjects will be included in this stage:

        -  Cohort 1: 100 mg CCX354-C or placebo

        -  Cohort 2: 100 mg CCX354-C or placebo

        -  Cohort 3: 200 mg CCX354-C or placebo

      Safety and PK data from each cohort will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee
      (DMC)before dose escalation to the next dose level. The study will proceed to Stage B only if
      the safety and tolerability profile of Stage A is deemed acceptable by the DMC.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, aged 18-75 years inclusive, with stable RA based on American
             College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (see section 11.3) for at least 3 months
             (subjects do not need to have active RA for Stage A of the study);

          2. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of methotrexate (7.5 to 25 mg/week) taken
             orally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly, but not intravenously, for ≥ 8 weeks prior
             to randomization;

          3. If a subject is also taking sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine, the subject must have
             been on a stable dose of these medications for at least 8 weeks prior to
             randomization;

          4. If a subject is on corticosteroid therapy, the dose must not exceed 10 mg prednisone
             or equivalent and the subject must have been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks
             prior to randomization;

          5. Willing and able to give written Informed Consent and to comply with the requirements
             of the study protocol;

          6. Negative result of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screen, the hepatitis B
             screen, and the hepatitis C screen;

          7. Judged to be otherwise healthy by the Investigator, based on medical history, physical
             examination (including electrocardiogram [ECG]), and clinical laboratory assessments;

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential, and male subjects with partners of
             childbearing potential, may participate if adequate contraception is used during, and
             for at least the four weeks after, any administration of study medication. Adequate
             contraception is defined as usage by at least one of the partners of a barrier method
             of contraception, together with usage by the female partner, commencing at least three
             months prior to Screening, of a stable regimen of any form of hormonal contraception
             or an intra-uterine device. Use of abstinence alone is not considered adequate. Use of
             a barrier method alone is considered adequate only if the male partner was
             vasectomized at least six months prior to Screening. Use of a double-barrier method of
             contraception is acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with RA prior to 16 years of age;

          2. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have a positive serum pregnancy test at
             Screening;

          4. History of alcohol abuse at any time in the past;

          5. Use of infliximab, adalimumab, abatacept, certolizumab, golimumab, or tocilizumab
             within 8 weeks of randomization;

          6. Use of leflunomide within 6 months of randomization;

          7. Use of etanercept or anakinra within 4 weeks of randomization;

          8. Use of rituximab or ocrelizumab, or cytotoxic agents, such as cyclophosphamide or
             chlorambucil, within one year of randomization;

          9. Currently taking cytochrome P450 inhibitors including protease inhibitors such as
             ritonavir,indinavir, nelfinavir, or macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin,
             telithromycin,clarithromycin, or azole antifungals such as fluconazole, ketoconazole,
             itraconazole, or cimetidine, nefazodone, bergamottin (constituent of grapefruit
             juice), quercetin, aprepitant,or verapamil;

         10. History or presence of any form of cancer within the 10 years prior to randomization,
             with the exception of excised basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or

         15. Subject has any evidence of hepatic disease; AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, or
             bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal;

         16. Subject has any evidence of renal impairment; serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of
             normal;

         17. The subject had an infection requiring antibiotic treatment within 4 weeks of
             randomization;

         18. History or presence of any medical or psychiatric condition or disease, or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may place the subject at
             unacceptable risk for study participation and may prevent the subject from completing
             the study; and

         19. Participated in any clinical study of an investigational product within 30 days prior
