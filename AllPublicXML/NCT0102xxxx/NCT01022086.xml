  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herceptin has shown significant improvement in breast cancer therapy and improved survival of
      patients over-expressing the HER-2 protein by 50%. However, Herceptin has shown to negatively
      affect the heart, and frequent heart monitoring with multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scans
      is required. MUGA scans use radiation and are not very accurate. This study will use cardiac
      magnetic resonance images (CMRs) to evaluate heart function and compare to MUGA scans in
      patients receiving Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer. In addition, novel biomarkers
      will also be assessed at the same time to help identify possible patients at risk for
      developing heart toxicities.

      Currently, serial MUGA scans are the imaging modality of choice for monitoring
      cardiotoxicity. However, MUGA scans only measure LVEF at the cost of ionizing radiation and
      considerable inter-study variability, and do not reliably detect cardiomyopathy. CMR is a
      highly accurate technique and represents a promising imaging alternative. Because CMR is now
      considered the gold standard for measuring LVEF and subclinical alterations in cardiac
      structure and function, it will be used in this prospective observational pilot study to
      determine its effectiveness for monitoring cardiotoxicity in patients receiving trastuzumab.
      Serial CMR will be compared to serial MUGA scans, as they are routinely used for LVEF
      monitoring with trastuzumab therapy, in standard practice. Cardiac biomarkers will also be
      measured in relation to CMR and MUGA scans. Furthermore, we will determine the long-term
      clinical and prognostic implications of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity detected by these
      various methods.

      This will be a double-blinded prospective observational pilot study of breast cancer patients
      with overexpression of HER2 on breast pathology (using either immunohistochemistry [IHC]
      and/or fluorescence in-situ hybridization [FISH]), who have never received trastuzumab
      before, who will be treated with trastuzumab.

    <description>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, otherwise called a cardiac (heart) MRI is a safe and standard clinical test that creates detailed images of your heart. It uses a computer to create images of your heart as it is beating, producing both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels. This test will allow the health professionals to obtain images of your beating heart and to look at the structure and function. Cardiac MRIs can help diagnose and evaluate a number of diseases conditions (such as heart failure, and heart valve disease) and will help doctors decide how to treat or manage patients who have heart problems.</description>

    <description>In addition to undergoing CMR imaging, patients will also have blood tests for two proteins, which serve as markers of heart injury and heart failure. These are called BNP and Troponin. These blood tests are currently used in clinical practice, but their precise role in monitoring heart function in cancer patients has not been well studied. Since the precise cause of Trastuzumab-induced heart damage is currently unknown, it is hoped that these two blood markers will provide valuable insights into how this happens.
Peripheral venous blood samples will also be drawn at each CMR time-point. TGF β1, amino terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (PINP) and type III (PIIINP) and the carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type 1 (CITP) will be measured by radioimmunoassay.</description>

      Mandatory: Troponin I/T and BNP will be assessed at each CMR time-point (and measured as per
      the institution's standard biochemistry laboratory commercial assay techniques.

      Optional: For consenting patients only, peripheral venous blood samples will be drawn at each
      CMR time-point. Each sample will be obtained with a tourniquet free technique, then undergo
      centrifugation to prevent platelet degranulation and enable platelet free serum to be
      obtained. Serum will then be separated and stored at -800C for subsequent analysis. TGF β1,
      amino terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (PINP) and type III (PIIINP) and the
      carboxyterminal telopeptide of collagen type 1 (CITP) will be measured by radioimmunoassay
      with commercially available kits. The intra-assay variations for determining PINP, PIINP, and
      CITP are 7%, 5%, and 8% respectively. CITP will be measured by ELISA according to the
      manufacturer's instructions.
