      The purpose of this study is to determine if restoring normal metabolic function in patients
      with type 1 or type 2 diabetes can improve the impact of the consequences of diabetic
      complications on the overall health and quality of life for diabetic patients.Patients are
      treated once per week with intensive bolus intravenous insulin delivery mimicking normal
      insulin secretions in a non diabetic individual. Baseline and periodic diagnostic tests are
      performed and questionnaires completed to evaluate and monitor progress and outcomes.

    <textblock>
      It is known that the glucose metabolic pathway is the primary fuel generator to the brain,
      nerve tissue, heart, vascular tissue, eyes, kidneys and the liver. Deficient metabolism state
      as seen in the glucose metabolism experienced in many diabetic patients can lead to
      complications. These damaging effects are exacerbated by altered cellular metabolites,
      specifically the increase in catabolic and decrease in anabolic factors. It has been shown
      over the past 20 years that normalization of metabolism in diabetic patients can be
      accomplished by mimicking the normal endogenous insulin pattern from the pancreas. Intensive
      intravenous insulin bolus has been demonstrated to reverse the metabolic state from primary
      fat utilization to carbohydrate utilization through monitoring of the subject's respiratory
      quotient.

      This study measures whether the reversal of abnormal metabolism in patients with diabetes is
      correlated with an improvement in their quality of life and associated complication related
      to their diabetes. The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measurement of CO2 exhaled and O2
      inhaled and is proportionate to the fuel sources being used by the body, primarily the liver
      over short periods of time. The higher the RQ, the more glucose and less alternative fuel
      sources are being utilized. Following the RQ change helps determine the effectiveness of
      physiological intravenous bolus insulin administration in increasing anabolic functions in
      diabetic individuals. By improving the body's glucose metabolism and thereby causing
      beneficial effects of anabolic factors, the possibility of serious complications may be
      decreased. In addition, the use of oral carbohydrate at the same time along with the
      physiologic intravenous bolus insulin administration stimulates the appropriate gut hormones
      which augment this effect, a response which cannot be duplicated with intravenous glucose.
      The purpose of our study is to determine whether the physiologic administration of
      intravenous bolus insulin along with the augmenting effect of oral carbohydrates will
      normalize metabolism in diabetic patients and improve their metabolic integrity and quality
      of life indices.

      The RQ is determined by the use of a metabolic cart. Individuals breathe into a mask for 3-5
      minutes after a rest period of 20 or more minutes. The ratio of exhaled volume of CO2 to the
      inhaled volume of O2 is determined as the RQ. The physiologic range is 0.7 to1.3. Individuals
      using fat as a primary fuel have a ratio of 0.7, protein or mixed fuels is 0.8-0.9 and
      carbohydrate is 0.9-1.0. Those taking excessive calories will have RQ's higher than 1.05. The
      RQ can be followed serially to monitor progress aand outcomes and this is done before and
      after each sixty minute intravenous bolus insulin treatment session, during the 3 successive
      sessions on a single treatment day. The amount of intravenous insulin and oral glucose given
      is determined by monitoring the RQ changes during the previous session.Intravenous bolus
      insulin therapy encourages the glucose metabolism in diabetics to normalize metabolic
      integrity in multiple organs, especially muscle, retina, liver, kidney and nerve endings. The
      process fundamentally requires the administration of high dose intravenous insulin boluses
      similar to those found in non diabetic humans by their pancreas into the surrounding portal
      circulation. Oral carbohydrates are given simultaneously to augment the process and prevent
      hypoglycemia. The process is monitored by frequent glucose levels and respiratory quotients
      (RQ). RQ is measured by a metabolic cart which determines the ratio VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is
      specific for the fuel used at any one time by the body. The glucose levels are monitored
      every thirty minutes or more frequently as medically necessary to keep glucose levels
      appropriate and the RQ determines the need to readjust the infusion protocol in each patient
      for subsequent intravenous bolus insulin infusion sessions.Patient is evaluated post session
      and discharged when stable.

      Frequent monitoring of RQ and glucose is necessary as these levels change rapidly, depending
      on the fuel being utilized by the body. Intravenous bolus insulin therapy shifts metabolism
      from primarily fatty acid metabolism to primarily glucose metabolism. This shift is reflected
      by the increase in respiratory quotient. However during rest periods the RQ may fall back to
      lower levels. Therefore RQ's are done at the beginning and at the end of each insulin
      infusion session of 1 hour in order to appropriately monitor and adjust insulin and
      carbohydrate loads to reach optimal activation in each session.
