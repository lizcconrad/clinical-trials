  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hematocrit level is defined as the ratio of plasma volume and red blood cell mass.
      Determination of this level is important for the diagnosis and follow-up of various
      hematological and renal disorders. In clinical practice, automated hematology analyzers are
      commonly used.

      Recently, a new method for hematocrit level determination has been introduced which employs
      layered resonant piezoelectric sensors. In the present study this technique will be applied
      in blood samples of healthy subjects and compared to a standard laboratory method.

    <intervention_name>Blood draw</intervention_name>
    <description>A venous blood sample will be taken (15 ml). Blood will be collected in 5 tubes. To avoid hematocrit variations due to the blood draw procedure, the first tube will be discarded. After that, the tourniquet which is used for venipuncture will be removed and 4 EDTA tubes (each 3 ml) will be filled with blood for hematocrit determination, one tube will be sent to the Department of Laboratory Medicine, and the other ones will be processed at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology.</description>
