  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that chloroquine will reduce the ability
      of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to survive and spread. Participants will receive either
      chloroquine standard dose (500mg/week) or chloroquine low dose (250mg/week) for 1 month prior
      to surgical removal of the tumor.

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that inhibiting the autophagy pathway in
      DCIS will reduce the capacity of DCIS to survive and invade. The study will examine the
      safety and effectiveness of neoadjuvant chloroquine administration for a one month period to
      patients with low, intermediate grade, or high grade DCIS. We will evaluate whether this
      treatment will reduce the capacity of DCIS neoplastic cells, existing within the duct, to
      survive, induce lesion regression, and kill the invasive DCIS progenitor cells.

    <description>Patients diagnosed with DCIS will undergo a breast biopsy prior to the start of study treatment. This biopsy is entirely voluntary and is not required to remain in the study. The biopsy will allow researchers to study the tissue for biomarkers and to determine how the DCIS tissue changes during treatment.
