  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for part 1 of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of CEP-18770 in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The primary
      objective for part 2 is to evaluate the antitumor activity of CEP-18770 in patients treated
      at the MTD.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        The patient has:

          -  relapsed multiple myeloma that has progressed following therapies that included
             bortezomib and an IMiD (thalidomide or lenalidomide) either alone or in any
             combination.

          -  multiple myeloma, which is refractory to the most recent therapy (bortezomib or IMiD,
             or any other chemotherapy), or the patient did not tolerate and discontinued the most
             recent therapy for multiple myeloma but has recovered from its toxic effects.

          -  measurable disease defined as 1 of the following:

               -  serum M-protein ≥0.5 g/dL

               -  urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 hours

          -  a life expectancy of more than 3 months.

          -  an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  adequate hepatic organ function.

          -  an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin level, and platelet count within
             protocol-specific ranges.

          -  been independent of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte
             macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) support for more than 1 week.

          -  been independent of platelet transfusion for more than 1 week.

          -  received, or may have received, an allogeneic and/or autologous transplant.

          -  a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/minute or more as measured or as calculated based on
             the Cockcroft-Gault method.

          -  if the patient is a female of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 1 year
             postmenopausal): must use a medically accepted method of contraception (including
             abstinence) and must agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the
             study and for 3 months after participation in the study.

          -  if the patient is a male: is surgically sterile, or if sexually active, is currently
             using an effective barrier method of contraception, and agrees to continue use of this
             method for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the last administration of
             study drug.

          -  had major surgery within 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug.
