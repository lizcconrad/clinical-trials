  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The paravertebral block is an alternative in the analgesia epidural the major interest of
      which lives in the catheterisation of the paravertébral space allowing to assure/insure an
      one-sided continuous analgesia.

      The main objective of the study is to bring to light the superiority of the continuous
      paravertébral block, as a supplement to analgesia, in the care of the renal and\or adrenal
      surgery by laparotomy at the adult in terms of consumption of morphine, with regard to the
      classic analgesia classic.

      The main assessment criterion is the consumption of morphine within first 24 postoperative
      hours at the patients benefiting from a paravertébral continuous block besides the classic
      systematic analgesia.

    <description>The paravertébral block is a peripheral block which gets an one-sided continuous analgesia by infiltration of the spinal nerves which appear from the intervertebral foramen.
Its realization consists of a draining in 2-3 cm of the thorny apophyses ( T6-T8). During the perception of the osseous contact (cross-functional process of the vertebra), the needle is redirected in cephalic direction until a loss of resistance corresponding to the passage of the upper costo-cross-functional ligament that is in the entrance to the paravertébral space. A catheter is then inserted into the paravertébral space.</description>
