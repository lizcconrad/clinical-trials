      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of treatment of choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with a combination of
      ranibizumab (Lucentis) and verteporfin PDT (Visudyne), as compared with ranibizumab
      monotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Patients with visual acuity of 20/40-20/320 in the study eye

          -  Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) must be at least 50% of the total lesion
             size.

          -  Total area of lesion components other that CNV must be less than 50% of the total
             lesion size.

          -  The lesion must be &lt; 5400microns in greatest linear dimension (GLD).

          -  Lesion size &lt; 10 DA

          -  Occult with no classic CNV lesions must have presumed recent disease progression:

               1. Blood associated with the lesion at baseline

               2. Loss of visual acuity in the previous 3 months: a: &gt; 5 letter loss (ETDRS
                  equivalent) or b: 2 or more lines using a snellen or equivalent chart

               3. &gt; 10% increase in GLD as assessed by fluorescein angiography in the previous 3
                  months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of angioid streaks, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, pathologic
             myopia (-8 or more with evidence of posterior segment abnormalities consistent with
             pathologic myopia), or CNV secondary to causes other than AMD

          -  Geographic atrophy in the study eye

          -  Tear (rip) of the retinal pigment epithelium

          -  Presence of fibrosis, hemorrhage, pigment epithelial detachments, or other
             hypofluorescent lesions obscuring greater than 50% of the CNV lesion

          -  Intraocular surgery within 6 weeks of enrollment

          -  Active or history of ocular inflammation or infection in the study eye within the last
             30 days

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage &gt; 50% of the total lesion

          -  History of submacular surgery, or transpupillary thermotherapy in the study eye

          -  Patients with intraocular pressure greater than 30 mm/Hg on 2 pressure-lowering
             medications

          -  Patients with severe disciform scarring

          -  History of intraocular surgery in the study eye including pars plana vitrectomy,
             except for uncomplicated cataract surgery within 60 days prior to screening

          -  History of YAG laser posterior capsulotomy in the study eye within 30 days prior to
             screening

          -  Inability to make study visits

          -  Advanced glaucoma, uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular
             pressure, IOP ≥ 25 mmHg) despite treatment with two or more topical pharmacological
             anti-glaucomatous medication)

          -  Allergies to porphyrins or a known hypersensitivity to any component of Visudyne®

          -  Patients with porphyria

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
