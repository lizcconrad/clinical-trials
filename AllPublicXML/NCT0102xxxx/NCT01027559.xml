  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purposes of this research are to determine if Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      has the same healing effect on the brain for people with depression as traditional
      anti-depressants do, to find out more about the causes of depression and why people differ in
      the extent of problems caused by depression, and to determine if certain differences in genes
      within populations are related to clinical symptoms. We hypothesize that CBT will have the
      same healing effect on the brain as antidepressants; that differences in brain activations
      created by the various tasks and genetic differences will help us understand differences in
      the type and severity of symptoms among the depressed subjects.

      The overall purposes of this research are to determine if Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      has the same healing effect on the brain for people with depression as traditional
      anti-depressants do, to find out more about the causes of depression and why people differ in
      the extent of problems caused by depression, and to determine if certain differences in genes
      within populations are related to clinical symptoms.The genes we are examining for this study
      are called &quot;COMT, BDNF, and 5-HTT long arm and short arm&quot;, as well as future genes that may
      be discovered to play a role in depression at a later time, and will be determined by
      examining a sample of your saliva and a small blood sample. The method we are using to study
      depression is Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) which takes pictures of the brain.
      This method allows us to identify certain parts of the brain that show how the brain works in
      controlling negative feelings. These pictures will compare 50 depressed individuals with 50
      individuals who are not depressed.

      Three tasks will be performed during the scan which are designed to cause activations in the
      brain areas we are interested in. In the first task, subjects will do a matching task in
      which the stimuli to match are either faces or houses and in which flanking distracters are
      either faces or houses. The goal of participants in this task is to attend to stimuli in
      either the horizontal or the vertical plane. On each trial, non-task relevant stimuli
      (distracters) are presented in the non-attended plane. One some trials these distracter
      stimuli are houses, on some trials neutral faces and on some trials they are negative faces.
      In the second task, participants will be presented with pre-recorded statements using words
      from the list of 555 personality/trait words compiled by Anderson (1968). Examples of these
      statements are &quot;I am happy&quot;, &quot;You are lucky&quot;, &quot;You are dull&quot;, and &quot;You are greedy&quot;. For
      negative statements, participants will be instructed to either passively listen to the
      statement or decrease their emotional response to the statement. For neutral statements,
      participants will be asked to passively listen to the statements.Subjects will then be asked
      how much the statement applies to them, on a 4-part Likert-type scale. In the third task,
      subjects will be asked to focus all their attention on a single fixation point. This will
      allow us to measure their resting state connectivity between specific brain regions.

Depressed patients will be treated with Sertraline starting with a dose of 50 mg daily on Day 1 of the study. For patients showing inadequate evidence of antidepressant response, the Sertraline dose will be increased up to a maximum dose of 200 mg daily. The daily Sertraline dose can be decreased in 50 mg increments, or as clinically indicated, in the presence of side effects until two weeks prior to the end of the study. No further changes in dose will be permitted in study subjects after the 10th week until the study is completed.</description>
