      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the potential clinical benefits of
      combining two new diagnostic tools to provide co-registered anatomical and functional
      information in the breast in patients with suspected breast cancer.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on a new way of imaging the
      breast that combines the benefits of a 3-D anatomical technique (Digital Tomosynthesis) with
      those of a functional imaging technique (Molecular Breast Imaging). Combining data from these
      2 modalities would provide co-registered functional and anatomical information on the breast,
      in the same way that PET/CT does today in oncology. This should greatly facilitate the
      evaluation and biopsy of lesions seen on MBI but occult on conventional mammography.

        All patients will have had a molecular breast imaging study as part of their participation
        in one of the current research protocols evaluating this technology. A requirement for
        inclusion in this study is that patients will have had a digital mammography examination at
        Mayo Clinic within the past 30 days.

          -  enrolled in one of the following protocols:

        IRB # 08-005522: Evaluation of Molecular Breast Imaging in Patients with a High Likelihood
        of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ. 07-004241: Molecular Breast Imaging in the Preoperative
        Evaluation of Women with Biopsy Proven Breast Cancer. 1204-03: Evaluation of a Small Field
        of View Gamma Camera for Scintimammography in Patients with Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia,
        Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia, and Lobular Carcinoma In Situ. 07-003397: Comparison of MRI
        and Molecular Breast Imaging in Breast Diagnostic Evaluation. 17-05: Determination of the
        Sensitivity of a Dual-Headed Small Field of View Gamma Camera for the Detection of Small
        Breast Lesions.

          -  Digital mammogram at the Mayo Clinic within the past 30 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They are unable to understand and sign the consent form

          -  They are pregnant or lactating

          -  They are physically unable to sit upright and still for 40 minutes.

          -  Recently enrolled on one of the ongoing tomosynthesis vs. mammography studies
             (rationale - avoid performing duplicate tomosynthesis studies in the same patient)
