  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a major neurodegenerative disorder in which there is a progressive
      loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The understanding that PD is a syndrome of
      dopamine (DA) deficiency led to the introduction in the clinical practice of L-dopa, a
      precursor of DA that crosses the blood brain barrier, and also to the use of selective
      inhibitors of MAO B, the major DA metabolising enzyme in man.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, extension trial, parallel-group, randomised,
      multi-centre, multi national, Phase III trial, comparing two doses of safinamide (50 and 100
      mg p.o. q.a.m.) versus placebo as add-on therapy to a stable dose of a single dopamine
      agonist in subjects with early idiopathic Parkinson's Disease.

      The principal objective is to evaluate the time to first intervention, as some previous data
      suggested that safinamide may delay the need for further dopaminergic supplementation.

             trial medication. For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are
             defined as: &quot;All female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at
             least two years, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive&quot;.

          3. The subject has shown clinically significant deterioration during participation in
             Trial 27918.

          4. Motor deterioration during trial 27918 that required upward titration of existing
             anti-parkinsonian medication or the initiation of an additional anti-parkinsonian
