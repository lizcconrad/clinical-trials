  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori colonizes approximately to 50% of the world-wide population.

      There is an exigency to find routes alternating to control the infection with an ample
      perspective but without the complications of induction of resistance to antibiotics.
      Supplement dietetic with Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in humans takes to the
      colonization of epithelium gastric and this, combined with the observation of which L.
      reuteri has the capacity to inhibit the growth of H. Pylori and its union to the gastric
      mucosa, indicates the potential that the native human bacteria control and influence in the
      colonization in humans.

      The acid-lactic bacteria (in particular the lactobacillus) have been studied by their effects
      in humans infected with H. Pylori with some success to reduce the load of bacteria Studies
      using supplements with L. reuteri as much in infected symptomatic patients as asymptomatic
      with H. pylori showed a clear reduction of the load of bacteria after 4 weeks of use and this
      was concordant with a reduction in the symptoms associated to the infection.

      The objective of this study is to determine if the dietetic supplementation with a
      combination of the stock of L. Reuteri (L. reuteri Progastria) is effective to control the
      load of bacteria and the consequences of the infection in patients infected with H. pylori.
