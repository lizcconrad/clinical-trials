      To compare the efficacy and safety of refined indigo naturalis ointment with that of crude
      ointment in treating psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous studies have shown that topical application of indigo naturalis significantly
      improves psoriatic symptoms. However, patient compliance is hindered because the preparation
      is unsightly and stains clothing.

      To improve patient compliance, we have developed a refined formulation in which closer to
      natural skin tones and less prone to stain clothing. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of this refined form of oil extract ointment and compared the results with those
      of the original crude form of indigo naturalis ointment in treating psoriasis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Severity Idex(PSI) at Week 8.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI score is comprised of the grading for scaling, erythema, and induration on a 5-point scale (where 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe and 4=very severe) and the sum of these three items with a minimal score of 0 and a maximum of score of 12. Higher values represent a worse outcome. For expample, a highter PSI score at baseline and lower PSI score after treatment represent an improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clearing Percentage of Target Plaque Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The target plaque area was rated from 0% to 100% (0%=clearance after treatment and 100%=baseline before treatment). Higher values represent a worse outcome. For expample, a lower percentage after treatment represent an improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Improvement Compared to Baseline in the Target Plaque.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The improvement percentage of the target plaque at the follow-up visit was calculated as: [(Area of baseline plaque*PSI of baseline plaque - Area of plaque week 8*PSI of plaque week 8)/(Area of baseline plaque*PSI of baseline plaque)]*100%. Higher values represent a better outcome. For expample, a higher percent represents an improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' Rating of the Overall Improvement at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>At week 8, patients rated an overall response to treatment (separately for each side of the body), taking into account both the extent and the degree of the disease, compared with the pretreatment condition, on a 6-point scale (0=worse,1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, 5=cleared). A score of 4 or higher represents a better outcome.</description>

          <description>In all participants, two bilateral symmetric plaques were identified, one randomly assigned to receive refined ointment, and the other assigned to receive crude ointment. Participants were instructed to avoid cross-contamination between the two treatment sites by washing hands throughly between applications. Treatment was performed until complete clearing, up to a maxmum period of 8 weeks.</description>
