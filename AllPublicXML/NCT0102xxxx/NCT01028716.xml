      This phase II trial studies how well donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant works
      in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Cyclophosphamide when added to tacrolimus
      and mycophenolate mofetil is safe and effective in preventing severe graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) in most patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing transplantation of
      bone marrow from half-matched (haploidentical) donors. This approach has extended the
      transplant option to patients who do not have matched related or unrelated donors, especially
      for patients from ethnic minority groups. The graft contains cells of the donor's immune
      system which potentially can recognize and destroy the patient's cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Rejection of the donor's cells by the patient's own immune
      system is prevented by giving low doses of chemotherapy (fludarabine phosphate and
      cyclophosphamide) and total-body irradiation before transplant. Patients can experience low
      blood cell counts after transplant. Using stem cells and immune cells collected from the
      donor's circulating blood may result in quicker recovery of blood counts and may be more
      effective in treating the patient's disease than using bone marrow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that use of PBSC in place of marrow as the source of lymphocytes and stem
      cells for nonmyeloablative transplants from related, haploidentical donors will not result in
      unacceptable rates of high-grade acute or chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality or relapse
      compared to historical data on nonmyeloablative transplants from unrelated donors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimates of the rates of neutrophil and platelet recovery, number of red blood cell (RBC)
      and platelet transfusions, incidences of graft failure, transplant-related toxicities,
      disease-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes daily on days -6 through
      -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -6, -5, and 3-4. Patients undergo
      total-body irradiation on day -1. Patients undergo donor peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant on day 0. Patients then receive tacrolimus IV once daily or orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 5-180 (may be continued if active GVHD is present), mycophenolate mofetil
      IV or PO thrice daily (TID) on days 5-35 (may be continued if GVHD present), and filgrastim
      IV beginning on day 5 until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt;= 1,000/mm^3 for three
      consecutive days.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
