      The aim of the study is to value, in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension,
      whether medical therapy plus interventional renal artery revascularization is superior to
      medical therapy alone for the treatment of hemodynamically significant (&gt;70%) atherosclerotic
      renal artery stenosis, diagnosed by duplex doppler ultrasonography and confirmed by magnetic
      resonance angiography, in terms of avoidance of the progression of renal damage, control of
      hypertension and in reducing the cerebro and cardiovascular complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD), due to renal hypoperfusion caused by mono or
      bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS), is a increasing cause of chronic kidney disease and
      many elderly patients start dialysis due to ARDVD. Moreover ARVD is frequently progressive
      and reduces life-expectancy more than other causes of end stage renal disease, with a
      mortality rate higher than in patients with stable angina, similar to that of patients
      operated for colon cancer.

      Unfortunately, there is not a definite therapy to cure this disease, despite important
      advancements in both medical therapy and in interventional radiology. Aim of the study is to
      see whether percutaneous transluminal interventional radiology plus stenting (PTRS) of the
      renal artery offers more, in terms of both preventing the progression of renal failure and
      controlling the hypertension, compared with the medical therapy addressed to control
      hypertension, improve the dyslipidemic profile and optimise the platelet anti-aggregant
      therapy, following the most recent guidelines. The eligible patients will be centrally
      randomized to:

        1. medical treatment with hypotensive drugs (all class of hypotensive agents will be used
           according to single-center experience including drugs agent on
           renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, when permitted), lipid lowering therapy (namely
           all class of statins-or hydroxymethylglutaryl-coA reductase inhibitors)and anti-platelet
           (acetylsalicylate and/or ticlopidine or clopidrogel according to single-center
           experience) or to

        2. the same medical therapy, as previously described in group a, associated with PTRS,
           according to a standardized protocol, with a follow up at 2 years extended to other 2
           years
