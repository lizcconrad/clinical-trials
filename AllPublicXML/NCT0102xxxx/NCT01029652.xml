  <official_title>A 12 Weeks Randomized, Controlled Core Study of ACZ885 (Canakinumab) on the Treatment and Prevention of Gout Flares in Patients With Frequent Flares for Whom NSAIDs and/or Colchicine Are Contraindicated, Not Tolerated or Ineffective, Including a 12-week Double-blind Extension Study and an Open-label 48 Week Extension Study</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the 12-week core study was to demonstrate that canakinumab given upon acute
      gout flares relieves the signs and symptoms and prevents recurrence of gout flares in
      patients with frequent flares of gout for whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      and/ or colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective. The efficacy of
      canakinumab was compared to the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide.

      The purpose of the first 12-week extension study was to collect additional safety,
      tolerability and efficacy data in patients who have completed the core study CACZ885H2356.

      The purpose of the second 48 week open-label extension study was to collect additional
      long-term safety and tolerability data in patients who have completed the first extension
      study CACZ885H2356E1.

    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first new flare and confidence intervals were determined. For patients with event, time to event = (date of event - date of first dose of study drug + 1).
Patients met definition of new flare if they had:
Flare in joint, not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during study)
Flare in joint previously affected (at baseline or during study) after previous flare in joint has resolved completely.
Patients did not meet criterion of having new gout flare if:

    <measure>SF36 Physical Function Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life (QoL). This 36-item survey has 8 subscales that can be aggregated into physical- and mental-component summary scores. Scores are standardized with the use of norm-based methods based on an assessment of the general U.S. population free of chronic conditions. Scores range from 1-100 with a mean=50 and a standard deviation=10. A higher score indicates less impact on QoL. A negative change score indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used with treatment group and baseline SF-36 physical function subscore as covariates.</description>

Patients could receive a re-dose of study drug on demand upon the occurrence of new flares, but re-dosing could not occur until 14 days had elapsed after the previous dose. Patients completing the 12 weeks core study were allowed to continue to be treated in another 12 weeks extension study for any new gout flare on demand with the same treatment as assigned in the core study.
Patients under this arm who agreed to continue to 2nd extension period of 12 months, were switched to canakinumab 150 mg sc for any new gout flare during this period Triamcinolone acetonide was not to be administered in the 48-week session.</description>

          <title>Triamcinolone Acetonide 40 mg</title>
          <description>Patients received 1 intramuscular (im) injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and 1 subcutaneous (sc) injection of placebo to canakinumab on Day 1. Patients could receive a re-dose of study drug on demand upon the occurrence of new flares, but re-dosing could not occur until 14 days had elapsed after the previous dose. Patients completing the 12 weeks core study were allowed to continue to be treated in another 12 weeks extension study for any new gout flare on demand with the same treatment as assigned in the core study.
Patients under this arm who agreed to continue to 2nd extension period of 12 months, were switched to canakinumab 150 mg sc for any new gout flare during this period. No patient received triamcinolone acetonide in second extension Study .</description>

        <description>The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to at least a 50% reduction in self-assessed pain intensity in the joint most affected at baseline was determined along with the 95% confidence interval. Patients scored their pain intensity on a 0-100 mm VAS, ranging from no pain (0) to unbearable pain (100). Scores on the 100 mm linear scale were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. Pain was scored at Baseline; at 6 and 12 hours post-dose; and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days post-dose.</description>

        <title>SF36 Physical Function Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life (QoL). This 36-item survey has 8 subscales that can be aggregated into physical- and mental-component summary scores. Scores are standardized with the use of norm-based methods based on an assessment of the general U.S. population free of chronic conditions. Scores range from 1-100 with a mean=50 and a standard deviation=10. A higher score indicates less impact on QoL. A negative change score indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used with treatment group and baseline SF-36 physical function subscore as covariates.</description>

          <description>Maximum severity is the maximum Likert score recorded after the start of the flare. Participant scored their current pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 5-point Likert Scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, extreme). It participant had a new flare, they also scored the maximum amount of acute gout pain in the most affected joint since the onset of a new flare on 5 point Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, extreme).</description>

          <title>High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hsCRP) and Serum Amyloid A Protein (SAA) Levels for Core and 24 Weeks Overall</title>
          <description>High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined in blood serum in order to identify the presence of inflammation, to determine its severity, and to monitor the response to treatment. Analytes were measured by a central laboratory. The analysis included treatment group, log-transformed protein level at baseline, and body mass index (BMI) at baseline as covariates.</description>
          <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients as randomized in core study who had taken at least one dose of study drug. Patients with baseline flare and data at 72 hours post-dose in core and patients with a new flare and data at 72 hours post-dose for the last post-baseline flare (during 24 weeks overall) were included in this analysis.</population>

Adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign(including an abnormal laboratory finding),syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or,if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
