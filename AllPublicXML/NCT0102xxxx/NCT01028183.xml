  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to address the comparative effectiveness and harm of the
      therapeutics frequently given to pregnant women and their young infants including
      antibiotics, tocolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, H2 blockers, and
      steroids.

      Our overall hypothesis is that the use of an existing electronic medical record with
      additional resources for precise data collection and 18 month follow up will successfully
      address current knowledge gaps in therapeutic effectiveness and relative therapeutic harm.

      We will use an existing electronic medical record into which detailed healthcare information
      is entered for over 100,000 newborns each year. These infants will comprise the &quot;Source
      Cohort&quot;. Nested within that database, we will prospectively enroll 10% of the population
      (10,000 newborns) as the Follow-Up Cohort.

      The current electronic medical record for the Source Cohort does not capture therapeutic
      dosing with sufficient precision to conduct comparative effectiveness research sufficient to
      change medical practice. The proposed research will: 1) ensure accurate data collection
      through electronic monitoring and real-time quality assurance evaluation in the Source
      Cohort; and 2) conduct 18 months post-hospital follow-up for neurologic outcomes and
      disability for the Follow-Up Cohort. We will complete assessments of neurologic outcomes and
      disability using an interactive web-based system, mail, telephone follow up, and in-person
      examination.

        We will enroll 10,000 infants at 40 centers. Infants will be enrolled into one of four
        strata: extremely premature (&lt;30 weeks, n=5,000), premature (30-36 weeks inclusive
        n=2,000), hospitalized term (≥37 weeks gestation, n=2,000), and healthy term (≥37 weeks
        gestation, n=1,000).
