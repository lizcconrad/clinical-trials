  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic fundoplication is increasingly performed in paediatric surgery. Many types of
      fundoplication are performed, each has advantages and disadvantages. The Nissen operation is
      the most frequently performed procedure in the U.K., however it can be associated with
      post-operative dysphagia. The relative benefits between Nissen and other fundoplication
      techniques in children are still uncertain.

      The aim of our study was to compare the long-term outcomes following laparoscopic Nissen
      fundoplication with laparoscopic Thal fundoplication in children.
