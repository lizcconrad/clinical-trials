    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of safinamide on levodopa blood
      levels, both after single and multiple dosing of safinamide . A further objective of the
      study is to assess the safety and tolerability of safinamide when given together with
      levodopa in the applied regimen.

      For that purpose, all study participants will undergo intensive blood sampling for
      investigation of levodopa levels and various tolerability examinations, such as the
      measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature), recording of ECGs and
      questioning to find out how the study participants are feeling. Furthermore, blood samples
      will be drawn and urine tests will be performed repeatedly for safety purpose during the
      course of the study.

      The results of this clinical trial may be used for the drug registration of safinamide in the
      future.

          5. Levodopa-responsive patients treated with a stable dose of levodopa/carbidopa

          6. Electrocardiogram recording (12 leads) normal or with abnormalities which are not
             hazardous to the patient according to the opinion of the investigator.

          7. Negative beta-HCG test and not lactating (females). Women who are of childbearing
             potential must be using acceptable methods of contraception and should be informed of
             the potential risks associated with becoming pregnant while enrolled within a clinical
             research study. Accepted forms of contraception are: i.e. intrauterine device and a
             barrier method, combined oral contraceptives and a barrier method, or double-barrier
             method throughout the study. Female volunteers who are post -menopausal or surgically
             sterile may be enrolled

          8. Ability to maintain an accurate and complete dosing diary, with the help of a
             caregiver, recording doses of levodopa and study medication taken at home All
             parameters will be determined within three weeks prior to first dosing. Subjects must
