  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) plus heart
      failure self-care education is superior to &quot;usual care&quot; for depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comorbid depression is common in heart failure, but little is known about how to treat it.
      This randomized, controlled, efficacy trial will compare cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to
      usual care (UC) for depression in heart failure. CBT will be integrated with an intervention
      to improve heart failure self-care, because depression and inadequate self-care are thought
      to be interrelated problems. It will also be integrated with clinical attention to primary
      caregiver stress. Basic heart failure education will be provided to all participants.

    <description>Participants who are randomly assigned to usual care will receive whatever treatment (if any) for depression their own physician may prescribe. In most cases, treatment (if any is provided) is likely to consist of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant such as sertraline or citalopram.</description>

    <description>CBT utilizes a variety of strategies and techniques to modify cognitions and behaviors that contribute to depression such as behavioral activation; identifying and challenging distressing thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes; and systematic problem-solving. In this trial, CBT will be integrated with an intervention aimed at improving heart failure self-care, and with attention to primary caregiver stress. The CBT sessions will usually last about 50 minutes and will be scheduled weekly for up to 6 months, with additional maintenance contacts after that. The frequency of sessions will be tapered prior to 6 months if the participant meets the study criteria for depression remission and has acquired relapse-prevention skills.</description>
