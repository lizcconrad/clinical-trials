             when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, some intrauterine
             contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner). Oral
             contraceptive medications are allowed in this study. Female subjects, who are
             surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)
             are also allowed for participation

          -  Subjects who are inmates of psychiatric wards, prisons, or other state institutions

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy (including photoallergy) to NSAID´s including

          -  Varicosis, thrombophlebitis and other vascular disorders of the lower extremities

          -  Major traumatic lesions (e.g. fracture, tendon or muscle ruptures) of the
             musculo-skeletal system of the lower limbs

          -  Pain conditions which might interfere with pain rating during the study, e.g.
             neuropathic pain

          -  Significant neurological or psychiatric symptoms resulting in disorientation, memory
             impairment, or inability to report accurately (e.g. Alzheimer's disease or
             schizophrenia or other psychosis), that in the investigator's opinion may affect
             efficacy or safety assessments or may compromise subject safety during the study

          -  Major heart disease / uncontrollable hypertension

          -  Peripheral arterial disease and/or cerebrovascular disease

             dose aspirin

          -  History of pancreatitis or peptic ulcers

          -  Inflammatory GI disease (e.g. M. Crohn, colitis ulcerosa)

          -  Any other analgesic therapy including cough and cold drugs containing analgesic
             properties as well as any other substance used for the treatment of pain during the
