      This is study where medical record information will be collected as well as collection of
      excess biological samples.

      Patients diagnosed with H1N1 will be asked to consent and allow us to collect the following:

      From the medical record the research staff will review and record the results of the
      test/procedures (x-rays, CT-scans, EKG (electrocardiogram), etc.) that are part of the
      subjects clinical care and the results will become part of the research record. We will also
      collect and record vitals signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate and record the list of medications the subject is taking. We will also
      collect information on demographics (address, phone number, etc.) including gender, race and
      ethnicity, review and record past medical history and any non medical procedures that the
      subject may have had within the past two months. This information will be collected by the
      research coordinator from the medical record.

      The clinical physician ordered a nasopharyngeal swab or obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
      to diagnose novel Influenza A (H1N1). We will collect this swab or fluid after the diagnosis
      has been made, to evaluate the genetic material of the virus. This swab or fluid is normally
      discarded once the diagnosis is made.

      collection of data will be done by the research staff and should not take any longer than
      15-20 minutes. The clinical samples that would have been discarded will be collected by the
      research staff from microbiology and pathology and delivered to the research lab in Scaife.

      The investigators will do a 6 month follow up phone call to check the health status of the
      participant. This will be done by the research coordinator and take no more than 5-10 minutes
      of the subject's time.

      All the biologic samples and data will be under the control of the principal investigator .
      To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers will be removed and replaced with a
      specific code number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding
      subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators will keep
      the samples and data indefinitely. All samples will be stored in the principal investigators
      laboratory in Scaife Hall, Room 835.
