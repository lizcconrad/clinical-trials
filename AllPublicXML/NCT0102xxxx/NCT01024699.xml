      The study is a prospective multi-center randomized evaluation of clinical and radiographic
      outcomes of two commonly used lumbar interbody fusion procedures (XLIF and TLIF) in adult
      patients with low-grade symptomatic spondylolisthesis. The study seeks to identify
      differences between the procedures with respect to perioperative variables.
