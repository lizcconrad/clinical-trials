      The purpose of this study is to better understand the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen and
      further clinical interpretations of laboratory results that confirm the presence of
      acetaminophen-cys adducts. This study will determine how long adducts persist in serum after
      a therapeutic course of acetaminophen as taken in a previous study (COMIRB 06-1265). Subjects
      will be asked to complete three study visits, each three days apart, following termination of
      COMIRB 06-1265. Each study visit will include collection of blood samples for batch testing
      of aminotransferase, serum acetaminophen and protein adducts. No interventions are planned.
