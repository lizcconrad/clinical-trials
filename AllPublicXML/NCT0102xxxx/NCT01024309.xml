      The purpose is to determine if differences exist in the attainment of functional milestones
      that reflect activities of daily living between mini-posterior and direct anterior approach
      total hip arthroplasty (THA). The investigators also hope to determine if the general health
      outcome after direct anterior total hip arthroplasty was better than that after
      mini-posterior-incision total hip arthroplasty as measured with Short Form-12 (SF-12) scores,
      and to evaluate variation of surgical factors of the two procedures on the basis of the
      operative time, component positioning, and occurrence of early complications.

      A number of studies have compared surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty. The influence
      of surgical outcome as a function of approach comparing mini-posterior to direct anterior has
      not been reported in a randomized, prospective manner.

      Standard primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) can reliably alleviate pain, improve function,
      and improve the quality of life in a broad section of patients with end stage arthrosis of
      the hip. However, minimally invasive approaches, such as the direct anterior and
      mini-posterior approaches, have been devised with the goal of decreasing peri-operative pain,
      speed early postoperative function, and improve patient satisfaction with the procedure,
      compared with standard THA. These patient centered goals are combined with the surgeon's
      desire of a safe, reproducible minimally invasive procedure that has durable, properly
      positioned components.

      There are currently no prospective, randomized studies comparing the direct anterior approach
      to total hip arthroplasty with other minimally invasive approaches. The mini-posterior
      approach has been studied extensively, with promising results. Others have compared the
      mini-posterior approach with other minimally invasive procedures, and at the current time,
      has the most prospective data demonstrating its superiority as a minimally invasive approach.
      Pagnano performed a prospective, randomized trial comparing the early clinical results of
      mini -posterior THA with Two-incision THA. The results found that the early attainment of
      functional milestones was shorter in the mini-posterior group.

      The purpose is to determine if differences exist in the attainment of functional milestones
      that reflect activities of daily living between mini-posterior and direct anterior approach
      total hip arthroplasty (THA). The investigators also hope to determine if the general health
      outcome after direct anterior total hip arthroplasty was better than that after
      mini-posterior-incision total hip arthroplasty as measured with Short Form-12 (SF-12) scores,
      and to evaluate variation of surgical factors of the two procedures on the basis of the
      operative time, component positioning, and occurrence of early complications.

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 week</time_frame>
    <description>The postoperative rate of improvement in functional outcome, measured by the Harris Hip Score (HHS). The HHS was developed to assess the results of hip surgery and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in an adult population. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items, which are summed to create a score out of 100. The score has a range of 0 (wost possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome) covering pain (0-44 points), function (0-47 points), absence of deformity (4 points), and range of motion (5 points).</description>

    <time_frame>3 week</time_frame>
    <description>Total score from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), which is a widely used set of standardized questionnaires used to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (range 0-68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties. It produces three subscale scores (pain, stiffness, and physical function) and a total score. These scores are transformed into a scale of 0 (worst possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome) for ease of interpretation and comparison with other studies.</description>

        <title>Harris Hip Score</title>
        <description>The postoperative rate of improvement in functional outcome, measured by the Harris Hip Score (HHS). The HHS was developed to assess the results of hip surgery and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in an adult population. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items, which are summed to create a score out of 100. The score has a range of 0 (wost possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome) covering pain (0–44 points), function (0–47 points), absence of deformity (4 points), and range of motion (5 points).</description>

        <title>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</title>
        <description>Total score from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), which is a widely used set of standardized questionnaires used to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (range 0–68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties. It produces three subscale scores (pain, stiffness, and physical function) and a total score. These scores are transformed into a scale of 0 (worst possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome) for ease of interpretation and comparison with other studies.</description>

        <title>Harris Hip Score</title>
        <description>The postoperative rate of improvement in functional outcome, measured by the Harris Hip Score (HHS). The HHS was developed to assess the results of hip surgery and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in an adult population. The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items, which are summed to create a score out of 100. The score has a range of 0 (wost possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome) covering pain (0–44 points), function (0–47 points), absence of deformity (4 points), and range of motion (5 points).</description>
        <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
        <population>54 participants returned for follow-up at 6 weeks. A total of 5 participants did not complete the Harris Hip Score instrument in its entirety at this appointment and, thus, were excluded from the analysis.

        <description>Total score from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), which is a widely used set of standardized questionnaires used to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (range 0–68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties. It produces three subscale scores (pain, stiffness, and physical function) and a total score. These scores are transformed into a scale of 0 (worst possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome) for ease of interpretation and comparison with other studies.</description>
