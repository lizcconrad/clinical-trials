  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the novel vaccine candidate, MVA.HIVconsv, will be tested for safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity in HIV-1-seropositive subjects receiving effective
      antiretroviral therapy.

      MVA.HIVconsv will be tested as a single vaccine modality, as a prelude to testing in a
      heterologous viral vector boost regimen which will include a replication-defective simian
      adenovirus expressing the same immunogen.
