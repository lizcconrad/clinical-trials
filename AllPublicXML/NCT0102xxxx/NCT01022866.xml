  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the Falls Prevention Clinic, each subject receives a comprehensive assessment of his or
      her individual risk factors for falling in addition to a comprehensive medical examination.
      Recommendations and appropriate followup tests and referrals are ordered for patients on an
      individual basis.

      Essential for medical advancement is the inquiry into information collected from medical
      records of older adults at high risk of falls and fracture. On such example is a
      retrospective chart review we conducted among patients who sustained a hip fracture [14]. The
      database we propose will provide novel insight into the identification of individuals at high
      risk for falls, key predictors of falls and associated mortality, morbidity, health related
      quality of life and healthcare resource utilization. In summary, our database will enable us
      to assess and improve quality of care, service delivery, patient outcomes, patient reported
      outcomes and track economic burden.

      Purpose: In community-dwelling seniors aged 70 years and older who attend the Vancouver Falls
      Prevention Clinic and who consent to allowing their data to form part of the Falls Prevention
      Clinic Database, we will audit charts to answer the following questions: 1) In terms of
      mobility and functional status, what characterizes the patient population that is referred to
      the Falls Prevention Clinic? 2) What is the physiological profile assessment (PPA) of
      individuals at the Falls Prevention Clinic? 3) What are the demographic characteristics? 4)
      What are factors that explain differences in health related quality of life and healthcare
      resource utilization? and 5) For individuals who have a high falls risk profile, what are
      their specific clinical outcome measures that indicate better or worse health related quality
      of life?

      Objective: To develop a Falls Prevention Clinic Database for subjects who attend the Falls
      Prevention Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital and Lion's Gate Hospital.
