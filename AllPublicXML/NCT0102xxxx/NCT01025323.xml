    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of lifestyle modification in reducing
      blood pressure values in Hispanics at risk for hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study participants (who have prehypertension as defined as systolic blood pressure -
      the upper number- 130-139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 85-89mmHg- the lower number-) are
      randomly assigned to one of two groups:

      the Minimal Intervention Group- participants receive advice and printed guidelines only but
      no counseling or personalized instruction, or the Enhanced Intervention Group- participants
      receive advice and the same printed guidelines as the minimal intervention group, together
      with dietary and physical activity counseling provided by a dietician and/or coordinator,
      periodic professional reviews of their progress and personalized instructions.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated due to difficult recruitment and retention of subjects, these were
    attributed by subjects to conflict with their job schedule.
