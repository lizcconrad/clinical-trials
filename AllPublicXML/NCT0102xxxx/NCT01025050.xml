      This clinical study is an open, prospective, multi-centre eye study consisting of three study
      arms to determine the safety and efficacy of intrastromal incisions for the correction of
      visual acuity on presbyopic eyes. The hypothesis of the study is that by means of
      intrastromal incisions, near visual acuity can be improved in presbyopic eyes in a safe and
      effective way.

      This clinical study is an open, prospective, multi-centre eye study consisting of three study
      arms to determine the safety and efficacy of intrastromal incisions for the correction of
      visual acuity on presbyopic eyes. The incisions are applied by means of the FEMTEC
      femtosecond laser system with the INTRACOR software module using patterns consisting of 6
      concentric rings and 3 different inner ring diameters. A similar pattern with 5 concentric
      rings and only one fixed inner diameter is currently under clinical investigation.

      The hypothesis of the study is that by means of intrastromal incisions, near visual acuity
      can be improved in presbyopic eyes in a safe and effective way.

      The intrastromal incisions are performed by the femtosecond laser FEMTEC, which is CE
      certified for various therapeutic indications. The incision eliminates both an epithelial and
      an endothelial opening of the cornea whereby the minimally invasive character of this form of
      treatment is guaranteed. A detailed pre-operative examination will ensure that every
      interested and willing patient fulfils the inclusion criteria of this study. Post-operative
      examinations, which should document the success of the treatment, are to be carried out after
      24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.
