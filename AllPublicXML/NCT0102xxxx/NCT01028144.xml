  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of obesity in U.S. children and adolescents is a major health
      threat to our society, especially among minority and low social economic status (SES)
      populations. During adolescence physical activity (PA) decreases and is likely an important
      contributor to the increasing trend in childhood obesity rates. Little evidence suggests that
      school-based curriculum interventions lead to increases in overall PA. Thus, this proposal
      will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative motivational and behavioral skills after-school
      program for promoting increases PA among underserved adolescents (e.g., minorities, low SES).
      The motivational plus behavioral skills intervention is consistent with Self-Determination
      (Motivation) Theory and Social Cognitive Theory in that it emphasizes increasing intrinsic
      motivation and behavioral skills for PA. Adolescents in the intervention take part in
      developing the program, selecting physical activities that generate fun and interest, and
      generating their own coping strategies for making effective PA changes during a videotaped
      session. Preliminary data from our group demonstrates the feasibility of the motivational
      plus behavioral skills PA program for increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in
      underserved adolescents in South Carolina. The proposed project will use a school-based
      nested cohort design to evaluate efficacy of a 17-week motivational plus behavioral skills
      program versus typical after-school program (general health education only) on increasing PA
      in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools (70 6th graders per school; N=1,680),
      located in South Carolina will be randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs. The
      study employs a nested cohort design, with schools, rather than individuals assigned to
      condition and will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance techniques as
      outlined by Murray. We will also examine psychosocial variables (PA self-efficacy,
      self-concept, motivation, social support, and enjoyment) as potential mediators of the
      intervention on changes in MVPA using regression and structural equation modeling techniques.
      This study will address an important public health problem that will have implications for
      decreasing obesity in underserved adolescents.
