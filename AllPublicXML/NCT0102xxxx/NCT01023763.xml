    <textblock>
      The primary objective for the project is to evaluate whether nursing home residents who
      require intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics, can be treated just as well or even
      better in the nursing home as in the hospital. In Vestfold, Norway, a structured training
      program in the intravenous treatment of dehydration and infections in nursing homes is
      planned. The 3IV study will evaluate if this leads to an equal or better patient trajectory
      and reduced hospital admittance.

      1. Can a structured training program in administration of intravenous fluids and
           antibiotics lead to a reduced number of admissions and days in hospitals among nursing
           home residents?

        2. Can treatment with intravenous fluids or antibiotics in nursing homes provide an equally
           good or better patient trajectory compared to patients hospitalized for the same
           treatment? We will look at duration of symptoms, direct and indirect complications, and
           mortality rates.

        3. Can treatment costs for the public health service be reduced when patients are treated
           with intravenous fluids and /or antibiotics in the nursing home instead of being
           admitted to the hospital?

        4. Can treatment for dehydration and infections in the nursing home rather than in a
           hospital provide an equally or better satisfaction in patients, next of kin and staff?

        5. How are difficult ethical issues handeld by medical staff at the nursing homes and the
           hospital when nursing home patients receive intravenous treatment?

    <description>Nursing home residents who require intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics was treated as usual (hospital admissions for intravenous treatment).
In control nursing homes that had not completed the training program (intervention period), nursing home residents who require intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics was treated as usual. The majority of these patients were admitted to hospital for intravenous treatment. A few nursing homes or nursing home departments had sufficient expertise and capacity to provide treatment locally.</description>

    <description>A structured training program in intravenous treatment in nursing homes:
Each of 30 participating nursing homes sequentially received theory and practical training in intravenous treatment. In nursing homes that had completed the training program (intervention period), and had sufficient expertise and capacity, nursing home residents in need of intravenous fluids or antibiotics were treated locally; otherwise they were hospitalized.</description>
