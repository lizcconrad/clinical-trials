  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National recommendations state that patients with a history of transient ischemic attack
      (TIA) or ischemic stroke should receive hypertension treatment, including antihypertensive
      medication and lifestyle modification, with a goal of reducing blood pressure (BP) to &lt;120 mm
      Hg systolic BP and &lt;80 mm Hg diastolic BP. Statin treatment and lifestyle modification is
      also recommended for post-stroke and post-TIA patients with elevated cholesterol levels or a
      history of stroke or TIA with an atherosclerotic cause. Despite the clear benefits of
      secondary stroke prevention, there is a gap between evidence and implementation in clinical
      practice. By a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will test whether a tailored,
      telephone-delivered transtheoretical model-based behavioral intervention will improve
      adherence to treatment in veterans with a history of TIA or stroke, thereby leading to better
      control of BP and cholesterol levels, as compared to an attention placebo.

      The primary specific aims of this project are to:

        -  determine whether a behaviorally tailored intervention (TI) can effectively lower BP
           after 6 months of counseling as compared to an attention placebo (AP) in veterans with a
           history of stroke or TIA

        -  assess whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to diet after 6 months of
           counseling in veterans with a history of stroke or TIA.

      Secondary aims are to

        -  assess whether the TI is effective in improving cholesterol levels in post-stroke
           veterans after 6 months

        -  evaluate whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to antihypertensive and
           lipid-lowering medications after 6 months of counseling in veterans with a history of
           stroke or TIA

        -  determine whether the TI is effective in improving adherence to exercise recommendations
           after 6 months.

      To answer this, veterans (n=190) with a history of stroke or TIA will be randomized equally
      to the TI, which will use the transtheoretical framework to provide 6 monthly counseling
      phone sessions about adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations, and the AP,
      in which 6 monthly counseling phone sessions about non-stroke-related health topics will be
      provided. Participants will make in-person visits at baseline and 6 months. BP (3 measures
      taken at least 5 min apart) and dietary sodium are the primary outcomes, while secondary
      outcomes will be total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio, adherence to
      antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and exercise adherence.
