  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few studies that look at sustained weight loss in the adolescent population. This
      study uses a multidisciplinary approach along with pharmacotherapy (use of Meridia)to
      motivate and establish behavior changes in adolescents (12-18yo) during the first phase of
      the study.

      The second phase will have those who have lost at least 5% BMI to be randomized into one of
      two groups. This first group will have no intervention and will be followed at 3 and 6 months
      to assess for weight loss maintenance. The second group will continue on with monthly
      behavior modifications and also be evaluated at 3 and 6 months.

      The hypothesis proposed is that, 1)there will be sustained weight loss at the end of one year
      in both arms as compared to baseline BMI, 2) and the arm with the behavioral therapy
      intervention will be more successful than no intervention at weight loss maintenance.

    <description>No intervention following phase 1 of the study is done during this 2nd phase.

During these two visits, they will receive counseling from the physician regarding food choices and exercise maintenance.</description>

    <description>This arm follows the end of the phase 1 which incorporates behavioral therapy, nutrition counseling and pharmacotherapy with Sibutramine while medically supervised. Participants randomized to this arm no longer receive medication and will receive behavioral therapy once a month and then evaluated at 3 months and six months for weight loss maintenance.</description>

    <description>During phase 1, sibutramine is given to all participants, 10mg po q day. If they do not meet a change in BMI of at least 2.5%,then the dosage may be increased to 15mg po q day. The main intervention in the study during phase 1 and 2is the behavioral modification</description>
