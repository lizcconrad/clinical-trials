  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will make a prospective study in which they will look at the economics and
      security of the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      The investigators want to do a randomized trial. One group will be treated as they have been
      treated at Ullev√•l University Hospital (UUS) in recent years, and the other group will be
      returned to their refering hospital the same day. The objective of this study will be to
      provide increased knowledge about whether the rapid discharge from the intervention center is
      associated with differences in costs or security.

      The topic of this study is whether patients with Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)may can be
      transferred to their refering hospital same day that they arrived intervention hospital.

      This is to see if one can reduce the hospital stay and costs for the intervention center, and
      the total hospitalization time.

      and this rapid transport not give more medical complications

      Our 1 hypothesis is that patients with ACS, who are transported back to the refering hospital
      the same day, will reduce the length of stay in intervention center without an increase for
      the stay at the refering hospital.

      Our 2 hypothesis is that patients with ACS, who are transported back to the refering hospital
      the same day as the treatment is performed, have no more complications than those who stay
      overnight in the intervention hospital.
