        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must:

               1. be between the ages of 18 and 65.

               2. agree to not participate in any other product evaluations or clinical evaluations
                  during the course of this study.

               3. have read, understood and signed an Informed Consent Form.

               4. have intact skin in the treatment area.

               5. have fair skin - Skin Types I, or II - as defined in Appendix II.

               6. be able to understand and willing to follow all study procedures and
                  restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participating in the study if they:

          1. are female and are pregnant or lactating [must be using an acceptable method of birth
             control if of child bearing potential].*

          2. exhibit any visible symptoms of skin disease, such as psoriasis or eczema, or skin
             abnormality (including active dermal lesions, uneven skin tone or scars) which might
             interfere with interpretation of the study results. The presence of nevi, blemishes,
             or moles will be acceptable if, in the Investigator's judgement, they will not
             interfere with the study results or skin stripping procedures.

          3. have a history of allergic responses to sunscreens or other products similar to those
             included in this study.

          4. have very dry or scaly skin on the test site.

          5. have diabetes.

          6. have a history of abnormal responses to sunlight, such as a phototoxic or
             photoallergic response.

          7. have an existing sunburn or suntan, or been to a tanning booth which would interfere
             with interpretation of the study results.

          8. have used self tanners within the past two weeks.

          9. have excessive hair at the test site area which could, in the opinion of the
             investigator, interfere with the interpretation of the results.

         10. have participated in a research drug trial or patch test within six weeks of beginning
             this study.

         11. have a known sensitivity to Scotch 600 Transparent Tape.

         12. are currently receiving, or within the past two weeks received, topical or systemic
             medication which could, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the
             interpretation of the results, affect the safety of the subject, or which may change
             the body's response to ultraviolet light.

         13. are currently taking any of the drugs listed on the next page. In addition, the use of
             St. John's Wort or other similar dietary supplements, aspirin or OTC ibuprofen is
             contraindicated for the duration of the study. Low dose daily aspirin use, 81 mgs,
             taken for heart attack prevention is excluded.

               -  Acceptable methods of birth control that can be used during the course of the
                  study are: oral contraceptive pill, intrauterine device, patch, injection, condom
                  with spermicide, partner vasectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, abstinence or
                  evidence of non childbearing potential (i.e., post-menopausal [one year without
                  menstrual period], hysterectomy or bilateral ovariectomy).
