    <textblock>
      This study is to understand how the inhaled form of amikacin is spread throughout the human
      body and how it is eliminated from the body and to make sure that giving an inhaled form of
      Amikacin to patients is safe and well tolerated

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects with confirmed pneumonia, defined as the presence of a new
             progressive infiltrate(s) on chest radiograph and the presence of gram-negative
             organism by either culture or Gram stain of respiratory secretions. The subject must
             be intubated and mechanically ventilated and expected to remain so for at least 3 days
             after the start of study treatment. Subjects with a tracheostomy were also eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with compromised or suppressed Immune systems, severe hypoxemia, neutropenia,
             serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl and chronic liver disease

          -  Had primary lung cancer or another malignancy metastatic to the lungs

          -  Were known or suspected to have active tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, acquired
             immunodeficiency syndrome, or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia

          -  Were receiving immunosuppressive therapy, defined as chronic treatment with known
             immunosuppressant medications

          -  Had a body mass index of â‰¥30 kg/m2

          -  Had burns &gt;40% of total body surface area

          -  Had known local or systemic hypersensitivity to amikacin or aminoglycosides

          -  Had a diagnosis of end-stage renal failure or were currently on dialysis treatment

          -  Had a serum albumin level &lt;2 g/dL at Screening

          -  Used amikacin by any route within 7 days before the start of study treatment

          -  Had a presence of any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would preclude completion of study evaluations or make it unlikely that the
             contemplated course of therapy and Follow-Up could be completed

          -  Had known respiratory colonization with amikacin-resistant gram-negative rods
