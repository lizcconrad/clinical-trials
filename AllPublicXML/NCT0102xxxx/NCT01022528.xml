  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of the addition of intravenous
      dexamethasone 1.5 hours prior to induction of anesthesia on the post-operative opioid
      consumption, pain scores, fatigue, and recovery in patients undergoing gynecological surgery
      with laparotomy under general anesthesia.

      This is a dose finding study with two different doses (0.1 mg/kg vs. 0.2 mg/kg) of
      dexamethasone to find out the optimal efficacious dose of dexamethasone with minimal side
      effects.

      Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and analgesic effects; and is superior
      to placebo in providing post-operative pain control, lower analgesic consumption, prevention
      of postoperative nausea and vomiting, lesser post-operative fatigue, and better recovery
      profile. No dose response study has been done. The investigators hypothesize that a higher
      dose of dexamethasone may have an incremental beneficial effect.

             confound the analgesic response (specifically analgesics, neuroleptics,
             corticosteroids, NSAIDs)

          -  Patients who have been on long term oral steroid therapy
