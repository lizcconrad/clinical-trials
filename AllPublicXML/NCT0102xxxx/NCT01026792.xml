    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of temsirolimus in treating patients with cervical
      cancer that cannot be cured by standard therapy. Temsirolimus interferes with a protein in
      cells that is part of one pathway that sends signals to stimulate cell growth and survival.
      By blocking this protein cancer cells may stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy (objective response rate) of temsirolimus given intravenously (IV)
      weekly in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. To assess the adverse events, time to progression and response duration of temsirolimus
      given IV weekly in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced recurrent carcinoma of
      the cervix.

      III. To explore the relationship between expression of proteins in the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in archival tissue samples from patients on this trial and their
      objective response to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. For complete
      responders, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity or for 2 courses after complete response criteria are first met. For
      other patients, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months (patients with complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]
      only) thereafter.

             driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial; investigators
