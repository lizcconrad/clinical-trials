      To study the effect of cinnamon on postprandial blood glucose, and plasma concentrations of
      insulin in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard
      75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was served with placebo or cinnamon capsules.
      Finger-prick capillary and venous blood samples were taken before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,
      120, 150, and 180 min after the start of the OGTT to measure glucose, and insulin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were selected for the study on the basis of the following inclusion criteria:
             diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance for &lt; 12 months before enrollment. Glucose
             tolerance status and fasting blood glucose levels were evaluated using the criteria
             established by the American Diabetes Association.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who had thyroid disorders, or used insulin, oral hypoglycemics, and
             insulin-sensitizing drugs within 60 days before enrollment were excluded.
