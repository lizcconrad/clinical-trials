      Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of the study product Noex in the treatment of
      allergic rhinitis by means of the Nasal Index Score (NIS) after 4 weeks of treatment with the
      drug.

      Secondary objectives: To determine the total NIS scale score after 12 weeks of treatment and
      the scores of the same scale individually for the symptoms of nasal obstruction, coryza,
      sneezing and nasal pruritus after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment, as well as to assess the
      safety of the study product according to the presence of adverse events.

      Some eligibility criteria:

        -  NIS scale score &gt; 4 points at the randomization visit

        -  Patients with persistent mild to moderate AR, according to the ARIA criteria with
           indication for use budesonide;
