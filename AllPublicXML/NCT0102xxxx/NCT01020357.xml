  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apnea of prematurity is a common condition that is usually treated with methylxanthines.
      Methylxanthines are adenosine receptor blockers that have powerful influences on the central
      nervous system. However, little is known about the long-term effects of methylxanthines on
      the developing brain.

      The Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity-Sleep (CAP-S) Study is a sub-study of the main Caffeine
      for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP) trial, an international placebo-controlled randomized trial of
      methylxanthine therapy for apnea of prematurity. This sub-study is designed to take advantage
      of this cohort of ex-premature, 5-7 year old children who were randomized at birth to receive
      either caffeine or placebo, and are currently receiving detailed neurocognitive and
      behavioral assessments in the CAP trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of methylxanthines as therapy for apnea of prematurity may be a double-edged sword.
      Although widely-used, and efficacious for treatment of apnea of prematurity, long-term drug
      effects have not been rigorously studied. Neonatal methylxanthine therapy may have long-term
      impacts on sleep organization and ventilatory control. The CAP trial, funded by the Canadian
      Institutes of Health Research, was initiated due to the paucity of well-controlled data on
      the long-term effects of methylxanthines in preterm infants. The initial CAP trial was a
      multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of caffeine vs placebo as treatment for
      apnea of prematurity with follow-up to a corrected age of 18 months. 2,006 infants were
      enrolled. The CAP trial found that methylxanthines reduced the rates of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD) and cerebral palsy (CP), and did not affect mortality. However, concerns
      remain regarding long-term sequelae of methylxanthine use. The Canadian Institutes of Health
      Research have therefore funded further follow-up of the entire CAP trial cohort to age 5
      years, corrected for prematurity. The key objectives of this study are to examine the impact
      of methylxanthines on neurocognition and behavior. This ongoing parent study provides an
      opportunity to determine potential long-term effects of methylxanthines on sleep disorders,
      and to correlate these findings with daytime functioning. Our overall hypothesis is that
      methylxanthine use in preterm infants, while beneficial in the short term, results in
      longstanding abnormalities in the regulation of sleep, and breathing during sleep.
