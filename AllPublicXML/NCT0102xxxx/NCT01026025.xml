    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial are to estimate the incidence and duration of air leaks
      and the incidence of prolonged air leaks (defined as &gt; 5 days by the Society for Thoracic
      Surgery) when using the ENDO GIA Staplers with ENDO GIA Single Use Loading Units (SULUs)
      buttressed with Duet TRS TM in an anatomic pulmonary resection via Video Assisted
      Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). Anatomic pulmonary resection is defined as either a lobectomy
      or segmental resection. Results of the study will be compared to contemporary literature for
      a similar population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must be 18 years of age or older

          -  The patient must be scheduled to undergo segmentectomy or lobectomy via Video Assisted
             Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for a lung nodule suspicious for or clinically proven to
             be primary lung cancer

          -  The patient must be able to tolerate general anesthesia and have cardiopulmonary
             reserve to tolerate the procedure

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements and have
             understood and signed the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  The patient is scheduled to undergo sleeve lobectomy, wedge resection, bi-lobectomy,
             pneumonectomy or Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS), or lung biopsy for suspected
             interstitial lung disease

          -  The patient has received pre-operative chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the lung
             cancer that will be resected

          -  The patient is scheduled to receive intra-operative brachytherapy

          -  The patient has other severe illnesses that would preclude surgery such as unstable
             angina or myocardial infarction within 3 months

          -  Re-operative surgery is excluded if it is on the same side as the previous surgery

          -  The patient requires chest wall reconstruction
