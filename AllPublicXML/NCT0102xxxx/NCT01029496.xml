    <textblock>
      The best time of the umbilical cord clamping has not been fully understood. immediate cord
      clamping (with in 10 seconds after birth) has been standardized practice for many years,
      while WHO protocol recommends to wait for 60-90 seconds. but the umbilical cord may still
      pulse for more than 90 seconds. is it best to wait longer until the pulsing ceased? how the
      time of umbilical cord will affect the newborn? will the longer time be less umbilical
      bleeding and shorter departure time of the cord? the hypothesis of this study is: to cut the
      cord after the pulsing ceased is the best time for cord clamping and will result in better
      quality of life for the newborn and less cord bleeding and earlier departure time of the
      cord, that means less infections of the cord.

      1. for normal newborn (apgar score over 7), regardless term or preterm,normal birth or
           cesarean section born: experimental group1: waiting for the ceased of the umbilical cord
           pulsing, then cut the cord.before cutting the cord, the baby is keeping warm and put
           over mother's abdomen.

           control group 1-1: clamping and cut the cord within 10 second after birth. control
           group1-2: clamping and cut the cord 90 second after birth.

        2. for in case of newborn asphyxia(regardless term or preterm,normal birth or cesarean
           section born):

      experimental group2: resuscitate on bed site with the cord unclamped until the umbilical cord
      ceased pulsing.

      control group 2-1 clamping and cut the cord within 10 second. and resuscitate the baby after
      transfer to the Irradiation table.
