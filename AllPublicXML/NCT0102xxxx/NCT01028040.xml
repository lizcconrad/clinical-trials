        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the

          -  Any clinically significant illness/infection or medical/surgical procedure or trauma,
             as judged by the Principal Investigator, within 4 weeks of the first administration of
             investigational product.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology or
             urinalysis as judged by the Investigator
