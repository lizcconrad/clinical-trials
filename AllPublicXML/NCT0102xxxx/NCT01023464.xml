        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The informed consent document and HIPAA privacy document must be read, signed and

             procedures.

          2. Patients (minimum age 18) with dry eye. Criteria for the diagnosis must include the
             following characteristics at Visit 1 (Screening): Patients' self-assessment of dry eye
             status (answer of at least Some of the time to the question, &quot;How often have your eyes
             felt dry enough to want to use eye drops?&quot;);TFBUT &lt;5 seconds in at least one eye; &gt;
             Grade 1 for Meibomian Gland Expression in both eyes; Evidence of missing meibomian
             glands in both eyes.

          3. Able and willing to follow study instructions.

          4. Patients must have best-corrected visual acuity of 0.6 logMAR or better in each eye as
             assessed using an ETDRS chart at Visit 1.

          5. Patients must not have used any topical ocular drops for approximately 24 hours prior
             to Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past six
             months.

          2. History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye within the past six months.

          3. Current punctal occlusion of any type (e.g., collagen plugs, silicone plugs).

          4. History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the study medications.

          5. History or evidence of epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis);
             vaccinia; active or recent varicella viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva;
             chronic bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or eyelids;
             mycobacterial infection of the eye; and/or fungal disease of the eye.

          6. Use of any concomitant topical ocular medications during the study period.

          7. Patients using systemic medications that may contribute to dry eye (e.g. cold and
             allergy medications, tricyclic antidepressants, hormone replacement therapies) may not
             be enrolled in the study unless they have been on a stable dosing regimen for a
             minimum of 30 days prior to Visit 1. In addition, the dosing regimen must remain
             stable throughout the study.

          8. Ocular conditions such as conjunctival infections, iritis, or any other ocular
             condition that may preclude safe administration of the test article.

          9. Individuals unwilling to discontinue contact lens wear during the study period.
             Contact lens wear must have been discontinued at least one week prior to Visit 1.

         10. Enrollment of investigator's office staff, relatives, or members of their respective
             households; or enrollment of more than one member of the same household.

         11. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering
             this study.
