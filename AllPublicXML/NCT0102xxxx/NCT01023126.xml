    <textblock>
      Adherence to obesity treatment programs has been a limiting factor to good results in loosing
      weight. This study aimed to verify if obese subjects submitted to a physical exercise program
      and group psychotherapy would have a greater adherence, than obese people exercising only.

      The sample was forty people, both genders, mean age: 42,2 ± 10,7 years old. Physical exercise
      consisted of walking and stretching three times a week, during 50 minutes, with intensity
      verified by the Borg Scale, during three months. One of the days were supervised by the
      authors while two were freely chosen by the participant, without supervision. The verified
      variables were: total body mass, height, body mass index, physical activity level, caloric
      expenditure, waist circumference and fat percentile. Half of the sample participated of group
      psychotherapy once weekly.
