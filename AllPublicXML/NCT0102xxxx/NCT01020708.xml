  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study will be a closely monitored trial of a small number of subjects to
      establish, preliminarily, the tolerability and safety of two ALTH12 enema formulations:
      ALTH12-1:4 and ALTH12-2:4. The study will be conducted in two parts. The first part will be
      the assessment of the safety and tolerability of a single dose of ALTH12-1:4 or the
      comparator, mesalamine (4.0g 5-ASA) followed by an assessment of repeated administrations of
      study drug (ALTH12-1:4 or comparator) for 6 weeks. The second part will be the same
      assessment for ALTH12-2:4. Three subjects will be enrolled in each cohort: 2 to receive
      ALTH12 enema therapy and 1 subject to receive comparator enema therapy. A total of up to 9
      patients will be enrolled in this study, allowing for up to 3 replacement or additional
      patients.
