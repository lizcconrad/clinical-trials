      This research trial studies deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood or bone marrow samples from
      younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from
      patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur
      in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well
      patients will respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. Perform a genome-wide scan to test for loci associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      relapse and infection risk.

      II. Validate positive associations seen in the genome-wide scan with a fine mapping approach.

      III. Perform simulated clinical trials using germline genetic variation data to test the
      feasibility of using genetic data to inform the clinical care of pediatric patients with AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Germline DNA is obtained from previously collected peripheral blood or bone marrow samples
      for array-based genotyping studies, including genome-wide association studies (single
      nucleotide polymorphisms) and fine mapping genotyping. Clinical trial simulations are
      performed to test the clinical applicability of using genetic variation data in the
      management of infectious complications.
