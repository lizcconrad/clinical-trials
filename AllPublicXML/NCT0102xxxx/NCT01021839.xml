  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators did a randomized control trial comparing bovine carotid artery grafts with
      ePTFE grafts for patients that need hemodialysis access. The goal of the study was to
      determine differences in primary and assisted patency rates and frequency of complications
      between these two types of grafts. The investigators' hypothesis was that bovine carotid
      artery grafts more closely mimic autologous tissue and therefore, would provide better
      patency and fewer complications.

      Objective: To understand how bovine carotid artery (BCA) grafts compare to cuffed
      polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts as conduits for hemodialysis access in terms of
      patency and complications.

      Background: Many hemodialysis patients do not have adequate anatomy for native arteriovenous
      fistulas. In these patients, synthetic conduits remain the only option for permanent
      hemodialysis access. We sought to compare the standard cuffed ePTFE with bovine carotid
      artery grafts as this has not been undertaken since the 1970's.

      Methods: Following Institutional Review Board approval, a prospective, randomized controlled
      trial was conducted enrolling 29 patients in the BCA group and 28 patients in the ePTFE
      group. Univariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken to understand factors that affect
      complications. Patency rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meyer method.
