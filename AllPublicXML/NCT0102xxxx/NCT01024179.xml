  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulnerable plaque characterized by thin fibrous cap and large lipid core is an independent
      risk factor for most of acute cardiac event. Current clinical data showed that thin-cap
      fibroatheroma was more frequently observed in patients with ACS than SAP. Further OCT study
      indicated that patients with ACS had significantly higher incidence of incomplete neointimal
      coverage and malapposition after DES implantation than those with SAP. These findings imply
      that initial native lesion characteristics may be related to different vessel response
      (neointimal coverage and malapposition) after stenting. However, there is little data on the
      relationship between plaque characteristics and vascular response to DES after stent
      implantation evaluated by OCT.

      Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between initial plaque
      characteristics and stent surface coverage or late malapposition after SES implantation. The
      investigators will use high resolution OCT to assess the initial culprit plaque morphology
      and subsequent vascular response after SES stenting at the time points of post-stenting, 6
      months and 12 months. IVUS will also be performed to evaluate the tissue protrusion,
      malapposition, vessel remodeling at the same time points.
