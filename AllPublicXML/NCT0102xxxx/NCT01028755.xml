    <textblock>
      This is the first time this drug will be tested in humans in order to determine the safety of
      the drug, the ability to tolerate the drug, to measure how the drug is used in the body and
      as a result of these tests to determine a maximum dose to be given. Specifically, the
      following aspects will be investigated:

        -  side effects of BAY79-4620 given as infusion every three weeks

        -  evaluation of highest and safest dose of BAY79-4620

        -  distribution and concentration of BAY79-4620 in the blood at specific times after
           administration

        -  effect of BAY79-4620 on tumor growth

        -  assessment of &quot;biomarkers&quot; (eg, analysis of specific proteins in blood samples, or
           analysis of tumor tissue sampled at the time of cancer diagnosis) for changes during the
           treatment or prediction of safety or benefits of the treatment with BAY79-4620.
