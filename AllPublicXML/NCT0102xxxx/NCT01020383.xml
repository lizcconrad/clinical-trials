  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized and open-label Phase II study to compare the safety,
      tolerability and biological effectiveness of ALX-0081 versus the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor ReoPro®
      in high risk PCI patients.

      Patients will receive standard treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) plus clopidogrel and
      heparin. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive open-label study treatment
      with either ALX-0081 or ReoPro®. Patients will be stratified according to PCI type (elective
      or ad-hoc) and stent type (bare metal stent or drug eluting stent).

             (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35%,
             age &gt; 75 years, female gender and/or lesion/anatomy related: SYNTAX score &gt; 26,
             bifurcation lesions, multi-vessel disease, intracoronary thrombus.

          -  Adequate hematological function including platelets &gt; 100000/mm3.

             period, safe contraception is mandatory. Male patients who are sexually active must
             use a condom during intercourse and ensure that the female partner uses a reliable

             months prior to screening visit, unless the cause has been definitely corrected

          -  History of intracranial bleeding (e.g. hemorrhagic stroke, subdural hematoma,
             subarachnoid hemorrhage) or history of hemorrhagic retinopathy.

          -  History of ischemic stroke or TIA, within the past year prior to screening or known
             structural cerebral vascular lesion (e.g. arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm).

          -  History of New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure or
             history of severe, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias at screening.

          -  Planned elective surgical operation or major invasive procedures or traumas from 30
             days prior to screening to completion of the study at Day 30 (the decision of what
             constitutes a major invasive procedure or trauma will be at the discretion of the
             investigator in conjunction with review and approval by the Medical Monitor).
