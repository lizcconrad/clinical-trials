  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common and serious chronic disease. However, there is a large gap between the
      level of care that people should receive (based on research and guidelines) and the level of
      care they actually receive. With the release of their 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
      Canadian Diabetes Association has a strategy to improve heart disease screening and treatment
      for people with diabetes. This study will evaluate whether the strategy works. The focus of
      the strategy was to give all family physicians in Canada a Toolkit in June 2009 to help them
      delivery better care for their diabetic patients. In Ontario, only half of doctors received
      this Toolkit. We will compare the quality of care received by diabetic patients whose doctors
      received this Toolkit versus those who doctors did not.

      A cardiovascular disease Toolkit was developed by the Canadian Diabetes Association and
      mailed to family physician with the Spring/Summer 2009 edition of the newsletter, Canadian
      Diabetes. The Toolkit was packaged in a brightly-coloured box with Canadian Diabetes
      Association branding, and contained: 1) an introductory letter from the Chair of the practice
      guidelines' Dissemination and Implementation Committee; 2) an eight page summary of selected
      sections of the practice guidelines targeted towards primary care physicians; 3) a four page
      synopsis of the key guideline elements pertaining to cardiovascular disease risk; 4) a small
      double-sided laminated card with a simplified algorithm for cardiovascular risk assessment,
      vascular protection strategies and screening for cardiovascular disease; and 5) a pad of
      tear-off sheets for patients with a cardiovascular risk self-assessment tool and a list of
      recommended risk reduction strategies.
