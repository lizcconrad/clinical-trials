  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ranibizumab (Lucentis) will be effective in
      reducing if not eliminating the macular edema associated with the disease, central retinal
      vein occlusion (CRVO).

    <textblock>
      Retinal Venous Occlusive disease is the second only to diabetic retinopathy as a major cause
      of blindness associated with retinal vascular disease. Macular edema is a major cause of
      vision loss in patients presenting with central and hemi vein occlusions. Until recently the
      standard of care for macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion was
      observation. Recent investigations of steroids for this condition has shown greater visual
      benefit but is associated with risks such as cataract formation and increased intraocular
      pressure. In the past laser photocoagulation has been used, but was found to offer no visual
      benefits over the natural history in the treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO.

      Ranibizumab (rhuFab V2), an anti-VEGF agent, is a potent inhibitor of vascular permeability,
      with the potential to reduce retinal vascular leakage and diminish macular edema. In
      addition, as an anti-VEGF agent, it may also inhibit neovascularization of the iris, a
      frequent complication of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Ranibizumab use as an
      intravitreal agent does carry the risk of intraocular infection but probably carries very low
      risk of glaucoma or cataract formation, making it a potentially safer pharmacologic treatment
      for CRVO associated macular edema as compared to steroids.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Clinical evidence of perfused central retinal vein occlusion. A central retinal vein
             occlusion (CRVO) is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhages and a dilated
             retinal venous system in all 4 quadrants. Other evidence of a CRVO may include
             telangiectatic capillary bed and collateral vessels at the optic nerve head.

          -  Central macular edema present on clinical examination and OCT testing with a central
             point thickness and/or central 1mm subfield thickness &gt; 250 microns.

          -  Visual acuity score greater than or equal to 19 letters (20/400) and less than or
             equal to 73 letters (20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity protocol.

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow OCT
             testing and retinal photography

             associated with diabetic retinopathy

          -  Evidence of vitreoretinal interface abnormality after ocular exam or OCT that may be
             contributing to the macular edema

          -  An eye that, in the investigator's opinion, has no chance of improving in visual
             acuity following resolution of macular edema (e.g. presence of subretinal fibrosis or
             geographic atrophy)

          -  Presence of another ocular condition that may affect the visual acuity or macular
             edema during the course of the study (e.g. AMD, uveitis, Irvine-Gas)

          -  History of YAG capsulotomy within 2 months of the surgery.

          -  Visual acuity &lt;20/400 in the fellow eye
