  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with a BRCA1 mutation face a lifetime risk of breast cancer of approximately 70% and a
      lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of approximately 40%. A number of potential anti-cancer
      nutrients have been proposed, however, it is important that diet supplements be evaluated
      prior to general recommendation.

      The risk of breast and ovarian cancer in carriers of a BRCA1 mutation might be lowered by
      some nutritional supplements. For example, green tea, broccoli and vitamin D are of potential
      interest. One dietary supplement that is thought to have potential for BRCA1 carriers is
      diindolylmethane (DIM), which is an active ingredient in broccoli and other green vegetables.
      DIM - is found in vegetables like broccoli and is available as a supplement in health food
      stores. The investigators think that DIM may increase the production of the normal copy of
      BRCA1 and offset the effect of the mutation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine that there is a potential for oral DIM
      supplementation to result in the increased production of the BRCA1 protein in BRCA1 mutation
      carriers. The results of the study will also serve as an evaluation of the current use and
      success of preventive strategies for BRCA1 mutation carriers.

    <description>This group will have up to 100 women who are carriers of a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. To ensure safety, women in this group will not be able to participate in the study if they are under medications with warfarin, theophylline, or anticonvulsants; or if they are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant within 6 months of the research project. Women in this group will receive 300 mg per day of Rx Balance BioResponse DIM for six weeks. Supplements will be given free of charge. A blood sample (20cc) and a urine sample (20cc) will be collected from these women during two clinic visits; the second visit will be during the six weeks of DIM supplementation (4-6 weeks after the first clinic visit).</description>

    <description>This group will have up to a 100 women who are carriers of a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. This group will not receive DIM. Women that choose not to take DIM will be in this group. A blood sample (20cc) and a urine sample (20cc) will be collected from these women during two clinic visits; the second visit will be 4-6 weeks after the first clinic visit.</description>

    <description>This group will have up to 100 women who do not carry a BRCA1 mutation but who come from BRCA1 carrier family (a family with at least one individual that has tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation). A control subject is considered negative for a BRCA1 mutation if she has been confirmed by direct DNA sequencing to not be a carrier of this gene. A blood sample (20cc) and a urine sample (20cc) will be collected from these women at a single clinic visit.</description>
