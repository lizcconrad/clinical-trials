      This study aims to evaluate head-to-head the effectiveness of tretinoin 0.5% and superficial
      dermabrasion in subjects that have recent stretch marks.

    <textblock>
      Healthy female subjects, from 11 t0 25 years old, that have thin (1-5mm) recent(less than 6
      months of evolution),reddish or purple line stretch marks. The striae should be symmetrical
      and it could be located in the abdomen,breasts, upper arms, thighs (both inner and outer),
      hips, and buttocks.

      Thirty subjects will be randomly divided in two groups:

      Group 1 will receive tretinoin cream that should be applied daily in areas affected by
      stretch marks.

      Group 2 will receive 16 sessions of dermabrasion that would be held in the research center.

      Subjects will be evaluated by pictures, measurement of width and length of stretch marks,
      using Mirror System(Canfield).

      Biopsy to quantify alterations of epidermis and dermis of treated area, will be held
      pre-treatment and 2 weeks after the conclusion of treatment. For biopsy will be used a punch
      of 3mm.

      The results will be evaluated two weeks after the conclusion of the interventions. An
      independent dermatologist, blinded for intervention, will analyse pictures pre and post
      treatment. This subjective evaluation will be performed using Global Aesthetic Improvement
      Scale.

      Safety and adverse events will be assessed each visit.
