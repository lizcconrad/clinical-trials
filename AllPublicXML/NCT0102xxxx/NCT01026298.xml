  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common but under-diagnosed form of sleep disordered
      breathing (SDB). Asthma is a common disease with rising prevalence, which continues to pose
      significant morbidity and costs. In spite of considerable progress in our understanding of
      asthma, a large number of individuals with asthma continue to have symptoms and subsequently,
      have a poor functional status, poor quality of life and increased health care costs. In many
      cases no apparent cause is found and optimal therapy does not achieve its goal. While recent
      data suggests that OSA is common in severe asthma, the prevalence of OSA and its predisposing
      factors have not been studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of not well-controlled (NWC) asthma (National Asthma Education and Prevention
             Program Guidelines step 2, 3, 4), as diagnosed by an asthma physician

          -  stable doses of standard therapy for 2 months prior to enrollment. These regimens will
             include: inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for mild-persistent step; ICS and inhaled
             long-acting β-adrenergics (LABA) or ICS and leukotriene modifier (LTMs) agents for
             moderate-persistent step; high doses of ICS, LABA or LTMs, with or without oral
             steroids at stable doses, for patients in severe step

          -  adherence to the current asthma medications regimen, demonstration of a proper inhaler
             technique; agreement for maintaining the same asthma regimen (except rescue
             bronchodilators) as clinical condition permits (if an exacerbation occurs during the
             first 4-week period, the subject will be excluded as discussed below), and willingness
             to complete diaries of asthma symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, peak flow meter
             (PEF) recordings as well as asthma-related urgent doctor's and emergency room visits
             and hospitalizations for the 3 months duration of the study

          -  moderate to high probability for OSA (SA-SDQ scores ≥31 for males and ≥28 for females)
             or high clinical suspicion for OSA

          -  preliminary agreement to treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if
             OSA is identified and current CPAP treatment criteria are met [patients with moderate
             to severe OSA (AHI&gt;15 events/hour), patients with mild OSA (AHI 5-15 events/hour) in
             association with EDS or co-morbid conditions (HTN, stable ischemic heart disease,
             prior stroke, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia

          -  ability to read and write

             protocol.

             aspergillosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

          -  evidence of medical instability due to OSA at first sleep study visit

          -  subjects with excessive daytime sleepiness to a degree that puts the subject or people
             around at risk of accidents (motor vehicle or work-related). In these cases we will
             facilitate expedited sleep evaluations through primary providers

          -  historical evidence of collagen vascular disease

          -  craniofacial abnormalities precluding the use of CPAP; 11) current cigarette smoking
