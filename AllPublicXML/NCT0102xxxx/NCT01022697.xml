  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fear of full stomach when emergency general anaesthesia is required is the origin of
      fastening when giving birth. This behaviour does not warranty perfect security for the
      general anaesthesia. In addition, well being for women and new born is affected. Giving birth
      is finally compared to a sportive competition with high-energy needs. As Intravenous energy
      intake is not regulated by physiologic digestion, it can induce metabolic disorders for the
      mother that can be amplified for the foetus.

      Oral glucose drinks could offer some benefits:

        -  gastric acidity would be decreased without significant increase in volumes.

        -  energy intake would further more active and more efficiency labour

        -  an increase in foetus well being

      However, it has never been shown yet that such behaviour could offer those benefits. Also, it
      seems that there is not more vomiting, but most of the studies compared oral glucose intake
      to waterborne intake with the same volumes The expected efficacy is a reduction in labour
      duration and a reduction in percentage of extraction. Previous studies said that the lack of
      statistical power due to small number of subjects caused the absence of statistical
      significant relationship.

      In addition, even though newborn have less acidosis, there is no clinical relationship
      proven.

      The investigators propose a randomised multicentre study to assess efficacy of oral glucose
      drinks in comparison to traditional fastening when giving birth.

      Main objective is to significantly reduce instrumental extraction rates. 5400 women will be
      included in the study in 2 years.
