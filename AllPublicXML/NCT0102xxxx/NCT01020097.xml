      Rationale: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography, using the drug
      fluorine F 18-EF5 to find oxygen in tumor cells may help in planning cancer treatment.

      Purpose: This clinical trial studies fluorine F 18-EF5 positron emission tomography in
      assessing hypoxia in patients with newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV
      squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx.

      Detailed DescriptionPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the patterns and levels of 18F-EF5 in Stage 1 - 4 de novo HNSCC of the oral
      cavity, oropharynx and larynx.

      II. Determine whether the 18F-EF5 PET images are predictive of patient outcome (event-free
      survival; EFS and overall survival; OS).

      III. Determine whether any statistically significant prognostic relationships found in the
      corresponding grant are independent of nodal status.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the relationship between 18F-EF5 signal and other measures of hypoxia (serum OPN;
      HIF1alpha protein expression), proliferation (Ki67+ cells/high power field (HPF)), apoptosis
      and radiation resistance (pAkt expression).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fluorine F 18-EF5 positron emission tomography imaging. Scans are performed
      180 minutes following injection.

      After completion of study, patients are followed at 2-4 weeks and 4-6 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed and/or clinical and imaging evidence of
             a Stage 1-4 de novo mass in the larynx, pharynx or oral cavity

          -  Treatment plan should include Surgery (Biopsy or Excision) and may be followed by
             radiation and/ or concurrent chemotherapy

          -  Patients' disease must not require emergency surgical attention

          -  The need for tracheotomy and/or feeding tube placement preceding definitive surgery is
             not a contradiction for participation

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70

          -  Patients must have a clinical condition and physiologic status for which the standard
             initial therapy is surgical biopsy or resection

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  WBC &gt; 2,000/mm^3

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm^3

          -  Total bilirubin

          -  Creatinine

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception

             duration of study participation (1 month)

          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Serum pregnancy testing will be required for women of childbearing age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to Flagyl (metronidazole), which has a
             chemical structure similar to EF5

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding

          -  Patients whose clinical status requires that surgery for their HNSCC be performed
             emergently or in a time course that does not allow scheduling of an 18F-EF5 PET scan
