  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, observational, multicentre (5 sites) study in which
      subjects that have surgically-correctable Stress Urinary Incontinence undergo a TVT SECUR
      operative procedure.

      The study will collect preoperative urologic testing, medical history, and subject quality of
      life patient questionnaires, Intraoperative procedural data will be collected.

      Postoperative complications, urologic, testing, and subject questionnaires will be collected
      at intervals up to 24 months. The anatomic position of the device will be characterize by
      transvaginal ultrasound testing.

      To determine the rate and/or improvement rate of patients who have received the Gynecare
      Secur device after 12 months and after 24 months.
