  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial to determine if vitamin D repletion in CKD (Chronic Kidney
      Disease) patients with low vitamin D levels will decrease proteinuria, a marker of kidney
      damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This RCT will enroll 75 subjects, men and women over age of 18, with stage 3-4 CKD from
      various causes including diabetes and hypertension. Patients will be recruited from the
      Montefiore Medical Center Nephrology clinics and the Montefiore Medical Center internal
      medicine clinics and other interested individuals.

      Informed consent will be obtained on all subjects. All subjects with meet with one of the
      investigators who will verbally explain to them the purpose of the study and the
      alternatives.

      Blood and urine tests will be collected to assess for proteinuria, vitamin D levels, serum
      creatinine, calcium and phosphorus, as well as a urine albumin, calcium and creatinine. These
      tests will be used for experimental purposes only and will be collected at each study visit
      over the span of 6 months.

      There will be two arms, an arm randomized to 50000IU of ergocalciferol once weekly and a
      placebo arm for 3 months. For an additional 3 months, all patients will be repleted with
      Vitamin D via open-label extension, based on their levels after 3 months.

      Secondary outcomes include ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, hemoglobin A1c, HOMA-IR.
