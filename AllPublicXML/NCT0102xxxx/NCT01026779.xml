  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to see what effects the introduction of RV5(RotaTeq) vaccine has
      had in the community both on the number of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and on the
      strains of rotavirus circulating in the community. The investigators will use cases of
      rotavirus gastroenteritis identified on the wards at Hasbro Children's Hospital during the
      2007-2009 rotavirus seasons for a case-control study to estimate rotavirus vaccine
      effectiveness in preventing rotavirus-associated hospitalizations. The investigators plan to
      assess rotavirus vaccine coverage in Rhode Island using the state vaccine registry and to
      examine whether and to what extent rotavirus vaccine was used outside the recommended age
      limits (off label) during the first 2 years of its implementation in Rhode Island. Finally
      using the state child health database, KIDSNET the investigators plan to investigate the
      reasons that children may not have received rotavirus vaccine in order to better target
      educational efforts for parents and health care providers.

      The goals of this study, conducted after the introduction of RV5 (RotaTeq) vaccine in the
      community, are: 1) to use a case-control study to estimate rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in
      preventing rotavirus-associated hospitalizations under field conditions, 2) to assess
      rotavirus vaccine coverage and to examine whether and to what extent rotavirus vaccine was
      used outside the recommended age limits (off label) during the first 2 years of its
      implementation in Rhode Island and 3) to investigate risk factors for non-receipt of
      rotavirus vaccine to inform educational efforts for parents and providers, and 4) to
      characterize the strains of rotavirus circulating in the community both prior to and after
      introduction of vaccine to determine if serotype replacement is occurring.

    <description>Patients will be eligible as cases if they have been identified by the investigator's ongoing rotavirus surveillance studies as having been hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis between January 1, 2007 and June 31, 2009. To be eligible as a case, the child must meet the following criteria: 1) immunocompetent; 2) born after April 15, 2006 (to select a population that would have been in the age group eligible for at least 1 dose of RV5 (RotaTeq); and 3) &gt; 2 months of age on the day of admission.</description>
