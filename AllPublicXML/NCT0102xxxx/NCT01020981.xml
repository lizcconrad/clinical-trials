      This project will add an evaluation/research component to an existing peer outreach program,
      now implemented for over 1100 soldiers in the Michigan Army National Guard. Preliminary work
      will be completed in three areas. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with soldiers,
      Buddies, and National Guard leadership and develop and pilot test survey items relevant to
      implementation. Further, we will develop and pretest survey items relevant to determining
      soldier symptomatic and functional status. We will also conduct a small feasibility study,
      fielding the newly developed survey to a representative sample of recently returned National
      Guard members from Michigan and Indiana, to determine response rates and veteran willingness
      to allow access to linkable PDHA/PDHRA data and health services data. Finally, we will
      construct a merged, de-identified longitudinal dataset comprised of Post-Deployment Health
      Assessment and Reassessment data, Military Health System/TRICARE, and VA services data from
      National Guard soldiers in Michigan and comparison states of Indiana and Ohio. This will
      allow a longitudinal assessment of services initiation and retention for the entire Guard
      populations in these states.

      Background:

      Soldiers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
      commonly experience symptoms of PTSD, depressive disorders, and interpersonal difficulties.
      Forty-two percent of National Guard (NG) soldiers report symptoms suggesting a need for
      evaluation. Unfortunately, only half with mental health needs initiate treatment in the VA or
      elsewhere. Stigma remains an important barrier. Proactive peer outreach may successfully
      address stigma and facilitate appropriate treatment use. In the recently implemented Michigan
      Guard Buddy*to*Buddy (B2B) program, all returning MIARNG soldiers are assigned a first-tier
      &quot;Buddy&quot; from their unit who systematically telephones them to &quot;check in&quot; regarding key areas
      of functioning and symptoms. Soldiers may also be referred to second-tier Buddies, veterans
      outside the Guard trained in motivational interviewing and supervised by professional staff.
      The goal of the program is to identify soldiers in need of evaluation and connect them to
      care in a timely fashion.

      We will conduct preliminary work that will allow us to assess the need for and the
      feasibility of adding a rigorous evaluation/research component to the B2B program.

      Objectives:

      The goal of this RRP is to assess the need for AND the feasibility of a larger VA study that
      would use a strong quasi-experimental design (time series analysis with comparison groups) to
      examine the impact of the B2B program on returning NG veteran mental health treatment
      initiation, retention, symptoms, and functional outcomes.

      Specific RRP aims are to:

        1. Prepare for and initiate a formative evaluation of the Buddy*to*Buddy program in the
           Michigan Army National Guard (MI ARNG).

        2. Develop and determine the feasibility of a confidential surveys for National Guard
           veterans in Michigan and Indiana that elicit information regarding B2B processes (in MI
           ARNG), VA outreach processes, mental health symptoms, substance use, and treatment
           initiation and retention.

        3. Construct a de-identified linked dataset consisting of PDHA/PDHRA data, Military
           Treatment Facility/TRICARE service provider use, and VA service use for MI ARNG and NG
           soldiers in contiguous states of Indiana and Ohio. Conduct preliminary analyses of these
           data.

      Methods:

      Preliminary work will be completed in two areas. We will begin a formative evaluation of the
      implementation of the B2B program, using an augmented qualitative RE-AIM Plus framework,
      multiple data sources and data collection techniques, and conducting field observations and
      interviews with program stakeholders. Personnel at all levels, including NG leadership,
      Buddies, and soldiers, will be part of this process.

      We will also develop and refine survey items relevant to understanding B2B implementation and
      soldier symptom and functional status. We will test procedures for fielding this survey in
      Michigan and a comparison state, assessing response rates, and using data to inform the
      design of a larger study of soldier outcomes.

    <description>The PCL is a 17-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms based closely on the DSM-IV criteria. The PCL-M is a military version and questions refer to &quot;a stressful military experience&quot;. Total possible scores range from 17 to 85. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of PTSD and a cut-off score of 50 is used for indicating a probable diagnosis of combat-related PTSD.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Interview and focus group participants and survey pre-testers participated during drill weekends in November and December 2010. Surveys were mailed to MI NG members in March 2011 with 2nd mailing in April 2011, and 3rd mailing in May 2011 and to Indiana NG members with first mailing in Sept 2011 , 2nd in Oct 2011, and 3rd mailing in Nov 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Fifteen soldiers in Michigan participated in interviews or focus groups during survey development. The survey was fielded to 300 Soldiers, 150 in Michigan and 150 in Indiana. A total of 141 Soldiers either returned a survey and/or completed an interview and were considered enrolled in the study. This is detailed in Participant Flow.</pre_assignment_details>

        <time_frame>Survey was fielded to Michigan National Guard Service Members on three occasions, March 2011, April 2011, and May 2011. The survey was also fielded to Indiana National Guard Service Members on September 2011, October 2011, and November 2011.</time_frame>
        <population>8 or 5% of surveys to Michigan NG Soldiers were not deliverable. 32 (21%) of Indiana NG soldier surveys were not deliverable.
66 of 142 delivered surveys to MI soldiers were returned for a response rate of 46%. 60 of 118 deliverable surveys to Indiana NG Soldiers were returned for a response rate of 51%.</population>

        <title>PTSD Symptoms</title>
        <description>The PCL is a 17-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms based closely on the DSM-IV criteria. The PCL-M is a military version and questions refer to &quot;a stressful military experience&quot;. Total possible scores range from 17 to 85. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of PTSD and a cut-off score of 50 is used for indicating a probable diagnosis of combat-related PTSD.</description>
