  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The electrical stimulation generated by the Cochlear Implant (CI) may improve the neural
      synchrony and hence contribute to the development of auditory skills in patients with
      Auditory Neuropathy / Auditory Dys-synchrony (AN/AD). Goal: The goal of the research was to
      evaluate the auditory performance and the characteristics of the electrically evoked compound
      action potential (ECAP) in a group of 18 cochlear implants recipients with AN/AD.The auditory
      perception was evaluated by sound field thresholds and speech perception tests. To evaluate
      ECAP's characteristics, the threshold and amplitude of neural response together with the
      amplitude growth and recovery functions were evaluated at 80Hz stimulation rate.The CI was
      seen as an efficient resource to develop auditory skills in 94% of the AN/AD patients
      considered by the research. The auditory perception benefits as well as the possibility to
      measure the ECAP showed that the electrical stimulation could compensate the neural
      dys-synchrony caused by the AN/AD. However, a unique clinical procedure cannot be proposed at
      this point. Therefore, a careful and complete evaluation of each AN/AD patient before
      recommending the Cochlear Implant is advised
