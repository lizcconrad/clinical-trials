      Trial will include 40 subjects and consists of 3 visits: Screening, Treatment and Follow up.
      A euglycemic clamp procedure and Technosphere®/Insulin (T/I) administration will occur at
      Visit 2 for both COPD and non COPD subjects.

      Trial objectives are to evaluate the impact of a defined lung disease (COPD) on
      pharmacokinetic parameters of insulin and fumaryl diketopiperazine (FDKP) after inhalation of
      Technosphere®/Insulin (T/I), the investigational medicinal product. 40 non diabetic subjects,
      20 COPD and 20 age/gender/BMI-matched non COPD subjects will participate in 3 visits: Visit 1
      (screening), Visit 2 (subjects will undergo a euglycemic clamp procedure and be dosed with
      T/I) and Visit 3 (follow up visit).
