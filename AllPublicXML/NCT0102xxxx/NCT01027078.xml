    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) who are free
      of any cardiovascular disease will have early microcirculatory changes that are unique to
      OSA, and therefore would resolve with treatment of OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired vascular regulation of the microcirculation is a consequence of Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea (OSA). Nitric Oxide (NO) related endothelial dysfunction occurs in OSA as the earliest
      vascular abnormality prior to the manifestation of vascular disease and it results in
      impaired vasodilatory response to hypoxia. These abnormalities have already been described in
      OSA patients. The role of oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction is present in vascular
      disorders. The presence of oxidative stress in OSA patients is also well established. The
      effect of increased superoxide on endothelial function has also been described in the
      literature. The mechanism of this effect is unknown and is the focus of this research.

      We hypothesized that patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) who are free of any
      cardiovascular disease will have early microcirculatory changes that are unique to OSA, and
      therefore would resolve with treatment of OSA.

        Participants: will be 36 patients with newly diagnosed OSA and 36 age and BMI matched
        controls.

        Patients with OSA will be enrolled from the sleep disorders center at OSU among patients
        who underwent a recent (past 4 weeks) polysomnography that is positive for OSA, and never
        were treated with CPAP.

        Inclusion criteria will be AHI &gt; 15 events per hours.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Hypertension defined by existing treatment with antihypertensives or any measurement
             of systolic pressure above 130 mmHg, or diastolic pressure above 85 mmHg;

          2. Dyslipidemia defined by fasting cholesterol above 200; or fasting LDL over 150 mg/dl;

          3. Diabetes defined as existing diagnosis, hemoglobin A1C &gt;7 or fasting glucose &gt;110 on
             two separate measurements (standard fasting glucose or HbA1C criteria);

          4. CAD defined by history of angina, coronary event or abnormal stress test;

          5. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) defined by history of stroke, claudication or
             abnormal Ankle brachial index;

          6. Concurrent smoking;

          7. Pregnancy;

             9)Chronic liver or renal disease. Fasting blood test for glucose, cholesterol, on all
             participants who have not had these tests in the 6 month prior to enrollment, will be
             obtained at the time of screening. The remaining criteria will be evaluated by
             reviewing the medical records and history taking on the day of first visit.
