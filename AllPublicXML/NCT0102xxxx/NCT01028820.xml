    <textblock>
      This is an 8 week research study of aripiprazole (abilify) which is used to reduce irritable
      behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. All participants will receive active study
      medication. Participants will also receive diagnostic and cognitive evaluations at no cost.
      Participants will be required to undergo two fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging
      scans) where we will take pictures of your brain while performing simple tasks.

    <measure>Baseline and Week 8scores on Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Pervasive Developmental Disorder Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (&quot;Pre-Dose&quot;) to 8 Weeks (&quot;Post-Dose&quot;)</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Pervasive Developmental Disorder Version (CY-BOCS-PDD) is a clinician-rated interview designed to evaluate repetitive behavior in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). It is a modification of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), developed to assess typically-developing children with obsessive compulsive behavior. Because of language limitations in children with PDDs the CY-BOCSâ€”PDD only includes the five compulsion items: Time Spent, Interference, Distress, Resistance of repetitive behavior, and Control of repetitive behavior. Each item is rated from 0 (none) through 4 (extreme), and scores can range from 0 to 20, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Usually a score &gt; than 8 is considered clinically significant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS_R)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline week 0, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RBS-R is an assessment that includes Sameness, Self-Injurious Behavior, Ritualistic, Compulsive, and Restrictive Behavior subscales. The assessments are completed by caregivers for the past week, with consideration of frequency,ease of redirecting and extent to which behavior interferes with functioning compared to a typically developing child of the same age and gender. Scores are rated from 0 - behavior does not occur to 3 - behavior occurs and is a serious problem. There are 43 items and 5 subscales. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. total score is the sum of all items in all subscales.
The subscales are stereotyped behaviors 6 items, self-injurious behaviors 8 items, Compulsive behaviors- 8 items, Ritualistic Behaviors 6 items, Sameness 11 items, restricted behaviors 4 items.Total score ranges from 0 to 129.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We planned to recruit participants through the NDRC Registry and Division TEACCH, as well as utilizing radio and television ads on various stations. We also posted brochures and flyers in public locations and attended conferences in order to hand out study-specific information. 13 subjects began the study and only one of those failed to complete.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In order to participate in the research study, subjects must have been washed out from psychoactive medication for at least one month for fluoxetine, two weeks for other SSRIs and neuroleptics and five days for stimulants prior to MRI scanning, with the exception of stable doses greater than three months duration of medication for seizure disorder.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Total Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS_R)</title>
        <description>The RBS-R is an assessment that includes Sameness, Self-Injurious Behavior, Ritualistic, Compulsive, and Restrictive Behavior subscales. The assessments are completed by caregivers for the past week, with consideration of frequency,ease of redirecting and extent to which behavior interferes with functioning compared to a typically developing child of the same age and gender. Scores are rated from 0 - behavior does not occur to 3 - behavior occurs and is a serious problem. There are 43 items and 5 subscales. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. total score is the sum of all items in all subscales.
The subscales are stereotyped behaviors 6 items, self-injurious behaviors 8 items, Compulsive behaviors- 8 items, Ritualistic Behaviors 6 items, Sameness 11 items, restricted behaviors 4 items.Total score ranges from 0 to 129.</description>

        <description>The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Pervasive Developmental Disorder Version (CY-BOCS-PDD) is a clinician-rated interview designed to evaluate repetitive behavior in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). It is a modification of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), developed to assess typically-developing children with obsessive compulsive behavior. Because of language limitations in children with PDDs the CY-BOCSâ€”PDD only includes the five compulsion items: Time Spent, Interference, Distress, Resistance of repetitive behavior, and Control of repetitive behavior. Each item is rated from 0 (none) through 4 (extreme), and scores can range from 0 to 20, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Usually a score &gt; than 8 is considered clinically significant.</description>
