      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) followed by targeted immune therapy Gemtuzumab
      Ozogamicin patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
      (JMML)/myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) will be safe and well tolerated.

    <textblock>
      Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (CMA-676) is a chemotherapeutic agent consisting of a recombinant
      humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated with calicheamicin, a highly potent cytotoxic
      antitumor antibiotic. The antibody portion of Gemtuzumab binds specifically to the CD33
      antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed on the surface of leukemic
      blasts, normal and leukemic myeloid colony-forming cells, including leukemic clonogenic
      precursors, but excluding pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and nonhematopoietic cells.
      This results in formation of a complex that is internalized, upon which the calicheamicin
      derivative is released within the lysosomes of the myeloid cell. The free calicheamicin
      derivative then binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), resulting in DNA double strand breaks
      and consequential cell death. Over 80% of AML patients possess myeloid blast cells with CD33
      surface antigen expression.
