  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major surgery is still associated with a high rate of postoperative morbidity despite
      improved techniques in surgical management. Surgery-induced alterations of the immune system
      are well described and may play a role in the genesis of postoperative complications. It has
      been shown by several large scale clinical trials, that the use of immunonutrition in
      postoperative cancer surgery, trauma and critically ill patients resulted in an improved
      immunocompetence and/or reduced postoperatively infectious morbidity and/or length of
      hospital stay.The pre-operative regimen was between 5 to 7 days of treatment. The aim of this
      trial is to evaluate if a shorter administration of 3 days pre-operatively would be
      beneficial as well.
