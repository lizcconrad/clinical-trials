  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of escalating doses of a
      genetically attenuated parasite malaria vaccine (p52-/p36- GAP vaccine) in healthy
      malaria-naive adults. The study will also assess preliminary efficacy of p52-/p36- GAP
      vaccine following primary experimental challenge with P. falciparum sporozoites. Lastly, the
      study will assess immunogenicity of p52-/p36- GAP in malaria-naïve healthy adults and
      preliminary efficacy of p52-/p36- GAP vaccine following primary experimental re-challenge
      with P. falciparum sporozoites.

             assessment and clinical examination before entering into the study

          -  Volunteers must have low cardiac risk factors according to the NHANES I criteria and a
