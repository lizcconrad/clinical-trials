  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia, especially for laparoscopic surgery, can cause post-operative nausea and
      vomiting. Most patients are given two drugs, decadron and ondansetron, to try to minimize
      this. This study is to determine if a new drug, aprepitant, would add any benefit in terms of
      post-op nausea prevention. All laparoscopic cholecystectomy study patients will receive
      decadron and ondansetron. Half the patients will receive aprepitant in addition. The other
      half will receive placebo. The study will be randomized and double-blind.
