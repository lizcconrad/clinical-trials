      In the investigators study, the investigators will focus on the screening of the related
      proteins and miRNA to IBS in order to reveal the possible clues or molecular mechanism for
      this disorder.

      For the proteomic procedures, Our study groups extracted proteins from the cecum and sigmoid
      colon samples and ran on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The proteins on 2-DE
      were visualized by the silver stain, and then gel maps were scanned and analyzed with the
      Image Master 2D Elite. The obvious abnormal protein spots were identified by the mass
      spectrometry. Western blot 、 immunohistochemistry 、 mRNA and miRNA were also performed for
      further verification of the proteins.

      The investigators enrolled IBS-D and IBS-C patients on the Rome III criteria and healthy
      volunteers as normal control group. Biopsies were taken from the cecum and sigmoid colon
      under direct vision. Five pieces were taken separately at each site. Four pieces were
      processed by cold saline water and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately while the other one
      was fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin three days later.
