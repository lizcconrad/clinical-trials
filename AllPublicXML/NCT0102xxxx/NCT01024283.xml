      The principal research objective of this additional research protocol is to support the
      collection, storage and use of tumour and surrogate (peripheral blood mononuclear cells -
      PBMNCs). The objective of this study is to perform assays to study pharmacodynamic (PD)
      markers that confirm target modulation.

      Study objectives -

        1. Evaluation of HSP70, p-ERK, ERK, p-AKT and AKT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           (PBMNC). Evaluation of p-AKT and AKT will be done by commercially available Meso Scale
           Discovery (MSD) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, while HSP70 will be
           studied using ELISA techniques developed within the Institute of Cancer Research.

        2. Evaluation of HSP70, p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK, ERK, HER-2 and p-HER2 in tumour tissue.
           Evaluation of p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK, ERK, HER-2 and p-HER2 will be done by commercially
           available MSD ELISA kits, while HSP70 will be studied using ELISA techniques developed
           within the Institute of Cancer Research.

      Study design - All patients entering the open label, phase I dose escalation and phase II
      expansion arms of AUY922A at the Royal Marsden Hospital will be asked to participate in this
      study. Patients will not have to attend additional appointments for this study and samples
      will be taken during visits for the planned Phase I/II clinical trial. Consent to donate
      samples for this research study is voluntary and patients will be asked to sign a separate
      consent form.
