      This study is to identify the following problems and questions with respect to the safety and
      effectiveness of Xarelto in comparison with other pharmacologic agents in the prophylaxis of
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a large sample of patients who undergo elective total hip
      replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) in the real-life conditions in its
      registered indication(s) as required by Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA).

        1. Known and unknown adverse reactions, especially serious adverse reactions

        2. Incidence of adverse reactions under the routine drug use

        3. Factors that may affect the safety of the drug

        4. Factors that may affect the effectiveness of the drug

        5. Other safety information related to overuse, drug interaction and laboratory
           abnormalities

        6. Other adverse reactions
