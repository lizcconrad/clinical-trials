      PURPOSE: To affirm the effectiveness and complication rate of postoperative single-dose
      beta-irradiation (RT) with (90) Sr in the case of primary pterygium in a clinical trial.
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: This trial was designed as a prospective, randomized, single center
      study. Surgery was performed in all cases according to the conjunctival autograft technique.
      One thousand and four patients with 108 pterygia were postoperatively randomized to either
      beta-RT or observation. In the case of beta-RT, a (90) Sr eye applicator was used to deliver
      1000 cGy to the sclera surface at a dose rate of between 200 and 250 cGy/min. After
      treatment, both an ophthalmologist and a radiation oncologist performed the follow-up
      examinations. The accumulated data were analyzed using a group sequential test. RESULTS:
      Between February 2007 and September 2008, 104 eyes with primary pterygium were operated on
      according to the trial protocol. Additional treatment was performed within 24 hours
      postoperatively. Four patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 104 patients who could be
      analyzed. In the 54 eyes randomized to receive beta-RT, 5 relapses occurred compared with 8
      recurrences in the 50 eyes that no received RT, for a crude control rate of 90.7 % vs. 84 %,
      respectively. At a mean follow-up of 9 months (range 4- 18), major treatment complications
      had not been observed . CONCLUSION: Single-dose beta-RT of 1000cGy after conjunctival
      autograft surgery is a simple, effective, and safe treatment that reduces the risk of primary
      pterygium recurrence.
