  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in substance abuse treatment smoke four times more than non-substance abusers, and
      suffer high rates of tobacco-related disease and death. While many quit smoking treatments
      exist that have been shown to help non-substance abusers quit smoking, little is known about
      what treatments work for patients in substance abuse treatment. The drug varenicline
      (Chantix) has been shown to be more effective at helping people quit smoking than nicotine
      replacement therapy, bupropion or placebo. However, varenicline has not yet been studied in
      patients in substance abuse treatment. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility,
      effectiveness and safety of varenicline, in combination with counseling, in methadone
      maintained smokers. It also aims to evaluate the link between quitting smoking and alcohol
      and illicit drug use in methadone maintained smokers. We hypothesize that participants
      receiving varenicline will have higher abstinence from smoking than participants receiving
      placebo and that participants taking varenicline will not have significantly more adverse
      reactions than were described in the general population in other studies. We also hypothesize
      that compared to continued smokers, tobacco abstainers will be more likely to be abstinent
      from alcohol or illicit drugs.
