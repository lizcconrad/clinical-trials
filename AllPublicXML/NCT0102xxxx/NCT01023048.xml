    <textblock>
      Gene Security Network has developed a novel technology called Parental SupportTM (PS) which
      is used for Preimplantation Genetic Screening/Diagnosis (PGS/D) during in vitro fertilization
      (IVF). This technology allows IVF physicians to identify embryos, prior to transfer to the
      uterus, which have the best chance of developing into healthy children. The purpose of this
      study is to validate clinical use of PS to detect specific genetic mutation(s) known to cause
      severe inheritable diseases in embryos produced by at-risk couples. This may be done while
      simultaneously testing these embryos for aneuploidy. This study will allow for first of its
      kind commercial PGS/D testing to detect disease-associated genetic mutations together with
      aneuploidy screening.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  couple (mother and father)at risk to have a child with a single gene disorder (e.g.
             cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, sickle cell anemia)

          -  Able to provide laboratory report from commercial CLIA certified laboratory confirming
             presence of disease associated mutation in mother and/or father

          -  couple planning to go through IVF and desiring PGD for the specified mutation

          -  Father (male) willing and able to provide sperm sample

          -  Maternal (female's) age &lt;40 years (e.g., 39 or younger)

          -  CVS/Amnio planned once the pregnancy occurs; willing/able to provide amnio/cvs sample
             for confirmatory testing or provide test results of confirmatory testing performed by
             an external CLIA certified laboratory.

          -  FSH &lt;10 (FSH = Follicle Stimulating Hormone. FSH is an indicator of egg quality and
             rough predictor of egg stimulation success. FSH is routinely measured by the IVF
             center prior to beginning an IVF cycle.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Couples without prior documentation of genetic mutation as specified above

          -  Adult couples where the male partner is not willing, able, or available to provide a
             semen sample.

          -  Maternal age &gt;=40 years

          -  Couple unwilling to have amnio/cvs
