  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if an on demand dosing of 50 mg or 150 mg of GSK557296 demonstrates superior
      efficacy with respect to duration of intra vaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) during an
      8 week study period compared to placebo in men with primary premature ejaculation. An
      assessment of the safety and tolerability of all doses of GSK557296 will be performed as well
      as an assessment for change in the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) from baseline and at
      the end of the 8 weeks of treatment. During the active treatment period study participants
      will be limited to a maximum of 40 doses of GSK557296, or placebo, spilt as 20 doses for both
      4 week intervals.

    <measure>Mean Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT) Compared Over All 8 Weeks of Treatment or Until Premature Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Male participant needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. On-treatment IELT for each participant was calculated by taking the median IELT from all valid on-treatment IELT attempts. Geometric mean IELT for each treatment was compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). LS mean values and two-sided p-values are from the general linear model ln(median IELT)= ln(Baseline IELT) + treatment + cluster. A step-down procedure was used to determine if the efficacy of on-demand GSK557296 was superior to placebo. First, the average of the geometric mean IELTs of the pooled 150mg and 50mg doses of GSK557296 was tested against placebo, and if significance was achieved with this global plateau trend test (p &lt; 0.05), then the simultaneous pair wise comparisons of the 150mg and 50mg doses to placebo would occur (each at an alpha level of 0.05).</description>

    <description>Male participants needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. First dose IELT was the IELT value associated with the first valid SI attempt made during the treatment period. For GSK557296 50 mg and 150 mg: LS mean values and two-sided p-values are from the general linear model ln(median IELT)= ln(Baseline IELT) + treatment + cluster using placebo, GSK557296 50 mg and GSK557296 150 mg treatments.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in IELT Compared After Each 4-week Treatment Period and Over All 8 Weeks or Until Premature Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Male participants needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. Baseline IELT was calculated as the arithmetic mean IELT from valid screening SI attempts. If multiple screening SI attempts were made on the same calendar day, only the IELT from the first attempt was used in the calculation of Baseline IELT. Change from Baseline IELT was calculated by subtracting the Baseline IELT (arithmetic mean IELT from valid screening attempts) from the on-treatment IELT (median IELT from valid on-treatment attempts). Only participants with a Baseline and a post-Baseline IELT value were included.</description>

        <title>Mean Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT) Compared Over All 8 Weeks of Treatment or Until Premature Discontinuation</title>
        <description>Male participant needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. On-treatment IELT for each participant was calculated by taking the median IELT from all valid on-treatment IELT attempts. Geometric mean IELT for each treatment was compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). LS mean values and two-sided p-values are from the general linear model ln(median IELT)= ln(Baseline IELT) + treatment + cluster. A step-down procedure was used to determine if the efficacy of on-demand GSK557296 was superior to placebo. First, the average of the geometric mean IELTs of the pooled 150mg and 50mg doses of GSK557296 was tested against placebo, and if significance was achieved with this global plateau trend test (p &lt; 0.05), then the simultaneous pair wise comparisons of the 150mg and 50mg doses to placebo would occur (each at an alpha level of 0.05).</description>

        <title>Mean IELT Compared After the First Dose of Study Drug or Placebo</title>
        <description>Male participants needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. First dose IELT was the IELT value associated with the first valid SI attempt made during the treatment period. For GSK557296 50 mg and 150 mg: LS mean values and two-sided p-values are from the general linear model ln(median IELT)= ln(Baseline IELT) + treatment + cluster using placebo, GSK557296 50 mg and GSK557296 150 mg treatments. A step-down procedure was used to determine if the efficacy of on-demand GSK557296 was superior to placebo. First, the average of the geometric mean IELTs of the pooled 150mg and 50mg doses of GSK557296 was tested against placebo, and if significance was achieved with this global plateau trend test (p &lt; 0.05), then the simultaneous pair wise comparisons of the 150mg and 50mg doses to placebo would occur (each at an alpha level of 0.05).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in IELT Compared After Each 4-week Treatment Period and Over All 8 Weeks or Until Premature Discontinuation</title>
        <description>Male participants needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. Baseline IELT was calculated as the arithmetic mean IELT from valid screening SI attempts. If multiple screening SI attempts were made on the same calendar day, only the IELT from the first attempt was used in the calculation of Baseline IELT. Change from Baseline IELT was calculated by subtracting the Baseline IELT (arithmetic mean IELT from valid screening attempts) from the on-treatment IELT (median IELT from valid on-treatment attempts). Only participants with a Baseline and a post-Baseline IELT value were included.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in IELT Compared After the First Dose of Study Drug or Placebo</title>
        <description>Male participants needed to make a minimum of 4 attempts at SI and Baseline IELTs were assessed by stop watch measurements for each SI attempt. IELT was the elapsed time from vaginal penetration until ejaculation. First dose IELT was the IELT value associated with the first valid SI attempt made during the treatment period. Baseline IELT was calculated as the arithmetic mean IELT from valid screening SI attempts. If multiple screening SI attempts were made on the same calendar day, only the IELT from the first attempt was used in the calculation of Baseline IELT. Change from Baseline IELT was calculated by subtracting the Baseline IELT (arithmetic mean IELT from valid screening attempts) from the on-treatment IELT (median IELT from valid on-treatment attempts). Only participant with a Baseline IELT and a valid first attempt were included.</description>

        <description>Serum laboratory parameters: Albumin, Alkaline phosphatase (AP), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Direct bilirubin, Total Bilirubin (T. Bilirubin), Calcium, Chloride, Carbon dioxide content/Bicarbonate (CO2/HCO3), Creatinine, Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Total protein (T. Protein), Urea/Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Uric acid were assessed. Baseline laboratory values were the latest values obtained on or before the participant’s Baseline reference date. Unscheduled laboratory values were summarized as at-visit values only in the event that an at-visit laboratory value was missing. The values were presented as high, low or normal values shifted from Baseline value.</description>
