    <textblock>
      This phase I/II, multi-center study is designed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of
      Raltegravir in patients with end stage liver disease and to assess drug-drug interaction when
      Raltegravir is combined with immunosuppressive therapy in liver transplant recipients.

      HIV infected patients with stable plasma HIV-RNA below 50 copies per mL and severe liver
      dysfunction will be switched from their antiretroviral regimen to a combination of
      raltegravir (one 400 mg pill twice daily) and two fully active molecules among nucleosi(ti)de
      analogs and enfuvirtide for a first period of at least 3 months and a second period of at
      least 3 months after liver transplantation, if need be, when a steady state of the
      anticalcineurin will be reached. Pharmacokinetic parameters of raltegravir will be calculated
      during severe liver dysfunction period and after liver transplantation. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters of cyclosporine (or tacrolimus if contra indication to cyclosporine) will be
      compared when administrated alone or combined with raltegravir. Patients will be followed up
      according to standard of care. This study will be divided in two distinct periods (1 and 2)
      lasting 3 months each. Period 1 will start from the inclusion in the study and will generally
      include the switch to raltegravir. Period 2 will start from liver transplantation.
