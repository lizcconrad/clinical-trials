  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study we could show that the early retinal venous vasoconstriction after grid
      photocoagulation in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is closely correlated to the visual
      outcome after three months. This could be of clinical importance, because the degree of
      vasoconstriction might be an early marker of treatment success, compatible with the idea that
      hypoxia is the major trigger of VEGF in BRVO. The present study evaluates the response of
      retinal vessel diameters to anti VEGF treatment with lucentis in patients with BRVO. This is
      done in an effort to gain insight into the retinal hemodynamic consequences of anti VEGF
      treatment in BRVO. The hypothesis that anti VEGF treatment is associated with a
      vasoconstrictor response in retinal vessel in patients with BRVO is tested.

      To investigate the response of retinal vessel diameters to lucentis treatment in patients
      with BRVO and to correlate these changes with changes in functional outcome after 3 months.

      Pilot study in patients scheduled for intravitreal anti-VEGF (Lucentis™) treatment with BRVO

      30 patients with BRVO scheduled for intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment Intravitreous
      administration of Ranibizumab (Lucentis ™)

      Main outcome measure: Retinal vessel diameters

      Secondary outcome measures: Retrobulbar flow velocities, best-corrected visual acuity,
      macular sensitivity assessed with Microperimetry, objective functional response assessed with
      mfERG, anatomic changes in the macula region as assessed with StratusOCT and prototype of a
      Cirrus-OCT(which is available at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of
      Vienna), angiographical outcomes.
