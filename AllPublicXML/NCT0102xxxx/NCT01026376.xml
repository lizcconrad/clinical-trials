      The purpose of this study is to provide Decitabine to patients with Myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) of all FAB (French-American-British) subtypes and Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, and
      High-Risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups, including both previously treated
      and untreated patients.

    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), which includes a diverse group of bone marrow disorders that
      result in ineffective production of blood cells, frequently occurs in elderly patients.
      Historically, the available treatments for MDS have been symptomatic and supportive, and have
      not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis
      (production of all types of blood cells ) or in delaying leukemic evolution (leukemia is a
      serious disease in which too many white blood cells are produced, causing weakness and
      sometimes death). This project is an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), multicenter, international single arm, Phase 3b study to provide expanded
      access to Decitabine for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The purpose of this
      study is to provide Decitabine to patients with Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) according some
      medical classifications: FAB (French-American-British) subtypes and Intermediate-1,
      Intermediate-2, and High-Risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups, including
      previously treated and untreated for MDS. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of Decitabine, as well as the overall response rate according to the
      International Working Group (IWG) 2000 and IWG 2006 response criteria, hematologic
      improvement, cytogenetic response rates (evaluation based on genetic), time to acute myeloid
      leukemia progression or death (evaluate the length of time that passes prior to onset of
      leukemia progression and/or death), blood product transfusion requirements per patient (with
      corresponding dates to collect the number of transfusion independent days), days in the
      hospital (including reason for hospitalization and the ward within the hospital where the
      hospitalizations occur) and, optionally, quality of life assessment (EORTC QLQ C-30). 3-day
      cycle: Decitabine will be administered as a 15mg/m2 administered by continuous infusion over
      3 hours repeated every 8 hours for 3 days. 5-day cycle: Another optional schedule could be
      adopted (at discretion of investigators), Decitabine at a dose of 20mg/m² administered
      intravenously over 1 hour, once daily for 5 consecutive days, of a 4-week cycle. Treatment
      may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit.
