  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether an intensive computerized intervention
      targeted on improving central auditory and visual processing and executive functioning can be
      implemented in youths aged 10-19 with psychotic spectrum disorders, what developmental
      modifications are needed particularly for the younger participants, and whether it is
      possible to develop an appropriate, blinded control intervention.

      The purpose of this study is to provide a foundation for future rigorous study of an
      intervention that translates what we know about refinement of synaptic connections in
      response to environmental stimuli to an individualized intervention that directly improves
      neurocognitive functioning in youths with early onset psychosis(EOP). We will conduct a pilot
      randomized control study that determines the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of
      Intensive Computerized Brain Training (ICBT) in youth with EOP.

      Participants: Seventy youths, aged 10 years to 19 years inclusive will be assessed in the
      study. Forty youths with EOP will be randomly assigned to ICBT or an equally intense
      computerized game activity and 20 will be age, gender and race matched youths with no major
      psychiatric illnesses. We will allow for up to 5 EOP screen failures and up to 5 healthy
      control screen failures.

      Procedures (methods): The forty participants with EOP will be randomly assigned to treatment
      with ICBT or equally intense video game play that also involves attention to sensory stimuli
      and requires increasingly skilled responses. A computer generated randomization schedule will
      be used to make assignments. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, completion of the
      intervention (typically week 20), 3 after completing the intervention (typically month 8) and
      7 months after completing the intervention(typically month 12). The other 20 youths, who
      comprise the typically developing comparison group known as healthy controls, will not
      participate in the computer activity or regular monthly psychiatric visits and will not
      complete satisfaction questionnaires. Up to 10 subjects may not be eligible to participate in
      the study.
