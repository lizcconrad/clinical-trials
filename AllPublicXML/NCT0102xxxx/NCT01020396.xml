             examination of a saline &quot;wet mount&quot; and all of the following criteria: Off-white
             (milky or grey), thin, homogeneous discharge; pH of vaginal fluid &gt; 4.7; a positive

             the clinical response).

          -  Subjects with a Gram's stain slide Nugent score &lt;4.

          -  Subjects who received antifungal or antimicrobial therapy (systemic or intravaginal)
