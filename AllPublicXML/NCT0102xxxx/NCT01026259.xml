  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if local warming of surgical wounds improves
      healing and helps prevent infection. The investigators want to see if warming surgical
      incisions improves oxygen levels and healing in skin close to the incision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) account for 37% of US hospital infections and increase
      morbidity and cost. High rates (10-22%) of SSI are associated with colorectal surgery and
      obesity. Bacterial resistance requires oxygen and higher tissue oxygen limits infection in
      general surgery patients. Control of core and local temperature may increase infection
      resistance by modulating perfusion, oxygenation, angiogenesis and immune cell responses.
      Perioperative hypothermia reduces tissue oxygen while normothermia lowers SSI rates. Warming
      injured tissues locally may offer additional benefit. Warming incisions immediately after
      surgery and intermittently for two days after gastric bypass or colectomy surgery reduced
      infection rates in a pilot sample. Systematic study of clinical outcomes and potential
      mechanisms in a larger study is lacking and is the focus of the current study.
