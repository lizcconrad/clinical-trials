      In this proposal, we will (1) detect the associations between BDNF and Trk B gene DNA
      methylation, histone modification, psychotic symptoms, obesity, suicide and antipsychotic
      drug responses in Taiwanese patients (2) discuss the possible mechanisms of epigenetic
      regulation of BDNF and Trk B in schizophrenia patients.

      A total 160 subjects (80 subjects every year, including 40 healthy controls and 40
      schizophrenia patients) will be recruited during a 2-year period. The first year, the
      baseline data of BDNF and Trk B DNA methylation, protein and mRNA levels in all subjects will
      be collected and the following 1 months data will also be collected in schizophrenia with
      antipsychotic drug treatments. The second year, the baseline data of BDNF and Trk B histone
      modification in all subjects will be collected.

        This study will be conducted in our clinical setting. By a semi-structured interview for
        DSM-IV criteria, total 160 subjectes (80 subjects every year, including 40 healthy controls
        and 40 schizophrenia patients with acute exacerbation) will be recurited during a 2-year
        period. The data of blood BDNF and Trk B DNA methylation and histone remodelling of all
        subjects will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. The clinical screening and assessment in schizophrenic patients：

          1. 40 schizophrenia patients will be recruited in psychiatric inpatients according to
             DSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994) by a structured interview (SCID). The assessment will be
             done by two senior psychiatrists. The intra-rater and inter-rater reliability will be
             done before this project started

          2. age : 18-65 years old.

          3. The patients had the ability to complete the written inform consent.。

          4. The choice of antipsychotic drugs depended on the need of patients in natural
             treatment procedure. They included conventional drugs, eg.haloperidol 10-20 mg/day；SDA
             (serotonin dopamine antagonist) drug, eg. clozapine 100-400 mg/day or risperidone
             3-6mg/day. The choice of the medication was according to the need of patients
             including previous responses and side effects.

          5. PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome)(Kay, 1987,1988&amp;1989) for positive, negative
             symptoms and severity.

          6. Check body mass index (BMI): if BMI&lt;24: normal; 24&lt;BMI&lt;27: overweight; BMI&gt;27: obesity
             (Taiwan criteria, 2004). If the patients were overweight or obesity, the lipid
             profiles would be done and we would consult the experts to assess these patients. The
             condition for diet control and daily activity will be observed. If the condition was
             extremely abnormal, the case will be excluded.

          7. Suicide behavior in tis study includes complete suicide and suicide attempt.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patients had systemic diseases, including metabolic, heart, and liver diseases。

          2. The patients had received any drugs before entering this protocol.

          3. The patients were heavy smokers or dependent on alcohol.
