      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving CT-guided
      accelerated radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount
      of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying giving radiation therapy followed by surgery to see
      how well it works in treating patients with early-stage breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  is to investigate the impact of a short fractionated schedule given preoperatively on
           local control, cosmesis and breast fibrosis.

        -  To further design optimal treatment strategies for individual breast cancer patients
           treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) on the basis of biological parameters,
           including the expression profile of the primary tumor, for both m-RNA as for micro-RNA,
           with first, a focus on radiotherapy responsiveness and second, on local recurrence rate,
           distant metastases and survival.

        -  proteomics will be studied in fine-needle aspiration samples. A classifier can be build
           (genomic or proteomic or any kind of molecular signature) to identify responders and
           non-responders

        -  quality of life

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo image-guided preoperative accelerated partial-breast irradiation
      (PAPBI) 10 times over 12 days (10 x 4 Gy) and later in the study 5 times 6 Gy. Six weeks
      after completion of image-guided PAPBI, patients undergo surgery.
