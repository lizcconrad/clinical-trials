  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study we aim to determine the effect of allergy immunotherapy in decreasing
      asthma and allergy related disease in children who had multiple episodes of wheezing and who
      are at high risk for developing persisting asthma. These risks include a history of asthma in
      the parents, allergies to environmental allergens (such as dust mite, cockroach or mouse) and
      other allergic diseases such as eczema or food allergies. Allergy Immunotherapy is not new
      and has been practiced for many years to treat asthma and environmental allergies in older
      children and adults, but has not yet been systematically studied in young children.

    <intervention_name>Allergen extracts (subcutaneous injections)</intervention_name>
    <description>Allergy immunotherapy consists of regular subcutaneous injections of an individualized mixture of allergen extracts according to the allergy sensitization profile of each child. Increasing doses of allergen extract are given in 1-2 injections until a predetermined maintenance dose is reached. This maintenance dose varies by extract and accords to the general practice guidelines of immunotherapy. To increase safety the cumulative monthly maintenance doses are divided into biweekly visits during the maintenance phase (year 2-3)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children between 18 months through 3 years who had at least 2 episodes of wheezing
             prior to enrolment.

          -  Positive skin tests or specific IgE antibody titers to at least one of common airborne
             allergens: Dust Mite, cat, cockroach, mouse, dog, pollen (all allergy testing can be
             done at the screening visit at the study site).

          -  The child must also fulfill the criteria for high risk of developing persistent asthma
             by meeting at least one of the following major conditions OR 2 of the following minor
             conditions:

               -  Major criteria: History of atopic dermatitis and/or parental history of asthma.

               -  Minor criteria: MD-diagnosed allergic rhinitis, wheezing unrelated to colds,
                  blood eosinophils above 4%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child has a severe systemic condition (other than allergy or asthma) including
             (but not limited to) seizures, major congenital anomalies, physical and intellectual
             delay, cerebral palsy, chest surgery, tuberculosis, primary or secondary
             immunodeficiency or cardiac disorder (except a hemodynamically insignificant ASD, VSD
             or heart murmur).

          -  The child was born following 35 or less weeks of gestation.

          -  Parental report that the child received oxygen for more than 5 days in the neonatal
             period, or required mechanical ventilation at any time since birth.

          -  The child fails to thrive, defined as crossing of two major growth percentile lines
             during the last year.

          -  The child has chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP), cystic fibrosis or any other
             chronic lung disease.

          -  The child ever received immunotherapy.

          -  The child ever received i.v. gammaglobulins or immunosuppressants (other than
             corticosteroids for asthma).

          -  History of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation which required intubation and
             mechanical ventilation.
