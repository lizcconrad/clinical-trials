    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help answer the following research question(s):

        -  To test if taking LY2599506 for 12 weeks controls blood sugar better than taking
           glyburide for 12 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the safety of LY2599506 in participants with diabetes.

        -  To determine if LY2599506 has the ability to control blood sugar in participants with
           diabetes.

        -  To determine how much LY2599506 should be given to participants.

        -  To determine if LY2599506 has an effect on a participant's weight.

      The study design consists of 4 study periods: a screening period, a 4-week dose adjustment
      period, an 8-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow up period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life -5 Dimension (EQ-5D) at 12 Weeks and 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain, and anxiety/depression with 3 options each. Total scores range from 5 (no problem) to 15 (more severe or frequent problems). An algorithm maps the 5 domain outcomes to a single index (0-1). A higher score indicates better perceived health state. Study GMAJ was terminated after enrolling 38 participants.

    <description>DTSQ, an 8-item questionnaire, measures satisfaction with treatment, perceived frequency of hyperglycemia, and perceived frequency of hypoglycemia. Response options range from 6 (best case) to 0 (worst case). Total scores for treatment satisfaction range from 0-36. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.

    <description>Assesses 2 hypoglycemia domains, with each item score from 0 (never engages in behavior) to 4 (always engages in behavior): Behavioral (15 items; range 0-60) and Worry about hypoglycemia (18 items; range 0-72). Total score is the sum of both domains (range 0-132). Higher scores indicate greater negative impact. Study GMAJ was terminated after enrolling 38 participants. Given the small sample size overall, and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading. As a result, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

          <description>Fasting lipids were measured after an overnight fast. Lipids measured included triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids. Study GMAJ was terminated after enrolling 38 participants.

Study GMAJ was terminated after enrolling only 38 participants. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure is not presented.</description>

          <description>Hypoglycemia: any time a participant experienced a sign/symptom associated with hypoglycemia or had blood glucose &lt;70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]). The 30-day adjusted rate=(total number of episodes between 2 time intervals/number of days between intervals) X 30 days. Study GMAJ was terminated after enrolling 38 participants.
