      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate by RECIST criteria of oral
      dichloroacetate in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic and pretreated breast and
      non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, approximately 180,000 new cases of breast cancer occur annually, and
      there are more than 40,000 deaths. More than 150,000 cases develop each year in Canada and
      the European community together, resulting in over 60,000 deaths from breast cancer. The vast
      majority of patients who die from breast cancer succumb to metastatic disease. Endocrine
      therapy and chemotherapy (using either sequential single agents or combination regimens)
      remain the principal treatments for women with metastatic breast cancer. A wide variety of
      classes of chemotherapeutic agents have activity as single agents. Median survival remains
      approximately two years for women with metastatic breast cancer, and less than 3% of patients
      will experience long-term survival after treatment. The development of new treatment
      strategies is therefore essential to improve outcome for patients with metastatic breast
      cancer. The population selected for this study will have previously received, where
      appropriate, those drugs with clearly defined survival advantages (anthracyclines, taxanes,
      trastuzumab, and hormonal therapy).

      Patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer are considered incurable. Palliative
      chemotherapies, such as platinum-based doublet, Taxotere or Pemetrexed or Erlotinib (an
      epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase) have been proven to improve symptoms, and survival
      in patients with good performance status. Despite these treatments, the median survival of
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is about one year. Therefore, there is an urgent need
      to develop novel therapy in these patients.
