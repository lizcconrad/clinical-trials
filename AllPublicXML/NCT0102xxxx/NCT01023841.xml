      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of bimatoprost solution 0.03% once daily
      application to the upper eyelid margins compared with vehicle in treating eyelash loss or
      hypotrichosis (inadequate or not enough eyelashes) in children.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 1-Grade Improvement From Baseline in the Global Eyebrow Assessment (GEA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>The physician evaluated the overall eyelash prominence in both eyes using the GEA 4-point scale: 1= minimal, 2= moderate, 3= marked and 4= very marked. A 1-grade improvement in the GEA score from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Upper Eyelash Length as Measured by Digital Image Analysis (DIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs were taken of the eyelashes and assessed using DIA. Length was measured in millimeters (mm). Data from both eyes were averaged for each participant for analysis. A positive change from Baseline indicated longer length (improvement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Upper Eyelash Thickness as Measured by DIA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs were taken of the eyelashes and assessed using DIA. Eyelash thickness (fullness) was assessed across both eyes as an average and is measured in millimeters squared (mm^2). A positive change from Baseline indicated fuller eyelashes (improvement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Upper Eyelash Darkness as Measured by DIA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Photographs were taken of the eyelashes and assessed using DIA. Eyelash darkness (intensity) was measured in both eyes and averaged for analysis using a scale where 0=black and 255=white. A negative change from Baseline indicated darker eyelashes (improvement).</description>
