  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention that combines positive
      affect and self-affirmation with motivational interviewing (TRIUMPH) improves blood pressure
      control compared to an educational/behavioral contract intervention at 12 months. We
      hypothesize that a greater proportion of participants in the experimental arm of TRIUMPH will
      have adequate blood pressure control as defined by Seventh Joint National Committee on
      Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC-7.)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRIUMPH is designed to build on the findings of our previous studies by combining positive
      affect and self affirmation with motivational interviewing in order to increase blood
      pressure control in community based practices that care for large numbers of hypertensive
      black patients. Patients in both the educational and behavioral contract control group and
      would receive a workbook, would make a behavioral contract, and a home blood pressure
      monitor. The positive affect/self-affirmation group would receive the same components as the
      control group. In addition the experimental group would receive a positive
      affect/self-affirmation induction and motivational interviewing.

      Both the control group and the experimental group would be followed at 2 month intervals. The
      outcome blood pressure control in this group will be contrasted to the knowledge/behavioral
      contract group. We hypothesize that we can increase the percent of patients who have blood
      pressure control to 75%.

    <description>The PASA group-intervention will receive small gifts one week prior to their scheduled follow up. The PASA intervention involves reminding participants to think about their proud and positive moments. The motivational interviewing intervention includes assessing the patient's motivation and confidence; elicit barriers and concerns; summarize in a non-threatening manner the 'pros' and 'cons' of patient's concerns, thereby eliciting positive self-motivational statements about the behavior. Follow up will be every two months.</description>
