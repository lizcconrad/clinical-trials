      The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of the selective serotonin
      re-uptake inhibitor, Escitalopram, in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      in an open clinical trial.

      A secondary aim is to determine whether treatment with escitalopram increases plasma
      allopregnanolone levels in patients with PTSD and if increases in allopregnanolone levels are
      correlated with treatment efficacy.
