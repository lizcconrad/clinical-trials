    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of double-blind study drug (if on FDC in 905-CL-055) or first open-label dose up to 30 days after last dose of open-label study drug (in 905-CL-057) (up to 56 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is monitored by collecting AEs, which include abnormal lab parameters, vital signs or ECG data if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect, was life-threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization or was considered medically important. AEs were assessed by the Investigator for intensity (mild-no disruption of normal daily activities, moderate-affected normal daily activities or severe-inability to perform daily activities) and for causal relationship to study drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that occurred after the intake of first dose of double-blind study drug (if on FDC in 905-CL-055) or after first open-label dose until 30 days after the last dose of open-label study drug (in 905-CL-057).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 52 weeks of FDC treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is a validated global questionnaire to assess the degree of urinary symptoms, based on answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms:
Incomplete emptying of the bladder
Intermittency
Weak stream
Hesitancy
Frequency
Urgency
Nocturia Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the symptom. Total score can range from 0 to 35 (mildly symptomatic to severely symptomatic).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 52 weeks of FDC treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Perception of the Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS) is a validated scale completed as part of the micturition diary. For each micturition and/or incontinence episode, the participant rated the degree of associated urgency according to the following 5-point categorical scale:
0. No urgency;
1. Mild urgency;
2. Moderate urgency;
3. Severe urgency;
4. Urgency incontinence TUS/TUFS was calculated as the sum of the PPIUS gradings from the 3-day diary divided by the number of days on which urgency grading was recorded. Higher scores indicate more severe urgency.</description>

For each micturition and/or incontinence episode, the participant rated the degree of associated urgency according to the following 5-point categorical scale: 0.No urgency; 1.Mild urgency; 2.Moderate urgency; 3.Severe urgency; 4.Urgency incontinence. TUFS/TUS was the sum of the PPIUS gradings from the 3-day diary divided by the number of days on which urgency grading was recorded.</description>

        <description>Safety is monitored by collecting AEs, which include abnormal lab parameters, vital signs or ECG data if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect, was life-threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization or was considered medically important. AEs were assessed by the Investigator for intensity (mild-no disruption of normal daily activities, moderate-affected normal daily activities or severe-inability to perform daily activities) and for causal relationship to study drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that occurred after the intake of first dose of double-blind study drug (if on FDC in 905-CL-055) or after first open-label dose until 30 days after the last dose of open-label study drug (in 905-CL-057).</description>

        <description>The Patient Perception of the Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS) is a validated scale completed as part of the micturition diary. For each micturition and/or incontinence episode, the participant rated the degree of associated urgency according to the following 5-point categorical scale:
0. No urgency;
1. Mild urgency;
2. Moderate urgency;
3. Severe urgency;
4. Urgency incontinence TUS/TUFS was calculated as the sum of the PPIUS gradings from the 3-day diary divided by the number of days on which urgency grading was recorded. Higher scores indicate more severe urgency.</description>

Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The storage symptom score is the sum of the responses to 3 storage questions (frequency,urgency and nocturia) and ranges from 0 to 15 (mildly symptomatic to severely symptomatic).</description>

          <description>The Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) is a self-reported questionnaire with items relating to Symptom Bother and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL portion consists of an 25-item HRQoL subscale containing the following domains scored from 1 to 6:
coping
concern
sleep
social interaction
Sleep score can range from 8 to 48 (none of the time to all of the time) and transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
