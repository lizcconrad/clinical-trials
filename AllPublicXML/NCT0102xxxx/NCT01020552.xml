    <textblock>
      A descriptive post-intervention study designed to provide data to decision-makers at the
      Kenyan Ministry of Health, the Extending Service Delivery Project (ESD), and Pathfinder
      International about whether and how to scale-up the ESD Project's postabortion care (PAC)
      services package. Approximately three months of data will be collected following the
      introduction of postabortion care job aids in eight public sector health facilities in
      Central Province and Nairobi, Kenya. Postabortion clients and providers will be interviewed;
      facilities providing PAC services will be inventoried using facility checklists.
