  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Earlier studies have found that retinal photography could be very useful for evaluating the
      condition of microcirculation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients. The
      architectural changes in retinal vascularisation strongly correlates with macrovascular
      remodeling. Also, recent founding suggests a possible close anatomical parallel between both
      the macrovascular and the microvascular blood.

      Our objectives are to assess (1) in which age and sex subgroups, if any, retinal vascular
      alteration in arterioles and venules can be predictive for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality; and (2) whether variations in arteriolar or venular caliber will predict better
      cardiovascular pathogenesis in normal and patient population. If the association between the
      diameter of the retinal vessels and the risks of cardiovascular disease is verified during
      this study, the impact on prevention would be enormous. The retinal microvascular change
      could become a powerful biomarker in the early detection of the cardiovascular pathogenesis
      and death risk
