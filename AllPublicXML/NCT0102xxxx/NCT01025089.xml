  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out the good and the bad effects that the
      combination of cetuximab with the traditional chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, doxorubicin,
      and cyclophosphamide has when given to patients with later stage thymoma or thymic carcinoma
      before surgery. The physicians will also look at changes in genes in the tumor that may
      relate to the effectiveness of cetuximab

    <description>This is a multicenter, open-label phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent cetuximab in patients with clinical Masaoka stage II-IVA thymoma or thymic carcinoma.. Patients will initially receive weekly cetuximab for 4 weeks to assess tumor response to cetuximab alone. Patients will then undergo weekly cetuximab along with concurrent CAP for 4 cycles. At the completion of this regimen, patients will undergo surgical resection and the specimen will be evaluated for CPR.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive single agent cetuximab infusion starting with a 400mg/m2 IV loading dose on day 1 of week 1, followed by weekly infusions (250mg/m2) on day 1 of weeks 2 3, and 4. Patients will receive single agent cetuximab infusion starting with a 400mg/m2 IV loading dose on day 1 of week 1, followed by weekly infusions (250mg/m2) on day 1 of weeks 2 3, and 4. Patients who have completed the neo-adjuvant treatment regimen, who have no evidence of distant progression, and who are medically operable will proceed to surgical resection within 6 weeks of the last infusion.</description>
