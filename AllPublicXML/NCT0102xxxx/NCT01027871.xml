      Comparison of fasting blood glucose levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes after 12 weeks of
      treatment with a new basal insulin analog or with insulin glargine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in this study will continue to use their stable prestudy dose of metformin and/or a
      sulfonylurea. Prestudy therapy also includes once daily insulin glargine or NPH insulin. The
      12-week active treatment phase will be followed by a 4-week follow-up period, during which
      patients will return to the basal insulin recommended by the investigator.
