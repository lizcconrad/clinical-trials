      Extracts produced from Echinacea purpurea are traditionally used for the prevention and the
      acute treatment of influenzal infections like the common cold. The aim of this clinical study
      is to assess clinical safety and efficacy of a treatment with Echinacea in comparison to
      placebo. 750 healthy subjects with a history of equal or more than 2 cold episodes per year
      will be recruited during October and November 2009 and will be treated with either Echinacea
      or placebo over a period of 4 months.

      Throughout the study period adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (AEs with at
      least a possible causal relation to the treatment) will be recorded.

      Common cold related symptoms will be recorded in a daily diary.
