  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nilotinib is efficacious in the treatment
      of metastatic and/or inoperable melanoma harboring a c-Kit mutation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial began as a multi-center, randomized, Phase III, controlled trial for nilotinib vs
      (DTIC) dacarbazine to assess the efficacy and safety of nilotinib (400 mg bid) in patients
      with c-Kit mutated metastatic and/or inoperable melanoma. The study was open to patients with
      mucosal or acral melanoma.

      Due to substantial difficulties identifying and recruiting eligible patients, the trial
      design was altered from a randomized, two-arm, Phase III study to a single-arm, Simon
      two-stage Phase II study with protocol Amendment 2 (27-Jul-2011). While the original protocol
      required the recruitment of 120 patients, this amendment required the study to recruit only
      41 patients (patients randomized to nilotinib prior to Amendment 2 were to be counted in this
      total, but those randomized to dacarbazine ( DTIC ) DTIC were not). Patients randomized to
      DTIC were allowed to cross-over to nilotinib, either immediately or at the time of
      progression.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 39 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a confirmed complete response or partial response (CR+PR) determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Durable Overall Response Rate (DORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 39 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DORR was defined as the rate of best overall response (CR+PR) lasting at least 12 weeks determined by RECIST v1.0 based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). The duration of ORR responders is computed from the date of first documented response (CR/PR) to the date of first documented progression or death due to underlying disease. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no worsening of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 39 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.0, as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of all target lesions, from smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline; or a new lesion; or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 39 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Objective Response (TOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 39 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TOR was defined as the time between the start date of treatment until first documented confirmed response of CR or PR determined by RECIST v1.0 based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 39 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DCR was defined as the proportion of participants with an overall response of CR of any duration, PR of any duration, or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 12 weeks from start of treatment. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions; PD, a &gt;=20% increase in TLs, clearly worsening of non-TLs, or emergence of new lesions; SD: no change or small changes that do not meet previously given criteria for CR, PR or PD.</description>

        <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a confirmed complete response or partial response (CR+PR) determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

        <title>Durable Overall Response Rate (DORR)</title>
        <description>DORR was defined as the rate of best overall response (CR+PR) lasting at least 12 weeks determined by RECIST v1.0 based on local investigators' assessment (CT/MRI/photography). The duration of ORR responders is computed from the date of first documented response (CR/PR) to the date of first documented progression or death due to underlying disease. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion; PR: a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no worsening of non-TLs, and no new lesions. For CR or PR, tumor measurements must be confirmed by 2nd assessments at least 4 weeks apart.</description>
