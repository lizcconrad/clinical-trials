  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I extension study, the investigators seek to test the safety of both higher
      doses of plerixafor as well as intravenous dosing to maximize inhibition of the target,
      CXCR4.

      In this study, we are seeking to target the leukemia microenvironment to overcome disease
      resistance. We hypothesize that by disrupting the interaction of leukemic blasts with the
      bone marrow microenvironment, we may sensitize leukemic blasts to the effects of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy. In current formulations, the volume of plerixafor required to administer doses
      higher than 240 mcg/kg may result in significant discomfort with repeated daily injections.
      In this phase I extension study, we seek to test the safety of both higher doses of
      plerixafor as well as intravenous dosing to maximize inhibition of the target, CXCR4.
