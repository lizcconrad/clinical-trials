  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Restorative yoga versus stretching
      exercises will reduce risk factors for metabolic syndrome in adults with metabolic syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic abnormalities, including visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,
      hypertension and dyslipidemia, occur together and are associated with excessive caloric
      intake and inadequate physical activity. Persons with the metabolic syndrome are at high risk
      of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle and behavioral
      interventions reduce these risks, but many individuals with increased metabolic risk find it
      difficult to achieve and maintain weight loss and increased physical activity.

      We are conducting a rigorous randomized controlled trial at two clinical sites to determine
      if Restorative yoga compared to stretching exercises improves the metabolic syndrome among
      overweight and underactive individuals who meet criteria for the metabolic syndrome.

    <description>Group yoga sessions: Participants will attend 90 minute yoga group classes for 48 weeks: twice a week for 6 weeks, then once weekly during weeks 7 to 12, then every other week for weeks 13 - 24, and once a month for 6 months. We plan a progressive series of classes, with a subset of poses for each class and then selecting individual poses to focus on in each class.
Home yoga practice: Participants will be given a video disk (DVD) of the yoga postures at the start of the yoga intervention practice. We will also provide the yoga participants with a written manual with pictures and descriptions of each posture that they will be taught in the group sessions. The participants will be asked to practice the postures taught during their group sessions at home at least three times a week with the assistance of the DVD and manual. Each participant will be given a set of yoga props for their use at home. We will ask all participants to keep a log of their home practice sessions</description>

    <description>Group classes: Participants will attend 90 minute group stretching classes for 48 weeks: twice a week for 6 weeks, then once weekly during weeks 7 to 12, then every other week for weeks 13 - 24, and once a month for 6 months. The stretches will address all body parts, including cervical, upper extremity, thoracic, lumbar, pelvic, and lower extremity musculature.
Home stretching practice: Each participant will receive a written manual with pictures and descriptions of each stretch that they will be learning in group sessions and a DVD with instruction on each of the stretches. The participants will be asked to practice the stretches taught during their group sessions at home at least three times a week with the assistance of the DVD and manual. Each participant will be given stretching supplies. We will ask all participants to keep a log of their home practice sessions.</description>
