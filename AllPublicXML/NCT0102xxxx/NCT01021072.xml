  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to block interleukin-1 alpha activity with a True Human
      monoclonal antibody, thus interrupting the inflammatory response that supports tumor
      growth/metastasis and which drives the cachexic process.

      An adaptive design will be employed which will allow for the exploration of different dosing
      regimens, as well as tumor types that show preliminary evidence of efficacy.
