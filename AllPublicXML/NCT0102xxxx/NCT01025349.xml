    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody currently used for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
      It works by preventing the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). The drug has been
      shown to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activity. Previous research showed
      positive findings in other solid tumors that had metastasized. In this study, the
      investigators are investigating the response of adding bevacizumab to conventional
      chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeted chemotherapy has gradually become the mainstay of cancer treatment in present day.
      Targeted medications such as trastuzumab, bevacizumab and lapatinib have recently been more
      extensively adopted for many cancers, particularly breast cancer. Among these targeted
      medications, bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody acting on vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor and it works by preventing the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).
      Published articles indicated that monotherapy of bevacizumab on breast cancer showed only a
      9-17% response rate, while combining with paclitaxel, the treatment outcome appeared to
      improve progression-free survival and the objective response rate. We are curious about the
      additive effect of bevacizumab on conventional chemotherapy, the toxicities induced when
      combined target therapy with conventional chemotherapy and the duration of remission that
      these treatment could achieve. In this study, we utilized bevacizumab, docetaxel plus
      cisplatin for metastatic breast cancer patients and furthermore, we are evaluated the
      treatment response, toxicities and duration of remission as our main goals.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-2.

          -  Normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

          -  Age ≤ 65 years.

          -  AST/ALT 2.5 ULN (&lt; 5 ULN if liver metastases).

          -  Serum bilirubin 3 ULN, Serum Creatinine 1.5 ULN.

          -  Urine dipstick of proteinuria &lt;2+.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood
             pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg).

          -  Prior exposure to bevacizumab.

          -  Planned radiotherapy for underlying disease (prior completed radiotherapy treatment
             allowed), except bone metastasis.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease for example
             cerebrovascular accidents (≤ 6 months), myocardial infarction (≤ 6 months), unstable
             angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart
             failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. Stroke in the preceding six
             months.

          -  Evidence of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates use of bevacizumab with chemotherapy.

          -  Ongoing treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or other medications known to predispose
             to gastrointestinal ulceration.

             uncontrolled illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes it undesirable
             for the patient to enter the trial.
