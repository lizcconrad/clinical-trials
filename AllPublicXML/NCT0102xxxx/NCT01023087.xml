  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colistin is a relatively old antibiotic drug which its use has been abandoned through the
      1970s because it was considered nephrotoxic.

      Recently ( the last decade) it has been reappraised because multidrug resistant Gram negative
      bacteria have emerged causing life threatening infections with no other good enough
      treatment. Moreover, more controlled studies from the recent years show less toxic effect of
      the drug.

      The investigators' study is a prospective study comparing renal function in a group of
      hospitalized patients with sepsis (infection) receiving intravenous treatment with Colistin
      (antibiotics) with a control group which its patients receive other non nephrotoxic
      antibiotics.

      The investigators' study hypothesis is that patients receiving Colistin would have renal
      function decline in higher rates than those seen usually in hospitalized patients in the
      Internal medicine wards with sepsis.

      Another goal of the study is to find correlation between Colistin levels in the plasma (after
      Colistin reaches steady state) and nephrotoxicity seen during or after use of this drug.

      measurement of the Colistin levels are planned to be done by immunological methods, by
      developing specific antibodies to Colistin in a laboratory in France.
