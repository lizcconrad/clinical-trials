          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
             solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for which YM155 has the potential, based on
             preclinical and/or clinical data, to show efficacy, namely:

               -  castrate resistant prostate cancer

               -  non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Inadequate bone marrow, renal and/or hepatic function

          -  History of being treated for other malignancy within 5 years except for treated basal
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Participation in any clinical study within 4 weeks prior to start of the first dose of
             study medication
