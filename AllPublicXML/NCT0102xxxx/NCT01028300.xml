  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative disc disease (DDD) refers to a syndrome in which a degenerating disc causes
      chronic back pain, significantly impacting an individual's ability to function. The condition
      is most commonly diagnosed in the lumbosacral spinal segments L3-S1. The condition often
      starts with an injury to the disc space. The injury weakens the disc and creates excessive
      motion at the corresponding vertebral level. Over time, the segmental instability and
      associated neurological compromise combined with ongoing inflammatory processes that occur in
      and around the disc produce low back pain. The reparative processes in the disc are poor,
      thus the painful symptoms can become chronic.

      Premature degeneration at adjacent levels of the spine remains one of the more vexing
      problems facing spinal surgeons when advising relatively young people to consider lumbar
      fusion surgery. Stopping the motion changes the mechanics of the back (which is designed for
      motion and flexibility) and results in the transfer of the loads and stresses to the adjacent
      vertebral segments. It is therefore intuitive to pursue total disc replacement, which allows
      for the treatment of pain due to DDD while re-establishing motion and stability, load
      distribution, and restoring the disc height, as an alternative to spinal fusion surgery.

      The study hypothesis is that military personnel receiving Total Disc Replacement will return
      to the same level of active duty performance as at the time of their most recent successful
      physical readiness test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) in one vertebral level between L3 and S1, where a
             diagnosis of DDD requires:

               1. Back and/or leg (radicular) pain; and

               2. Radiographic confirmation of any one of the following by CT, MRI, discography,
                  plain film, myelography, and/or flexion/extension films:

             i. Decreased disc height &gt; 2 mm; ii. Scarring/thickening of annulus fibrosis; iii.
             Herniated nucleus pulposus; or iv. Vacuum phenomenon.

          2. Skeletally mature adult between the ages of 18 and 50 years at time of surgery.

          3. Failed at least 6 months of conservative therapy.

          4. Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire score ≥ 20/50 (40%) (Interpreted as
             moderate/severe disability).

          5. Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with this protocol
             including adhering to scheduled visits, treatment plan, completing forms, and other
             study procedures.

          6. Plans to remain on active duty for a minimum of two (2) years.

          7. Personally signed and dated the informed consent document prior to any study-related
             procures indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. More than one vertebral level to be treated.

          2. The involved vertebral endplates dimensionally smaller than 34.5 mm in the
             medial-lateral direction and/or 27 mm in the anterior-posterior direction.

          3. Known allergy to polyethylene, cobalt chromium, or molybdenum

          4. Prior fusion surgery at any lumbar vertebral level.

             Osteoporosis Risk Estimation), will be used to screen patients who require a DEXA bone
             mineral density measurement. If DEXA is required, exclusion will be defined as a DEXA
