    <textblock>
      This phase 2b study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy (24 weeks) of MPC-4326 in
      combination with a 2-3 drug optimized background regimen (OBR) relative to the efficacy of a
      3-4 antiretroviral (ARV) regimen in treatment experienced, HIV-1 infected subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard antiretroviral therapies for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, while effective for varying
      lengths of time, can be rendered inadequate for viral suppression by the emergence of drug
      resistant virus, which can include resistance to entire mechanistic classes of drugs. Thus,
      there exists a significant unmet medical need for new highly potent antiretroviral agents
      with novel mechanisms of action. The novel mechanism of action of MPC-4326 suggests that
      MPC-4326 may have utility for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients failing current
      regimens due to the development of drug resistance.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily consent to participate in the study (sign Informed Consent Form), and able
             to understand study procedures and complete the study.

          2. Be at least 18 years of age at the time of screening.

          3. Have a screening plasma HIV-1 RNA value ≥ 1,000 copies/mL

          4. Be receiving an ARV regimen containing at least 3 drugs which has been unchanged for
             at least 8 weeks prior to initial screening.

          5. Have at least two fully active ARVs (exclusive of MPC-4326) as determined by a
             'maximal response' on the vircoTYPE assay; R5 tropism testing (if applicable); and
             treatment history (e.g., naïve to enfuvirtide or integrase inhibitors) that can be
             combined in a regimen containing a maximum of four ARVs for the 3-4d ARV regimen or
             three ARVs for the 2-3-drug OBR to be combined with MPC-4326.

          6. Two NRTIs are not allowed as the only fully-active antiretroviral agents in the
             3-4-drug ARV regimen or in the 2-3-drug OBR

          7. Must have wild type Gag at position 370 (i.e., no polymorphisms at 370)

          8. Have resistance to at least one agent in each of the three 'classic' ARV drug classes
             (NRTI, NNRTI, PI) to include documented evidence of resistance on prior resistance
             tests.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must agree to the use two forms of contraception
             from the time of screening until 90 days after completion of dosing.Surfactant-type
             spermicide gels and contraceptive foam are not recommended, as they increase the rate
             of HIV transmission.

               5. Calculated creatinine clearance (ClCr) &lt;40 mL/min as determined by the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation

          6. Subjects who have received radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents
