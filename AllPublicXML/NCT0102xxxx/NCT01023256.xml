  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GM-CSF is considered to have a key role in the initiation and progression of arthritic
      inflammation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of multiple doses of MOR103, a human antibody to GM-CSF,
      in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that affects 0.5% to 1%
      of the adult population world wide. RA primarily affects the joints and is characterized by
      chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue, which eventually leads to the destruction of
      cartilage, bone and ligaments and can cause joint deformity.

      Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1,
      IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which lead to the
      activation and proliferation of immune cells, are found to be increased in the inflamed
      joint. Several preclinical findings support an anti-GM-CSF therapy for RA.

    <description>Data on treatment-emergent adverse events (MedDRA version 13.0) were collected at each visit (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 16). For a list of serious adverse events and adverse events occurring at a frequency of &gt;5 % (&gt;1 patient) in any treatment group, please see the adverse events listing.</description>

    <description>The primary exploratory efficacy outcome was change from baseline in Disease Activity Score calculated using 28 joints (DAS28) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as the acute phase reactant (0 = no disease activity; 9.3 = maximal disease activity).</description>

    <measure>Percentages of Subjects With American College of Rheumatology 20% Improvement (ACR20) at Week 4</measure>

    <description>The percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response (20% improvement based on ACR improvement criteria) in each group. ACR20 improvement criteria require at least 20% improvement in both swollen and tender joints counts and 3 out of 5 of the following parameters: pain visual analog scale, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein), and functional questionnaire.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4 (1 week after last MOR103 dose) and change from baseline to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Swollen joint counts were based on 66 joints and tender joint counts were based on 69 joints.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at week 4 (1 week after last MOR103 dose) and change from baseline at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported outcomes included patient's self-assessment of pain (measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale [VAS] from 0 = best to 100 = worst), the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI; 0 = best to 3 = worst), the patient's global assessment of disease activity (measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale [VAS] from 0 = best to 100 = worst), and fatigue, which was measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-fatigue self-assessment scale (0 = worst; 52 = best).</description>

    <measure>Change From Screening in Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies Mean Sum Score for Synovitis at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from screening to week 4 (1 week after last MOR103 dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the wrist and hand on the side with the most swollen joints (or the right side if swollen joints were equivalent). The 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints and 3 wrist joints (distal radioulnar, radiocarpal, and intercarpal-carpometacarpal joints) were scored on a scale of 0 = no synovitis to 3 = severe synovitis. MRIs were scored by 2 independent experts blinded to patient data and chronology. The sum score is the average of the 2 reader scores for each of the 7 joints. The range of the sum score is thus 0 = no synovitis in any joint to 21 = severe synovitis in all joints.</description>

In the MOR103 1.0 mg/kg group, one patient had missing data so the mean was calculated on 21 patients.</description>

        <title>Change From Screening in Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies Mean Sum Score for Synovitis at Week 4</title>
        <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the wrist and hand on the side with the most swollen joints (or the right side if swollen joints were equivalent). The 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints and 3 wrist joints (distal radioulnar, radiocarpal, and intercarpal-carpometacarpal joints) were scored on a scale of 0 = no synovitis to 3 = severe synovitis. MRIs were scored by 2 independent experts blinded to patient data and chronology. The sum score is the average of the 2 reader scores for each of the 7 joints. The range of the sum score is thus 0 = no synovitis in any joint to 21 = severe synovitis in all joints.</description>

        <title>Change From Screening in Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies Mean Sum Score for Synovitis at Week 8</title>
        <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the wrist and hand on the side with the most swollen joints (or the right side if swollen joints were equivalent). The 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints and 3 wrist joints (distal radioulnar, radiocarpal, and intercarpal-carpometacarpal joints) were scored on a scale of 0 = no synovitis to 3 = severe synovitis. MRIs were scored by 2 independent experts blinded to patient data and chronology. The sum score is the average of the 2 reader scores for each of the 7 joints. The range of the sum score is thus 0 = no synovitis in any joint to 21 = severe synovitis in all joints.</description>
