  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal haemaoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disease which results in breakdown of
      the red blood cells and bone marrow failure. It is associated with an increased risk of blood
      clots. Until recently, treatment has been with blood transfusions and in patients with a
      blood clot, blood thinners. A new treatment called eculizumab is now standard for patients
      who require regular blood transfusions. It works in the majority of patients by preventing
      the breakdown of red blood cells. This can eliminate the need for blood transfusion and
      reduce the risk of blood clots. It is not well understood why patients with PNH are at high
      risk of blood clots. The investigators plan to use specialised blood tests to assess the
      stickiness of the blood before starting eculizumab treatment and monthly after starting
      treatment. The investigators will compare these tests with standard tests of clotting.
