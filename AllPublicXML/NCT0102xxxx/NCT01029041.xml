  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a rheumatologic syndrome characterized by widespread chronic pain, tender
      points and other symptoms as fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. Therapeutic
      exercises are described as an important form to management of symptoms. This study aims to
      assess strengthening and stretching exercise efficacy in symptoms and quality of life of
      Fibromyalgia patients. The study is done at General Clinical Hospital of Medicine Scholl of
      University of Sao Paulo. 63 subjects undergo the study and they are divided into three
      groups: 1 strengthening exercise, 2 stretching exercise and 3 control group. Patients are
      evaluated by following instruments: Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study
      36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire,
      dolorimetry at tender points by a Fischer dolorimeter, finger-to-tip floor test for muscular
      flexibility, dynamometer EMG System do Brasil for strength test of extension and flexion of
      knees and elbows, time to get up and go test, functional reach test, sit-to-stand test.
      Subjects of 1 strengthening exercise group undergo a global strengthening program and 2
      stretching exercise group undergo a global stretching program. All programs have 12 weeks of
      duration and physical therapy is twice a week. The control group does not do any intervention
      during 12 weeks and after the second evaluation they enter the common program of physical
      therapy. Data are being analyzed by descriptive and interferential statistics procedures.

      In this study, were included subjects with fibromyalgia diagnosis aged between 30 and 55
      years old. We aimed to assess the effect of a physical therapy program on impact of
      fibromyalgia syndrome and quality of life.
