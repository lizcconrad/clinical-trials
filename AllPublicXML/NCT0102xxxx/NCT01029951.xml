  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to compare the relative effectiveness of cervical
      manipulation, mobilisation and the Activator instrument in the treatment of subacute
      non-specific neck pain. The secondary purpose was to describe any adverse effects of these
      treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is a common disorder. About 70% of adults will experience neck pain during their
      lifetime. After low back pain, neck pain is the most common reason patients give for seeking
      chiropractic care, and the second most common reason for the use of spinal manipulation.
      Usually, the underlying cause of neck pain is non-specific and cannot be related to a
      particular pathology as a cause of the presenting symptoms. Due to the uncertainty of the
      results obtained in the limited number of studies of manipulation and mobilisation for neck
      pain, further studies are needed to compare the different therapies available for neck pain.
      Participants in the study were treated as they would normally be with the exception of the
      type of spinal manipulation. There were three groups: a manipulation group, a mobilisation
      group, and an Activator instrument group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 18-64 years; a new or recurrent episode of neck pain present for more than 4
             weeks, but no longer than 12 weeks;

          -  neck pain that could extend to the shoulder region or upper extremities, and be
             accompanied by headache, but neck pain was more painful;

          -  the patient agreed not to take medication or receive other treatment for neck pain
             during the course of the study (paracetamol 500 mg 4 times a day was allowed as rescue
             medication);

          -  and a baseline pain level of at least 4 on the 11-point numerical rating scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were treatment with any of the interventions during 6 months prior
             to recruitment to the study; specific neck pain due to fracture, neoplasm, infection,
             inflammatory arthropathy, radiculopathy or myelopathy;

          -  factors contraindicating manipulation, such as blood coagulation disorders, long-term
             use of corticosteroids, anticoagulant medications, history of neck surgery, stroke or
             transient ischaemic attacks; plans to relocate;

          -  inability to read or understand English;

          -  and third-party liability or workers' compensation claims.
