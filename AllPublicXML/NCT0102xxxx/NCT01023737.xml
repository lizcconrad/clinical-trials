    <textblock>
      This study is an open label non randomized study of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Vorinostat in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of this
      drug combination.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 16 years of age

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed non-hematological malignancy. Patients
             must have received and failed standard treatment for their malignancy; patients for
             whom no standard treatment is available will also be eligible.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG PS at 0, 1, or 2

          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. absolute
             Neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3, platelets &gt; 75,000/mm3); creatinine

               -  2 times the upper limits of normal (ULN) total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, ALT and AST
                  £ 3 times above the upper limits of the institutional norm ALT, AST can be &lt; 5
                  times upper limits of normal if patients have hepatic involvement.

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test. The anti-proliferative activity of this
             experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant.

          -  Complete supportive and palliative care will continue to be provided to ameliorate
             signs and symptoms that were pre-existing or may arise while on study and which do not
             interfere with the objectives of the study.

          -  Tumor blocks available from previous surgery/biopsy.

        At the tumor specific expansion, only patients with metastatic colorectal and renal cell
        cancers will be enrolled. Patients with metastatic colorectal and renal cancer must have
        been treated and progressed or intolerant to standard care therapy.

        Patients with colorectal cancer must been treated in the past with Irinotecan and/or
        Oxaliplatin and/or AvastinIEGFR therapy or intolerant to these agents. No more than 4 lines
        of therapy permitted in the metastatic setting. Patients with colorectal cancer may enroll
        irrespective of K-Ras mutational status, although this will be documented.

        Patients with renal cell cancer must have been treated with a VEGF targeted therapy and/or
        mTOR inhibitor. No more than 4 lines of therapy permitted in the metastatic setting.

        Prior treatment with Vorinostat and HCQ are not permitted in each tumor type.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases.

          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with porphyria are not eligible.

          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the
             disease is well controlled and they are under the care of a specialist for the
             disorder who agrees to monitor the patient for exacerbations.

          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for
             Nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events to ≤ grade 1 due to agents administered more than 4
             weeks earlier. For targeted therapies patients will need to clear for 5 half lives.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients should not have taken valproic acid or another histone deacetylase inhibitor
             for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vorinostat or HCQ.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 21 days prior to
             treatment.

          -  Clinically significant hypercalcemia (including vomiting, dehydration and neurological
             symptoms).

          -  QTc &gt; 500 ms at baseline (average of 3 determinations at 10 minutes interval).

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or
             active peptic ulcer disease. Patients with NJ, J or G tube will not be allowed to
             participate.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SAHA has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects

          -  Patients with known hepatitis B or C or HIV infection.
