    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of coenzyme Q10 administration in
      improving mitochondrial function as measured by anaerobic threshold in older athletes on a
      stable dose of statin medication.

    <measure>The primary objective of this study is to test if oral coenzyme Q10 is superior to placebo in improving oxygen consumption by mitochondria as measured by cardiopulmonary fitness testing for anaerobic threshold in this population</measure>
    <time_frame>The study will consist of an initial six week treatment period followed by a six week washout period. Subjects will then crossover to the alternative treatment for a second six week study period.</time_frame>
