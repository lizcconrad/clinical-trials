    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AN2728 Ointment B, 2.0%
      and 0.5%, compared to Ointment Vehicle B, applied once or twice daily for 12 weeks, in the
      treatment of plaque type psoriasis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, bilateral design.
      Patients will apply both test article AN2728 Ointment B (0.5% or 2%), and Ointment B Vehicle
      twice daily for 12 weeks. The assigned study medication will be applied to two comparable
      treatment targeted plaques identified at baseline. One test article will be applied to one
      plaque and the other test article to an anatomically distinct plaque. All efficacy
      evaluations will be measured from only the two plaques identified at the baseline visit.

    <description>OTPSS is a scale to assess plaque severity. Each target plaque was scored by the investigator on severity scale ranging from 0 (no plaque) to 8 (very severe plaque), where higher score indicates more severity of a plaque. In this outcome measure, percentage of participants with reduced OTPSS in ointment (2% twice daily) treated plaque versus (vs.) vehicle treated plaque and percentage of participants with reduced OTPSS in vehicle treated plaque versus ointment (2% twice daily) treated plaque respectively at Day 42 are reported.</description>
