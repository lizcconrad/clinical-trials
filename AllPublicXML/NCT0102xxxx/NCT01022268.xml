      This proposal represents a unified programme supported by both clinical and academic staff in
      the Departments of Paediatrics at Imperial College and St Mary's Hospital. St Mary's Hospital
      is the hub of a paediatric network for West London, and forms part of the Paediatric
      Intensive Care Network for the London region, with potential access to a population of 3
      million children.

      We aim to improve diagnosis and understanding of children with infectious, inflammatory and
      allergic conditions. Our study will establish well-characterised cohorts of patients with
      defined conditions, in whom microbiological and patient samples will be used to understand
      the contribution of genetic background, differential gene expression, proteomics and the
      pathogen type to the disease process.

      Unwell children coming to St Mary's hospital through any route will be invited to join the
      study. Entering the study will entail the child having blood taken for research purposes in
      addition to the clinically indicated tests. We will also recruit well (control) children who
      are having blood tests performed for elective purposes, such as surgery.

      In addition, children presenting with an illness that is likely to have an infectious
      aetiology will also have samples collected for microbiological diagnosis. Those samples taken
      for ordinary diagnostic purposes (such as blood, urine, CSF, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
      fluid or nasal brushings for epithelial cell cultures) would also be used for
      state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques, in order to maximise the likelihood of confirming a
      microbiological diagnosis. Where healthy, uninfected children are having invasive procedures,
      such as lumbar punctures, we would aim to recruit these children as controls and collect
      biological samples such as CSF samples.

      This bid addresses the need for translational research in paediatrics, by building on the
      world-class basic science and clinical paediatric base at Imperial College and St Mary's
      Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently little understanding of the mechanisms by which respiratory infections can
      cause severe illness and death. The emergence of H1N1/09 as a major cause of childhood severe
      illness in 2009 permitted further study of how this virus triggers severe disease, and how
      the inflammatory response to H1N1 differs from other infections. It is likely that
      host-mediated inflammatory processes triggered by the infecting agent contributes to severe
      illness. In addition, viral infection induces profound changes in the innate immune response
      to common bacterial pathogens, with increased bacterial colonisation of normally sterile
      lower airway. Thus both host and bacterial factors may contribute to lung damage in severe
      respiratory infection.

      This study was initiated to identify the aetiology and immunopathologic mechanisms of
      childhood respiratory infection (Immunopathology of Respiratory Infection Study - IRIS),
      recruiting children with suspected respiratory infection or respiratory failure (and
      controls). This dataset will provide a unique resource for further study of disease
      mechanisms in children with a range of infections including H1N1/09 infection, RSV,
      Rhinovirus, other common respiratory viruses and severe bacterial infections.
