      Introduction:

      The prevalence of overlap between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is around 10%. This overlap syndrome is an important
      issue because is related to nocturnal desaturation and its complications. The use of portable
      monitoring devices (PM) for the diagnosis of OSAS was recently accepted as an alternative to
      full-night polysomnography (PSG). However, there are not studies evaluating the PM recording
      in COPD patients to detect or exclude OSAS.

      Objective:

      To evaluate if a PM (Stardust®, Respironics, Inc, USA) could accurately measure the
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in COPD patients with a suspicion of OSAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from the Pneumology outpatient clinic of UNIFESP, Patients had
      been diagnosed with COPD in GOLD's stages II and III, were stable (no COPD exacerbation in
      the last three months), were using bronchodilators without a dose change during that period,
      and had symptoms suggestive of OSAS (loud snoring, reported breathing pauses during sleep and
      excessive sleepiness). We excluded patients with other sleep-related disorders, a diagnosis
      and/or previous treatment for OSAS, severe cardiovascular disorders or neuromuscular disease
      and those using oxygen, psychotropic drugs, alcohol or other drugs of abuse.

      Patients will undergo two assessments of sleep, randomly determined: 1) PM at home for one
      night, 2) PM in the sleep laboratory simultaneously to the PSG. Three apnea-hypopnea index
      (AHI) values will be obtained and analyzed: a) AHI from PM at home, b) AHI from PM in the
      laboratory, and c) AHI from the PSG. Analyses of all evaluations will be performed by two
      trained technicians, blinded to study details.
