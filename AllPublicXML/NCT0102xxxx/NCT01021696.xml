  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In nursing homes (NHs) 80% of the patients have dementia, between 60%-80% exhibit behavioural
      disturbances (BPSD), and more than 60% have pain. Both pain and BPSD is more common in those
      with severe dementia. Since older persons with dementia have less communicative skills,
      suffer from more pain and exhibit more agitation, pain may be a contributing factor in these
      patients. More than 40% of patients with BPSD are treated with neuroleptics despite described
      side-effects. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact of individual pain management
      on BPSD in patients with dementia.

      It was hypothesized that

        -  pain increase BPSD in patients with dementia

        -  individual pain treatment decrease BPSD in patients with dementia

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We intend to conduct an eight weeks, multi-centre, rater-blinded, cluster randomized, and
      parallel-group trial, with follow up after four weeks. We will choose cluster randomizing by
      practical reasons. 920 NH patients were screened and 352 patients with moderate or severe
      dementia and BPSD were included. The treatment period is 8 weeks, with further follow after
      four weeks.

      The primary outcome measure will be reduction in aggression and agitation as well as other
      items which are measured by means of CMAI (Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory). Secondary
      outcome are reduction in NPI-NH-subscale agitation/aggression and other items which are
      measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH). Further, we want
      to evaluate the concomitant use of acute medication. Additionally, Activities of Daily Living
      function (ADL) and MIni Mental State Examination (MMSE) will be used as secondary outcome
      measure.

      Pain in patients with dementia will be assessed and followed by the MOBID-2 Pain Scale
      (secondary outcome measure). MOBID-2 Pain Scale is a staff-administered behavioural
      instrument for assessment pain in older persons with dementia with god validity and
      reliability (Husebo 2008, 2009). MOBID-2 is based on patient's pain behaviour in connection
      with standardised, guided movements of different body part, and pain behaviour related to
      internal organs, head and skin. Additionally, pain will be registered by pain diagnoses,
      -etiology, and -duration. The MOBID-2 score is derived from caregiver in a clinical bedside
      situation during morning care.

      Adverse events will be recorded and evaluated throughout the study as the primary assessment
      of safety and tolerability.

      Inclusion criteria: Patients of either gender, 60 years of age or older, living in a nursing
      home (NH) diagnosed moderate or severe dementia measured by the Functional Assessment Staging
      (FAST) and MMSE, and BPSD in form of agitation / aggression as measured by subscale of NPI-NH
      and CMAI.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients without cognitive impairment and without BPSD. Patients with
      hepatic or renal failure or diseases that make it impossible to follow the study schedule.

    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory - long form (CMAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>CMAI will be used during the screening/inclusion process, at week 2, 4, 8, and 12.</time_frame>
    <description>CMAI has 29-item (max. score 203) to assess agitated behaviours in NH-patients. A six-point rating scale assesses the frequency with which patients manifest BPSD evaluating 29 agitated behaviours, ranging from never, less than once a week, but still occurring, once or twice a week, several times a week, once or twice a day, several times a day or several times an hour. Items are presented in four factors: I Aggressive behaviour; II Physical non-aggressive behaviour; III Verbally agitated behavior, IV hiding and hoarding. Ratings are based on face-to-face interviews with caregivers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH)</measure>
    <time_frame>NPI will be used during the inclusion process, at week 2, 4, 8, and 12.</time_frame>
    <description>NPI is a caregiver based interview (10 min.), assessing 10 BPSD and 2 neurovegetative areas with total score and subscales for: delusion, hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, disinhibition apathy, irritability, aberrant motor activity, sleep, appetite. Frequency, severity, and caregiver's distress are measured. The NH-version will be used, recently validated in Norwegian (AGS Panel 1998). A higher score reflects increased frequency and severity of the disturbances.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity of Daily Living function (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>ADL assessment will be used during clinical investigation related to the inclusion prosess and at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>ADL assess physical function. Rating includes activities like feeding, moving, personal toilet, and dressing higher values indicating higher levels of activities of daily functioning and independency (Sheikh 1979). The scale includes 10 items (0-20 score). The ADL score is derived from caregiver interview. Administration of the ADL takes approximately 5 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Mini Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/clinical investigation and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a 30-point mental status examination scale that enables cut-off differentiation for levels of severity of cognitive impairment (Folstein 1975). Cut point for moderate dementia: &lt;20. The question consist of several orientation question (10 points), registration and recall task (6), attention task (5), three stage command (3), two naming task (2), repetition task (1), reading comprehension task (1), written sentence (1), and a visual construction (1). The test takes 15 minutes to administer and the patient is asked the questions directly by the examiner.</description>

    <description>MOBID-2 Pain Scale is a staff-administered behavioural instrument for assessment pain in older persons with dementia (Husebo 2008a). MOBID-2 is based on patient's pain behaviour in connection with standardised, guided movements of different body part, and pain behaviour related to internal organs, head and skin. Additionally, pain will be registered by pain diagnoses, -etiology, and -duration. The MOBID-2 score is derived from caregiver in a clinical bedside situation during morning care.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment Staging (FAST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>FAST describes a continuum of seven stages and sub stages from normality to most severe dementia (Hughes 1982). Moderate to severe dementia is consistent with Fast stage of 5 or 6 or 7. Stage 5 is defined as moderately severe cognitive decline, with deficient performance in activities of daily living such as choosing proper clothing and maintaining hygiene. Stage 6 is defined as severe cognitive decline with incontinence and decreased ability to clothe, bathe, toilet oneself, severely limited speech, vocabulary, emotional expression. FAST score is derived from caregiver interview (5 min).</description>

    <description>Safety and tolerability assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) and the regular monitoring of vital signs (BP, puls); AE and SAE registration and report is related to each patient, each medication each centre with reportation to the Norwegian Medicines Agency (study code EUDRACTNR. 2008-007490-20).</description>
