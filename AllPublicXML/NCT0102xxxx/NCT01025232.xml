  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of intravitreally administered 2.0 mg ranibizumab in
      subjects with persistent fluid or recurrent fluid on OCT after having received at least nine
      ranibizumab injections in the past twelve months. Consented, enrolled subjects will receive
      have monthly ETDRS BCVA, ophthalmic examination and OCTs evaluation using Stratus, Cirrus and
      Spectralis machines. Fluorescein angiography and autofluorescence will be done at BSL, and
      Months 6 and 12. DNA samples for genetic analysis will be collected at baseline.

      Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 2.0 mg ranibizumab administered
      every 28 days for 3 months: Following the three loading doses, all patients will receive a
      minimum &quot;capped&quot; PRN treatment (all patients will receive 2.0 mg intravitreal ranibizumab
      quarterly). Dosing should not occur earlier than 22 days after the previous treatment. Study
      visits should be scheduled to occur every 30 (±7) days relative to the date of the first
      injection (Day 0).

      Subjects will be randomized into two re-treatment cohorts for additional re-treatment, if
      needed:

        -  Cohort A - Subjects can receive re-treatment every 4 weeks if there is persistent or
           recurrent intraretinal, subretinal ,or sub-RPE fluid on any OCT modality, or any
           evidence of hemorrhage on clinical evaluation.

        -  Cohort B - Subjects can receive re-treatment every 6 weeks if there is persistent or
           recurrent intraretinal, subretinal ,or sub-RPE fluid on any OCT modality, or any
           evidence of hemorrhage on clinical evaluation. Every 6 weeks regimen will test potential
           longer duration of action of 2.0 mg ranibizumab.

    <description>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Best Corrected Visual Acuity (ETDRS BCVA) was used to quantify visual acuity. BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</description>

        <description>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Best Corrected Visual Acuity (ETDRS BCVA) was used to quantify visual acuity. BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</description>
