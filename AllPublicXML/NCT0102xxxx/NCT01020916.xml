      Experimental studies and previous clinical trials suggest an improvement in mortality and
      neurological function with hypothermia after cardiac arrest. However, the accrued evidence is
      inconclusive and associated with risks of systematic error, design error and random error.
      Elevated body temperature after cardiac arrest is associated with a worse outcome. Previous
      trials did not treat elevated body temperature in the control groups. The optimal target
      temperature for post-resuscitation care is not known. The primary purpose with the TTM-trial
      is to evaluate if there are differences in all-cause mortality, neurological function and
      adverse events between a target temperature management at 33°C and 36°C for 24 hours
      following return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest.

      Detailed statistical analysis plan for the Target Temperature Management after
      Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest trial

        1. Introduction The Target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a
           randomised, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial (the TTM-trial) is the
           largest trial to date in post-cardiac arrest treatment and in temperature management in
           the intensive care setting.

           To prevent outcome reporting bias and data driven analysis results, the International
           Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice and others have recommended that
           clinical trials should be analysed according to a pre-specified plan [1]. Leading
           experts in the critical care community have advocated that this should not only be a
           recommendation but rather a prerequisite [2]. Here we describe the statistical analysis
           plan that has been finalised while data collection in the TTM-trial still is on going,
           and to which all data analyses in the main publication of the TTM-trial results will
           adhere. The steering group of the TTM-trial unanimously approved the statistical
           analysis plan December 3rd 2012, patient recruitment at 950 patients was completed
           January 10th 2013, and the final follow-up is predicted to occur in the beginning of
           July 2013, after which the database will be locked and then analysed.

        2. Trial overview The TTM-trial is a multicentre, multinational, outcome assessor-blinded,
           parallel group, randomised clinical trial comparing two strict target temperature
           regimens of 33°C and 36°C in adult patients, who have sustained return of spontaneous
           circulation and are unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when admitted to
           hospital. The study background, design, and rationale have previously been published [3,
           4]. The TTM-trial protocol (current version 3.3) has been available online on
           www.ttm-trial.org since the start of the trial. The trial is registered at
           clinicaltrials.gov NCT01020916 and is endorsed by the European Clinical Research
           Infrastructure Network and the Scandinavian Critical Care Trials Group.

        3. Objective The primary aim of the TTM-trial is to compare the effects of two strict
           target temperature protocols for the first 36 hours of hospital stay after resuscitation
           from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (4 hours for achieving the target temperature, 24
           hours of maintenance of target temperature, and 8 hours of rewarming). The null
           hypothesis is that there is no difference in survival until the end of trial (180 days
           from randomisation of the last patient) with a target temperature of 33°C compared to
           36°C. To demonstrate or reject a Hazard Ratio difference of 20% between the groups,
           equivalent to approximately one months difference in median survival time assuming
           proportional hazards in the groups during the observation time, a sample size of 900
           patients would be necessary with a type-1 error risk of 5% and a type-2 error risk of
           10%. To allow for patients lost-to-follow up the target population is set to 950
           patients.

        4. Stratification and design variables The only stratification variable used is trial site
           (hospital). Pre-defined design variables allowing for an adjusted analysis of the
           primary outcome, and pre-defined subgroup analyses are: age, gender, first presenting
           cardiac rhythm (shockable or non-shockable), duration of cardiac arrest, and presence of
           shock at admission.

        5. Definition of the efficacy variables The outcomes are defined as primary, secondary and
           exploratory (tertiary in the trial protocol). Only primary and secondary outcomes will
           be analysed for the first published report of the TTM-trial due to the complexity of the
           exploratory outcomes, and thus a need for separate publications.

      Primary outcome The primary outcome is survival until end of trial, which will be 180 days
      from randomisation of the last patient.

      Secondary outcomes including adverse events The main secondary outcomes are the composite
      outcomes of

        1. poor neurological function defined as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 3 or 4, or
           death (CPC 5); and

        2. poor neurological function defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 or 5, or death (mRS
           6)

      evaluated at 180 days (+/- 14 days) from randomisation.

      The number of study participants in each category of CPC and mRS will be reported separately.

      The following adverse events are included in the secondary outcomes: bleeding, pneumonia,
      electrolyte disorders, hyperglycemia, hypoglycaemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myoclonic or
      tonic-clonic seizures, renal replacement therapy. Definitions for the adverse events have
      been described earlier [4].

      Other secondary outcomes are Cerebral Performance Category at intensive care unit and
      hospital discharge, and best Cerebral Performance Category during entire trial period.

      Exploratory outcomes Neurological function at 180 days defined with CPC, mRS, Informant
      Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), Mini mental state exam (MMSE) and
      two simple questions: 1a. In the last two weeks, did you require help from another person for
      your every day activities? (If yes: 1b. Is this a new situation following the heart arrest?),
      and 2. Do you feel you have made a complete mental recovery after your heart arrest? [4].

      Quality of life defined with Short-Form 36.

      ventilation during the index ICU-admission and days in hospital within the index admission
      will be reported.

      7. General analysis principles

        1. Analyses will be conducted according to the modified intention-to-treat principle [5] if
           not otherwise stated.

        2. All tests of significance will be two-sided with a maximal type-1 error risk of 5%

        3. The primary analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will be those of the modified
           intention-to-treat population adjusted for the protocol specified stratification
           variable [6] and if necessary using data sets generated using multiple imputations (see
           below). An unadjusted analysis and an analysis adjusting for both stratification and
           predefined design variables will be carried out as sensitivity analyses. Other analyses
           may also be done using e.g. a slightly different population. If the results of these
           analyses are not consistent with the primary analyses this will be discussed.
           Nevertheless, the conclusions of the study will still be those based on the primary
           analyses.

        4. The tests for interaction between the intervention and each design variable used to
           identify subgroups are exploratory.

        5. Risks will be reported as hazard ratios or risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI)
           or with limits as stated under point 6.

        6. If there is data missingness for a specified primary or secondary outcome of less than
           5% we will perform a complete case analysis without imputing missing values. If there is
           a missingness of more than 5% we will perform Little's test. If the test indicates that
           the complete case data set is a random sample we will continue without imputing missing
           values and analyse the complete cases. If Little's test indicates that the data set of
           complete cases is not a random sample of the total data set we will report the point
           estimates and their 95% confidence limits applying a worst/best scenario imputation for
           the missing values. If the worst/best case analyses allow for the same conclusion we
           will not perform multiple imputation. However, if the worst/best case imputation
           provides different conclusions, multiple imputation will be performed, creating 10
           imputed data sets under the assumption of missingness at random. The result of the trial
           will be the pooled intervention effect and 95% CI of the analyses of the data sets after
           multiple imputation.

      Primarily the observed P-values of the primary and five secondary outcomes will be presented.
      However, multiplicity, a possibly reason for spurious statistically significant P-values, may
      be a problem when the result of several outcomes are presented. We therefore want to present
      a supplemental analysis being the result with P-values adjusted for multiplicity according to
      the fall-back procedure [7]. The P-values adjusted for multiplicity will be presented and
      discussed in relation to the unadjusted P-values. This adjustment may be needed to control
      the overall probability of a type 1 error (rejection of a null hypothesis that is actually
      true) and keep the family wise error rate below 0.05 as required by most regulatory agencies.
      This will be done by specifying the weights of the hypotheses assigned to them according to
      their importance. The sequence in which the hypotheses will be tested and their individual
      weights (in parentheses) will be: the primary outcome (0.50), first secondary outcome (0.25),
      second secondary outcome (0.0625), third secondary outcome (0.0625), fourth secondary outcome
      (0.0625), and fifth secondary outcome (0.0625). The multiplicity problem is further
      illuminated in the Discussion section.

      8. Statistical analyses Trial profile Flow of study participants will displayed in a CONSORT
      diagram as shown in Box 1 [8]. Number of screened patients who fulfilled study inclusion
      criteria and the number included in the primary and secondary analyses as well as all reasons
      for exclusions in primary and secondary analyses will be reported.

      Primary outcome Frequencies and percentages per group, as well as hazard ratios with 95% CI
      will be reported. The primary outcome will be analysed using Cox-regression with adjusting
      variables indicated below. The proportional hazard assumption across treatment groups will be
      checked by testing if there is an interaction between intervention and time and by plotting
      cumulative hazard functions for intervention groups.

        1. The first analysis of the primary outcome, adjusted for the stratification variable,
           will be on the patients that met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion
           criteria at time of randomisation. Patients who did not meet inclusion criteria and did
           not receive the intervention (temperature management) and was erroneously randomised
           will be excluded according to the modified intention to treat principle.

        2. The second analysis on the primary outcome will be on patients that met the inclusion
           criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria and did not have any major protocol
           violations (per-protocol analysis).

        3. The third analysis on the primary outcome will be an analysis adjusted for both the
           stratification variable and the design variables.

        4. The above analyses will be repeated with sites grouped as a variable indicating whether
           the patient has been allocated by the 2 sites having allocated most patients or one of
           the other sites (which would be approximately ¼ of the trial population).

      Secondary outcomes including adverse events Frequencies and percentages per group, as well as
      risk ratios with 95% CI will be reported. A standard Chi2-test will be used to assess the
      effect of treatment on binary and categorical outcomes. For the adjusted primary analyses
      logistic regression analysis will be used. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney's test will be used for
      continuous outcomes. There will only be reported significance testing on the composite
      outcomes mortality and poor neurological outcome versus survival with good neurological
      outcome; not on the individual sub-scores of CPC and mRS. For adverse events there will be a
      Chi2-test on having one or more adverse events versus having no adverse events. If there is a
      significant difference between treatment groups in occurrence of adverse events we will try
      to delineate which of the events that drive this difference. However we acknowledge the low
      power for performing analyses in this case.

      Characteristics of patients with baseline comparisons Description of baseline characteristics
      listed above will be presented by treatment group. Discrete variables will be summarized by
      frequencies and percentages. Percentages will be calculated according to the number of
      patients where data are available. Where values are missing, the actual denominator will be
      stated.

      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and
      dispersion, either using mean +/- standard deviation for data with normal distribution or
      median and inter quartile range for non-normally distributed data.

      Intervention period variables The mean values of the actual measured temperature in the two
      intervention groups will be displayed in a graph with mean, +/- 2 standard deviations.

      Neurological prognostication and withdrawal of care, concomitant cardiological treatments and
      other descriptive variables

      Description of baseline characteristics listed above will be presented by treatment group
      without significance testing. Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and
      percentages. Percentages will be calculated according to the number of patients where data
      are available. Where values are missing, the actual denominator will be stated.

      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and
      dispersion, either using mean +/- standard deviation for data with normal distribution or
      median and inter quartile range for non-normally distributed data.

      9. Outline of figures and tables Figure 1 will be a CONSORT flow chart as specified above.
      Figure 2 will be a temperature graph for the two groups with hour 0 to 36 on the x-axis and
      mean temperature with +/- 2 standard deviations on the y-axis.

      Figure 3 will be a Kaplan-Meier plot of survival in the two groups during the trial period
      (32 months).

      Figure 4 will be a Forest plot of intervention effects stratified for the design variables:
      age dichotomised around the median, gender, duration of cardiac arrest dichotomised around
      the median, initial cardiac rhythm shockable or non-shockable, and presence or absence of
      cardiogenic shock at admission to hospital.

      All tables will report variable according to randomisation groups:

      Table 1 and 2 will report background variables. Table 3 will report intensive care unit and
      hospital stay variables. Table 4 will report adverse events. Table 5 will report 180-day
      outcomes for survival/mortality and neurological function with CPC and mRS.

      10. Discussion With this statistical analysis plan we present the different analyses in the
      main publication of the TTM-trial to avoid risks of outcome reporting bias and data driven
      results. Of the pre-specified outcomes in the trial we choose to report only primary and
      secondary in the main publication, because of the complexity of the detailed neurological
      outcomes and quality of life that constitutes the exploratory outcomes, requiring separate
      publications.

      We would like to emphasise that the main secondary outcome being the composite outcome of
      poor neurological function and mortality at 180 days after cardiac arrest will be of great
      importance in a situation of a neutral outcome in the primary outcome, when interpreting the
      results and deriving clinical implications from the TTM-trial. As survival is an outcome with
      low risk of bias, not prone to competing risks, and earlier trials and registry data indicate
      a lower sample size needed to show the same risk reduction when the composite outcome of
      mortality and poor neurological function is used (compared to mortality/survival), this was
      the fundament for the order of the outcomes. The composite outcome of poor neurological
      function and mortality will hopefully benefit by an increased power with respect to the
      possibility of finding or rejecting a significant signal when the trial is powered for
      survival, which would require a larger sample size.

      Comments on the multiplicity problem

      There are one primary and 5 secondary outcomes to be assessed:

        -  Primary outcome: survival

        -  Secondary outcomes

             1. Neurological (CPC): binary quantity

             2. Neurological (mRS): binary quantity

             3. Adverse event: binary quantity

             4. Cerebral performance category measured at specified point in time: binary quantity

             5. Best cerebral performance during specified period: binary quantity Thus there are
                six significance tests. These have to be adjusted for multiplicity to control the
                probability of a type-1-error (rejection of a null hypothesis that is true). One
                way to diminish this risk would be to deal with the six outcomes as one group using
                a data driven adjustment of the P-values. The most powerful procedure based on the
                raw P-values is probably that of Hommel [7].

      An alternative (the fixed sequence procedure) would be to specify the sequence of the
      hypotheses testing in advance. (Primary outcome, first secondary outcome, second secondary
      outcome, - - -, fifth secondary outcome.) In this latter case no multiplicity adjustment will
      be needed. Then each test will be done at the 0.05 level of significance in the specified
      order. However, as soon as a test is non-significant the remaining null hypotheses will be
      accepted without test.

      For instance if the primary outcome and the first secondary outcome are significant at the
      0.05 level and the second secondary outcome (neurological function measured with mRS) is
      insignificant, the null hypotheses corresponding to the secondary outcomes 3, 4 and 5 will be
      accepted without test.

      A third approach is the so-called fall back procedure where the fixed hypothesis testing
      sequence is also used. However, if a test is insignificant, the procedure does not stop but
      the next hypothesis is tested at a reduced level of significance. This procedure also allows
      one to weight the hypotheses according to their importance and likelihood of being rejected.

      Hommel's procedure is sensitive to the P-values of the last three tests while the fall back
      procedure is not. Since the first and second of the secondary outcomes probably will produce
      similar P-values it appears logical to place most of the weights on the primary and the first
      secondary outcome.

      Based on these considerations the analyses in the TTM-trial will be presented with unadjusted
      P-values as well as adjusted for multiplicity using the fall back procedure.

      11. Conclusion To conclude this article describes the principle for how the TTM-trial will be
      analysed and presented in the first and main publication. With this we minimise the risk for
      data driven results and outcome reporting bias.
