  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased endogenous glucose production (EGP) is the major cause of postabsorptive
      hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While EGP is inhibited by both glucose and
      insulin in non-diabetic animals and humans, T2DM is associated with increased EGP despite
      elevated plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. In fact, we and others have reported
      direct inhibitory effects of hyperglycemia itself on EGP in nondiabetic subjects, independent
      of other hormonal or metabolic signals, which are markedly blunted in subjects with T2DM.

      The medial hypothalamus mediates hormonal signals which affect glucose metabolism.
      ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are expressed in the hypothalamus and can be
      activated by insulin. Activation of these channels appears to be an important common
      mechanism whereby both systemic glucose and insulin suppress EGP, and may account for almost
      50% of EGP suppression by both agents. Diazoxide has been shown to inhibit EGP in rodents via
      the activation of these KATP channels in the hypothalamus, while the KATP channel inhibitor
      glyburide blocks these effects. There is evidence to suggest that central activation of KATP
      channels is still able to suppress EGP in animal models that are otherwise resistant to the
      effects of systemic glucose and insulin.

      The current proposal will address the potential impact of diazoxide on inhibiting EGP, and
      ultimately to investigate its use as a potential treatment for diabetes mellitus.
      Additionally, to determine the importance of central signaling to the effects of
      hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on EGP in humans, we will administer glyburide prior to
      raising glucose or insulin levels under controlled clamp conditions.
