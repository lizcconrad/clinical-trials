    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a standardized peer-led
      intervention to teach self-management skills in improving outcomes of individuals with a
      severe mental illness. The intervention is known as Wellness Recovery Action Planning or
      WRAP, co-developed by Dr. Mary Ellen Copeland. The focus of the inquiry is on whether and how
      developing an individualized plan for successful living: 1) lowers psychiatric symptoms; 2)
      enhances psychosocial outcomes such as self-perceived recovery, empowerment, self-advocacy,
      coping, and social support; 3) increases knowledge of personal mental illness self-management
      strategies; and 4) enhances satisfaction with the service delivery system. The study
      evaluated the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis #1: Compared to wait-list control subjects, those who participate in the WRAP
      intervention will report reduced levels of psychiatric symptoms.

      Hypothesis #2: Compared to wait-list control subjects, those who participate in the WRAP
      intervention will report enhanced enhanced feelings of empowerment, hope, recovery, quality
      of life, and functioning.

      Hypothesis #3: Compared to wait-list controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention
      will report increased levels of social support.

      Hypothesis #4: Compared to wait-list controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention
      will report increased use of peer services, higher satisfaction with services, and have lower
      overall service costs.

      Hypothesis #5: Compared to controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will
      report increased knowledge of mental illness self-management, including making/using a WRAP
      plan.

      Hypothesis #6: There will be no difference in employment rates of control vs. intervention
      subjects.
