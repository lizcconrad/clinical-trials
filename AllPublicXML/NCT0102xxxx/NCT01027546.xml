      The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in cervical laminoplasty; the
      surgical procedure used was identical in all cases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, has proven to be effective in reducing
      perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty. However,
      limited numbers of well-controlled trials in spinal surgery have been conducted due to
      heterogeneity in the performed surgical procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were scheduled to undergo cervical laminoplasty from C3 to C6 for
             cervical multilevel compressive myelopathy with a narrow spinal canal for which
             nonoperative therapy had failed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, serious cardiac disease,
             allergy to TXA, a history of thromboembolic disease, and bleeding disorders, as well
             as those who were currently receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant drugs, were
