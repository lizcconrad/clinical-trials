  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients are prone to a diffuse and rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis.
      Both clinical and angiographic outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      are poor in patients with DM compared with those without DM. Autopsy study has shown delayed
      neointimal healing with inadequate endothelialization and persistent stent surface ﬁbrin
      deposition after DES implantation in DM patients. This might partially contribute to the high
      risk of late stent thrombosis.

      YINYI Polymer-Free paclitaxel stent is a domestic new type stent with bare metal base with
      micro porous surface. However, limited data is available in vivo about the surface coverage
      after stent implantation in DM patients because of lack of sensitive imaging modalities.
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of intravascular
      ultrasound（IVUS）that allows high-resolution tomographic intravascular imaging. Furthermore,
      several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of OCT to quantitatively evaluate the
      surface coverage and stent conditions in the follow up after PCI .

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the surface coverage and late malapposition
      after two types of DES implantation in DM patients compared with non-DM patients by using OCT
      and IVUS
