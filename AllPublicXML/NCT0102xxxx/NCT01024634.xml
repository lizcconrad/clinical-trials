  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of endurance exercise training on arterial
      structure and function, and to examine potential mechanisms producing changes in arterial
      structure and function in young (18-35 years of age) African Americans when compared to
      Caucasians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African-Americans are at greater risk than Caucasians for developing hypertension,
      cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease. This is likely related to arterial
      dysfunction including greater arterial stiffness, and reduced microvascular reactivity of
      resistance arteries in African-Americans. In addition, African-Americans have higher levels
      of inflammatory markers, and a greater sympathoexcitatory response to various stressors. This
      imbalance between sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activation may directly affect
      vascular function and potentiate a greater inflammatory response, further altering key
      structural and functional properties of the vascular wall. The overall aim of this proposal
      is to test the effects of endurance exercise training on arterial structure and function, and
      to examine potential mechanisms producing changes in arterial structure and function in young
      (18-35 years of age) African Americans when compared to Caucasians. We will examine these
      effects at rest and following a high intensity (maximal cycle ergometry) sympathoexcitation
      at both pre- and post-intervention time points, since sympathoexcitation may elucidate
      changes not evident at rest. Because African-Americans have higher levels of arterial
      stiffness, lower microvascular reactivity, greater responses to sympathoexcitation, greater
      levels of inflammatory markers and greater vasoconstrictive tone, we hypothesize that
      African-Americans will show differential responses to exercise training and benefit more
      compared to a matched group of Caucasians.
