  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently several different commercially available topical eye drops and gels used
      to reduce eye discomfort (topical anesthetics) during and after eye injections. Dr. Pollack
      is performing a research study to evaluate three commercially available topical anesthetics
      (eye numbing treatments) to determine if individuals have a preference for one over the
      other. The three topical anesthetics being studied are 1) 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride
      (generic, Akorn, Inc), 2) 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride (generic, Akorn, Inc) PLUS 4%
      lidocaine hydrochloride topical solution (generic, Roxane Laboratories), and 3) 3.5%
      lidocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel (Akten, Akorn, Inc). These eye anesthetics are NOT
      experimental medications. They are all commercially available topical anesthetics currently
      used in our offices and their use is widespread among retina specialists throughout the
      United States. Dr. Pollack will randomly select one topical anesthetic to use and he will ask
      you to grade your level of pain associated with the injection procedure. Answering these
      questions should take less than one minute of your time and your identity will NOT be
      revealed with the results of this study. The results of this study will be used to inform
      doctors which eye anesthetics patients find most effective for pain control during eye
      injections.

      In this prospective study, 120 sequential patients undergoing 30 and 33 Gauge intravitreal
      injections were randomly assigned to receive either: proparacaine HCL 0.5% (Group 1),
      proparacaine HCL 0.5% + 4% lidocaine liquid drops (Group 2); or 3.5% lidocaine gel (Group 3)
      as topical anesthetic prior to injection. All procedures utilized a lid speculum and 5%
      povidone iodine. Approximately 10 seconds after injection, patients graded pain associated
      with the lid speculum, the needle, and with burning sensation on a pain scale of 0 to 10,
      with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the patient's worst imaginable pain. They
      also graded their overall injection procedure experience as Excellent, Very Good, Fair, Poor,
      or Awful.
