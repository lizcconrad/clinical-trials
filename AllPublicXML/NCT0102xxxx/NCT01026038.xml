  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study (a study in which the doctors and participants know which drug or
      vaccine is being administered) in children who previously received a 4-dose series of a
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnC) during infancy in Study 6096A1-008-EU (NCT00366678). In
      this study, participants will receive an additional dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate persistence, if any, of the antibody
      response by measuring any remaining pneumococcal antibodies since the previous study. This
      study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine when administered at least 24 months after the last dose of pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine.

    <measure>Serotype-specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) 1 Month After Single Dose of 13 Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate (13vPnC) Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>One month after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody GMC as measured by microgram/millilitre (mcg/mL) for 7 common pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and 6 additional pneumococcal serotypes specific to 13vPnC (Serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A) are presented. GMC (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were evaluated. Geometric means (GMs) were calculated using all participants with available data for the specified blood draw.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Prespecified Local Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Seven days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Local reactions (redness, swelling and pain) were reported using electronic diary. Redness and swelling were recorded in caliper units (range 1 to 14+), each caliper unit represented 0.5 cm. Categorized as any, absent (no redness or swelling present; 0 caliper units), mild (0.5 to 2.0 cm; 1 to 4 caliper units); moderate (2.5 to 7.0 cm; 5 to 14 caliper units); or severe (&gt;7.0 cm; &gt;14 caliper units). Pain was categorized as any, mild: does not interfere with activity; moderate: interferes with activity; severe: prevents daily activity. Participants may be reported in more than 1 category.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Prespecified Systemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Seven days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic events (any fever &gt;= 38 degree celsius [C], vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue) were reported using electronic diary. Fever categorized as &gt;=38 to &lt;=39 degree C; &gt;39 to &lt;=40 degree C; &gt;40 degree C. Vomiting: mild (1-2 times/day ); moderate (&gt;2 times/day); severe (requires intravenous hydration). Diarrhea: mild (2-3 loose stools/day); moderate (4-5 stools/day); severe (&gt;=6 loose stools/day). Fatigue: mild (does not interfere with activity); moderate (some interference with activity); severe (prevents daily routine activity). Participants may be reported in more than 1 category.</description>

        <title>Serotype-specific OPA GMTs 1 Month After Single Dose of 13vPnC Vaccine</title>
        <description>Serotype-specific pneumococcal OPA GMTs for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in the blood samples of all the participants using mcOPA assay.

        <description>Percentage of participants achieving OPA GMTs with at least LLOQ for 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) determined in blood samples of all participants using mcOPA assay. Exact 2-sided CI based on observed proportion of participants. LLOQ in titers for each serotype was: Pn001, 18; Pn003, 12; Pn004, 21; Pn005, 29; Pn06A, 37; Pn06B, 43; Pn7F, 210; Pn09V, 345; Pn014, 35; Pn18C, 31; Pn19A, 18; Pn19F, 48; Pn23F, 13. LOD established as lowest titer possible in assay, which was 8. OPA titers below LLOQ set to 0.5*LOD for analysis.</description>
