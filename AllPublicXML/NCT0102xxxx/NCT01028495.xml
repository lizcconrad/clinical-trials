      To assess the safety and efficacy of a combined therapy regimen of RX-0201 plus Gemcitabine,
      in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled to assess safety will receive a combination of Gemcitabine plus RX-0201.
      Gemcitabine will be administered prior to RX-0201 intravenously in a 30-min iv infusion dose
      at 1000 mg/m2 once weekly for up to 2 cycles; each 4-week cycle consist of 3-week treatment
      phase followed by 1 week resting phase. RX-0201 will be administered at 250 mg/m2/day in a
      24-hour continuous intravenous infusion for up to 2 cycles; each 3-week cycle consists of
      2-week treatment phase followed by a 1 week resting phase. (See schedule of
      assessments)Subjects enrolled to evaluate efficacy will receive a combination of Gemcitabine
      and RX-0201 as outline above for up to 4 cycles.

          -  Have at least a 6-month life expectancy as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Pre-menopausal women must be surgically sterile or agree to use an accepted method of
             birth control while participating in the study and for 30 days following the last

             birth control described above during the study and for 30 days following the last
             exposure to study drug. The subject's agreed upon method of birth control will be
             discussed and documented in the subjects source document during the screening phase of
             the study.

          -  Have a history of brain cancer (primary or metastatic).

          -  Have a history of an active hematologic malignancy within the past 2 years.

          -  Have an underlying diagnosis or disease state associated with an increased risk of

          -  Have a serious infection requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy during screening.

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or have a positive serum pregnancy test during
