      Evaluation of fibrin and platelet deposition on a human umbilical endothelial cell surface in
      perfusion chamber experiments using human whole blood.

      Open-label, non interventional study Perfusion chamber experiment will be performed in 30
      healthy patients. The Impact of different pH-solutions on thrombus lysis will be evaluated in
      an in-vitro second step

      Outcome:

      D-Dimer content of the thrombus reflecting the size of the thrombus.

      All Subjects will have two perfusion chamber experiment as follow with an estimated maximum
      of blood loss of 165ml:

      Before blood perfusion, perfuse the system including the chambers with human umbilical vein
      endothelial cell coated glass slides (HUVEC), with sodium chloride (NaCl) (0.9%), to ensure
      no leaks and to remove all air bubbles.

      Blood is drawn from a vein in the arm with a Surflo® Winged Infusion Set, 19G (Terumo Europe,
      Leuven, Belgium) with a pump (Masterflex® L/S™, Cole-Parmer Instrument Company, Vernon Hills,
      Illinois, USA). Five mL of blood is discarded before each perfusion.

      Three in serial placed flow chambers (with HUVEC) heated to 37°C are used. They are made of a
      Plexiglas block through which a cylindrical hole of 0.2 cm in diameter is machined. The aorta
      pieces are perfused at 10 mL/min for 5 minutes, followed by a 30 seconds perfusion with NaCl
      (0.9%).

      The plasmin degraded thrombus D-Dimer content will be further evaluated under different
      conditions (different pH solutions).
