    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, 3-treatment, 3-period, crossover, single-dose study in
      healthy subjects. Eighteen (18) subjects will complete the study; dropouts may be replaced at
      the discretion of the sponsor. Three treatments are:

      Treatment A: Revatio 20 mg intact tablet. Treatment B: Revatio 20 mg crushed tablet mixed
      with apple sauce. Treatment C: Revatio 20 mg extemporaneously prepared suspension (EP). Blood
      samples for the analysis of sildenafil in plasma will be obtained pre-dose and up to 14 hours
      post dose in each period. Tolerability and safety will be assessed by reported adverse events
      during each study period.
