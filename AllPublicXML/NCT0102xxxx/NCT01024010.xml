      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving ofatumumab
      together with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide may be a better way to block cancer growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving ofatumumab together with pentostatin
      and cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Arm A: To assess the rate of complete response using pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and
      ofatumumab in patients with previously untreated CLL or SLL requiring therapy.

      II. Arm B: To assess the treatment-free survival rate at 18 months using
      pentostatin,cyclophosphamide, and ofatumumab induction therapy followed by ofatumumab
      consolidation in patients with previously untreated CLL or SSLL requiring therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Arm A and Arm B: To assess the rate of overall response in patients with previously
      untreated CLL or SLL requiring therapy and to determine the proportion of patients who
      achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative state as assessed by flow cytometry in each
      arm independently.

      II. Arm A and Arm B: To monitor and assess toxicity in patients with previously untreated CLL
      or SLL in each arm independently.

      III. Arm A and Arm B: To determine the progression-free survival, treatment-free survival,
      and duration of response in each arm independently.

      IV. Arm A and Arm B: To determine if molecular prognostic parameters (ZAP-70, CD38,
      cytogenetic abnormalities identified by FISH, IgVH mutation status, etc) relate to response
      to therapy in each arm independently.

      V: Arm B: To assess the rate of complete response using pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and
      ofatumumab induction followed by ofatumumab consolidation in patients with previously
      untreated CLL or SLL requiring therapy.

      VI: Arm B: To evaluate whether consolidation therapy with ofatumumab after PCO induction
      improves the depth of response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ofatumumab IV on days 1-2 of course 1 and on day 1 of courses 2-6.
      Patients also receive pentostatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 30
      minutes on day 1, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on Arm
      B receive additional courses with single agent ofatumumab IV on day 1 for 6 courses (courses
      7-12). Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

             including previous documentation of:

          -  a) Biopsy-proven small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or

          -  b) Diagnosis of CLL according to NCI working group criteria as evidenced by ALL of the
             following:

          -  1) Peripheral blood lymphocyte count of &gt; 5,000/mm^3 consisting of small to moderate
             size lymphocytes, with &lt; 55% prolymphocytes

          -  2) Immunophenotyping consistent with CLL defined as: i) The predominant population of
             lymphocytes share both B-cell antigens (CD19, CD20, or CD23) as well as CD5 in the
             absence of other pan-T-cell markers (CD3, CD2, etc.); ii) Dim surface immunoglobulin
             expression; iii) Restricted surface kappa or lambda light chain expression

          -  NOTE: Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or lymphadenopathy are not required for the
             diagnosis of CLL

          -  3) Before diagnosing CLL or SLL, mantle cell lymphoma must be excluded by
             demonstrating a negative FISH analysis for t(11;14)(IgH/CCND1) on peripheral blood or
             tissue biopsy or negative immunohistochemical stains for cyclin D1 on involved tissue
             biopsy

          -  Patients must be previously untreated and meet at least one of the following
             indications for chemotherapy:

          -  a) Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of or
             worsening anemia (=&lt; 11 g/dl) and/or thrombocytopenia (=&lt; 100,000/mm^3) not due to
             autoimmune disease

          -  b) Symptomatic or progressive lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly

          -  c) One or more of the following disease-related symptoms: 1) Weight loss &gt; 10% within

          -  Any of the following comorbid conditions: New York Heart Association Class III or IV
             heart disease; recent myocardial infarction (&lt; 1 month); uncontrolled infection;
             infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) as further severe
             immunosuppression with this regimen may occur; infection with known chronic, active
             Hepatitis B or C or Hepatitis B carriers

          -  Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose
             genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are
             unknown: pregnant women; nursing women; men or women of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to employ adequate contraception

          -  Other active primary malignancy requiring treatment or limiting survival to =&lt; 2 years

          -  Any radiation therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration

          -  Any major surgery =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration

          -  Current use of corticosteroids (EXCEPTION: Low doses of steroids [&lt; 10 mg of
             prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid] used for treatment of non-hematologic
             medical conditions; NOTE: Previous use of corticosteroids is allowed)

          -  Active hemolytic anemia requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other pharmacologic
             treatment; patients who have a positive Coombs test but no evidence of hemolysis are
