    <description>The change from baseline (CFB) to Day 15 (Visit 4) in the ocular signs and symptoms composite score. Ocular signs and symptoms were collected for study eyes at each study visit using a 0-4 grading scale, assessed as 0 = none, 1 = minimal/trace, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The signs and symptoms composite score was the sum of each individual sign or symptom score. Per protocol population (PP).</description>

Ocular signs and symptoms were collected for study eyes at each study visit using a 0-4 grading scale, assessed as 0 = none, 1 = minimal/trace, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The signs and symptoms composite score was the sum of each individual sign or symptom score. Per protocol population (PP).</description>
