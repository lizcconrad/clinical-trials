    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS-9411 in patients
      with Cystic Fibrosis. GS-9411 is a sodium channel inhibitor, that may restore airway
      hydration and mucociliary clearance in the lung.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GS-9411 is being evaluated as a potential therapy to improve airway hydration and mucociliary
      clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. This study is evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of 2 dose levels of GS-9411 as an inhaled product, compared to a matched
      placebo.
