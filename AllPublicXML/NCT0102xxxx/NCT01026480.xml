  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the factors that predispose patients to complications after an ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis procedure (IPAA). Our goal is to establish a registry that
      prospectively captures pre- and post-surgical data from participants. Retrospective studies
      concerning IPAA outcomes and will be conducted using these data.

  <detailed_description>

      In order to better understand the long-term outcomes following IPAA, a registry that collects
      pertinent information about the underlying disease and its treatments and complications in an
      organized manner must be established. Establishing this Registry will allow us to follow
      patients who have an IPAA and organize retrospective medical information into a meaningful
      system.
