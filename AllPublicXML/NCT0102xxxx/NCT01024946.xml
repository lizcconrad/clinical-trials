  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma that has grown despite treatment with
      standard chemotherapy, no treatment has yet proven beneficial. The purpose of this study is
      to find out what effects, both good and bad, that everolimus has on the cancer. Everolimus
      works by blocking a protein that helps the cancer grow. The goal of this clinical research
      study is to learn if the study drug everolimus can shrink or slow the growth of mesothelioma.
      The safety of this drug will also be studied. The patients' physical state, changes in the
      size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken during the study will help us decide if
      everolimus is safe and effective.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter, open label, phase II study of everolimus as a second or third line
      therapy for the treatment of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma, which will also
      evaluate Merlin/NF2 loss as a biomarker to predict sensitivity to everolimus. Patients who
      have disease progression after one or two prior chemotherapy regimens will be eligible. In
      the first stage of this design, 19 patients will be accrued. If 6 or less patients among the
      first 19 patients show clinical benefit, then the study will be terminated and declared
      negative. If 7 or more patients show clinical benefit, than an additional 20 patients will be
      accrued to the second stage. At the end of the study, if 17 or more patients show clinical
      benefit out of a total of 39 patients enrolled, the regimen will be considered worthy of
      further investigation.

    <description>Everolimus will be administered at a dose of 10mg orally once daily continuously. Dose reduction may be required depending on the type and severity of toxicity encountered.

            <description>This is a multicenter, open label, phase II study of everolimus as a second or third line therapy for the treatment of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma, which will also evaluate Merlin/NF2 loss as a biomarker to predict sensitivity to everolimus. Patients who have disease progression after one or two prior chemotherapy regimens will be eligible. In the first stage of this design, 19 patients will be accrued. If 6 or less patients among the first 19 patients show clinical benefit, then the study will be terminated and declared negative. If 7 or more patients show clinical benefit, than an additional 20 patients will be accrued to the second stage. At the end of the study, if 17 or more patients show clinical benefit out of a total of 39 patients enrolled, the regimen will be considered worthy of further investigation.
everolimus: Everolimus will be administered at a dose of 10mg orally once daily continuously. Dose reduction may be required depending on the type and severity</description>
