  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to support the suspected expectation that Contrast enhanced
      Ultrasound (CUS) detects all endoleaks that have been detected by Computed Tomography (CT),
      and also find a number of leaks missed by CT.

      The investigators' primary goal is to detect no difference between CT and CUS and provide
      evidence that CUS is a possible alternative to CT.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase 1 - Pilot phase</arm_group_label>
    <description>Total of 10 patients currently undergoing EVAR Surveillance. These 10 patients include 5 patients with endoleak known from a recent CT scan and 5 patients with no endoleak and shrinking aneurysm.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase 2 - Blinded from CT Scan</arm_group_label>
    <description>This phase of study involves recruitment of 150 patients currently under post-EVAR surveillance. The physicians and ultrasound technologists will be blinded to the result of the CT Scan when performing and interpreting the CUS. The current schedule for EVAR Surveillance will be maintained so that an individual may receive more than one enhanced CT Scan and CUS during the 18 months of the study.</description>
