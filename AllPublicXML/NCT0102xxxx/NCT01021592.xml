      This observational study will observe the degree of the quality of life in patients with
      multiple myeloma before and after bortezomib administration by using EORTC-QLQ C30 (European
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30) and
      EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimensions). Both tools are validated research instruments used to measure
      the quality of life in cancer patients and consequently will provide fundamental data
      regarding the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma by analyzing factors that
      affect the quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma have been conducted in Korea, but
      none of them have evaluated the improvement in the quality of life in patients with multiple
      myeloma. Most study variables used to evaluate the quality of life of patients with multiple
      myeloma are subjective and limited. This study will observe the degree of change in the
      quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma before and after bortezomib administration
      by using EORTC-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
      Life Questionnaire-Core30) and EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimensions), validated research instruments
      used to measure the quality of life in cancer patients and consequently will provide
      fundamental data regarding the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma..
