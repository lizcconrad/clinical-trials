  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial will be performed to evaluate the effects of lung volume
      reduction surgery (LVRS) in patients with COPD on systemic inflammation, oxidative stress,
      endothelial function, arterial stiffness and blood pressure. We hypothesize that LVRS will
      lead to a reduction of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness and blood
      pressure and to improved endothelial function.

      For this purpose 30 patients with severe/very severe COPD (GOLD III-IV) and pulmonary
      emphysema who are to undergo LVRS will be randomised to one of two groups: group 1 receiving
      immediate LVRS and group 2 receiving LVRS after a delay of 3 months.

      Measures of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial function, arterial stiffness
      and blood pressure will be measured at baseline and 3 months after surgery and no surgery,
      respectively (group 2 receiving surgery only after a delay of 3 months will serve as control
      group) to investigate the effects of LVRS on the described outcomes.
