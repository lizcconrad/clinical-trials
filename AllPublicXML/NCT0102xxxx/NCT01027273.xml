  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a peer-led stroke recurrence prevention
      intervention, versus usual care, will help reduce risk factors for recurrent strokes among
      adults in Harlem.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty nine percent of the 700,000 strokes that occur yearly nationwide are among stroke
      survivors. Blacks, both nationally and among Harlem residents, have a twofold increase in
      recurrent strokes. Harlem Latinos have a threefold increase in risk relative to Whites.

      Primary risk factors for recurrent stroke include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and under use
      of anti-thrombotic agents. Controlling risk factors can be particularly challenging for
      low-income, minority populations who lack the resources needed to adhere to necessary
      therapies. In Harlem, 72% of adults studied six months post stroke did not have these three
      risk factors treated adequately.

      We propose to determine if participation in a recurrent stroke prevention educational
      intervention, versus usual care, can activated stroke survivors to at reduce primary risk
      factors for recurrent strokes while providing an effective, low-cost, sustainable recurrent
      stroke prevention program in neighborhoods like Harlem, whose residents bear a
      disproportionate burden of suffering from strokes. Specifically, we propose:

        1. Recruit 600 adults who sustained a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the
           past five years by working with Harlem community leaders, local clinical sites including
           the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Institute for Family Health, and the Visiting
           Nurse Service of New York;

        2. To conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine if participation in a peer-led
           stroke prevention program activates stroke and TIA survivors to improve their knowledge
           and self-management strategies and treatments related to stroke prevention; and

        3. To rigorously compare the impact of the intervention with usual care (delayed
           intervention), on increasing the proportion of individuals with strokes and TIAs who are
           appropriately treated to reduce the risk of recurrent events, specifically through
           control of hypertension (blood pressure ≤ 140/90mmHg), hyperlipidemia (LDL
           cholesterol≤100 mg/dl) and use of anti-thrombotic medicines.

    <description>Number of participants adherent to medications as determined with Morisky score ≥ 6 Adherence to medications was measured using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire (Morisky). The questionnaire has been validated against an objective measure of adherence and has been used in racially diverse and elderly patient samples. Scores on the questionnaire can be used to classify patients into low and high adherence groups.
Consistent with standard cut points, participants who scored less than 6 points on the Morisky were categorized as nonadherent to medications and participants who scored 6 to 8 points were categorized as adherent.</description>

Prevent Return of Stroke: Prevent Return of Stroke is a community-based, peer-led stroke recurrence prevention program. This is a bilingual (English/Spanish) education program written at a 4th grade reading level, and contains simple, actionable, messages, easily taught by lay leaders, and focuses on enhancing self-efficacy to make lifestyle changes, to help reduce stroke recurrence risk factors. It consists of 6 sessions (1½ hours each) held over 6-weeks. Topics include learning the risk factors for stroke, controlling hypertension, LDL cholesterol, preventing blood clots, medication adherence, and stress management.The intervention arm will participate in the intervention shortly after enrolling in the trial.</description>

Scores on the questionnaire can be used to classify patients into low and high adherence groups.
Consistent with standard cut points, participants who scored less than 6 points on the Morisky were categorized as nonadherent to medications and participants who scored 6 to 8 points were categorized as adherent.</description>

          <title>Peer-Led Stroke Recurrence Prevention Education</title>
          <description>The intervention group participated in a 6-session course held over a 6-week period. The Prevent Return of Stroke Workshop, led by trained peer educators, aimed to help participants control the risk factors for stroke, thereby preventing recurrence of strokes.
Prevent Return of Stroke: Prevent Return of Stroke is a community-based, peer-led stroke recurrence prevention program. This is a bilingual (English/Spanish) education program written at a 4th grade reading level, and contains simple, actionable, messages, easily taught by lay leaders, and focuses on enhancing self-efficacy to make lifestyle changes, to help reduce stroke recurrence risk factors. It consists of 6 sessions (1½ hours each) held over 6-weeks. Topics include learning the risk factors for stroke, controlling hypertension, LDL cholesterol, preventing blood clots, medication adherence, and stress management.The intervention arm will participate in the intervention shortly after enrolling in the trial.</description>
