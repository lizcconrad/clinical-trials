    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether mentally rehearsing moving one's affected arm after stroke
      will improve the quality and amount of affected arm movement. The study will enroll 100
      people who have experienced a stroke &gt; 1 year ago, and who still have difficulty moving their
      affected wrists and hands. Eligible subjects also cannot have any implanted devices or metal
      above the waist. Each patient will receive 10 weeks of therapy targeting their affected arms.
      Half of the subjects will also be administered mental rehearsal of the exercises that they
      are physically performing, while the other half will be administered stroke information and
      information on additional exercises that they can perform targeting their affected arms.
      Tests of arm movement and use will be given before and after intervention, as well as 3
      months after intervention, to measure response to these interventions. We will also
      administer brain scans before and after intervention. We hypothesize that people receiving
      the mantal and physical rehearsal will show larger arm movement and use changes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:(1) Minimum motor criteria: able to at least actively flex the affected
        wrist a minimum of 10 degrees and actively flex the MP joints of the thumb, and at least 2
        additional MP joints in two additional fingers at least 10 degrees. These movements must be
        repeated at least 3 times in one minute. Additionally, subjects in this study will have to
        exhibit the aforementioned active range of motion and a FM score of 28 to be eligible for
        study inclusion. (2) stroke experienced &gt; 1 year prior to study enrollment; (3) a score &gt;
        25 on the Folstein Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), (4) age &gt; 21 &lt; 75; (5) have
        experienced one stroke; (6) discharged from all forms of physical rehabilitation.

        Exclusion Criteria:(1) &lt; 21 years old; (2) excessive pain in the affected hand, arm or
        shoulder, as measured by a score &gt; 5 on a 10-point visual analog scale; (3) excessive
        spasticity in the affected biceps, triceps, wrist, or fingers, as defined as a score of &gt; 2
        on the Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale;92 (4) currently participating in any
        experimental rehabilitation or drug studies; (5) mirror movements (i.e., involuntary
        movements by the unaffected hand during attempts at unilateral movement by the
        stroke-affected hand); (6) contraindication to a MRI procedure (i.e., metal implants,
        claustrophobia)
