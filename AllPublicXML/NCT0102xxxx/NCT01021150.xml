      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity
           and the maximum administered dose of ombrabulin in combination with cisplatin
           administered every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the overall safety profile of the combination therapy.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ombrabulin, its active metabolite RPR
           258063, and cisplatin in combination.

        -  To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy.

      The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 4-week screening phase,
      21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit and a follow-up period 30 days after
      the last infusion of ombrabulin. The patient will continue treatment until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient's refusal of further treatment.
