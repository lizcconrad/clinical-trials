  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Taste Perception Study is to assess variations in the ability to taste and
      perceive sensations from various stimuli in younger (18-49 years) and older (50-85 years)
      volunteers. The study's goal is to determine how these sensations influence what one likes to
      eat, and what one chooses to eat, and whether there is an association with dietary intake,
      body composition and chronic disease. Another objective of the study is to determine the
      association between variations in oral sensations and genes mediating sensory perception and
      dietary behaviours.

      The objective of the Taste Perception Study is to assess variations in oral sensations in
      younger (18-49 years; n=35) relative to older (50-85 years; n=35) subjects, and determine the
      association between variations in oral sensations and measures of chronic disease risk
      factors, body composition, habitual dietary intake and selected genes mediating sensory
      perception and dietary behaviors. Subjects who are participating in the Glycemic Index study
      (IRB #7196) will be asked for voluntarily participation in the proposed study. These
      volunteers will undergo 1-2 hours of standardized testing. These tests will involve tasting
      or smelling certain foods/beverages or ingredients in foods/beverages and rating the degree
      of liking/disliking, intensity and flavor or odor using a validated general Labeled magnitude
      scale. Volunteers will also be asked to complete a food preference survey and eating
      inventory questionnaire, as well as provide a DNA sample from a cheek swab or blood sample.
      These data will then be merged with the measures of chronic disease risk factors, body
      composition and habitual dietary intake data generated from the Glycemic index study in order
      to better understand if variations in oral sensations influence food preferences and patterns
      and subsequently chronic disease risk.
