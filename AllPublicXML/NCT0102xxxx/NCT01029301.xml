  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is a multifactorial process involving the 3 layers of the skin: Epidermis, dermis
      and hypodermis. Skin aging process involves among others: skin roughness (epidermis), skin
      dyschromia (epidermis, dermis), wrinkles and elastosis - skin texture changes due to collagen
      modification, skin laxity and cellulite (dermis and hypodermis).

      EndyMed has developed the EndyMed Pro system - Computerized Radiofrequency System for Skin
      Tightening. By using a multielectrodes treatment tip an exact computerized thermal pattern
      can be produced allowing to selectively heating one or more of the target tissues (epidermis,
      dermis and hypodermis). In the skin tightening module the dermis and hypodermis would be
      targeted, creating enough thermal effect to induce collagen remodeling with no ablative
      thermal damage in the epidermis or dermis. This post marketing study is intended for
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of the EndyMed Pro system.
