      The intervention was a dialogic nutritional counseling and the control arm was a traditional

The first three meetings will be monthly and the fourth will be 6 months after the last one. Each meeting will be developed within the context of dialogic and participatory education, directed to the adoption of a healthy diet and prevention and control of cardiovascular risk factors.
