    <textblock>
      Over a period of 4 weeks, metacognitive training for schizophrenia patients (MCT), delivered
      both in a group and individually, is compared to cognitive remediation (CogPack training).
      Blind to treatment assignment, both groups are assessed before intervention and four weeks
      later with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), the Psychosis Rating Scales
      (PSYRATS) and cognitive tests. Delusion severity serves as the primary endpoint. It is
      assumed that MCT will improve delusion severity to a greater extent than CR in the course of
      4 weeks taking medication into account.

      Metacognitive training for schizophrenia patients (MCT) is a manualized group intervention
      that can be obtained cost-free online. MCT seeks to sharpen the awareness of schizophrenia
      spectrum patients on cognitive biases (e.g. jumping to conclusions) contributing to delusion
      formation and maintenance and conveys cognitive strategies to counter these. The present
      trial combines group MCT with an individualized cognitive-behavioral oriented approach
      entitled MCT+. Patients with schizophrenia are randomly allocated to either metacognitive
      treatment (MCT) or cognitive remediation (CogPack training). Blind to treatment assignment,
      both groups are assessed prior to intervention and four weeks later with the Positive and
      Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), the Psychosis Rating Scales (PSYRATS) and cognitive tasks.
      Delusion scores derived from the PANSS and PSYRATS serve as main outcome parameters. We also
      explore if MCT improves jumping to conclusions with a probabilistic reasoning task. To make
      results as generalizable as possible to a typical inpatient population, broad inclusion
      criteria are chosen. Patients are only excluded if age is &lt; 18 and &gt; 65 years and diagnoses
      do not meet criteria of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

    <description>Computerized cognitive remediation (CogPack training). A fixed series is administered, which covers a wide range of neuropsychological exercises involving memory, reasoning, selective attention and psychomotor speed. The difficulty level for each patient is adapted automatically depending on to the subject's performance on prior exercises. At the end of each session, the patient receives individual feedback on his or her performance. To match with group MCT, eight sessions are administered. Each session lasts approximately 45-60 minutes.</description>

    <description>The group metacognitive training program (MCT) is fully documented (Moritz, Woodward, &amp; Metacognition Study Group, 2007; VanHam Campus Press) and can be obtained in more than 15 languages cost-free via the following link: www.uke.de/mkt. The group program is delivered to groups of 3-10 patients by trained psychologists addressing delusion-related metacognitive biases (e.g., jumping to conclusions). The eight modules are presented via a video projector using pdf-converted Power-Point slides. Each group session lasts approximately 45-60 minutes. Individualized MCT (MCT+) follows group sessions and accords to the general guidelines for cognitive-behavioral therapy. For each patient, 8 one-to-one sessions were carried in addition to one session relating to the medical history.</description>
