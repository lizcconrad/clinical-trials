  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety,
      tolerance, pharmacokinetics (exposure of drug) and pharmacodynamics (effect) of NN1952 as
      tablets in healthy volunteers and subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

      The trial consists of two parts. In part 1, single escalating doses of NN1952, placebo or
      insulin aspart will be given to healthy volunteers. In part 2, subjects with type 1 or type 2
      diabetes will receive single doses of NN1952 (with/without a meal), insulin aspart and
      placebo.
