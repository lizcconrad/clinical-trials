      This study will look at dietary patterns in individuals with chronic spinal cord injuries and
      the relationship between these dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The
      study is a supplement to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.
      The dietary history from CARDIA will be used. The investigators' primary hypothesis is the
      following: Greater whole-grain and dietary fiber intake will be favorably associated with
      adiposity (BMI and WC) and metabolic CVD risk factors (fasting glucose, fasting insulin,
      HOMA-IR, diabetes, hsCRP, TC, HDL-C, triglycerides, TC/HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C, and systolic
      and diastolic blood-pressure) among a sample of individuals with SCI aged 38-50 who have been
      injured &gt;1 year.
