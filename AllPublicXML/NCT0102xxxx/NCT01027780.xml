      The purpose of the study is to better understand effects of the Mindfulness-Based
      Stress-Reduction (MBSR) program on the physical and emotional health and well-being of adults
      ages 65 and older.

      The effects MBSR may have on the immune system is investigated, including how these effects
      relate to factors such as perceived health, psychological well-being, age, personality, and
      mood.

      This study investigates the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on immune
      responses to multiple concentrations of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in elderly
      volunteers. The research design thus capitalizes on the antibody response to a novel, benign
      antigen to which our subjects will be immunologically naïve. The use of a range of antigen
      concentrations will provide a sensitive indicator for the effects of intervention.

      The Aims of the study are the following:

        1. To examine the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on immunological
           outcomes, perceived health, and psychological well-being in a sample of seniors 65 years
           of age and older.

        2. To examine whether treatment effects are moderated by age, personality traits, physical
           health status, or depression.

        3. To examine the effects of behavioral, psychological, and physiological mediators of
           immune outcome.

    <description>The Trail Making Test is a commonly used neuropsychological test of visual attention and task-switching. In two timed tasks, subjects are asked to first connect numbers (Test A), then alternating numbers and letters (Test B), in sequential order as quickly as possible. Completion times, relating to cognitive processing speed and executive function (respectively), may be utilized individually, and as a difference (B-A) or ratio (B/A) score. The Trails B/A ratio was used as an index of improvement in executive control throughout the trial, with lower scores indicating better performance.</description>

    <description>The standardized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is the primary training tool used to enhance mindfulness. The eight-week-long MBSR program is designed to teach subjects how to develop their inner resources in the service of taking better care of themselves. MBSR training includes the learning and refining of a range of skills aimed at increasing relaxation and awareness of physical experiences and sensations related to physical symptoms, emotions, and thoughts. Special emphasis is placed on movement, meditation, and breathing.</description>

        <title>Trail Making Test</title>
        <description>The Trail Making Test is a commonly used neuropsychological test of visual attention and task-switching. In two timed tasks, subjects are asked to first connect numbers (Test A), then alternating numbers and letters (Test B), in sequential order as quickly as possible. Completion times, relating to cognitive processing speed and executive function (respectively), may be utilized individually, and as a difference (B-A) or ratio (B/A) score. The Trails B/A ratio was used as an index of improvement in executive control throughout the trial, with lower scores indicating better performance.</description>
