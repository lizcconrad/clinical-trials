    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of postoperative posturing on the
      outcome of macular hole surgery. Current practice is divided; some individuals are advised to
      posture face-down for 10 days and others are advised that posturing is unnecessary. By
      evaluating the effect of posturing in a prospective randomised controlled trial the
      investigators hope to determine best practice, enabling surgeons and patients to make
      informed decisions regarding postoperative management.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients having surgery for idiopathic full thickness macular hole

          2. Able and willing to posture face-down for 10 days postoperatively

          3. Agree to participate in the trial and able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of visual loss suggesting a duration of macular hole greater than 12 months

          2. Patients unable or unwilling to posture face-down for 10 days postoperatively

          3. History of trauma that may have been causative

          4. Age less than 16 years (in practice idiopathic macular hole is extremely rare in
             patients under 30 years).

          5. Previous vitrectomy surgery

          6. Additional retinal breaks occurring during surgery that necessitate post-operative
             posturing to prevent retinal detachment.
