    <textblock>
      The investigators investigated the effect and predictors of effectiveness of massage in the
      treatment of patients with posterior shoulder stiffness. This is a randomized controlled
      trial study- massage and control (hand touch) two times a week for 4 weeks. A total of 60
      patients with posterior shoulder tightness were randomized into 2 groups; 52 of them
      completed this study (29 for the massage and 23 for the control). Patient sex, age, body mass
      index, glenohumeral internal rotation range of motion (ROM), duration of symptom, functional
      status, and muscle stiffness were recorded. Additionally, for the massage group, patients
      with glenohumeral internal rotation improvement of 20 degrees after massage were considered
      responsive, and the others were considered nonresponsive. The influences of the
      aftermentioned factors on the effectiveness of massage were analyzed by multivariate
      logistric regression. The overall mean internal rotation ROM increased significantly after
      massage (from 31.9째 to 54.9째; P &lt; 0.001) compared to the control (from 28.7째 to 34.9째; P &gt;
      0.05). There were 22 patients in the responsive group and 7 in the nonresponsive group. Among
      the factors, duration of symptoms, FLEX-SF score, and posterior deltoid stiffness were
      significant predictors of effectiveness of massage. Massage was an effective treatment for
      subjects with posterior shoulder stiffness, but was less effective in patients with longer
      duration of symptoms, higher functional limitation, and less posterior deltoid stiffness.

    <description>For the massage group, a physical therapist with 8 years of clinical experience in manual therapy provided the massage on the posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, and teres minor of the involved shoulder for 18 minutes [about 6 minutes for each muscle and order was random] two times a week for 4 weeks. The techniques of massage included petrissage for 3 minutes and rolling for 3 minutes of soft tissues</description>
