    <textblock>
      A cohort of 4000 community-dwelling adults is followed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      Finnish national A(H1N1)v influenza vaccination campaign in preventing the first episode of
      laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)v influenza. The safety of vaccination and the severity of the
      disease are followed primarily from health care registers. In a subgroup of 200 participants,
      the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine will be studied.

        The subjects will be invited from the population assigned to use the services of Tampere
        health centre, according to the target groups for pandemic vaccination. Invitations will be
        distributed at the maternity clinics for pregnant women, at work places for health
        professionals, and letters will be sent home to random sample of subjects at age groups of
        18-24 years, 25-64 years and potetially later at 65-75 years of age.
