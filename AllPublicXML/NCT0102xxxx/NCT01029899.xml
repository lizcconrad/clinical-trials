  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate how doctors in training are different from very experienced doctors
      when using force to perform colonoscopy with a device that monitors the amount of force
      applied to the colonoscope during colonoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two sequential observational studies designed to identify which
      instrument should be used to assess trainee performance and to quantify trainee skill
      development in performance of colonoscopy over the course of their training program.
