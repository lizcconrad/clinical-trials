      This study is aimed to evaluate the bipolar disorder symptoms in patients presented with
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or recurrent depression.

      Bipolar disorder is a group of mood disorders characterised by elevated or irritable mood
      episodes in patient's lifetime history accompanied by some additional symptoms. In this study
      modern bipolar disorders screening/assessment instruments will be used to explore the
      prevalence of bipolarity symptoms in patients who never been diagnosed with bipolar
      disorders. The results of this study could be useful for more accurate assessment of bipolar
      disorders prevalence in psychiatric patient population, could help to improve the diagnostics
      of bipolar disorders and management of bipolar patients.
