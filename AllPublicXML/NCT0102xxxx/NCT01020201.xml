    <textblock>
      Risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting(PONV) such as past history of PONV and/or
      motion sickness, non-smoking status, female gender, planned opiate use for post-operative
      analgesia were identified in white people. Whereas, risk factors for PONV in female patient
      with mongolian race were not clear. As a different life style and genetic background, new
      risk factors may associate with PONV in this population. The present study is a prospective
      cohort study to identify risk factors for PONV within 24 postoperative hours in chinese
      female patients underwent gynecology operative under general anesthesia.
