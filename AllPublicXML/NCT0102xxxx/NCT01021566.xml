      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combined hemoperfusion-hemodialysis
      treatment is an alternative drug-free, effective, and safe treatment for opiate
      detoxification.

      Drug abuse remains a major society problem in our community and is also a major health
      problem in our modern society. Thus, education to prevent the young generation to avoid drug
      abuse and detoxification to help those to quite from the drug abuse are two major key steps
      in the controlling drug abuse program.

      Currently, medications for opiate detoxification, such as methadone, are commonly used
      worldwide. However, methadone is also an addictive medication. When it is stopped suddenly,
      patients usually produce unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, methadone is also
      potentially to be abused too. Thus, it is urgently needed to seek an alternative safer,
      effective, drug-free method for opiate detoxification. Based on our clinical observation, the
      timely clearance of toxicities from the body or blood is a safe and effective detoxification
      method. Thus, we hypothesized that the use of combined hemoperfusion-hemodialysis may be an
      alternative drug-free, effective, and safe treatment for opiate detoxification. This will be
      tested in patients who have severe drug abuse and are under custodial conditions by a daily
      combined hemoperfusion-hemodialysis for 3 days. The efficacy and safety of the
      hemoperfusion-hemodialysis will be compared to a 10 day standard methadone detoxification
      treatment.

    <description>On admission all patients will undergo a 3-day stabilization period. Then they will begin the 10-day methadone treatment regimen. The starting dose of methadone is determined by the mean daily dose requirement during the stabilization period and the dose will be reduced to zero at a linear rate over the 10 days treatment.</description>
