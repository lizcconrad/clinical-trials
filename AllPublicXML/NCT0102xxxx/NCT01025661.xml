      The purpose of the study is to explore the short term effects of chiropractic care on pain
      and function in patients with hip osteoarthritis.

      Research over the last years have reported a scarce of trails investigating chiropractic
      treatment of lower extremities. Osteoarthritis, also called joint failure, is a common
      rheumatic joint disease often affecting the hipjoint, contributing to pain, decreased
      mobility and loss of function. Individuals with osteoarthritis can also be affected in many
      other ways, e.g. economically, socially and emotionally.

      Chiropractic care may be considered as a complement to the conventional allopathic treatment
      of hip osteoarthritis. Joint manipulation is a well-established treatment technique to
      restore optimal joint function of the locomotor system. The aim of the study is to explore
      the effects of chiropractic vs. continued conventional care (waiting list controls) on pain
      and function during a three week trail period among patients with hip osteoarthritis waiting
      for arthroplasty.

    <description>Clinical examinations and treatments were performed at the outpatient clinic. The patients were assessed and treated by research assistants and the clinical care was supervised by state registered chiropractors. The choice of therapy and modality was pragmatic and based on the analysis of different functions such as mobility, tenderness, muscle tension and tone, and each patient's relative symptoms. Chiropractic care included high-velocity and low-amplitude techniques, soft-tissue or myofascial techniques, and arthrokinematic stabilizing exercises or a combination of these. Patients were treated in 1-2 sessions per week during the trial.</description>
