  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to establish a safe dose of the drug by providing
      information on any potential side effects this drug may cause and collecting data about how a
      patient's cancer responds to the drug. The study will also assess the blood levels and action
      of AZD2014 in the body over a period of time and will indicate whether the drug has an effect
      on the types of cancer the patients have.
