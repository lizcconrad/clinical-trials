  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At any given time, 10 million Americans suffer from temporomandibular disorders (TMD), with a
      lifetime prevalence of 45% and costs for direct care exceeding $2 billion/year. Little
      evidence exists regarding the efficacy of specific conservative interventions used to treat
      TMD and currently there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; of care that is widely accepted by the dental
      or medical community. This study is a prospective, randomized 4 arm parallel observer-masked
      pilot study comparing: 1) Activator Methods Chiropractic Technique (AMCT), 2) a conservative
      dental approach with reversible interocclusal splint therapy, 3) a sham AMCT, and 4) a
      self-care only group, which includes a standard checklist of self-care jaw relaxation
      techniques, for a total of 80 patients with chronic myofascial TMD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be offered the self-care checklist of homecare approaches at baseline.
      Patients will be treated for two months with follow up at 3 and 6 months after enrollment.
      The primary outcome measure will be an 11 point Numerical Rating Scale for average TMD pain
      during the past week. Secondary outcomes will include the Oral Health Impact Profile
      (OHIP-14), believability of the sham AMCT compared to active AMCT, expectations of and
      satisfaction with care, medication use, bothersomeness of symptoms and health care
      utilization. Our project is a collaborative effort between the Palmer Center for Chiropractic
      Research (PCCR) and the University of Iowa (UI) through the College of Dentistry and the
      General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) Oral and Craniofacial Unit. The PCCR Clinic and Data
      Core will serve as the data coordinating center and will develop a web-based data collection
      system for this project. Patient eligibility will be assessed by dental examiners at the UI
      College of Dentistry using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders
      to diagnose chronic, Axis I myofascial TMD. Dental care will be provided by a dentist at UI
      GCRC and chiropractic care will be provided by a private practitioner in close proximity to
      UI. The aims of this project are to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of AMCT for patients with chronic
      myofascial TMD; determine the most appropriate control group(s) for a full-scale randomized
      controlled trial; and to estimate the sample size needed for an adequately-powered trial and
      the recruitment period that would be required. In general, there is a lack of evidence for
      the efficacy of non-surgical treatment for patients with TMD, including chiropractic
      interventions. If the beneficial effects of the AMCT are supported in this pilot study, the
      logistical information gained will allow us to plan a full scale trial for patients suffering
      pain and disability due to TMD. It is anticipated that such a trial will allow clinicians to
      make more informed recommendations for treatment of patients with TMD. At the conclusion of
      this project, we will be well-positioned to prepare an R01 level grant application.

    <description>Following the dental exam, patients will have maxillary and mandibular polyvinyl siloxane impressions made. Interocclusal records will be made with a fast setting silicone using a metal tray. A commercial laboratory will then wax and heat process a clear acrylic resin splint attempting to capture the mandibular cusp tips in the occlusal plan of the splint. The splint will be adjusted to provide uniform posterior centric occlusal stops followed by evaluation for canine guidance. The splint will then be polished and home care instruction provided.

    <description>This protocol will attempt to follow all of the procedures of the actual AMCT protocol except that when a thrust is given with the Activator instrument, the clinician will place the thumb of his left hand over the spot that would normally be adjusted. The tip of the instrument them will be placed very close to, but not touching the thumb. Consequently, the patient will feel the contact of the clinician's thumb on the spot that would be normally adjusted, and will hear the click of the instrument, but no thrust will be delivered to the patient.</description>

          <description>This technique uses a hand held instrument to deliver a quick, shallow thrust in a well defined manner.
Chiropractic w/Activator &amp; Self Care: This technique uses a hand held instrument to deliver a quick, shallow thrust in a well defined manner. The instrument has two handles that are squeezed together until it clicks, resulting in a shallow, very quick thrust to the segment that is to be adjusted. The AMCT protocol is a structured method of chiropractic treatment that utilized a number of simple biomechanical tests in order to determine where to adjust. These tests are mostly well defined movements of body parts such as extending the head or laterally moving the mandible relative to the rest of the skull. This protocol includes treatment of the full spine and appendages as well as the area immediately around the jaw.</description>

          <description>Intraoral splints are removable orthopedic appliances made of acrylic resin positioned between remaining teeth and designed in theory to support function of the TMJ and relieve pain. Stabilization splints are believed to function by stabilizing intracapsular structure of TMJ, reducing activity of masticatory muscles, distributing occlusal forces, and reducing bruxism (teeth grinding).
Dental Care &amp; Self Care: Following dental exam, patients will have maxillary and mandibular polyvinyl siloxane impressions. Interocclusal records will be made with a fast setting silicone using a metal tray. Commercial laboratory will wax and heat process acrylic resin splint to capture mandibular cusp tips in the occlusal plan of splint. Splint will be adjusted to provide uniform posterior centric occlusal stops followed by evaluation for canine guidance. Splint will be polished and home care instruction provided.

Sham AMCT: This protocol will attempt to follow all of the procedures of the actual AMCT protocol except that when a thrust is given with the Activator instrument, the clinician will place the thumb of his left hand over the spot that would normally be adjusted. The tip of the instrument them will be placed very close to, but not touching the thumb. Consequently, the patient will feel the contact of the clinician's thumb on the spot that would be normally adjusted, and will hear the click of the instrument, but no thrust will be delivered to the patient.</description>

            <description>This technique uses a hand held instrument to deliver a quick, shallow thrust in a well defined manner.
Chiropractic w/Activator &amp; Self Care: This technique uses a hand held instrument to deliver a quick, shallow thrust in a well defined manner. The instrument has two handles that are squeezed together until it clicks, resulting in a shallow, very quick thrust to the segment that is to be adjusted. The AMCT protocol is a structured method of chiropractic treatment that utilized a number of simple biomechanical tests in order to determine where to adjust. These tests are mostly well defined movements of body parts such as extending the head or laterally moving the mandible relative to the rest of the skull. This protocol includes treatment of the full spine and appendages as well as the area immediately around the jaw.</description>

            <description>Intraoral splints are removable orthopedic appliances made of acrylic resin positioned between remaining teeth and designed in theory to support function of the TMJ and relieve pain. Stabilization splints are believed to function by stabilizing intracapsular structure of TMJ, reducing activity of masticatory muscles, distributing occlusal forces, and reducing bruxism (teeth grinding).
Dental Care &amp; Self Care: Following dental exam, patients will have maxillary and mandibular polyvinyl siloxane impressions. Interocclusal records will be made with a fast setting silicone using a metal tray. Commercial laboratory will wax and heat process acrylic resin splint to capture mandibular cusp tips in the occlusal plan of splint. Splint will be adjusted to provide uniform posterior centric occlusal stops followed by evaluation for canine guidance. Splint will be polished and home care instruction provided.

Sham AMCT: This protocol will attempt to follow all of the procedures of the actual AMCT protocol except that when a thrust is given with the Activator instrument, the clinician will place the thumb of his left hand over the spot that would normally be adjusted. The tip of the instrument them will be placed very close to, but not touching the thumb. Consequently, the patient will feel the contact of the clinician's thumb on the spot that would be normally adjusted, and will hear the click of the instrument, but no thrust will be delivered to the patient.</description>
