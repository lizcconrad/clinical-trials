  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If subjects are listed for kidney transplant and are considered sensitized, this means they
      have a high amount of antibodies in their blood that could react to a kidney transplant
      offered for them. Antibodies are protein substances made by the body that fight anything that
      the body considers as a threat to it, such as infection or a kidney transplant. Sensitization
      may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions. Being sensitized can
      increase the subject's kidney transplant waiting time as it is more difficult to find a
      suitable kidney transplant for them that their antibodies will not react to. The purpose of
      this research study is to see if giving the investigational drug belimumab up to one year
      pre-transplant can de-sensitize the subjects, or decrease the amount of antibodies in their
      blood. This may help make the subjects eligible to receive a kidney transplant more quickly.
      If after receiving belimumab, the subjects are compatible with a donor kidney offered and are
      medically suitable for transplant at that time, a kidney transplant will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one third of patients awaiting kidney transplant at our transplant center have
      significant levels of antibodies in their blood leading to a longer wait time for a kidney
      transplant and death. Antibodies in the blood may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or
      blood transfusions. These antibodies sensitize a patient and make it more difficult for the
      patient to get a compatible kidney transplant. The measure of these antibodies is called
      panel reactive antibodies (PRA) and can range from 0-100%, with 100% being most sensitized.
      The waiting time for patients with a PRA in the range of 20%-79% is over 5 years as compared
      to patients with low PRA (0%-19%) which is 3-4 years. Patients with a PRA greater than 80%
      are likely to be granted extra points to increase the chances of transplantation. Antibodies
      in these patients may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions. To date,
      no trials with belimumab have been performed in patients with pre-existing antibodies
      awaiting kidney transplantation. This study is undertaken to assess the effectiveness and
      safety of using belimumab to normalize antibody levels in sensitized patients awaiting kidney
      transplantation. It is hoped that decreasing these antibodies will decrease the waiting time
      on the kidney transplant list, and allow the patient to become compatible with a donor kidney
      for transplant.

    <measure>Effectiveness of Belimumab to Normalize Allo-antibody Levels in Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplantation.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year pre-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Before transplant it is necessary to measure antibodies that the recipient might have and compare them to the living or decease donor's immune make-up. Recipients with many antibodies or a specific antibody in a high concentration may have a more difficult time finding a compatible donor, and being transplanted. These recipients are referred to as sensitized patients. It is important that the sensitized recipient and the donor be compatible to prevent rejection after transplant. We measured antibodies levels in sensitized patients waiting for kidney transplant, to see if belimumab would decrease these antibody levels.</description>

    <measure>Successful Kidney Transplantation From a Cross-match Compatible Donor (as a Result of Belimumab Therapy)</measure>
    <time_frame>one year pre-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>In order for a sensitized recipient ( a recipient with antibodies) to be transplanted, the cross match with the donor has to be compatible. We wanted to study if belimumab reduced antibodies in sensitized patients and led those patients to subsequently become cross-match compatible with a donor and allow for successful transplant.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of Belimumab Measured as Number of Participants With Specific Dilution Factors at Each Time Point.</measure>
    <time_frame>Belimumab serum drug dilution factors were measured in patients at at timepoints 0 (first day of belimumab), day 14, day 56, day 168, 364, at any unscheduled visits, and at 8 weeks post completion of belimumab therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>We wanted to look at belimumab pharmacokinetics in sensitized patients awaiting kidney transplant. These are reported as number of participants with specific dilution factors at each studied time-point. Blood for these tests could be drawn pre dose as well as 0-4 hours after the dose was given. Belimumab dilutions factors were measured pre dose at timepoints 0 (first day of belimumab), days 56 and 364. Belimumab dilution factors were measured after the dose on days 14, and 168. Belimumab dilution factors were also measured at 8 weeks after completion of belimumab therapy and pre dose at any unscheduled visits if needed.</description>

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Belimumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Belimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that recognizes and inhibits BLyS ®. BLyS ® is a B-lymphocyte stimulator protein which plays a role in the development of B lymphocyte cells into plasma B cells, which then produce antibodies that can sensitize a potential transplant recipient. At the time of this trial, belimumab was not yet FDA approved and was being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Until this trial, it had not yet been used in the transplant setting.</description>

          <description>Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody. It is the first drug of its type in a new class of medications called BLyS-specific inhibitors. In March 2011, it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard therapy. In this study, belimumab was being used to try to decrease the amount of antibodies in the subject's blood pre-kidney transplant. This use was considered investigational (not approved by the Food and Drug Administration).
Belimumab : The subjects were given this medication as an outpatient as an intravenous infusion through the arm. The medication was given at the beginning of the study, two weeks later, and then every 4 weeks for up to one year pre-transplant.</description>

        <title>Effectiveness of Belimumab to Normalize Allo-antibody Levels in Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplantation.</title>
        <description>Before transplant it is necessary to measure antibodies that the recipient might have and compare them to the living or decease donor's immune make-up. Recipients with many antibodies or a specific antibody in a high concentration may have a more difficult time finding a compatible donor, and being transplanted. These recipients are referred to as sensitized patients. It is important that the sensitized recipient and the donor be compatible to prevent rejection after transplant. We measured antibodies levels in sensitized patients waiting for kidney transplant, to see if belimumab would decrease these antibody levels.</description>

            <title>Belimumab</title>
            <description>Belimumab will be administered intravenously at a dose of 10mg/kg on days 0, 14, 28 and every 28 days for up to 52 weeks to normalize alloantibody levels in sensitized patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Subjects who are not able to undergo transplantation before the end of the treatment period will have final follow-up evaluation 8 weeks after the last dose of belimumab is administered.
Belimumab: Belimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that recognizes and inhibits BLyS ®. BLyS ® is a B-lymphocyte stimulator protein which plays a role in the development of B lymphocyte cells into plasma B cells, which then produce antibodies that can sensitize a potential transplant recipient. At the time of this trial, belimumab was not yet FDA approved and was being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Until this trial, it had not yet been used in the transplant setting.</description>
