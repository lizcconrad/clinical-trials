      Hypocalcemia is the complication, after total thyroidectomy, that usually determines the
      length of hospital stay.Serum calcium levels is a quick and cost-effective practice to
      recognise hypocalcemia in the postoperative follow up.

      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this perspective study is to determine if consecutive
      postoperative serum calcium levels early after total thyroidectomy can be used to identify
      patients who are unlikely to develop significant hypocalcemia and can be safely discharged
      within 24 to 48 hours postoperative.

      INTRODUCTION:

      In recent years there has been a global trend towards more radical and aggressive approach to
      thyroid surgery (total or subtotal thyroidectomy against semithyreoeidectomy), almost
      regardless of the pathological cause, even for benign diseases. There is also developed, a
      serious skepticism as complications of total or subtotal thyroidectomy is neither rare nor
      insignificant. In particular, complications of thyroidectomy is the laryngeal nerve paresis
      (0.2% bilateral, unilateral 3,7-3,9%, 2% transient, lasting 1%), bleeding (1-2%), infection
      of the wound (0, 3-1,6%) and hypocalcaemia (permanent hypocalcaemia in over 6 months follow
      up 1,7-4,4%, while transient, manageable with vit D and calcium substitution 8,3-9,9%). The
      post total thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia is not only more frequent but also has the most
      delayed onset after surgery (up to several 24hours later) in relation to bleeding and paresis
      of the laryngeal nerve, which is immediate postoperative complications. This is the main
      cause of prolonged hospitalization and monitoring of patients postoperatively which is linked
      to increased risk of bacterial infections and increased cost.9, 10 Great effort has been made
      in the last 15 years to reduce the length hospital stay of patients in order to perform the
      total thyroidectomy as a one day surgery.6, 11 In this way great importance is the prediction
      of those patients are more likely to experience post-operative hypocalcaemia. The appearance
      of postoperative hypocalcaemia associated with specific diseases such as thyroid disease
      Graves, the thyreotoxicosis and thyroid cancer 7.8, and the surgical technique (the extent of
      excision, the type of thyroid artery ligation, the number of parathyroid recognized
      intraoperative but also those autotransplanted) 12. Moreover, beyond these factors, great
      importance is given to methods of monitoring patients to find reliable indicators to allow
      safe release out of the hospital after the first 24 hours without risk of hypocalcaemia. The
      measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) both intraoperative and postoperatively (4 hours) is
      a hot topic in contemporary literature and promises accurate predictions 13, but there is
      disagreement about the precise time of receiving the specimens and great consideration about
      the increased cost 14, 15 (at our hospital is not even available). An older, simple, fast and
      economical method is to measure levels of free serum calcium 6,9. Despite that the
      correlation of the immediate post-operative levels of free calcium, with the likelihood of
      developing hypocalcaemia has variations in different surveys, resulting to early release of
      patients directly when free calcium is in normal range, by some departments, while others
      follow strict protocols of monitoring patients for days . However, the variation in the
      levels of free serum calcium between the first 6 and 12 postoperative hours alone or in
      combination with measurement of PTH seems to give some answers and it is under great
      consideration in the international community.

      It is therefore, in line with the current literature, important to develop a safe, and also
      cost-effective protocol monitoring patients after total thyroidectomy, which, in combination
      with predisposing risk factors of hypocalcaemia, will predict low-risk patients for
      developing hypocalcaemia and allow secure release from the hospital.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      The objective of this perspective study is to correlate the variability of the levels of free
      serum calcium (Ca + +), and also the levels of albumin (ALB), phosphorus (PO-3), magnesium
      (Mg) and total albumin (TPR), between two measurements on 6 and 12 hours postoperatively, the
      incidence of hypocalcaemia in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for any reason. The aim
      is to develop on the basis of variation in levels of free serum calcium, a secure method of
      prediction and identification of low risk patients for developing hypocalcaemia providing an
      early release from hospital.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      The correlation between development of hypocalcaemia in patients after total thyroidectomy
      with the following factors:

        -  Gender,
