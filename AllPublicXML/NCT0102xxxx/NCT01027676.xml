  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gefitinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (EGFR-TKI) and produces 8-20% of response rates in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]) is a small-molecule
      inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest,
      and apoptosis in several tumor cells. There is a strong synergistic antiproliferative effect
      of vorinostat in combination with gefitinib in NSCLC cells. Vorinostat increases expression
      of E-cadherin and ErbB-3, which results in increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Moreover,
      In-vitro studies have shown that vorinostat leads to acetylation and disruption of Hsp90,
      which may lead to decreases in activity of pro-growth and prosurvival client proteins (J Bio
      Chem 2005;280:26729, Br J Cancer 2006;95:S2). These findings suggest that combination of
      vorinostat with gefitinib may improve the efficacy of gefitinib in NSCLC.

      Phase I design

        -  Three patients will be treated per cohort for one cycle (28 days per cycle).

        -  If no DLTs are recorded, treatment will continue and three patients will be treated in
           the subsequent cohort.

        -  However, if a patient develops a DLT, another three patients will be treated in this
           cohort for one cycle.

        -  If there are no more DLTs, dose escalation continues.

        -  If more than one of three patients develop a DLT in any cohort, another three patients
           will be treated in the next lower dosage cohort.

        -  If no DLTs are recorded in any of the cohorts, cohort 3 will be expanded to six
           patients.

        -  Up to 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD.

        -  The phase II dose for this combined treatment will be therefore defined as the highest
           dosage cohort in which six patients had been treated and there are less than three DLTs.
