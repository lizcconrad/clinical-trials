  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sunitinib
      malate before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that
      needs to be removed. Giving sunitinib malate after surgery may kill any tumor cells that
      remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving sunitinib malate before and after
      surgery works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if neoadjuvant sunitinib malate can achieve a clinical benefit of 70% or more
           to the primary renal tumor prior to surgery and adjuvant sunitinib malate in patients
           with metastatic renal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to radiological progression in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients suitable for nephrectomy after neoadjuvant
           sunitinib malate.

        -  Determine the translational endpoints.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for 3 courses. Approximately 2 weeks later, patients undergo a standard radical
      nephrectomy with lymph node dissection. Beginning at least 2 weeks after surgery, patients
      receive oral sunitinib malate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples may be collected periodically for laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

               -  Measurable metastatic disease on CT/MRI imaging

               -  Patients with suspicion of renal cancer on radiology must have a biopsy to
                  confirm diagnosis of clear cell disease

          -  No prior therapy for renal cancer

          -  Judged by the treating physician to have the potential to derive clinical benefit from
             this treatment
