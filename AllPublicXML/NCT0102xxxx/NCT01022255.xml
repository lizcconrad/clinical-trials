  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of an autologous idiotype
      vaccine manufactured by magnICON technology for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma
      who are in complete or partial remission following non-antiCD20 containing salvage therapy.
      Data in terms of idiotype-specific immune responses will also be obtained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologically proven follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 2, or 3a), in
             clinical relapse/progression requiring treatment

          -  Subjects must have had first line treatment consisting of rituximab with or without
             rituximab maintenance therapy (i.e. rituximab monotherapy, R-CHOP, R-CVP, R-FND, etc)

          -  At least 4 months since last rituximab exposure

          -  Subjects may have had any number of prior treatment regimens. If enrolled with
             transformed follicular lymphoma, study subject must have had anthracycline in a
             previous regimen

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 months

          -  Presence of at least a 2x2 cm in diameter lymph node (either a single lymph node or
             combined volume of lymphoid tissue) accessible for excision; for histological
             confirmation of diagnosis and for manufacture of the vaccine

          -  Measurable disease in neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis as assessed by computed
             tomography (CT) scan such that response to 2nd line chemotherapy can be defined by the
             criteria of Cheson et al (JCO 2007; 25:579, see appendix 15.2 and ref 65). PET scan
             results are not required for enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposure to rituximab or antiCD-20 directed therapy within the 4 months prior to
             enrollment

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) infection

          -  Active clinically serious infections (&gt; grade 2 National Cancer Institute Common Toxic
             Criteria [NCI-CTC] version 3.0)

          -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors including lymphoma unless the patient
             is &gt; 6 months from definitive therapy, has a negative imaging study within 4 weeks of
             study entry and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time of study
             entry

          -  History of organ allograft

          -  Patients undergoing renal dialysis
