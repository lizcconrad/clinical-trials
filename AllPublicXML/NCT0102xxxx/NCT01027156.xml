    <description>In this study, participants will be instructed to sprint maximally for a period of 30 seconds. Following 30s rest, the participants will be instructed to repeat this procedure a further 3 times. This equates to 2 minutes of maximal effort sprinting interspersed with 2 minutes recovery. Participants will be requested to perform this protocol 3 times weekly. Training progression will be implemented by increasing the number of repeats from four repetitions during weeks 1 and 2, to five repetitions during weeks 3 and 4, to six repetitions during weeks 5 and 6. Finally, during week 7 participants will still perform six repetitions but interspersed by only 20 s recovery.</description>
