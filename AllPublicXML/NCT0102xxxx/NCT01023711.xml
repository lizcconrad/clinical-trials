  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the immune response to a novel H1N1 influenza
      vaccination in healthy adults, and to understand the factors that allow healthy adults to
      respond to a single dose of vaccine even if they have never previously experience novel H1N1
      disease or vaccination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have now determined that only a single dose of inactivated vaccine is needed for
      immunization against novel H1N1, but the reasons why adults appear to be ready to respond to
      a single dose are not known.

             infection

          -  Previous history of vaccination with A/New Jersey/76 vaccine (for subjects 60 &amp; older

          -  History of egg allergy or is allergic to other components of the vaccine

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or intends to get pregnant during the study

             preceding 36 months

          -  Subject has active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or prostate
             cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any hematological

             symptoms resolved are eligible to enroll as long as treatment is complete &amp; symptoms
             resolved &gt; 3 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject is currently participating or plans to participate in a study that involves an
             experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication) or
             has received an experimental agent within 1 month of enrollment in this study, or

             (disabling) chronic psychiatric diagnosis, or are receiving psychiatric drugs.
             Subjects who are receiving a single anti-depressant drug &amp; are stable for at least 3
             months prior to enrollment without decompensation are allowed enrollment into the
             study.

          -  Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the 5 years of enrollment.

          -  Subject has known human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.
