  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAVgenetics is a partnership between Investigators at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
      Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard-Partners Center for Genetics and Genomics,
      dedicated to discovering the genetic causes of bicuspid aortic valve disease and associated
      aortic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators at BAVgenetics are dedicated to discovering the mechanisms of bicuspid
      aortic valve disease and why individual genetics seem to play such an important role in
      generation of this disease.

      If you have, or have had, a bicuspid aortic valve, we seek your help in this effort by
      volunteering to donate DNA and details of your disease to the Investigators, so that this
      disease can be better understood and therapies for it can be developed.
