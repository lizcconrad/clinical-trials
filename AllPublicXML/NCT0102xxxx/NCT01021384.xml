  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this 2 year research project is to determine whether an evidenced-based
      empowerment strategy, Problem Solving Education (PSE), targeted to mothers of young children
      with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), promotes family well-being by decreasing the burden of
      maternal depressive symptoms and maternal parenting stress and improving social functioning.
      We propose a randomized control trial involving 140 mothers who have children &lt;4 years with
      confirmed ASDs. Based on the paradigm of the IOM report on mental health prevention research
      that highlights the importance of targeting interventions to at-risk populations who may not
      meet diagnostic criteria, all mothers of young children with ASDs will be eligible to
      participate. Consistent with previous studies of cognitive-behavioral interventions, the
      mother-child pairs will be followed for 9 months. The intervention will be embedded in two
      settings that provide services to young children with ASDs - Early Intervention (EI) programs
      and specialty developmental assessment clinics. We aim to support families during a critical
      juncture - when they are confronted with a new diagnosis and are asked to navigate a complex
      service system on their children's behalf. The hypothesis of this proposal is that
      strengthening problem solving skills among mothers of young children with ASDs serve as an
      important buffer against the negative impact of life stressors, and thereby prevent and
      attenuate depressive symptoms and parenting stress.
