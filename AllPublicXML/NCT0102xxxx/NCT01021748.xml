      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of combination therapy with MK-2206
      and AZD6244 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RPTD) for this drug combination in the treatment of participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. Preliminary efficacy data will also be collected.
