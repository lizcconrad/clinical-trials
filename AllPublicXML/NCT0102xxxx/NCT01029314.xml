      Primary study objective is to test the accuracy of the Genius 2 tympanic thermometer and the
      Exergen TAT-5000(TM) temporal artery thermometer as compared with serial perioperative core
      temperature measurements obtained in cardiac surgical patients during cardiopulmonary bypass.
      Study hypothesis: The Genius 2 thermometer will display greater precision and accuracy than
      the Exergen TAT-5000 thermometer when compared to core body temperature in patients
      undergoing CABG surgery.

    <description>Thirty to fifty cardiac surgery patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass will have serial triplicate temperatures taken by both the Genius 2 tympanic thermometer and the Exergen-TAT 5000 temporal artery thermometer at predetermined perioperative time points. These temperature readings will be compared to at least one core temperature (i.e., pulmonary artery).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adult subjects greater than/equal to 18 years of age providing signed
             informed consent

          -  Febrile or afebrile

          -  Planned monitoring of core temperature at a minimum of two separate sites, one of
             which includes the pulmonary artery

          -  Planned use of cardiopulmonary bypass for a cardiac surgical procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mist tents or oxygen hoods

          -  Hot or cold applications to the head

          -  Patients that have the planned use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest

          -  Aural anomalies (e.g., external auditory canal less than 2cm in length, persistent ear
             pain)

          -  Any other major anomaly, surgery or medical condition precluding participation
             according to manufacturers' stated exclusions or in the opinion of the principal
             investigator

          -  Blood, cerumen, excessive hair, inflammation, infection, ulceration or foreign object
             in the ear observed by otoscopic examination

          -  Any other signs or symptoms of distress or a condition which would, or in the opinion
             of the principal investigator, render their participation in the study detrimental to
             their well-being.

          -  Previous refusal or enrollment in this study

          -  Previous or concurrent participation in a clinical trial of a drug or device within
             the past 30 days.
