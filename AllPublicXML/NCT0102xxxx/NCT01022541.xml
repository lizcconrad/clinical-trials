  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the overall response rate of patients with previously untreated unresectable
      liver-only metastases from colorectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant capecitabine and
      oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab.

      No previous treatment.

      The 21 day cycle of treatment will be given for four courses before being reassessed by
      MRI/CT for resectability of their liver metastases.

      Those patients with stable disease or partial response, but are not yet resectable will
      continue for a further four courses of treatment before reassessment.

      Patients whose liver metastases have become resectable will proceed to surgery after a 6 week
      break from the last administration of Capecitabine (8 weeks from the last administration of
      Bevacizumab).

      A further four courses of treatment will be administered post-operatively to commence at
      least 8 weeks after surgery and when the patient is well recovered and healed.

    <description>Bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, diluted in normal saline, will be administered as an iv infusion over 30 to 90 minutes before the administration of oxaliplatin on day 1 of every cycle.
The first infusion should be administered over 90 minutes. If well tolerated, the second infusion can be administered over 60 minutes. Provided that this is tolerated subsequent infusions can be administered over 30 minutes. If a patient experiences an infusion related adverse event with the 60 minute infusion, all subsequent infusions will be administered over 90 minutes. If a patient experiences an infusion related reaction with the 30 minute infusion, all subsequent infusions will be administered over 60 minutes

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma

          -  Metastatic disease present in the liver only.

          -  Absence of extrahepatic metastases excluded by CT chest, abdomen and pelvis.
             Indeterminate CT findings may require verification by FDG-PET scanning.

          -  Liver-only metastases determined to be unresectable at presentation on a pre-treatment
             liver MRI with an appropriate liver specific contrast (eg. TESLA) by a specialist
             multidisciplinary team (consisting of medical oncologist, hepatic surgeon and
             radiologist). Guidelines for determining unresectability include:

          -  presence of &gt;4 metastases;

          -  size &gt;5cm;

          -  location and distribution of metastatic disease within the liver unsuitable for
             resection with clear margins (eg. Involvement of both lobes of liver; invasion of
             intrahepatic vascular structures);

          -  extent of liver involvement precluding resection with adequate post-resection residual
             liver parenchyma volume for viable liver function in the immediate post-operative
             period;

          -  inability to retain adequate vascular in flow and out flow to maintain viable liver
             function.

          -  No previous treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, including chemotherapy,
             targeted or experimental therapies (e.g. anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR), radiotherapy to the
             liver, or surgery or radiofrequency ablation to liver metastases.

          -  Feasibility of surgery with curative intent:

          -  If the primary colorectal tumour is in situ, the primary tumour must also be
             resectable with curative intent

          -  Patients presenting with liver metastases only relapse after initially curative
             resection of their primary colorectal cancer followed by treatment with adjuvant
             chemotherapy may not be entered into the study if the relapse has occurred within 12
             months of completion of adjuvant treatment

          -  Adequate medical fitness to undergo neoadjuvant treatment and surgery with curative
             intent (hepatectomy +/- resection of primary tumour, if required)

          -  Absence of pre-existing liver dysfunction of Childs Pugh Grade B or greater. Patients
             who are suspected of having pre-existing liver dysfunction due to clinical,
             biochemical or radiological findings, should have significant liver disease excluded
             by a liver biopsy prior to study entry.
