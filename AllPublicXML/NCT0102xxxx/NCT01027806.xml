      The investigators leading hypotheses are:

        -  Oral therapy with montelukast may lead to improved sleep study findings in children with
           mild to moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) who require surgical removal of
           adenoids and tonsils for OSAS.

        -  A significant proportion of the children with OSAS treated with montelukast will show
           reduced severity of OSAS, and this will remove the need for surgical intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for inclusion in the study will be symptomatic snoring children &gt;2 years of
             age and &lt; 10 years of age, who snore and have an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;2/hrTST
             (hour total sleep time), and in whom T&amp;A is therefore contemplated. Also among these,
             we will include children referred for evaluation for snoring who have a history of
             allergic rhinitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include: Hypersensitivity to montelukast, immunodeficiency or
             immunosuppressant therapy, craniofacial, neuromuscular, syndromic or defined genetic
             abnormalities, acute upper respiratory tract infection, systemic corticosteroid
             therapy or antibiotic therapy in the 2 weeks previous to the study, and children who
             already had adenotonsillectomy. In addition, children chronically receiving oral
             antihistamine preparations or nasal decongestants will be required to continue using
             these medications throughout the duration of the study. Patients receiving
             immunotherapy will continue on the same regimen without escalation of dose and
             frequency throughout the duration of the study. In addition, patients with severe OSA
             who in the opinion of their treating physicians require early surgical intervention
             for their OSA will be excluded from eligibility to the study.
