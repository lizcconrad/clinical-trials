    <time_frame>Enrollment to the date of progressive disease (PD) or the date of death from any cause (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS defined as time from enrollment date to first date of objective progression of disease or of death from any cause. Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.0, which define when cancer participants improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progression&quot;) during treatments. Participants receiving any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy before objective progression or death were censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment before starting subsequent systemic anticancer therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment to date of progressive disease (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed CR, PR, or SD. Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.0, which define when cancer participants improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progression&quot;) during treatments. CR = disappearance of all target lesions. PR = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. SD = small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

    <description>Measured from the date of the first dose of the maintenance therapy. Calculated by subtracting induction therapy period from PFS. Tumor response assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.0; define when cancer participants improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progression&quot;) during treatments.

    <time_frame>From the start of maintenance therapy in Cycle 5 (21-day cycle) until the date of measured progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause (up to 26.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the duration from the date of the first dose of the maintenance therapy to the date of death from any cause and was calculated by subtracting the induction therapy period from OS. Participants receiving any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy before objective progression or death were censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment before starting subsequent systemic anticancer therapy.

    <description>Percentage of participants who achieved confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions), or SD (small changes that do not meet above criteria). Response derived from target lesion assessments performed before maintenance therapy (as baseline), during maintenance therapy (as post-baseline), and non-target lesion assessments performed during maintenance therapy according to RECIST guideline version 1.0, defines when cancer participants improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progression&quot;) during treatments.</description>

        <description>OS was defined as the duration from the date of the first dose of the maintenance therapy to the date of death from any cause and was calculated by subtracting the induction therapy period from OS.

For participants who were alive, OS was censored at the last contact.</description>
