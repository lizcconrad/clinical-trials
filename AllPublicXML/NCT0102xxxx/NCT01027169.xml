  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (behavior of the
      compound in the body) of safinamide in patients with different degrees of hepatic (liver)
      impairment in comparison to matched subjects with normal hepatic function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatically impaired subjects - Subjects with liver cirrhosis and different degrees of
             impaired hepatic function: mild and moderate impaired hepatic function (Grade A, or B
             according to Child-Pugh classification)

          -  Healthy subjects - Subject is in good age-appropriate physical and mental health as
             established by medical history, physical examination, ECG and vital signs recordings,
             and results of biochemistry, haematology, coagulation and urinalysis testing within 3
             weeks prior to the dosing

          -  All subject have given written informed consent before any study-related activities
             are carried out

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant disease or condition, which in the Investigator's opinion
             would exclude the subject from the study

          -  Diseases or surgeries of the gastrointestinal tract, which could influence the
             gastro-intestinal absorption and/or motility

          -  Hepatically impaired subjects - Subjects with primary biliary liver cirrhosis, hepatic
             encephalopathy grade III and IV, sepsis or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,
             gastrointestinal bleeding within one month before the study, esophagus varices &gt; grade
             II, acute hepatic failure of any aetiology, portosystemic shunt, renal impairment
             (creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min calculated by use of Cockroft Gault formula)

          -  Healthy subjects - Use of any medication, including multi-vitamin preparations,
             received within 21 days prior to the drug administration, or within six times the
             elimination half-life, whichever is longest, except combined oral contraceptives and
             occasional use of paracetamol or ibuprofen within 14 days before study drug
             administration
