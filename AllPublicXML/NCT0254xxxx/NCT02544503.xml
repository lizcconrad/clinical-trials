  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and establish how the area of the brain that
      controls motor function (motor cortex) might serve as a new focus for treatment for stroke.
      The therapeutic intervention aims to identify protocols that improve motor performance after
      stroke.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in motor function assessed by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 month post stroke), 6 months post stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Arm function be evaluated by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). The test consists of timed and functional tasks and has 17 items. It is composed of 3 parts: Time, functional ability and strength and includes 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength based tasks. Items 1-6 involve timed functional tasks, items 7-14 are measures of strength, and the remaining 9 items consist of analyzing movement quality when completing various tasks. The examiner will test the less affected upper extremity followed by the most affected side. Scores are based on time taken to complete each task. The median time to complete all tasks will be be used to evaluate motor function. Larger values indicate greater upper extremity motor dysfunction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in motor function assessed by the Perdue Pegboard Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 month post stroke), 6 months post stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The Perdue Pegboard Test is administered by asking the subject to take pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible. Subjects are asked to then remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container. Only the dominant hand being evaluated will perform the test. The total time taken to complete the task is recorded. Scores are based on the time taken to complete the test activity, and is recorded in seconds. The results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second. Increased number of pegs placed per second is indicative of greater manual dexterity and increased change scores indicate the contribution of paired associative stimulation to hand dexterity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in motor function assessed by the Jebsen Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 month post stroke), 6 months post stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The Jebsen Test assesses weighted and non-weighted hand function. Subjects are assessed through writing, turning over 3 by 5 inch cards, picking up small common objects, simulated feeding, stacking checkers, picking up large objects, and picking up large heavy objects.Patients are required to perform all of the subtests with both the right and left hands, with the non-dominant hand tested first.Time to complete each task is recorded. Total score is calculated as the total time to perform each subtest. A shorter time is a better score.</description>
