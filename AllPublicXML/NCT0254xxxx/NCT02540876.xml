    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies how well ilorasertib works in treating patients with
      cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)-deficient solid cancers that have spread to
      other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced)
      or have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and cannot be removed by surgery.
      Ilorasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform serial tumor volume-based growth trajectory assessments in the setting of a
      candidate therapeutic in a molecularly defined subset of advanced cancer patients.

      II. To enable patients and physicians to make informed and individualized assessments of
      ilorasertib treatment effects on CDKN2A-deficient tumors.

      III. To develop new technologies of quantitative measurements of plasma tumor
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and computed tomography (CT) imaging volume measurements as
      methods to evaluate treatment effects on advanced solid tumors.

      IV. To generate descriptive, proof-of-concept data to inform further investigation of
      ilorasertib in solid tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ilorasertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, and 36.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

          -  Subject has known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement; the subject has
             untreated brain or meningeal metastases; CT scans are not required to rule out brain
             or meningeal metastases unless there is a clinical suspicion of central nervous system
             disease; subjects with treated brain metastases that are radiographically or
             clinically stable for at least 4 weeks after therapy and have no evidence of
             cavitation or hemorrhage in the brain lesion(s) are eligible, providing that they are
             asymptomatic, and do not require corticosteroids (must have discontinued steroids at
             least 1 week prior to study drug administration)

          -  Subject has had major surgery within 28 days prior to study day 1

             measured by a urine dipstick (2+ or greater) and confirmed by a 24 hour urine
             collection (&gt;= 1 g/24 hrs); subjects may be re-screened if proteinuria is shown to be
             controlled with or without intervention

          -  History of:

               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure

               -  Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia (subjects with stable atrial
                  fibrillation are not excluded)

               -  Adrenal insufficiency

          -  Subject is unable to swallow or absorb oral tablets normally

          -  Subject takes cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitors within 3 days
             or inducers within 7 days prior to the study drug administration; any questions or
             clarifications of these determinations should be brought to the attention of the
             principal investigator (PI); the PI will make the final determination on when it is
             safe to initiate ABT-348 (ilorasertib) therapy under circumstances where the magnitude
             or relevance of possible CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers is unclear in the protocol
