  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Epithelial Ovarian Cancer is the most lethal amongst the gynecologic malignancies
      and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.1 Despite
      initial high response rates, 50% to 75% of women who present with advanced disease suffer
      relapse and require re treatment2.The optimal treatment for platinum resistant ovarian cancer
      remains hotly debated. Combination chemotherapy is not favored due to its increased toxicity
      and lack of convincing benefit when compared to single agent chemotherapy.3,4 Recently, the
      addition of bevacizumab to single agent chemotherapy in the AURELIA study improved
      progression free survival (PFS) from 3.4 months to 6.7 months. Response rates were also
      improved from 11.8% versus 27.3% (p= 0 .001).9 Aim: To determine the maximal tolerated dose
      (MTD) of weekly paclitaxel in combination with LDWART. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D)
      will be based on the MTD in this Phase I study. Method: This study is designed as a
      prospective, single arm phase I study with 3+3 with dose de-escalation and cohort expansion.
      All patients will receive weekly paclitaxel at a pre specified dose of 80 mg/m2, 70 mg/m2,
      60mg/m2 or 50 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion according to institution specific standard
      practices. Cycles of chemotherapy will be administered weekly without interruption on Days
      1,8,15,22,29,36 for a total of 6 weekly cycles in combination with LDWART(Fig.1). LDWART will
      be given at 60 cGy fractions, twice daily for two days, with a minimum of 4 hours inter
      fraction interval, starting on day 1 of each cycle of weekly paclitaxel for 6 weeks.(Fig.1).
      Importance of proposed research: The combination of a LDWART with weekly paclitaxel may
      improve the efficacy of the current standard weekly paclitaxel in platinum resistant ovarian
      cancer patients. Potential benefits and risks: The combination may improve treatment
      response. Adding LDWART may increase treatment risks, but these will be monitored closely.

               -  Is a female patient of childbearing potential, defined as a female
                  physiologically capable of becoming pregnant (including a female whose career,
                  lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner, and
                  females whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means), unless
                  they are using a highly effective method for birth control throughout the study

                  control include the following:

                    1. Total abstinence: This is an acceptable method when this is consistent with
                       the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.
                       calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal
                       are not acceptable methods of contraception.

                    2. Female sterilization: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to
                       taking study drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status
                       of the patient must have been confirmed by follow-up hormone level
                       assessment.

                    3. Male partner sterilization: The patient has the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate.

                       (For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be
                       the sole partner for that patient.)

                       These patients must also agree to the following:

                       Use of a combination of the following (1+2):

                         1. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system

                         2. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or cream, or
                            vaginal suppository Reliable contraception maintained throughout the
                            study and for 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation

                    4. Females considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential: The
                       definition applies to females who have had 12 months of natural
                       (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
                       appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous
                       amenorrhea with serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels &gt;40 mIU/mL (for US
                       only: and estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
                       (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks prior to starting treatment.

                       In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
                       patient has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she
                       considered not of childbearing potential.

               -  Is a pregnant or nursing (lactating) female, where pregnancy is defined as the

                  Serum pregnancy test to be assessed within 7 days prior to study treatment start,
                  or within 14 days (with a confirmatory urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior
                  to study treatment start).
