  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute pain remains unfortunately a major health problem in intensive care patients.
      Several factors, such as cancer, traumatic injuries, surgery, scars, diagnostic or
      therapeutic procedure, could contribute to an increase in the incidence or in the intensity
      of acute pain. The acute pain could impact on the prognosis of intensive care patients and on
      the patients perception of the quality of care.

      Moreover, the acute pain could lead to a long-term chronic pain syndrome. The chronic pain
      after intensive care admission could threaten the physical and psychological recovery after
      the stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).

      If many studies have been conducted to improve the management of the acute pain in the ICU,
      only few data exist on the incidence and the risk factors of the chronic pain after a stay in
      a surgical intensive care.

      The aim of the DOLOCHROREA study is to assess the incidence and the risk factors of 6-month
      chronic pain after a stay in our surgical ICU.

    <description>Pain is defined by The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as &quot;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage&quot;. Pain exceeding the average period of healing of 2 to 3 months and ceasing to serve any apparent protective function is defined as chronic pain. The incidence of chronic pain will be assessed by using a validated french version of the Brief Pain Inventory during a phone call at 6 month after the end of the stay in our intensive care unit.</description>
