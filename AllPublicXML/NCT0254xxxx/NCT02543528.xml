    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, bilateral, dispensing, parallel-group
      clinical trial design. All subjects will participate in a 2-week daily disposable contact
      lens adaptation period prior to being randomized into one of the four extended wear lenses.
      The study has a total of 9 scheduled study visits and a total duration of ~197 days. The
      lenses will be replaced with a fresh pair after 6 nights / 7 days of wear.

    <measure>Number of First Occurred Serious and Significant Lens-related Corneal Infiltrative Event (CIE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of first serious and significant corneal infiltrative adverse events deemed to be related to contact lens wear (possible, probable or very likely) during a 6-month period (contact lens extended wear period) was assessed via Biomicroscopy. A biomicroscope was used to detect the presence of a corneal infiltrate for each subject eye (Yes: corneal infiltrates detected, No: None present). The number of subjects with corneal infiltrative events was reported for each lens type.</description>

    <measure>Overall Comfort Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD). CLUE was collected at the 1-day, 5-day, 12-day, 26-day, 88-day and 180-day follow-up evaluation.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study utilized an adaptation period of 14 days prior to dispensing the extended wear contact lenses. A total of 171 subjects were enrolled into the adaption period. Of those enrolled into this period 168 were dispensed a study lens and 3 did not meet the eligibility criteria. Of the 168 dispensed subjects 142 completed the adaptation period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 26 subjects were discontinued from the adaptation period. A total of 142 subjects were enrolled into the extended wear period. Of the enrolled subjects, all 142 were dispensed a study lens. Of the dispensed subjects in the extended wear period 58 completed the study and 84 subjects discontinued from the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Overall Comfort Score</title>
        <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD). CLUE was collected at the 1-day, 5-day, 12-day, 26-day, 88-day and 180-day follow-up evaluation.</description>

        <title>Overall Vision Score</title>
        <description>Overall quality of vision score was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD). CLUE was collected at the 1-day, 5-day, 12-day, 26-day, 88-day and 180-day follow-up evaluation.</description>
