      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that myopia progression can be slowed or
      prevented by low dose Echothiophate Iodide.

      This pilot study is designed to establish proof of concept of a method to either slow or stop
      the progression of myopia in children between the ages of 8 and 15 years by using
      Echothiophate Iodide eye drops to alter the relationship between focusing (accommodation),
      eye alignment, and peripheral blurring. Echothiophate Iodide 0.03% eye drops have been used
      for years for the treatment of accommodative esotropia in children. A prospective double
      blind randomized study of 33 children with active development of myopia will be divided into
      a treatment group of 22 and a control group of 11. They will be treated for 18 weeks with
      four planned visits at 6 week intervals. The progression of myopia will be measured by a
      determination of the length of the eye (axial length measured by the IOL Master) and
      cycloplegic refractions. Influencing factors such as corneal changes, lens changes and
      macular choroidal thickness will be monitored for any significance. If successful, a larger
      and longer study to slow the rate of myopia with echothiophate iodide will be done in order
      to decrease the world's incidence of myopia currently at 25-33% in western countries and 85%
      in Asian countries. This would also reduce the financial burden of glasses and contact lenses
      as well as decrease the incidence of pathological eye disease due to high myopia.
