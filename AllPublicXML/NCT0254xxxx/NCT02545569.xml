      This is a controlled, single blinded comparative study which is conducted monocentric at
      Phonak Headquarters in Staefa.

      The purpose of the studies is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of new custom product
      development in comparison to existing/old products. The results should promote the custom
      product development, to provide a maximum of benefit and wearing comfort to the hearing aid
      user.
