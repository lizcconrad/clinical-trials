    <textblock>
      After the age of 50, one in three women and one in eight men will experience at least one
      fragility fracture during the rest of their lives. It is currently recognized that physical
      activity has an osteogenic actions, especially when it includes the impact transmitted to the
      skeleton. In this context, the investigators propose a study to determine whether the regular
      practice of golf could be particularly beneficial for the skeleton, not only in the lower
      limbs, due to repeated impacts to the ground when it requires sustained walking, but also the
      upper limbs due to the impacts transmitted by the club at the time of striking the ball, as
      has been amply demonstrated with racquet sports.

      Each patient will have 1 blood samples and 1 measure of bone by 3D micro-tomography (3D CT
      Scan).These examinations and sampling will take place on 1 day.
