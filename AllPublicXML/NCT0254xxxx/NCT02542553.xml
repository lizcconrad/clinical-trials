    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess microbiologic concordance rates between right- and
      left-lung bronchoalveolar lavage cultures from patients with suspected ventilator-associated
      pneumonia, identify predictors of concordance, and evaluate the impact of discordant
      microbiology on clinicians' ability to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatments, the
      investigators conducted a prospective observational study in the general intensive care unit
      of a large university hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchoscopic sampling of lower respiratory tract secretions is widely used in intensive care
      units (ICUs) for the microbiological diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
      However, the importance of selecting a specific lung segment for sampling is still a matter
      of debate.

      Non-bronchoscopic blind mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is currently used for the diagnosis
      of VAP with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. In the presence of pneumonia,
      microbiologic concordance between the left and right lungs becomes crucial. If concordance is
      low, the reliability of blind sampling becomes questionable.

      When the bacterial distribution in the right and left lungs of VAP patients has been
      investigated using bronchoscopic sampling techniques, rates of microbiological concordance
      between the two specimens have varied widely (from 53% to 92%). The factors potentially
      associated with concordant culture yields have never been explored, and it is unclear whether
      the use of guided, bilateral lung sampling would actually improve the appropriateness of the
      antibiotic regimens prescribed for patients with suspected VAP.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the frequency of microbiologic concordance
      between the right- and left-lung samples in ICU patients undergoing bronchoscopic BAL
      performed with two different fiberoptic bronchoscopes for the suspicion of VAP. Secondary
      objectives are to identify factors associated with such concordance and to evaluate the
      suitability of treatments prescribed based on unilateral vs. bilateral BAL cultures.

    <description>Pneumonia is microbiologically confirmed when the quantitative culture of one or both BAL specimens is positive at significant growth for at least one potential bacterial pathogen. Right and left BAL cultures are classified as concordant when both are positive for the same organism(s) or when neither show any growth. Cultures are classified as discordant when at least one of the microorganisms isolated from one specimen is not recovered from the contralateral specimen.</description>

    <description>For each enrolled patient, actual treatment decisions are made by the ICU attending physicians in charge of the case on the basis of the results of bilateral BAL culture and sensitivity analyses. Later, at the end of the study, data for patients with discordant BAL cultures are reviewed in a simulated prescribing session by a second team composed of an ICU physician and an infectious disease specialist. The team is asked to propose an appropriate antimicrobial regimen based on the culture and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility data for the right-lung BAL sample alone, the left-lung BAL sample alone, and the right and left BAL samples. Each microbiological report is presented separately to the team with a summary of the patient's relevant clinical data. The prescribed regimen is defined as appropriate if it provides active coverage for all of the organisms identified in both BAL specimens.</description>

    <description>Bronchoscopies are performed in strict accordance with consensus guidelines. The left or right lung is examined with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. If localized infiltrates are present on the chest radiograph, the tip of the scope is wedged into a subsegment of the area displaying the most marked opacity. In the presence of diffuse opacity or when no clear roentgenographic abnormalities are observed, the tip is positioned in the lingula or right middle lobe. Five 20-ml aliquots of sterile normal saline are then injected and reaspirated with a syringe. Bronchoscopy is then repeated in the same manner in the contralateral lung with a second, sterile bronchoscope of the same brand and model.</description>
