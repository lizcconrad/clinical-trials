    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-drug, biomarker-directed, multi-centre, multi-arm, randomised
      Phase 1b study in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (urothelial) who have
      progressed on prior treatment. This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity of multiple agents as
      monotherapy and as combinations of different novel anti-cancer agents in patients with muscle
      invasive bladder cancer.

      The study will consist of a number of study modules (substudies), each evaluating the safety

      This is an open label, multi-drug, biomarker-directed, multi-centre, multi-arm, randomised
      Phase 1b study in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (urothelial) who have
      progressed on prior treatment. This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity of multiple agents as
      monotherapy and as combinations of different novel anti-cancer agents in patients with muscle
      invasive bladder cancer. The study will consist of a number of study modules (sub-studies),
      each evaluating the safety and tolerability of a specific agent or combination in patients
      whose tumours express specific mutations relevant to the molecules under investigation and
      whose disease has progressed following prior therapy. The allocation of patients to specific
      modules will depend on the specific eligible mutations identified in their tumours.

      Module A includes an AZD4547 monotherapy arm and a durvalumab + AZD4547 combination therapy
      arm. Patients who receive AZD4547 monotherapy will have the option to cross over to
      durvalumab as a monotherapy treatment at the point of objective progression. Module A will
      investigate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab given intravenously, in combination
      with AZD4547 given orally to selected patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer with
      tumours that have fibroblast growth factor receptor mutations or fibroblast growth factor
      receptor fusions and whose disease has progressed following prior therapy. Specifically the
      following fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 activating mutations are eligible, R248C,
      S249C, G370C, Y373C, S371C, G3780R, as are fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, 2, 3 gene
      fusions resulting in removal of the c-terminal of the fibroblast growth factor receptor while
      encoding an intact tyrosine kinase domain, an example being the fibroblast growth factor
      receptor 3-transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 fusions identified in bladder cancer and
      glioblastoma. Module A will evaluate the durvalumab + AZD4547 combination dose(s) for further
      clinical evaluation and assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AZD4547 given orally
      to selected patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer who have progressed following prior
      therapy. In the combination arm, a maximum tolerated dose will be defined by dose-limiting
      toxicity. An expansion cohort(s) in Module A will enroll additional patients to explore
      further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological activity at the selected
      AZD4547 plus durvalumab dose(s). Patients who receive AZD4547 as monotherapy will have the
      option to cross over to durvalumab as monotherapy at the point of objective progression as
      long as the investigator believes it is in the patient's interest to continue MEDI4736
      monotherapy.

      Module B will evaluate durvalumab + olaparib combination dose(s) to confirm the safety and
      tolerability of durvalumab given intravenously in combination with olaparib (AZD2281).
      Olaparib will be given orally to selected patients with muscle invasion bladder cancer (MIBC)
      whose tumors have deleterious mutations, deletions or truncations in any one of a panel of
      homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, and whose disease had progressed following prior
      therapy.

      Module C will evaluate durvalumab + AZD1775 combination doses(s) to confirm the safety and
      tolerability of durvalumab given intravenously, in combination with AZD1775 given orally to
      selected patients with MIBC whose tumours have mutations in genes involved in cell cycle
      regulation (eg, loss of either retinoblastoma 1 or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A or
      amplification of cyclin E1 or MYC family genes).

      Module D will evaluate durvalumab monotherapy treatment to confirm the safety and
      tolerability of durvalumab given intravenously as monotherapy to patients with MIBC who do
      not qualify for Modules A, B or C. This sub-study will not be restricted to any PD-L1 defined
      sub-population and it is intended to perform retrospective analysis of PD-L1 so that patients
      with positive PD-L1 status are included in this monotherapy module.

      Module E will evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab given intravenously, in
      combination with vistusertib (AZD2014) given orally to patients with MIBC whose disease has
      progressed following prior therapy. Patients who enter this sub study will be those whose
      tumours do not show mutations that would be eligible for other study modules, with the
      exception of the following mutations that have potential to respond to an mTOR inhibitor:
      RICTOR amplification, or TSC1/2 mutations.

      Module F will investigate the safety and tolerability of intravenous durvalumab in
      combination with intravenous AZD9150 in patients with MIBC whose tumours do not show genomic
      alterations that would be eligible for other modules.

expression of PD-L1,
CD8 and the number and phenotype of immune cells such as T-cells.
Markers relevant to the targeted therapy, for example FGFR and ligand expression and PD markers, for example pErk, pS6 and γH2AX will also be measured in tumour paired biopsy samples.
Biomarker assessments that may have the potential to identify patients likely to respond to treatment with the agents studied in this modular protocol will be investigated to determine a patient's biomarker status and for possible correlation with efficacy endpoints.</description>
