  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center, double blinded, randomized controlled trial aimed to
      investigate the effects of focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (fESWT) on Delayed Onset
      Muscle Soreness (DOMS) of the non-dominant biceps brachialis muscle in healthy voluntary
      adults.

    <textblock>
      Forty-five participants agreed to participate and signed a written informed consent. After
      enrollment, muscle soreness was induced and participants were subsequently randomized to
      receive either (1) focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Verum), (2) sham shock wave
      (Sham) or (3) no treatment (Control). Thereafter, treatments were administered once, only.
      Measures were repeated after the treatment and at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Main outcome parameter
      was the pain intensity at rest and in movement as assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) in
      the elbow region of the non-dominant arm. Secondary outcome included the pressure pain
      threshold (PPT) over the biceps muscle belly, the maximum isometric voluntary force (MIVF) of
      the elbow flexors and the assessing the impairment of activities of the daily living.
      Participants were followed-up 72 hours after the induction of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity at the elbow region during active movement of the biceps muscle is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 cm (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 experiencing the worst imaginable pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PPT is assessed using a mechanical pressure algometer (pdt, Rome, Italy) with increasing force at a rate of approximately 1 kg/cm2/s until the participant reported a painful sensation; and the force value is recorded (kg/cm2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum isometric voluntary force MIVF</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>MIVF is easured using a strain-gauge force transducer (ASYSÂ® SPOREG, Offenbach, Germany). Peak strength values (N) are recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities of daily living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This test comprises the asssessment of the impairment of six complex movements (each on a VAS 0-10 cm) and the mean VAS of all items is kept to describe the impairment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Verum focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy is applied at 7 equidistant points, perpendicular to the belly of the biceps brachii muscle on a thought line between the radial tuberosity and the coracoid process (Dermagold120, Tissue Regeneration Technologies, Woodstock, Georgia, U.S.). Shock waves are generated by electrohydraulic mechanisms.</description>

    <description>Sham shock wave is performed using the same device as stated above, but using a special applicator that has been isolated with layers of metal and water by the manufacturer, extinguishing the transmitted energy. The study personal is blinded to the applicators. All handling, adjustments and noises are thus same in this group.</description>
