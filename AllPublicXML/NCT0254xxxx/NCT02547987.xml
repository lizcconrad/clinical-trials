      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of docetaxel and
      carboplatin is an effective treatment for patients with triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine whether neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin will increase the pCR rate in TNBC
      compared to historical controls. Pathologic complete response (pCR) will be defined as no
      residual invasive breast cancer in the breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph node (ypT0-is
      ypN0).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  All patients must be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.

          -  Breast cancer must be ER-negative, and HER-2 negative according to CAP/ASCO biomarkers
             testing guidelines. Tumors may be PgR positive with an Allred score of less than 5.

          -  Primary breast tumor size at least 2 cm in one dimension by clinical or radiographic
             exam. Patients who have multicentric breast cancer are eligible if each lesion is
             ER-negative and HER2-negative. In that case, one lesion needs to be identified as the
             index lesion to be followed for clinical response. The index lesion must also be the
             lesion from which core biopsies are obtained.

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,200/mcl

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcl

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ institutional 1.5 times ULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 1.5 times ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN

          -  Women of childbearing potential (defined as women under the age of 55 with intact
             ovaries and uterus) must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. They must also have a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 7 days of starting treatment.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document and follow study procedures including willingness to undergo study biopsies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior systemic therapy for breast cancer within 5 years.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Patients with known bilateral invasive breast cancer. Patients with contralateral in
             situ breast carcinoma are eligible.

          -  Inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  Patients with confirmed stage IV disease.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to docetaxel or carboplatin.

          -  Known to be seropositive for HIV, HCV, or HBV.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  If the patient is otherwise not deemed a good study candidate by sole discretion of
             the principal investigator.

          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.
