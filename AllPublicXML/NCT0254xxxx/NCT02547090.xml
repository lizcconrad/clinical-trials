    <textblock>
      Background:

      Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) carries a high risk of
      complications and mortality. Complication rates have been reported as high as 45%, and
      infection rates typically reported at 15%. Efforts to improve efficiency by reducing
      operative time and blood loss could decrease these risks. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the impact of utilizing two attending surgeons on blood loss, operative time, and
      complications in this population.

      Methods:

      This is a prospective, matched cohort analysis with a consecutive series of patients with CP
      who underwent PSF, with two attending surgeons, in 2012. These are matched with a control
      group that had a single-surgeon team (operative dates 2008-2010), assisted by a resident, PA,
      or RN-FA. The groups are compared using paired Student T-tests and chi square tests
      (significance set a p&lt;0.05).

        The study group consisted of 25 consecutive patients with CP and progressive neuromuscular
        scoliosis who underwent PSF in 2012 with the use of a two surgeon team. The control group
        consisted of a consecutive series of patients with CP who underwent PSF by a single surgeon
        from 2008-2010 at the same institution. The control group was a cohort of patients matched
        for age, gender, weight and Cobb angle.
