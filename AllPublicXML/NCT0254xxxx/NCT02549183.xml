      Clinical study to estimate the optimal frequency for stimulation of the spinal cord to
      achieve relief from back pain.

      This is a feasibility study to identify the optimal frequency for stimulation of the spinal
      cord to achieve maximum reduction in neuropathic back pain as measured by average Numerical
      rating Scale.

      Twenty patients who suffer from back more than leg pain will be recruited into the study once
      they have satisfactory pain relief from both low and high frequency stimulations. Each
      patient will then receive stimulation at four different frequencies for 2-3 weeks in a random
      and blinded order. Their pain scores and function will be assessed using a variety of
      different tools. The data will then be used to estimate the optimal frequency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Complaint of persistent or recurrent low back pain, with or without equal or lesser
             leg pain, for at least 90 days prior to Screen.

          2. Received at least 90 days of documented pain management care to address the primary
             pain complaint, prior to Screening (e.g. medication, physical therapy.)

          3. No back surgery within 6 months prior to Screening.

          4. Average low back pain intensity, during the position/activity, which routinely causes
             worst pain, of 5 or greater on a 0-10 numerical rating scale during Baseline period
             based on eDiary.

          5. If taking prescription opioids for primary chronic pain complaint (low back and/or leg
             pain), must have been on a stable prescription (same drug(s) and dose(s)) 30 days
             prior to Screening to a total of less than 180 mg Oral Morphine equivalent

          6. Willing and able to comply with all protocol-required procedures and
             assessments/evaluations (e.g. willing to comply with opioid prescription lock from the
             Baseline visit through End of Rate Randomization and protocol required stimulation
             parameter locks, complete daily eDiary).

          7. 18 years of age or older when written informed consent is obtained.

             pregnancy test at Screening.

          9. Subject signed a valid, IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF) provided in English.

         10. Baseline Oswestry Disability Index score ≥ 20 and ≤ 80.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Average worst leg pain intensity is greater than average worst low back pain intensity
             as reported during Baseline period based on eDiary.

          2. Radiographic evidence of spinal instability requiring fusion.

          3. Primary pain complaint of vascular origin (e.g. peripheral vascular disease).

          4. Spinal pain secondary to neoplasm, infection, autoimmune disorder with spinal
             involvement, or a spinal metabolic disorder.

          5. Any pain-related diagnosis or medical/psychological condition that, in the clinician's

             pain, chronic migraine.

          9. Currently on any anticoagulant medications that cannot be discontinued during
