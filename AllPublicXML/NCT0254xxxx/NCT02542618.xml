  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Major depression is a common mental disorder with serious consequences. The
      societal costs of depression are high. Despite the existence of empirically-supported
      psychological therapies, many patients do not benefit from these treatments and relapse and
      recurrence percentages are high. Improvement of existing treatments or development of new and
      better treatments is badly needed. Inquiry Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) is a promising
      verbal therapy focusing on the inquiry of thoughts and could be a next step in improving
      psychotherapy for depression.

      Objective: The objective of the current study is to assess the effectiveness of IBSR.
      Research to date has shown that IBSR is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. The investigators want to know if IBSR is more effective in reducing symptoms of
      depression than the best psychotherapeutic treatment for depression at this moment, cognitive
      behavioural therapy (CBT). The investigators' secondary objective is to know more about the
      underlying mechanisms of change of these therapies.

      Study design: A randomized controlled intervention study.

      Study population: 88 patients with a mild to moderate depression as their principal
      diagnosis.

      Intervention: IBSR or CBT
