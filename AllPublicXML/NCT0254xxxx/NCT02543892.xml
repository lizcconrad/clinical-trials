      This study will determine if PATH-wSP, a vaccine against a germ that causes pneumonia, is
      safe and induces immune responses in adults and toddlers. The study vaccine will be compared
      to placebo. First adults will receive a 2 injections of a lower dose of the vaccine or
      placebo, 28 days apart. If the lower dose is safe, then a higher dose will be tested. Once
      the safety is established in adults the lower and higher dose will be tested in toddlers,
      starting with the lower dose.
