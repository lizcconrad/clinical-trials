  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that eosinophilic airway inflammation is more likely respond to steroid
      treatment. However, in real-world practice, it is difficult to routinely assess airway
      inflammation using sputum induction because of technical and facility requirement. COPD
      (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a heterogeneous disease and it remains a great
      challenge to identify patients who have eosinophilic airway inflammation and respond to
      steroid treatment well. A recent study demonstrated elevated plasma D-dimer was associated
      with acute inflammation and a significant predictor of pulmonary embolism in COPD exacerbated
      patients. D-dimer may potentially act as a marker of inflammation and a predictor of
      cardiovascular event in COPD patients. The investigators preliminary study demonstrated that
      exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) &gt; 23.5 ppb is a good surrogate marker to predict eosinophilic
      airway inflammation in COPD patients who were newly diagnosed or untreated for at least 3
      months. There were significant correlations among sputum eosinophils, eNO and serum total
      immunoglobulin E (IgE). Particularly, eNO predicted sputum eosinophilia (&gt; 3%) in COPD at a
      sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 71% respectively. Herein, the investigators test the
      hypothesis that eNO may act as a biomarker to determine treatment option for COPD.

      Eligible COPD patients (newly diagnosed or untreated for at least 3 months) will be enrolled
      at out-patient clinic after consenting by participants. Upon enrollment, exhaled NO (eNO)
      will be measured and patients will be categorized into 2 groups according to eNO levels:
      either high exhaled NO (greater than or equal to 23.5 ppb) or low eNO (&lt; 23.5 ppb) group. In
      each group, patients will be randomized to receive either 2 inhalations of
      fluticasone/salmeterol 250/25 mcg/ pudd twice daily or 2 inhalations of tiotropium 2.5
      mcg/inhalation for 12 weeks and followed at scheduled visits. Testing outcome measures
      include eNO, lung function, different count and mediators in induced sputum, and which will
      be tested as the following timings: before (baseline, week 0), and after treatment (week 4
      and week 12). Rescue medication and drug compliance will be record.
