  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is one of the most critical and accelerating health challenges throughout
      the world. It is a major risk factor for developing varus/valgus misalignments of the knee
      joint. The combination of misalignment at the knee and excess body mass may result in
      increased joint stress and damage to articular cartilage. A training programme, which aims at
      developing a more neutral alignment of the trunk and lower limbs during movement tasks may be
      able to reduce knee loading during locomotion. Despite the large number of guidelines for
      muscle strength training and neuromuscular exercises that exists, most are not specifically
      designed to target the obese children and adolescent demographic.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a training programme which combines strength and
      neuromuscular exercises specifically designed to the needs and limitations of obese children
      and adolescents and analyse the effects of the training programme from a biomechanical and
      clinical point of view.
