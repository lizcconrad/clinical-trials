      The cluster-randomized study was conducted in 9th grade classrooms in Chicago Public Schools
      (CPS) with equal number of schools randomized to intervention and comparison groups for two
      cohort years. Students were administered a scannable paper survey at three time points:
      baseline, post-program and 1-year post program. The primary impact analysis used an
      intent-to-treat approach. Implementation of TOP® was assessed by conducting classroom
      observations. TOP® was delivered in a variety of classroom settings over the school year by
      facilitators from CPS and partner organizations.
