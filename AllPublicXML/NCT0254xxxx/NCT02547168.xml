  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung resections for pulmonary malignancies offer the best chance of survival for patients,
      but these procedures carry a significant burden of post-operative morbidity and mortality.
      Patients are particularly at high risk for post-operative atrial fibrillation (a condition
      involving irregular heart rhythm). Atrial fibrillation with symptoms can increase the risk of
      stroke - a blockage in a major blood vessel in the brain, which can potentially result in a
      disability or even death. The objective of this study is to establish the feasibility of
      using ambulatory heart rate monitoring to determine the total incidence of atrial
      fibrillation in the peri-operative period before and after anatomic lung resection for
      malignancies. The study will also investigate the correlation between atrial fibrillation and
      rates of stroke and other adverse events, as well as serve to identify the patients that are
      at a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.

      Novel literature suggests that atrial fibrillation that is asymptomatic may just be as
      problematic as atrial fibrillation that presents itself with symptoms. The objective of the
      study is to establish the feasibility of tracking the total incidence of atrial fibrillation
      in the peri-operative period, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic events, using an
      ambulatory heart monitor. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the overall incidence of
      peri- and post-operative atrial fibrillation. These will be accomplished through usage of
      iRhythm ZIO XT, a small pebble shaped device that will be adhered to the patient's chest for
      14 days before and after surgery, to measure how often atrial fibrillation occurs.
