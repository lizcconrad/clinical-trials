  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral chemotherapeutic agents (OCAs) are increasingly being used as an alternative to
      traditional intravenous chemotherapy, and factors promoting this trend include increased
      survival times requiring long-term therapy, acceptability among patients, convenience, and
      cost savings due to reduced hospital time. Although OCAs are commonly preferred by patients,
      adherence to these medications vary. Suboptimal medication adherence leads to loss of
      treatment efficacy, increased toxicity, and increased health care costs. Thus, it is critical
      to develop and test interventions that effectively improve adherence to OCAs. Although the
      medication adherence literature has been criticized for methodological issues, some
      components of interventions have had promising results on adherence such as electronic
      monitored adherence feedback, cognitive-education, nurse-based interventions, and
      technology-based or telehealth strategies. The investigators propose to unify components of
      these effective approaches in a novel way to assess the efficacy and feasibility of two
      telehealth-based strategies (electronic medication-event monitoring with feedback and
      tailored nurse coaching which includes cognitive-education) in an effort increase OCA
      adherence among cancer patients who are at high-risk for non-adherence in rural eastern North
      Carolina.

      Objective: To test the effectiveness of two telehealth adherence motivation strategies among
      cancer patients on oral chemotherapeutic agents who are at high-risk of non-adherence.

      The investigators are proposing a randomized multi-arm intervention study of 150 subjects
      with two intervention arms and a control arm (50 subjects per arm). The
      Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model of Adherence and the results of specific aim 1
      will guide this aim. Intervention Arm 1 will receive a Medication Event Monitoring System
      (MEMS) with feedback. Intervention Arm 2 will receive the MEMS plus a tailored nurse coaching
      component. Controls will receive standard-of-care from the Cancer Center. Specifically, the
      investigators want to test whether a tailored nurse coaching intervention component will
      significantly improve medication adherence at higher rates as compared to the MEMS alone. The
      MEMS is a medication bottle with a cap that is equipped with a microchip that registers the
      date and time of each cap opening (dosing history). Currently, there is no gold standard for
      measure of medication adherence but the MEMS device has been demonstrated to be a valid and
      objective method to assess medication adherence. The nurse coach intervention component will
      involve an individualized barriers/facilitators screening tool and regular contact with
      cancer patients via telephone calls across a six-month period. The investigators hypothesize
      that although both telehealth strategies will be effective at increasing medication
      adherence, Arm 2 will have a significantly greater effect on adherence. This hypothesis is
      supported by existing medication adherence literature that suggests a tailored intervention
      using multiple adherence strategies can potentially have a significant impact on increasing
      medication adherence.

    <description>Before beginning their OCA regimen, participants in Arm 2 will be administered a barriers/facilitators screening tool that will help the nurse coach identify specific adherence strategies (i.e. cognitive education, knowledge skills, and affective support) tailored to the participant's needs. Once a tailored intervention plan is developed, participants will receive a 60-minute session conducted by the nurse coach. Participants will receive weekly phone calls from the nurse coach during the first month of the intervention, and then bi-monthly follow-up calls for the remainder of treatment or 6-month follow-up period (whichever occurs first).</description>

Participants will receive weekly phone calls from the nurse coach during the first month of the intervention, and then bi-monthly follow-up calls for the remainder of treatment or 6-month follow-up period (whichever occurs first). MEMS feedback will be used to show Participants their own medication-taking behavior via the MEMS Report, to correct any misperceptions of actual adherence and to identify problem areas. The nurse coach will modify the intervention plan to address identified barriers to adherence at this time.</description>
