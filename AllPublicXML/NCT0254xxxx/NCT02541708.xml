  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous iron preparations have been shown to be superior to oral iron and have largely
      replaced the treatment of anaemia in Northern countries. However, the socio-economic and
      medical conditions in low resource countries greatly differ from those in northern countries.
      Patients' different access to medication supply, perception of medication need and compliance
      as well as the burden of concomitant disease like malaria, soil-transmitted helminths,
      schistosomiasis, HIV and red blood cells (RBC) genetic disorders may influence effectiveness
      and safety of iron substitution modality. The aim of the present study is to compare iv iron
      substitution by ferric carboxymaltose (FerinjectÂ®) to per oral iron substitution in a low
      resource country

      The objectives of the study are as follows:

      Primary objective:

      To assess the superiority in terms of effectiveness of iv iron substitution with ferric
      carboxymaltose versus per oral iron substitution in women with iron deficient anemia at
      delivery in Tanzania.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate safety and feasibility of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution
           compared to per oral iron substitution in a resource limited country

        -  To evaluate acceptance of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution compared to per
           oral iron substitution in a resource limited country

        -  To evaluate wellbeing of women receiving intravenous ferric carboxymaltose compared to
           women receiving per oral iron substitution

        -  To evaluate the sensitivity of diagnosis of iron deficiency by measuring hemoglobin,
           mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) only,
           compared to the diagnosis by measuring iron metabolism parameters in a resource limited
           country
