  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, prospective, multicenter study with two study parts (epochs) to evaluate
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of HYQVIA/HyQvia (IGI, 10% with recombinant human
      hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) administered subcutaneously) for maintenance therapy to prevent
      relapse (Epoch 1) and GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG (immunoglobulin G intravenous (IGIV) 10%
      administered intravenously) for the treatment of CIDP (Epoch 2). This study will enroll adult
      subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CIDP and who have remained on a stable dosing regimen
      (monthly equivalent dose of 0.4 to 2.4 g/kg body weight (BW) with a dosing interval of 2 to 6
      weeks) of IGIV therapy for at least 12 weeks prior to screening. In this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled phase of the study (Epoch 1), eligible subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either HYQVIA/HyQvia or 0.25% albumin placebo solution with rHuPH20
      every two, three, or four weeks in a double-blind fashion for a period of 6 months or until
      relapse. Subjects who relapse during Epoch 1 will enter Epoch 2 to receive IGIV treatment for
      a period of 6 months.
