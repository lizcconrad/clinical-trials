    <textblock>
      Study 110 is a Phase 3, multicenter study in subjects aged 6 years and older with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del-CF transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) mutation and who participated in Study 109 (NCT02514473) or Study 011B (NCT01897233).
      Study 110 is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long term treatment of
      lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects entering the Treatment Cohort must meet both of the following criteria:

          -  Completed study visits up to Week 24 of Study 109 or Week 26 of Study 011B and did not
             permanently discontinue treatment

          -  Willing to remain on a stable CF medication through the Safety Follow-up Visit.

        Subjects entering the Observational Cohort must meet 1 of the following criteria:

          -  Completed 24 weeks of study drug treatment in Study 109 or completed 24 weeks of study
             drug treatment and the Week 26 Safety Follow up in Study 011B.

          -  Received at least 4 weeks of study drug and completed visits up to Week 24 of Study
             109 or Week 26 of Study 011B.

        Exclusion Criteria (Treatment Cohort Only):

          -  History of any comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in
             administering study drug to the subject (e.g., cirrhosis with portal hypertension).

          -  Pregnant and nursing females.

          -  Sexually active subjects of reproductive potential who are not willing to follow the
             contraception requirements.

          -  History of drug intolerance in the prior study that would pose an additional risk to
             the subject in the opinion of investigator

          -  History of poor compliance with study drug and/or procedure in the previous study as
             deemed by the investigator.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug trial (including studies investigating
             lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor).
