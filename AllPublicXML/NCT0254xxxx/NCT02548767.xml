  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not known whether consumption of excessive amounts of sugar can increase risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease or diabetes in the absence of increased food (caloric) intake and
      weight gain, nor whether the negative effects of sugar consumption are made worse when
      accompanied by weight gain. This study will investigate the effects of excess sugar when
      consumed with an energy-balanced diet that prevents weight gain, and the effects of excess
      sugar when consumed with a diet that can cause weight gain. The results will determine
      whether excess sugar consumption and excess caloric intake that lead to weight gain have
      independent and additive effects on risk factors for cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and
      will have the potential to influence dietary guidelines and public health policy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that consuming high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)- or
      sucrose-sweetened beverages increased lipid/lipoprotein risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) in healthy adults compared with iso-caloric amounts of glucose or low-fat milk.
      The longest of these studies, which utilized a 6-month intervention, also showed increased
      liver and muscle TG and increased visceral adipose deposition. Neither of these studies found
      differences in weight gain between subjects consuming HFCS/sucrose beverages compared with
      control beverages. These results suggest that it is not just excess calories and weight gain
      that mediate the effects of dietary sugar/fructose on the development of metabolic disease;
      rather, dietary sugar per se is also a contributor. However, it is not known whether
      consumption of excessive amounts of sugar can increase risk factors for metabolic disease in
      the absence of positive energy balance and weight gain, nor whether the adverse effects of
      sugar consumption are exacerbated by weight gain. This study will compare the contribution of
      sugar with the contribution of energy level to the increases in risk factors for metabolic
      disease induced by consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages under energy-balanced or ad
      libitum conditions. The investigators will measure risk factors and processes associated with
      metabolic disease in 4 groups of young, healthy adults who will consume 1) 0%, 2) or 25% of
      energy requirement as HFCS-sweetened beverages with an energy-balanced diet; 3) 0%, or 4) 25%
      of energy requirement as HFCS-sweetened beverages with an ad libitum diet for 8 weeks. All
      diets, formulated to achieve a comparable macronutrient intake (55% energy as carbohydrate,
      35% fat, 15% protein) among all 4 experimental groups, will be provided to the subjects
      throughout the entire study. The investigators hypothesize that under energy balanced (EB)
      condition that prevent body weight gain, consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages will result
      in adverse metabolic effects compared with aspartame-sweetened beverages. Consumption of
      HFCS-sweetened beverages with the ad libitum (AL) diet will result in increased energy intake
      and body weight gain compared with aspartame-sweetened beverages, and will also result in
      adverse metabolic effects that are more marked than with consumption of HFCS-sweetened
      beverages with the energy-balanced diet. These results will demonstrate that consumption of
      HFCS-sweetened beverages increases risk for metabolic disease both directly, via the adverse
      effects of fructose on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and indirectly, via the effects of
      HFCS-sweetened beverages to promote excess energy intake and body weight gain. These findings
      will have the potential to influence dietary guidelines and public health policy.
