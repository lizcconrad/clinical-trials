    <textblock>
      Breast cancer are common on mediterranean basin. Epidemiological data suggest that breast
      cancer in young women (&lt; 40years old) is more aggressive in the Maghreb countries
      comparatively to western countries. This aggressiveness could be associated with phenotypic
      and genotypic differences between this two populations.

      The object of this study is to compare the genotypic and phenotypic differences between south
      and north shore of the mediterranean sea.
