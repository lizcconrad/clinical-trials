  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing therapist-guided Internet-based
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), self-guided ICBT, and individual face-to-face (f2f) CBT
      for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in adults.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether ICBT is a non-inferior treatment option compared
      to the best possible available treatment for OCD, individual face to face (f2f) CBT. A second
      objective is to compare the efficacy of self-guided vs. therapist-guided ICBT. As this
      question has cost implications for the health system, a third objective is to carry out a
      health economic evaluation of both forms of ICBT, in relation to the gold standard f2f CBT. A
      fourth objective is to explore whether ICBT is equally suited for clinic-referred cases
      compared to self-referred patients. Finally, a fifth objective is to investigate whether
      genetic markers, in combination with clinical variables, can be employed to predict treatment
      outcomes with CBT in general.

      Research Questions:

      Q1: Is therapist-guided internet-based CBT (ICBT) for OCD non-inferior to face-to-face (f2f)
      CBT with regard to OCD symptoms, function and quality of life?

      Q2: Is entirely self-guided ICBT non-inferior to f2f CBT with regard to OCD symptoms,
      function and quality of life?

      Q3: Is ICBT a cost-effective treatment, compared to f2f CBT?

      Q4: Is there a difference in treatment outcome between self-referred and clinical referred
      patients?

      Q5: Can clinical variables and genetic markers be useful to predict which patients will
      benefit from CBT?
