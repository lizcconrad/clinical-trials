  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with esophageal cancer that had metastatic lesions after been treated with surgery
      or definitive chemoradiotherapy are being asked to participate in this study.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factors receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, similar to vatalanib (PTK787), but with a binding affinity 10 times that of
      vatalanib or sorafenib.

      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects apatinib has on metastatic esophageal
      cancer. These effects include whether apatinib could shrink the tumor or slow down its growth
      and what side effects apatinib will have on the tumor.

      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects apatinib has on metastatic esophageal
      cancer patients after been treated with surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy. These
      effects include whether apatinib could shrink the tumor or slow down its growth and what side
      effects apatinib will have on the tumor.

      Eligible are patients with metastatic esophageal cancer who have achieved stable disease or
      have disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy) and
      have at least one separate measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic
      disease is recorded either at CT or MRI scanning. Apatinib (850mg) is given daily during the
      therapy for 28 days. Tumor response is evaluated by assessing clinical and CT/MRI response in
      the metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon
      design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if
      there are no tumor responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more
      responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed esophageal cancer which is persistent and
             metastatic or recurrent and metastatic;

          2. Patients must have distinct measurable metastatic sites at least 1 cm of larger in
             their largest diameter;

          3. Age ≥18 years;

          4. Metastatic disease measurable on a CT/MRI scan. The primary tumor is not considered
             measurable disease. Metastatic lesions within a prior radiation field are acceptable
             as long as disease has progressed in the radiation field by RECIST criteria. The same
             imaging modality performed at baseline (CT or MRI) will be repeated at subsequent
             imaging.

          5. ECOG performance status: 0-1;

          6. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

          7. Patients have adequate baseline organ and marrow function as defined by an absolute
             neutrophil count greater than 1500 cells per μL, platelet concentration of greater
             than 50 000 per μL, total bilirubin less than 1•5 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase less than 2•5 times the
             ULN, and serum creatinine less than 1•5 times the ULN;

          8. Signed consent forms voluntarily;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had prior allergic reaction to Apatinib;

          2. Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents.

          3. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

          4. Patients with known brain metastases can be included in this clinical trial but brain
             lesions are not eligible as target or non target lesion;

          5. Anticipated patient survival under 3 months;

          6. Active severe infection or known chronic infection with HIV, hepatitis B virus, or
             hepatitis C virus;

          7. Cardiovascular disease problems including unstable angina, therapy for
             life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive
             heart failure within the last 6 months;

          8. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for
             cervical cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of
             the skin;

          9. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

         10. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
