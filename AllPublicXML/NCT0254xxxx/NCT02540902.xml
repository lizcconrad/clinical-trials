  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective single cohort investigation of the Columbus all polyethylene tibia
      (Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. The aim of
      the project is to determine post-operative outcome of the all polyethylene tibia up to two
      years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty consecutive TKA patients under the care of two orthopaedic consultants at the Golden
      Jubilee National Hospital who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited to the
      study and will be given the all polyethylene tibia. Participants will return for their
      standard postoperative followup appointments (6 weeks and 1 year post-operatively). In
      addition to standard care, a bone density scan using dual energy x-ray absorptiometery (DXA)
      will be done as part of the 6 weeks post-operative follow-up. A second DXA scan will be done
      at an additional appointment at the hospital between 18 and 24 months post-operatively for a
      bone density scan which is not part of standard care.

      The data which will be analysed will be the results of the bone scan, computer generated data
      about the range of movement (RoM) and alignment of the operated knee collected as part of the
      operation, the RoM, clinical outcome and satisfaction data collected at the pre-operative
      assessment and post-operative followups, pre- and post-operative x-rays, complications,
      survivorship and surgeon experience of using the all polyethylene tibia. These data will be
      investigated to see if the all polyethylene tibia has satisfactory outcomes with no adverse
      effects.
