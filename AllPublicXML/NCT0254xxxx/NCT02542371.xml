  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure arterial 99mTc-Tilmanocept uptake using single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scanning in HIV infected subjects known to have
      subclinical coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by contrast-enhanced coronary computed
      tomography angiography (CCTA).

      Detailed Description:

      Patients with HIV have been shown to have increased atherosclerotic risk compared to
      age-matched controls, and this risk is thought to be related to increased systemic immune
      activation. Specifically, systemic immune activation may contribute to destabilizing coronary
      atherosclerotic plaque, leading to plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. This study is
      intended to measure arterial uptake of the macrophage specific marker 99mTc-Tilmanocept using
      single photon emission computed tomography, applied initially to a group of HIV-infected
      patients with known subclinical coronary atherosclerosis on CCTA. Moreover, traditional
      markers of CVD risk and inflammatory markers will be assessed in relation to CV imaging
      outcomes. Positive findings in the index HIV group with known subclinical atherosclerosis
      will prompt subsequent study of three comparison groups, as above.
