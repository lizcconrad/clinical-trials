  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary reports showed that hormonal treatment may improve the chance of retrieving
      viable testicular sperm from men with NOA. It was generally believed that gonadotrophin
      treatment would be ineffective in the presence of high plasma levels of endogenous
      gonadotrophin.The purpose of this study is to determine whether GnRHa(gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone agonist) combined with hCG(human chorionic gonadotropin) and hMG(human menopausal
      gonadotropin) are effective in the treatment of non-obstructive azoospermia.

    <description>Semen analysis was performed every month from the end of the 6th month (two months after the last injection of hMG) to the end of 9th month until any sperm was found in the semen. If not sperm was found at the end of the 9th month, testicular sperm aspiration(TESA) was performed and the tissue was used for histological assessment. If any sperm was found in the semen analysis or TESA, the treatment was effective. The sperm retrieval rate was calculated.</description>

    <description>3.6mg GnRHa (Goserelin, AstraZeneca UK Limited) every 28days for 5 months. After 2 months from the first Goserelin injection, all subjects were treated with hCG (Pregnyl, N.V.

After 3 months from the first Goserelin injection, all subjects were treated with hMG (Urofollitropin for Injection, Livzon Pharm Group Inc., China) at a dose of 150 IU every 3 days for 2 months.</description>
