  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether participants with persistent developmental
      disfluency who report fluctuational disfluency due to vocal cord tension on a day to day
      basis of can achieve a more normalized fluency by identifying dietary allergen responses and
      subsequently eliminating these dietary triggers from their daily consumption.

    <description>Initial fluency samples are taken prior to treatment protocol of study.
Food sensitivity panel will be assessed for potential allergans. Allergan responses are graded from 0 being no response to food allergen to 3 being the strongest response and subsequent removal of sensitive allergan from diet. Speech sample and disfluency severity will be evaluated qualitatively again via the SSI-3 on repeat office visit at fixed interval scale. Erickson S-24 repeated at end of study and final conclusions made.</description>
