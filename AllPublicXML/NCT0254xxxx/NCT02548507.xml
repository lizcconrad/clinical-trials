      Background :

      Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are defined as painful involuntary contractions of the lower limbs
      occurring during prolonged periods of rest, typically during the night. They may cause severe
      pain and sleep disturbance, and are particularly common among older adults, though they can
      occur in all decades of life. They are frequently unreported to physicians. To the
      investigators' knowledge, no epidemiological studies have been conducted in Switzerland, but
      in a general population survey carried out in the UK (n=233), the overall prevalence of NLC
      was 37% and the disorder was more prevalent in older subjects (&gt;80 years old: 54%). Of those
      who experienced NLC, 40% had cramps three or more times per week and 6% nightly. Another
      study performed in older US veterans (n=515) showed that 56% suffered from NLC.

      The precise cause of these cramps is unclear. Most NLC occurring in adults appear to be
      idiopathic, but potential contributing factors include low levels of certain minerals,
      extracellular fluid volume depletion and prolonged sitting or inappropriate leg position
      during sedentary activity.

      Research question :

      What are the prevalence and the main features of NLC in patients consulting primary care
      physicians (PCPs) in Geneva, and how do PCPs treat this affection?

      Primary objective :

      To compute the prevalence of NLC in patients consulting PCPs in Geneva, explore its main
      features (number, duration, severity and sleep disturbance) and assess how PCPs treat this
      affection.

      Study design :

      Prospective observational study using questionnaire and daily log completed by patients.

    <time_frame>Presence or absence of NLC will be checked during the time of recruitment for each participant PCP, with expected average of 1 to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>In order to compute the prevalence of NLC, the PCPs will be asked to specify for each patient coming for a planned consultation whether he/she has NLC, meets the inclusion criteria and accept to participate (group 1), has NLC, meets the inclusion criteria but refuses to participate (group 2) or has NLC but does not meet the inclusion criteria (group 3). For patients in the group 1 doctors will record the current date, the name and the first name, the gender, the date of birth and the phone number; for patients in the group 2 they will record the current date, the gender and the date of birth; and finally for patients in the group 3 they will record the current date, the gender, the date of birth and the exclusion criterion.</description>

    <description>We will ask the voluntaries to specify the average pain and sleep disturbance related with NLC on analog numerical scale of 1 to 10. We'll then ask them what improvement they would expect from a treatment on the same analog numeric scale for pain and sleep disturbance.</description>
