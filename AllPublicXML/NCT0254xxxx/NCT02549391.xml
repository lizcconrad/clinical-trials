    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KHK7580 orally
      administered once daily for 30 weeks in subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT)
      receiving hemodialysis in a randomized, double-blind, intra-subject dose-adjustment,
      parallel-group design with cinacalcet hydrochloride as an active control.
