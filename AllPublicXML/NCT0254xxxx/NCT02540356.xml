  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAX69 monotherapy
      given either as intraperitoneal (IP) infusion (Single-Route Arm); or as IP infusion after
      intravenous (IV) infusion (IV+IP) (Double-Route Arm), and to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each Arm separately, in subjects with
      refractory ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant ascites. In both Arms, the plasma
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAX69 will be characterized, and pharmacodynamics (PD) markers will
      be explored in plasma and ascites. Two expansion cohorts will further assess the tolerability
      of the RP2D and explore clinical signs of efficacy.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLT is defined as any drug related treatment-emergent adverse event that occurs during the 28-day period after the first dose of Imalumab and that meets any of these criteria:
Any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity assessed by the investigator as related to study drug (except: single lab value out of normal range not necessarily translating or considered a feature of clinical diagnosis requiring an intervention per investigator's interpretation and resolves to ≤ Grade 2 with adequate measure in 7 days; Transient grade 3 elevations of hepatic transaminases in the absence of simultaneous increase in serum bilirubin; Alopecia)
Any toxicity resulted in dose delay for ≥14 days
Any grade 4 hematologic toxicity (except lymphopenia)
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia

        <description>DLT is defined as any drug related treatment-emergent adverse event that occurs during the 28-day period after the first dose of Imalumab and that meets any of these criteria:
Any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity assessed by the investigator as related to study drug (except: single lab value out of normal range not necessarily translating or considered a feature of clinical diagnosis requiring an intervention per investigator's interpretation and resolves to ≤ Grade 2 with adequate measure in 7 days; Transient grade 3 elevations of hepatic transaminases in the absence of simultaneous increase in serum bilirubin; Alopecia)
Any toxicity resulted in dose delay for ≥14 days
Any grade 4 hematologic toxicity (except lymphopenia)
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding

      <restrictive_agreement>Agreements with PIs may vary per requirements of individual PI, but contain common elements. For this study, PIs are restricted from independently publishing results until completion of the multi-center publication or twelve months following the conclusion of the study at all sites, whichever is first. Baxalta requires a review of results communication at least 90 days prior to submission. Baxalta may request an additional delay up to 60 days (e.g. for intellectual property protection).</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Study was terminated early with only 1 subject having been dosed. Therefore no statistical analysis was performed on the outcome measures. Only descriptive data for one subject are available.</limitations_and_caveats>
