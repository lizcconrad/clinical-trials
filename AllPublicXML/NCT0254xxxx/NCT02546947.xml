    <textblock>
      Mortality in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is high (40 to 60 %). Protective
      mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of the ARDS therapeutic strategies. Recently, a
      prospective multicenter study demonstrates that short-term infusion of neuromuscular blocking
      agents (NMBA) reduces hospital mortality. However, the mechanisms through which NMBAs could
      improve survival remain speculative and the dose of NMBA needed to observe a beneficial
      effect is still debated. In hypoxemic ventilated patients, continuous cisatracurium infusion
      with an objective of no response at orbicularis oculi to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation and
      an objective of two responses had similar effects on respiratory parameters. In their study,
      Papazian and colleagues used cisatracurium with an initial standard dose of 15 mg followed by
      a continuous infusion of 37.5mg/h, based on previous results of studies with patients
      monitored for paralysis. Atracurium and its stereoisomer cisatracurium are non-depolarizing
      neuromuscular blocking drugs, both used in anaesthesia and intensive care units.

      The aim of this study was to compare in ARDS patients a dose adjustment of
      continuous-atracurium intravenous infusion with an end point of one or two response at
      orbicularis oculi to TOF stimulation, and a dose adjustment to achieve clinical goals of
      protective ventilation without monitoring of TOF stimulation.
