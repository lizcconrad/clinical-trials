  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is on the long term not always successful in every patient
      because weight regain can occur. An intervention to prevent weight regain in the future is to
      place a silicone band (non-adjustable) around the pouch of the RYGB (Banded-RYGB: BRYGB)
      which increases weight loss and decreases weight regain on the longer term. The question is
      whether primary application of a banded bypass gives a greater weight loss and / or prevent
      weight regain in the future versus a standard RYGB.

      A Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is on the long term not always successful in every patient
      because weight regain can occur. An intervention to prevent weight regain in the future is to
      place a silicone band (non-adjustable) around the pouch of the RYGB (Banded-RYGB: BRYGB)
      which increases weight loss and decreases weight regain on the longer term. The question is
      whether primary application of a banded bypass gives a greater weight loss and / or prevent
      weight regain in the future versus a standard RYGB.

      The Study design is a prospective, randomized, single center study.

      Study population: patients who qualify for a RYGB are eligible to participate. The primary
      RYGB patients may participate if there is a BMI of 35 kg / m2 with a morbidly obesity-related
      comorbidity or a BMI of 40kg / m2 or higher.

      Intervention: The standard RYGB with a vertical pouch over a 40 french feeding tube with a
      volume of 30-50 ml, is compared with a banded-RYGB (BRYGB)
