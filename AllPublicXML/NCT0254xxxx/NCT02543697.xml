  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with tumors in both adrenal glands and slightly elevated cortisol (subclinical
      Cushings syndrome) are offered to go through an adrenal venous sampling to try to quantify if
      the overproduction of cortisol is from one adrenal, or from both sides. If it is one-sided,
      the investigators offer the patient operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal incidentalomas are quite common. About 4 % of the population have adrenal tumors that
      they are unknown of. Some percentage of this patients produce a little to much cortisol, but
      not enough to give overt Cushings syndrome. It is shown that slightly elevated cortisol
      production will give higher blood pressure, higher blood sugar and maybe higher BMI. For
      another hormone produced in the adrenal glands , aldosterone, we know that even if you have
      an adrenal tumor on one adrenal, you could have bilateral overproduction of the hormone.In
      that situations it is no need of an operation of the adrenal with the tumor. When the
      overproduction is unilateral it is of great value to the patient to operate the adrenal
      gland, and the symptoms from the hormone excess will disappear. For aldosterone Adrenal
      venous sampling (AVS) has been used for several years to try to determine if the hormone
      overproduction is one-sided or to sided. We are in this study using the same principle for
      cortisol overproduction.

    <description>If the ratio between cortisol in the adrenal veins is over 3,3 , it is defined as unilateral overproduction of cortisol.</description>

    <description>The patients will be offered operation if the overproduction seems to be unilateral. They will then be evaluated for cortisol abnormalities , blood sugar, and hypertension i intervals of 6 months after surgery ,to see if the parameters improve. They who are not operated will be evaluated in the same way.</description>

    <description>If the ratio between cortisol in the adrenal vein and the periphery vein is over 3,3 it is defined as overproduction, and if it is over 6,5 it will probably be an adenoma.</description>

    <description>We go trough the femoral vein with a catheter up to the adrenal vein first on the left side, then on the right side. We take blood samples and analyze cortisol, metanefrin/ normetanefrin, aldosterone both from the adrenal veins and from the peripher vein. Then we use criteria from the Majo clinic to identify if the overproduction of cortisol is uni- or bilateral.</description>
