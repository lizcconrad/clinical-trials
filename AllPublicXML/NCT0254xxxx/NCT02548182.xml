  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to conduct a pilot RCT of young obese population to evaluate
      the effect of smartcare with or without financial incentives for 12 weeks. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to a three-arm of control, smartcare, and smartcare plus financial
      incentives group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility and potential impact of smartcare with or without financial
      incentives, the study employed a three-arm, open label randomized controlled trial design:
      control, smartcare, and smartcare plus financial incentives. The investigators hypothesized
      that the 'smartcare + financial incentive' arm will show the greatest change in outcomes,
      followed by the 'smartcare' only arm, and lastly the control arm. Specific aims of the study
      are as follows:

        -  To quantify the effectiveness of a 'smartcare' intervention to promote physical activity
           and reduce weight over a 12 week period.

        -  To quantify the incremental effectiveness of adding financial incentives to 'smartcare'
           intervention

    <description>Participants allocated to a smartcare arms received the Fit.life™ wireless physical activity tracker (Fit.life™, Suwon, Korea) that measures daily and weekly physical activity. It is convenient for data upload via Bluetooth on participant mobile phone or wirelessly via a personal computer, and has been validated for measurement of free-living physical activity in adults [REF]. Participants allocated to a smartcare arms were also provided a standardized education material on diet, exercise, and behavior modification.</description>

    <description>Participants in the 'smartcare plus financial incentive' arms were told that they are entitled to receive financial incentives depending on their achievement of the physical activity and weight target, and the amount they ca expect .The investigators provide financial incentives classified as process-based incentive and outcome-based incentive in addition to smartcare group intervention. A smartphone application was customized for the use of the investigators' intervention, different for the 'smart care' group and 'smartcare plus financial incentive' group.</description>

    <description>Fit.life™ wireless physical activity tracker can measure daily physical activity including activity strength and time. It was chosen for its small size, accuracy in the measurement of physical activity, and convenient data upload via Bluetooth on participant mobile phone or wirelessly via a personal computer. Fit.life™ wireless physical activity tracker has been validated for measurement of free-living physical activity in adults [REF]. A smartphone application was customized for the use of the investigators' intervention, different for the 'smart care' group and 'smartcare plus financial incentive' group. The version for the latter group included the feature for the monitoring and feedback of financial incentives.</description>

    <description>Financial incentives are provided in the form of process-based and outcome-based incentive.(maximum 320,000KRW) Process-based incentives were based on daily physical activity level. Participants in the 'smart care plus financial incentive' arms could earn incentives of up to 10,000 KRW per week according to the following schedule: 1,000 KRW if a participant reached target amount of physical activity in a day / An additional 3,000 KRW if a participant reached target amount of physical activity every day in a week. Outcome-based incentives were based on achievement of weight loss target at each visit. 50,000 KRW if a participant reached weight loss target of 3% from the baseline body weight at visit 2 (4 week)/ 50,000 KRW in weight loss target of 5% from the baseline body weight at visit 3 (8 week) / 100,000 KRW in weight loss target of 7% from the baseline body weight at final visit 4 (12 week)</description>
