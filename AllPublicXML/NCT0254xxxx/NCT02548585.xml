      A Phase 1/2, multiple dose study with 6 cohorts of ascending doses designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MEDI0382 in patients with Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T2DM).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and PK of MEDI0382 administered as multiple daily SC doses to subjects with
      T2DM. Approximately one hundred and seven subjects will be enrolled across 6 cohorts. In
      cohorts 1-3 the subjects will be randomized to MEDI0382 or placebo (3:1). In Cohort 4,
      subjects will be randomized 1:1. In cohort 5 and 6 subjects will be randomized to MEDI0382 or
      placebo (3:1).
