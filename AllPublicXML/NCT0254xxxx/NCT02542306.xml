  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding is a common complication of cardiac surgery, especially aortic arch surgery
      involving moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest. Fibrinogen concentrate is increasingly
      used to treat coagulopathic bleeding in cardiac surgery, although its effectiveness and
      safety are unknown.

      Fibrinogen concentrate was administered to 54 patients when the fibrinogen level was below
      1.5 g/L after protamine reversal. Additionally, 30 patients were enrolled as the
      non-FC-treated group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of fibrinogen
      concentrate in patients with acute type A aortic dissection.

      Eighty-four acute type A aortic dissection patients undergoing emergency aortic arch surgery
      involving moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest were included. The clinical data, standard
      laboratory tests and plasma fibrinogen levels were obtained at 5 time points.

      The investigators analyzed the standard laboratory tests, the plasma fibrinogen levels, the
      volumes of cumulative postoperative drainage and transfused allogenic blood products in 84
      patients.

      The primary and secondary end points were determined and considered.The primary endpoint
      (efficacy endpoint) included the volumes of individual allogeneic blood products, volumes of
      cumulative drainage within 24 h and 48 h and 5 days volumes after infusion of fibrinogen
      concentrate as well as the rates of reoperation due to bleeding. The secondary endpoint
      (safety endpoint) for the study was the incidence of serious adverse events from infusion of
      fibrinogen concentrate to day 45. The serious adverse events defined for the evaluation of
      safety of fibrinogen concentrate were death, pulmonary embolism and other thromboembolic or
      ischemic events (myocardial infarction, paraplegia and cerebral infarction).
