  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Problem gambling is a public health concern with prevalence rates at 2 %. Problem
      gambling also severely affects concerned significant others (CSOs). Several studies have
      investigated the effects of individual treatments based on cognitive behavior therapy (CBT),
      but there is a shortage in studies on the effect of involving CSOs in treatment. This study
      aims to compare an intervention based on behavioral couples therapy (BCT) involving a CSO
      with an individual CBT treatment to determine their relative efficacy. BCT has shown
      promising results in working with substance abuse, but this is the first time it is used as
      an intervention for problem gambling. Both interventions will be Internet-delivered and
      participants will receive e-mail and telephone support.

      Method/Design: A sample of at least 100 couples will be randomized to either the BCT
      condition or the CBT condition. The participants will work through 10 modules over 12 weeks
      in a secure online environment, and receive support via email and over telephone. Repeated
      measures will be conducted weekly and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome
      measure is gambling behavior, defined as time spent and money lost on gambling, as measured
      by timeline follow-back. Secondary outcomes include gambling related harm, alcohol
      consumption, relationship satisfaction and mental health for the gambler as well as for the
      CSO.

      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that a) BCT will yield greater reductions on
      gambling measures than CBT, b) BCT will yield a lower drop-out rate compared to CBT, c) BCT
      will be superior to CBT on increasing relationship satisfaction, d) relationship functioning
      will mediate change in gambling behavior in the BCT group and e) reduction in gambling
      behavior will mediate change in relationship functioning in the CBT group.
