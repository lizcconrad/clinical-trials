  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exempt, retrospective study of a limited set of information obtained from
      patients' medical records at 10 to 12 substance abuse treatment programs combined with
      alcohol breath analyzer results during up to 3 years of aftercare monitoring. The study
      objectives are 1) to compare the compliance rates and likelihood of achieving sustained
      sobriety for aftercare patients in mandated (eg, impaired professionals) versus non-mandated
      monitoring programs and 2) identify components within patients' monitoring agreements that
      are significantly correlated with positive outcomes.
