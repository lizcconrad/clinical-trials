             stoma site (wound) is kept open to heal by secondary intention at the time of

             drug.

          -  Agree to use accepted highly effective methods of birth control (defined as one that
             results in a low failure rate (i.e., &lt;1% per year when used consistently and
             correctly) and continue for 3 months following receipt of study drug:

             drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical/research
             monitor, contraindicates their participation.

             active infection (not including eligible surgical wounds), symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, metastatic
