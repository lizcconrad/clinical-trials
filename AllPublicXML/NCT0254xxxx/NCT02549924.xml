  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus [ T2DM ] has quickly become the epidemic of the XXI century and
      challenging global health . Estimates of the World Health Organization [ WHO ] indicate that
      globally , from 1995 to date has nearly tripled the number of people living with diabetes
      mellitus [DM ]. Resveratrol has been extensively studied as a regulator of glucose through
      its antioxidant effects and protecting pancreatic β cells by activation of sirtuin -1 [ SIRT1
      ] dependent deacetylase nicotinamide adenine diphosphate [ NAD ]. Therefore, it is important
      to know the effect of resveratrol on the glycemic variability [GV ] in patients with T2DM who
      are not in control with metformin monotherapy based.

      The objective is to evaluate the effect of administration of resveratrol on GV in individuals
      with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin, for which we will conduct a double-blind
      trial, randomized, placebo control group, each group 11 male and female patients 30-60 years
      of age with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin [2000 mg / day and glycosylated
      hemoglobin A1c (A1C) ≥% 7], with body mass index [BMI] form 25.0 to 34.9 kg / m2.
      Randomization will determine who will receive the intervention during the 8-week trial
      [resveratrol capsules, 500 mg 3 times daily with the first bite of each meal or approved
      placebo capsules], both groups also continue with metformin. The clinical findings and
      laboratory tests include a metabolic profile and biosafety, which will be made at baseline
      and at 8 weeks. Body weight, body fat, BMI and blood pressure will be determined during the
      initial and final visit, likewise, plasma glucose concentrations every hour recorded over 72
      hours by continuous monitoring system outpatient glucose [MACG] via iPro ™ 2 [Medtronic
      MiniMed, Northridge] system, through which the mean amplitude of glucose excursions [MAGE] is
      calculated and AUC glucose, which will serve to assess the GV. Adverse events and adherence
      to treatment will be documented. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon and
      Fisher exact test. It is considered with significance at p &lt;0.05.
