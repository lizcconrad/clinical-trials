      The health-related quality of life questionnaire &quot;EQ-5D&quot; has been collected in connection
      with several interventional and observational studies where the no-touch vein harvesting
      technique in CABG has been used. The results of the questionnaires will be compiled and
      reported in this study.

    <description>EQ-5D is a generic measure of health. The instrument can be used to measure quality of life change in a population over time and to compare the quality of life among different groups in the population such as different socio-economic groups. EQ-5D is constructed of five dimensions: mobility, care, usual activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression. Each dimension is answered on a three-point scale (none, moderate or severe symptoms). With this instrument, it can theoretically be 243 possible health conditions. Health condition can also be described as an index value between 0 corresponding to death and one equivalent full health. Some negative values corresponding a state worse than death can occur. Moreover consists EQ-5D of a VAS scale (Visual Analogue Scale), a thermometer-like scale, with 0 being the worst possible health status and 100 representing full health.</description>
