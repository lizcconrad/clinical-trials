      The Chest Wall and Spine Deformity Registry is a tool designed to assist spine surgeons to
      efficiently identify and track patients with chest wall and spinal disorders. The registry
      allows spine surgeons to participate in retrospective and prospective studies for specific
      spinal disorders.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical and radiographic measures for children with chest wall deformity, spine deformity and/or spinal disorder.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10 years, recording each clinical and/or surgical visit the patient encounters at Children's Hospital Colorado.</time_frame>
    <description>The registry records data from clinical and surgical visits - evaluation date, demographics, cobb angle, kyphosis, ambulatory status, ECG and ECHO measurements, lab results (HbG, Serum CO2, Albumin, Prealbumin), X-rays, pulmonary function test and O2 saturation, primary diagnosis, comorbidities, prior and current treatment, surgical info (days in ICU, blood loss, type of procedure, position of device, fusion details), and complication details.
An Early Onset Scoliosis 24-Item Questionnaire is also administered each visit. Questions pertain to general health, pain/discomfort, pulmonary function, transfer, physical function, daily living, energy level, emotion, parental impact, financial impact, and satisfaction. For each category there are 1-3 questions where parents can circle one of the five answer choices that vary in severity grade.
The primary outcome would be to complete numerous small retrospective cohort studies using the data collected prospectively from the registry.</description>
