  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In hemiplegic, there is very little data on the impact of neurological deficit on the
      microarchitecture independent of bone mineral density and composition of the bone marrow.
      Rare studies have shown the relationship between some micro-architectural parameters and
      severity of neurological deficit. There is no study in humans on the evolution of the
      parameters of the microarchitecture assessed by 3D micro-tomography in the early phase of the
      installation of neurological deficits after stroke, in terms of a bearing bone, tibia, that a
      non-load bearing bones, radius.

      Each patient must answer several questionnaires about their calcium intake and its ability to
      perform everyday tasks. They will also have 3 blood samples (15 ml each time), 3 measure of
      bone by 3D micro-tomography and 2 MRI examination. These examinations and sampling will take
      place after 30 days after stroke onset (except for MRI) and again after three months and six
      months after the stroke (the same day as the medical follow-up visit).
