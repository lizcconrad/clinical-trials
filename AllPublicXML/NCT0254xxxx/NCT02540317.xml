  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress disorders in form of adjustment disorder and burnout syndrom are highly prevalent and
      cause substantial suffering. Prior evidence suggest that these disorders may be effectively
      treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), but access to psychological treatment is
      limited. One possible solution is to provide therapy via the Internet, which has been shown
      to be effective for anxiety disorders and depression. In the present study, we will
      investigate the efficacy of Internet-based CBT (ICBT) for adjustment disorders and burnout
      syndrom in a randomized controlled trial (N=100). Participants will be randomized to active
      treatment (n=50) or a control condition on waiting list.

      Stress disorders in form of adjustment disorder and burnout syndrom are highly prevalent and
      cause substantial suffering. Prior evidence suggest that these disorders may be effectively
      treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), but access to psychological treatment is
      limited. One possible solution is to provide therapy via the Internet, which has been shown
      to be effective for anxiety disorders and depression. Internet-based CBT can be described as
      online bibliotherapy with therapist support via a secure messaging system. In this study
      psychologists will deliver the treatment. We will investigate the efficacy of Internet-based
      CBT (ICBT) for adjustment disorder and burnout syndrom in a randomized controlled trial
      (N=100). Participants will be randomized to active treatment (n=50) or a control condition on
      waiting list. We expect that participants who receive ICBT will make superior improvements
      compared to the control condition on measures of stress, burnout, depressive symptoms,
      general anxiety and general functioning.
