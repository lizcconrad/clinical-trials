  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blinded study involving healthy non-alcoholic (self-reported)
      volunteers over the age of 21 to consume beer on hospital property in a safe environment to
      ensure immediate availability to medical attention and to security if needed. Volunteers will
      be recruited from residency programs, hospital employees, emergency medical personnel, and
      friends of study investigators. The volunteers will drink to a BAC of 0.1 as checked with a
      breathalyzer. They will wear a tag around their neck with their study number, which will be
      hole-punched with every beer consumed, which will be collected at the end of the night for an
      accurate count of beers consumed per person. They however will not be forced to drink anymore
      if they are uncomfortable with the amount of alcohol they are consuming and can withdraw from
      the study at any time. All participants will be required to be driven home by a sober driver
      once the participant's BAT is 0.02 or less. At the end of the night, the volunteer will be
      breathalyzed to determine BAC, and given 1 capsule per 3 drinks consumed of either 600 mg
      N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine or placebo capsules. In the morning, each participate will fill out a
      Hangover Symptom Score questionnaire, evaluating each hangover symptom on a 0 - 4 point
      Hangover Symptom Severity scale. A random number generator will be used to determine Placebo
      or NAC first, then the participant will be given the other treatment at their subsequent
      encounter. The study will be conducted over the series of many months, and data can be
      analyzed by self-control comparing the participant's hangover symptom severity as determined
      by the hangover symptom scale data when using NAC compared to placebo. The data will be
      analyzed using the numerical values of each category for hangover classification and compare
      the placebo data to the control data.

    <description>In the morning, each participate will fill out a Hangover Symptom Score questionnaire, evaluating each hangover symptom on a 0 - 4 point Hangover Symptom Severity scale. 0 representing &quot;strongly disagree&quot; or &quot;feels like I did not drink last night&quot; to 4 representing &quot;strongly agree&quot; or &quot;I'm so hungover / I'm never drinking again&quot; for each symptom. The symptoms on the Hangover Symptom Scale are: feeling thirsty or dehydrated, feeling more tired than usual, headache, nauseated, vomited, feeling weak, difficulty concentrating, more sensitive to light and sound than usual, sweating more than usual, had trouble sleeping, feeling anxious, feeling depressed, experienced trembling or shaking.</description>
