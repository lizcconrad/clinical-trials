      Objectives: The aim of this research is to compare the effectiveness of myofascial release
      therapy and exercise therapy on pain, quality of sleep, anxiety, trigger points, and joint
      sounds in individuals with temporomandibular disorders and myofascial pain-dysfunction
      syndrome.

      Material and Methods: A single-blind randomized clinical trial will be conducted in a
      university research clinic. Sixty-four subjects with temporomandibular disorders and
      myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome will be randomly assigned to physical therapy group
      (myofascial release protocol and Rocabado exercise therapy) and control group (exercise
      therapy). Intensity of pain, quality of life, quality of sleep, anxiety, trigger points, and
      joint sounds will be collected at baseline, and forty-eight hours after the intervention
      phase.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of pain (100-mm VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in intensity of pain at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 100-mm VAS was used for determining pain intensity, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (very severe pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in quality of sleep at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI was used to study the quality of sleep. It comprises 24 items where the individuals respond to 19 of these items, and individual living in the same dwelling (or hospital room) responds to remaining 5. Scores are obtained on each of 7 components of sleep quality: subjective quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficacy, sleep perturbations, use of hypnotic medication, and daily dysfunction. Each component is scored from 0 to 3 (0: no problems; 3: severe problems).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State and trait anxiety (state anxiety questionnaire and trait - STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in state and trait anxiety at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety level were determined with the 40-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which measures anxiety as a stable dimension of personality (trait or tendency to anxiety) and also includes a state subscale to detect anxiety behaviors. Subjects report their feelings in general for the trait scale and how they feel at the time of questionnaire completion for the state anxiety scale. The state anxiety scale indicates the feelings or sensations of anxiety (not at all, somewhat, moderately so, very much so) at a specific moment in time. The trait anxiety scale indicates the frequency with which anxiety is experienced (almost never, sometimes, often, almost, and always).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical parameters of active and passive mouth opening</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in active and passive mouth opening at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects were asked to open her/his mouth as much as possible for the measurement of active mouth opening without pain and maximal active mouth opening. Maximal passive mouth opening was measured after the application of downward pressure on the mandible by the second and third finger of the patient. The vertical overlap of the incisors was measured by a ruler (Helios-Preisser, Gammertingen, Germany) and recorded in mm for these parameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical parameters of pain in temporalis muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in pain in temporalis muscles at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trigger points were assessed by palpation of temporal muscle (anterior, middle, and origin).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical parameters of lateral condyle pole and temporal tendon insertion pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in Lateral condyle pole and temporal tendon insertion pain at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The muscles, tendon, and lateral condyles were palpated to the finger portion of the examiner´s finger applying a pressure on the muscle (1 Kg) and lateral condyles (0.5 Kg) being studied for 3-6s.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical parameters of clicking sound when opening / close palpation</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in clicking sound when opening / close palpation at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Joint sounds during mouth opening and closing were assessed with the examiner's left index finger on the right joint and the right finger on pre-auricular area. The fingertip is placed anterior to the tragus of the ear. The patient is asked to slowly open as much as possible. After each closing, the subject must place the teeth in contact at a maximal intercuspal position. The patient open and close the mouth three times. Total number of sounds was recorded on both sides.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical parameters of pain in masseter muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in pain in temporalis muscles at twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trigger points were assessed by palpation of masseter muscle (anterior, deep, origin).</description>
