  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip osteoarthritis (HOA) is a common cause of pain and disability in aging population.
      Conservative treatment is based on lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory medications and intra articular injections. This Prospective Pilot Study
      aims at investigating the efficacy of Ultrasound-Guided Cooled Radiofrequency Hip Denervation
      as a treatment offered to patients with HOA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiological prevalence of HOA is very high. Hip denervation (HD) is a known palliative
      procedure that was initially performed as an open surgery. The role of the obturator, femoral
      and sciatic nerves in hip joint innervation was discovered. Several small clinical and
      anatomical studies addressed feasibility and benefits of the radiofrequency hip denervation
      (RFHD). Ultrasound guidance may eliminate equivocality of previously published techniques and
      provide precise image guidance as it a is logical and anatomically sound approach when
      procedural targets include soft tissue, such as nerves, tendons and joint capsule. None of
      these structures can be localized under routine fluoroscopy. Ultrasound is a bedside imaging
      tool that has been accepted as safe and reliable. In two meta-analyses, the use of real-time
      two-dimensional ultrasound for the placement of CVCs substantially decreased mechanical
      complications and reduced the number of attempts at required cannulation and failed attempts
      at cannulation compared with the standard landmark placement. Pertinent to the proposed
      study, recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the accuracy of US-guided versus
      landmark-guided hip joint injections revealed that US-guided injections are significantly
      more accurate than those that are landmark-guided. The significance of this study lies in its
      potential to improve functional activity and pain control in patients with HOA. Also, it may
      eventually lead to a decrease in patients resorting to Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) as an
      ultimate end solution for HOA.

    <measure>Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire designed to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA)1
The WOMAC consists of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy household duties, light household duties.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A generic, multipurpose short-form survey with 12 questions selected from the SF-36 Health Survey which, when combined, scored and weighted, results in two scales of mental and physical functioning and overall health-related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. It is primarily designed for self-completion by respondents and is ideally suited for use in postal surveys, in clinics and face-to-face interviews. It is cognitively simple, taking only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire.</description>
