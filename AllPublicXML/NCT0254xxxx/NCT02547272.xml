  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal colonization with S. aureus is a risk factor for infection with this bacterium. A
      methodologically well conducted study of S. aureus bacteremia showed that 80% of S. aureus
      bacteremia with are due to the strain isolated in the nasal level. However, as part of a
      study coordinated by the CHU of Saint-Etienne, less than 50% of infections in prosthetic
      orthopedic devices have been linked to nasal carriage . Outside of exogenous infections,
      intestinal colonization with S. aureus could be an alternative source of endogenous
      infections with the waning of orthopedic surgery. In the general population, considering that
      about one third of the subjects were colonized with S. aureus nasal level and 1 in 5 in the
      intestine However the proportion of exclusive intestinal porting is not well known .

      This study will analyze, among ICU patients, porting S. aureus nasal and rectal level. It
      will better clarify the relationship between nasal and rectal ports and the risk of
      developing an infection.

      The adult patients hospitalized in intensive care at the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne
      have a multiresistant bacteria porting screening at the nose and rectum at admission and then
      once a week. These samples will be carried unchanged way for the study but will also be a
      research S Aureus
