  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot evaluation to assess the feasibility of using novel imaging process to
      characterize lens edge and limbal epithelial thickness profile; lens movement with gaze and
      blink; and conjunctival microvasculature including fractal analysis of microvascular
      perfusion maps and blood flow velocity.

      This is a pilot evaluation to assess the feasibility of using ultra-high resolution optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) to image and characterize lens edge and limbal epithelial
      thickness profile; lens movement with gaze and blink; and conjunctival microvasculature
      including fractal analysis of microvascular perfusion maps and blood flow velocity.

             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.
