      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of donor lymphocyte infusion
      when given together with reduced intensity conditioning regimen before partially matched
      donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with stage IIB-IV mycosis fungoides or Sezary
      syndrome. Giving chemotherapy and low-dose total-body irradiation followed by high-dose
      cyclophosphamide before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth
      of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer
      cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the
      body's normal cells (called graft-versus-host disease). Removing the T-cells from the donor
      cells and giving them before transplant may stop this from happening. Additionally, giving
      tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil before and after transplant may also stop this from
      happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTVES:

      I. To evaluate regimen related toxicity, engraftment and graft versus host disease (GVHD) in
      the first 100 days with new reduced intensity haploidentical regimen protocol, including
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), low dose total body irradiation, and cyclophosphamide.

      II. To determine an effective donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) dose that provides successful
      engraftment without causing GVHD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess myeloid and lymphoid engraftment rates of patients undergoing treatment on this
      regimen.

      II. To determine the incidence and severity of GVHD in patients undergoing treatment on this
      regimen using a combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as GVHD
      prophylaxis.

      III. To examine progression free survival and overall survival in patients with cytotoxic
      T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) undergoing treatment on this regimen.

      IV. To assess the pace of lymphoid recovery in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of DLI.

      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days -11 to -8 and undergo total body irradiation twice daily (BID) on day
      -7. Patients also receive donor cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ enriched T lymphocyte
      infusion on day -6 and high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 to -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day
      0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -1, patients receive tacrolimus IV with taper (drug wean)
      by day 60 and mycophenolate mofetil IV BID on days -1 to 28 in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
