  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early mechanical ventilation, if delivered with injurious settings, can lead to pulmonary
      complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation in
      the emergency department (ED) has been studied infrequently when compared to the intensive
      care unit; however, data suggests that ED-based mechanical ventilation has significant room
      for improvement and may also be a causative factor in ARDS incidence.
