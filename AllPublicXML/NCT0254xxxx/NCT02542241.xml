  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether hypertonic saline solution is effective in
      the resuscitation of traumatized patients undergone abdominal damage control surgery
      regarding early closure of the abdominal wall.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial will be conducted to determine the
      impact of an infusion of hypertonic saline 3% vs isotonic saline 0.9% at a dose of 50 mL/hr
      for the first 72 hours in patients with abdominal trauma requiring damage control surgery, in
      terms closing time of abdominal cavity, fluids balance, abdominal hypertension and abdominal
      compartment syndrome occurrence, organ dysfunction and 28 days mortality.
