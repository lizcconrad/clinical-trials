      This is a cohort study. This study is to develop a predictive model of the side effects after
      chemotherapy, exploreing the potential risk factors of the side effects such as
      myelosuppression and chemotherapy realted vomit after the chemotherapy, so that it could help
      to alleviate patients' fear and anxiety about the side effects and the toxicity of
      chemotherapy. The potential risk factors were measured at baseline.

      Firstly, the investigator will extact the &quot;macro&quot; information about physical conditon, which
      comes from syndrome-constitutional differentiation in the light of Traditonal Chinease
      Medicine (TCM) theory. Then combined with the &quot;micro&quot; information about pathological and
      biological markers, &quot;TCM clinical phenotype&quot; is extracted by Text Mining, and shows the full
      picture of the clinical features of breast cancer, which will include most of risk factors
      related to occurrence of adverse of chemotherapy fo breast cancer patients to establish two
      corresponding quatitative databases. Furthermore, predictive models will be built according
      to the predictors selected from an analysis on new methods of econometrics-Granger causality
      and cointegration analysis between &quot;TCM clinical phenotype&quot; and adverse effects of
      chemotherapy. The research results will be used to establish effective predictive models to
      lay the foundation for optimizing individualized treatment program of breast cancer by TCM
      and Western medicine.
