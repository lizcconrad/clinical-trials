  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of autologous
      mononuclear cells (MNC) collected from bone marrow (BM) and intracoronary delivery for
      individuals with declining ventricle systemic pumps. This procedure has the potential to
      foster a new strategy for congenital heart patients. This is an open-label study of
      autologous MNC derived from bone marrow with a 2-year follow-up to document 1) related
      serious adverse events and 2) monitor changes in cardiac structure and function.

      This study is an open label Phase I trial to determine the safety and feasibility of bone
      marrow-derived mononuclear cells delivered into the coronary circulation of subjects with
      Fontan circulation and right ventricular dysfunction. Subjects will be screened at outpatient
      clinic visits at Mayo Clinic and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered
      participation in this trial. Once informed consent has been obtained; preoperative values
      will be established and a selection committee will review subjects within three days prior to
      planned procedure to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. This will require a non-study
      cardiologist to review the clinical case and confirm the baseline cardiac function with
      evidence of disease progression with right ventricle dysfunction. However, individuals with
      decreased cardiac function requiring inotropic support and immediate listing for cardiac
      transplantation will NOT be included such that the risk of this research procedure may not be
      acceptable. Following cell-based product delivery, subjects will be followed for 6-months
      according to a pre-determined schedule that includes imaging studies along with
      questionnaires, electrophysiology and laboratory studies. Subjects will be contacted for an
      additional 18-months for surveillance by phone.
