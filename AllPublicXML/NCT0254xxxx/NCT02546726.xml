  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended for inactive, middle-aged adults with untreated pre-hypertension who
      live in the Urbana-Champaign area, who are interested in a comprehensive program designed to
      enhance physical activity &amp; reduce blood pressure. All participants will be asked to engage
      in a program developed in accordance with American Heart Association's recommendations.
      Specifically, the program will encourage and support lifestyle behavior changes such as
      quitting smoking, eating heart-healthy food, and reducing excessive alcohol, in addition to
      weekly exercise. The exercise program will involve a 14-week aerobic training program (3
      weekly sessions, scheduled at study participants' convenience), and 2 pre- and 2-post-testing
      sessions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been associated with enhanced cognitive functioning. Several physiological
      mechanisms of change have been proposed, including increased blood-flow, vascular
      functioning, and neurological changes. Similar outcomes are also associated with partial-body
      and full-body heat therapy (e.g. steam-room or dry-sauna). The purpose of this study is to
      compare full-body HEAT treatments combined with exercise in a 14-week program to an
      exercise-only condition. The exercise program will involve moderate-intensity aerobic
      exercise training. All participants will also be asked to adhere to the American Heart
      Association's guidelines for reducing and controlling blood pressure, including increasing
      physical activity (at least 50 minutes, 3 times/week as part of our supervised training
      sessions), stopping smoking altogether, eating healthier (limiting sodium, eating fruit,
      veggies, low-fat dairy and lean protein, and reducing saturated fat and total fat), drinking
      less alcohol (1-2 drinks a day max) and achieving and maintaining a healthy bodyweight
      (striving for a body mass index between 18 and 25).

      It is hypothesized that heat treatments combined with exercise will enhance the body's
      adaptive responses to exercise which in turn, should reduce blood pressure &amp; blood flow, and
      improve cognitive functioning and related psychosocial outcomes (including anxiety and
      mindfulness). A two-armed (parallel groups design) randomized controlled trial involving heat
      and aerobic training (HEAT) will be compared with an exercise only (ExOnly) control
      condition. Therefore, the HEAT groups will receive 42 exercise classes each followed by a
      heat treatment involving 11-20 minutes of steam-room therapy. Post-exercise time will be
      matched in the control condition by having participants sit in the lobby after each session.
      The exercise interventions and assessments will be conducted by trained exercise staff. The
      participants will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Additionally, brief
      assessments will be administered at each session (pre and post) and logs will be administered
      to participants on a weekly basis. Assessments will include (a) physical activity &amp; biometric
      monitoring, (b) performance on neurocognitive tests, (c) endothelial function, (d) a battery
      of psychosocial questionnaires, and (e) functional performance measures.

    <time_frame>14-week change</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to fast for 6 hours and avoid alcohol &amp; caffeine for 24 hours. They will arrive in a postprandial state and blood flow will be assessed on the calf using strain-gauge plethysmography. Data will be presented as peak hyperemic calf blood flow (CBF) and total CBF. Total CBF will be calculated as area under the curve of the 3-min hyperemic CBF response, based on 13 measures (post-occlusion) using the trapezoidal integration method (see Heffernan et al 2009). Total CBF is an overall estimate of the dilatory capacity of the vessels and therefore serves as an indirect measure of endothelial function.</description>

    <measure>blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>14-week change</time_frame>
    <description>Resting systolic and diastolic will be assessed on the upper-arm with an automated Omron device that takes 3 continuous measurements and reports the average. After study enrollment, participants will be asked to avoid certain medications, foods and beverages known to alter these measurements. Upon entering the research site, participants will be instructed to sit quietly in a dimly lit room for 10 minutes prior to assessments. Staff will then assess blood pressure in three sequential positions (lying supine, sitting in chair, standing). The 14-week change in blood pressure will be defined as the difference between baseline and program end, using the average measures recorded at each position for systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure.</description>

    <description>An iPad-version of the established Trail-Making (A&amp;B) Test will be used to assess general executive functioning overall. The iPad version involves trials with stationary and moving stimuli within the A (alpha-only) and B (alpha-numeric) condition. A modified algorithm based on the commonly used index of global executive function (subtracting B - A) will be implemented for data analysis. Specifically, the outcome measure will be calculated as:
Trails AB reaction time (RT) cost = ((Average RT for hard/moving B trials) - (Average RT for easy/stationary B trials)) - ((Average RT for hard/moving A - Average RT for easy/stationary A trials)).</description>
