    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of Black Tea in reducing the deposits on
      teeth. It also compares the effect between use of black tea mouthwash and green tea mouthwash
      to that of chlorhexidine in reducing plaque deposition on teeth in a two weeks long clinical
      trial among adults of 18-40 years of age.

      The study titled &quot;Effectiveness of Black Tea Mouthwash on Plaque formation: A Randomized
      Controlled Clinical Trial&quot; conducted at Department of Periodontics,during February 2015 till
      July 2015 included three interventional arms with 15 subjects each who had chronic
      generalized plaque-induced gingivitis. All subjects underwent scaling and randomly allocated
      into three groups as Black tea,Green tea and Chlorhexidine. Those in black tea, green tea and
      Chlorhexidine groups advised to rinse with 0.5% Black tea, 0.5% green tea and 0.12%
      Chlorhexidine aqueous based solutions for 30 seconds twice daily half an hour after brushing
      teeth respectively. Gingival Index (Loe and Silness 1963) and Plaque Index (Silness and Loe,
      1964) recorded at baseline and 2 weeks after intervention in all subjects. Results were
      analyzed using SPSS Statistical software version 20.
