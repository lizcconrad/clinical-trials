      The study is an open label, prospective, multicenter, phase II study which aims to define
      ibrutinib efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory primary central nervous lymphoma
      (PCNSL) or intraocular lymphoma (IOL) as measured by the disease control (DC) rate (complete
      response (CR) + uncertain complete response (Ru) + partial response (PR) stabilized disease
      (SD)) after 2 cycles of treatment according to International study group for PCNSL (IPCG)
      criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of PCNSL or cytologically proven diagnosis of IOL
             or lymphomatous meningitis of B-cell type. In case of CNS lymphoma relapse or
             refractory PCNSL, cerebral biopsies are not required if imaging reveals typical images
             of PCNSL. In case of isolated IOL relapse, vitrectomy is not required if i) vitrectomy
             was part of the initial diagnosis workout, and ii) ocular examination and dosage of
             IL-10 in the anterior chamber of the eye performed at relapse or progression are
             highly in favour of IOL relapse (&gt; 50 pg/ml in aqueous humor or 400 pg/ml in
             vitreous).

          2. Aged 18 years and older.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2.

          4. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

          5. No more than 4 lines of anti-cancer treatment received.

          6. Patients must have recovered within 28 days to a grade ≤ 1 from all toxicities related
             to prior treatments.

          8. Measurable PCNSL as diagnosed on MRI

          9. Highly effective method of birth control during and after the study consistent. Men

         10. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-hCG or urine pregnancy
             test at Screening.

         11. Sign of an informed consent document.The informed consent document can be signed by a
             person of confidence in case neurologic disorders related to the disease prevent the
             patient to sign himself.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindication to any excipients of the drug.

             3 mm on T2* sequence won't be excluded.

          7. Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists or ongoing
             warfarin medication or other equivalent vitamin K antagonists.

          8. Any anti-platelet aggregant medication except acetyl salicylic acid ≤ 75 mg/day.

          9. Requires treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

             arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of

         13. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which
             could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of
             ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.

         14. Inability to swallow capsules.

         15. Pregnancy or lactation.

         16. Use of anti-cancer drug therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
