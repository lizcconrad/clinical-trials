    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of low dose S+ketamine compared to placebo on cumulative
      morphine consumption at 24 hours in women undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy with
      remifentanil-propofol target controlled infusion. It compares the adverse effect profile in
      patients receiving S+ketamine as compared to those who did not. Participants are randomly
      distributed in two groups of 45 patient's each.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent times it has been suggested that NMDA receptor antagonist like ketamine when used
      in small doses helps reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption without compromising
      wakefulness and or causing its psycho mimetic adverse effect .

      The clinical utility of S+ ketamine as an adjuvant intra-operatively remains controversial.
      The NMDA receptor activation and subsequent biochemical process has been proven to play an
      important role in both hyperalgesia after tissue injury and the development of opioid
      tolerance. Various studies have reported the advantage of S+ ketamine over traditional
      balanced anaesthesia, but may lead to secondary hyperalgesia and increased opioid requirement
      in post operative period in both animals and healthy human volunteers. Other studies showed
      that 48 hours continuous administration of small-dose ketamine, together with
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine, or systemic, epidural co-administration of
      ketamine and opiates markedly reduced cumulative morphine. However, the dosage, route and
      timing of administration of S+-ketamine varied in different setting.
