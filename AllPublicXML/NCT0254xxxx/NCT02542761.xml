      The purpose of this study was to compare the functional performance of individuals with
      transtibial amputation using two types of prosthetic foot designs: carbon fiber vs.
      fiberglass composite.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a new type of prosthetic foot has appeared on the market. This device is composed
      of a fiberglass composite material. Knowledge is lacking regarding the performance
      characteristics of this new device. Comprehensive studies are needed to form a solid basis
      for prosthetic prescription. The current study sought to understand the experience of
      community-living, transtibial amputees using this prosthetic foot. Specifically, the
      biomechanical performance of this device were compared to existing conventional dynamic
      elastic response (DER) technology in a controlled laboratory setting. The investigators
      hypothesized that the fiberglass composite material provided more energy return and improved
      ankle kinematics performance.

      The study design was a repeated measures cross-over trial whereby only the prosthetic foot
      was changed. Each subject was tested using their current carbon-fiber energy storage and
      return prosthetic foot (CFPF) and the fiberglass composite energy storage and return
      prosthetic foot (Rush, Ability Dynamics) (FPF). Half of the subjects began the study on the
      CFPF while the other half began on the FPF. All types of CFPF were used in this study. Each
      subject was given an acclimation period (about 4 weeks) before testing, which was consistent
      with other similar studies. The same socket and suspension were used throughout the study in
      order to eliminate these confounding variables.

      A 10 camera, high resolution motion capture system with a set of 51 reflective markers was
      used to capture whole-body motion. Three-dimensional marker trajectory data was collected at
      120 Hz and filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency
      of 8 Hz. The standard Helen Hayes marker set and some additional markers were applied to the
      subject. Additional markers included an anterior pylon marker, medial pylon marker, lateral
      pylon marker, right and left medial calcaneus markers, and right and left lateral calcaneus
      markers. In addition, left and right medial knee markers were used for establishing the knee
      joint centers and were then removed for the walking trails. Subjects wore standard laboratory
      athletic shoes for all walking trials. All of the markers associated with the foot were
      placed on the outside of the subject's shoes.

      Following the application of the reflective marker set, the subject performed tests while
      walking over level ground at a self-selected and normalized speed as well as up and down a 10
      degree inclined ramp. The normalized speed controlled for leg length by normalizing to a
      Froude (Fr) number of 0.25 where Fr = v^2/gl, and v is the walking speed, g is the
      gravitational constant, and l is the leg length using the greater trochanter height as leg
      length. Timing gates were used to control the walking speed. Simultaneously, ground reaction
      force data was collected from force plates at a sampling rate of 600 Hz. Data from these
      force plates was time-synchronized with the motion cameras. The ramp had a force plate
      embedded within the ramp.

    <measure>Peak Ankle Dorsiflexion During Stance</measure>
    <time_frame>After approximate 4 week acclimation period</time_frame>
    <description>The peak ankle dorsiflexion is the peak ankle backward flexion or bending when walking.</description>

    <measure>Peak Ankle Plantar Flexor Moment During Stance</measure>
    <time_frame>After approximate 4 week acclimation period</time_frame>
    <description>Peak ankle plantar flexor moment means the peak force of the movement of the foot in which the foot or toes flex downward toward the sole. The unit of measurement for this variable is Nm/kg = 1 nanometer / (kilogram unit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Ankle Power Generation</measure>
    <time_frame>After approximate 4 week acclimation period</time_frame>
    <description>Joint power (P) is the &quot;dot product&quot; of the moment (M) at the joint and the angular velocity (w) of the distal segment with respect to the proximal segment (i.e., P = M · w). Depending on the direction of the moment and the direction of the angular velocity, the power can be positive or negative. If the signs for the moment and angular velocity are both positive or both negative, the power is positive. If the signs for the moment and angular velocity are different, the power is negative. The unit of measurement for this variable is W/kg = watts/kilogram.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Knee Flexion During Swing</measure>
    <time_frame>After approximate 4 week acclimation period</time_frame>
    <description>A gait cycle is the period of time for one stride, that is, the time from one event (usually initial foot contact) to the next occurrence of the same event with the same foot. For each leg, the gait cycle can be divided into a stance phase and a swing phase. This variable is measuring the angle of knee flexion during the swing phase.</description>

    <measure>Time of Peak Knee Flexion During Swing</measure>
    <time_frame>After approximate 4 week acclimation period</time_frame>
    <description>A gait cycle is the period of time for one stride, that is, the time from one event (usually initial foot contact) to the next occurrence of the same event with the same foot. For each leg, the gait cycle can be divided into a stance phase and a swing phase. This variable is expressed as a percentage of the gait cycle.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction as Measured by the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>After approximate 4 week acclimation period</time_frame>
    <description>The PEQ is a self-administered questionnaire composed of nine scales computed from forty-two items (ambulation, appearance, frustration, perceived response, residual limb health, social burden, sounds, utility, well being). Each question uses a visual analog scale format, scored as a continuous numerical variable measured as the distance in millimeters from the left endpoint of the measured from the left (0-100). The 0 side of the scale is very negative (terrible) and the 100 side of the scale is very positive (excellent). Each scale is reported separately, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction with the prosthesis itself or quality of life.</description>

        <description>Joint power (P) is the “dot product” of the moment (M) at the joint and the angular velocity (w) of the distal segment with respect to the proximal segment (i.e., P = M · w). Depending on the direction of the moment and the direction of the angular velocity, the power can be positive or negative. If the signs for the moment and angular velocity are both positive or both negative, the power is positive. If the signs for the moment and angular velocity are different, the power is negative.

        <title>Patient Satisfaction as Measured by the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ)</title>
        <description>The PEQ is a self-administered questionnaire composed of nine scales computed from forty-two items (ambulation, appearance, frustration, perceived response, residual limb health, social burden, sounds, utility, well being). Each question uses a visual analog scale format, scored as a continuous numerical variable measured as the distance in millimeters from the left endpoint of the measured from the left (0-100). The 0 side of the scale is very negative (terrible) and the 100 side of the scale is very positive (excellent). Each scale is reported separately, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction with the prosthesis itself or quality of life.</description>
