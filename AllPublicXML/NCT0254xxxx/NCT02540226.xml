  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a drug that is being used more frequently at the Hospital for
      Special Surgery to lessen the amount of blood loss after total knee replacement (TKR). It is
      an anti-fibrinolytic agent, which means that it promotes the formation of blood clots. TXA
      can be given either intravenously or topically (placed directly on the open wound) before
      wound closure. Patients with certain medical conditions have been found to have a high risk
      of thrombosis after being given intravenous TXA, which may lead to serious complications.
      However, to date, no high-risk patients have been identified for use of topical TXA. This
      study will look at thrombogenic markers (proteins found in blood that promote clot formation)
      after TXA is given either intravenously or topically. If the effect on these markers is
      similar between intravenous and topical use of TXA, then the safety of topical TXA should be
      questioned. Of note, these markers have never been measured after TXA has been given
      topically. As a result, this information would be important for the medical community.

    <description>Patients will receive 1g tranexamic acid in 100mL solution intravenously in the operating room before inflation of the tourniquet. They will again receive the same IV solution in the post-anesthesia care unit, approximately 3 hours after the first solution was given. They will also receive a 75cc topical saline solution approximately 5 minutes before the tourniquet is released.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 3g tranexamic acid in 75mL solution topically in the operating room, approximately 5 minutes before the tourniquet is released. It will sit for 5 minutes before the solution is suctioned off by the surgeon. They will also receive 2 intravenous saline solutions: one in the operating room before inflation of the tourniquet, and one in the post-anesthesia care unit 3 hours after the first solution was given.</description>
