    <textblock>
      Confabulators consistently generate false memories without intention to deceive and with
      great feeling of rightness. However, there is currently no known effective treatment for
      them. In order to fill this gap, the aim of this trial was to design a neuropsychological
      treatment based on the current theoretical models and test it experimentally in two groups of
      confabulators: experimental vs. control. The treatment consisted of some brief material that
      patients had to learn and recall at both immediate and delayed moments. After both
      recollections, patients were given feedback about their performance (errors and correct
      responses). Pre-treatment and post-treatment baselines were administered. Confabulators in
      the control group performed the baselines without treatment, and were then offered the
      treatment after the second baseline.

    <measure>Number of Confabulations</measure>
    <time_frame>Measures were recorded during 3 sessions administered in 1 week before (pre-baseline) and during 3 sessions after the treatment (post-baseline). In the control group, pre and post baselines were also recorded but without any treatment between them</time_frame>
    <description>The confabulations recorded were 1) guessed answers, 2) confusions in time and space, 3) a mixture of two or more stimuli presented, and 4) devised or bizarre responses.
Scores ranged from 0 (no confabulations) to unlimited number of them (because devised or bizarre responses were recorded) and consisted of the sum of all the confabulations produced during the baseline. The values in the table represent the mean of confabulations for each group (Neuropsychological treatment or No treatment) in the 3 sessions at each baseline (pre- and post-treatment).</description>

    <description>Scores ranged from 0 (no correct answers) to 72 (12 stimuli remembered twice in each session: firstly, in a immediate recall after learning, and secondly, in a delayed recall after 10 minutes).

    <time_frame>Measures were recorded during 3 sessions administered in 1 week before (pre-baseline) and during 3 sessions after the treatment (post-baseline). In the control group, pre and post baselines were also recorded but without any treatment between them</time_frame>
    <description>After the recall of the material, patients were also asked to remember which modality corresponded to each recall (i.e., seen, heard or imagined), and who had presented the material during the learning session (i.e., the therapist or themselves).
Scores ranged from 0 (if all answers were non-responses) to unlimited number (depending on number of confabulations produced by patients).
The values in the table represent the mean of errors in source attribution for each group (Neuropsychological treatment or No treatment) in the 3 sessions at each baseline (pre- and post-treatment).</description>

    <description>Participants had to learn some brief material (words, faces, pictures, news), after which they were asked for an immediate and a delayed recall. After both recalls, participants were confronted with feedback about correct responses, non-responses and errors (i.e., confabulations and errors of attribution). This type of feedback worked on: 1) selective attention during the learning phase, training patients to focus on the relevant details of the stimuli; 2) monitoring processes during the retrieval phase, reinforcing the strategic search and training patients to inhibit traces that were irrelevant; and 3) memory control processes after the retrieval phase. The treatment consisted of 9 sessions and lasted for 3 weeks and the participants performed a baseline before and after treatment.</description>

        <description>The confabulations recorded were 1) guessed answers, 2) confusions in time and space, 3) a mixture of two or more stimuli presented, and 4) devised or bizarre responses.
Scores ranged from 0 (no confabulations) to unlimited number of them (because devised or bizarre responses were recorded) and consisted of the sum of all the confabulations produced during the baseline. The values in the table represent the mean of confabulations for each group (Neuropsychological treatment or No treatment) in the 3 sessions at each baseline (pre- and post-treatment).</description>
        <time_frame>Measures were recorded during 3 sessions administered in 1 week before (pre-baseline) and during 3 sessions after the treatment (post-baseline). In the control group, pre and post baselines were also recorded but without any treatment between them</time_frame>
        <population>We used preliminary data from the first 5 patients using the G*Power software to calculate the sample size. From them, to detect differences through a Student t-test considering the significance level is 5%, the sample size was estimated in 7 subjects per group with an alpha of 0.95. We expanded to 10 to ensure greater power.</population>
