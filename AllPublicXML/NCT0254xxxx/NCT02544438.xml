      A Phase I/IIa, open-label, uncontrolled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Astarabine (BST-236) as single agent in patients with refractory or relapsed Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, Phase I/IIa, open-label, uncontrolled, single-center, single arm study
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Astarabine given intravenously (I.V.) in escalated
      doses for 6 days for cycle in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or ALL who are more
      than 18 years of age. Patients will be screened for eligibility based on existing records
      and/or specific laboratory examinations performed for the screening process.

      Patients will be gradually enrolled into 4 subsequent cohorts of escalating drug doses:

      Cohort # Astarabine Dose Number of Patients

        1. 0.5 gr/m2 (0.3 age&gt;50) 3

        2. 1.5 gr/m2 (0.8age&gt;50) 3

        3. 3.0 gr/m2 (1.5 age&gt;50) 3

        4. 4.5 gr/m2 (2.3 age&gt;50) 6

        5. 4.5 gr/m2 (no age limit) 3 up to 6

        6. 6 gr/m2 (no age limit) 3 up to 6

      Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined in case 2 subjects will experience a dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT)

             chemotherapy and/or salvage therapy.

             II. 2nd relapse III. Relapse following autologous or allogeneic stem cell
             transplantation. B. patients which at the physician discretion are not eligible for

             documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.

          2. Patients with compromised pulmonary function who needs oxygen therapy.

          3. Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would
             compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation,
             follow up, or interpretation of study results.

          4. Patients who have had chemotherapy (except for hydroxyurea), biologic therapy,
             immunotherapy, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of induction therapy or 4 weeks of
             consolidation or intensive therapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to

          7. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.

          8. Patients with prior malignancy are eligible; however, the patient must be in remission
             from the prior malignancy and have completed all chemotherapy and radiotherapy at
             least 6 months prior to registration and all treatment-related toxicities must have
             resolved.

          9. Leptomeningeal/ central nervous system involvement with AML; a lumbar puncture does
             not need to be performed unless there is clinical suspicion.

             be greater than 3 months.

         16. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Astarabine/Ara-C.

         17. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Astarabine/Ara-C are agents with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with Astarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with Astarabine.

         18. known history of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B or C

         19. Concurrent use of the following medications: Digoxin, Gentamycin, fluorocytosine,
             L-asparginase, any drugs or supplements that interfere with blood clotting can raise
             the risk of bleeding during treatment with Ara-C. These include: vitamin E,
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, warfarin, ticlopidine,
             clopidogrel.
