  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is the major type of diabetes in the young. The pathophysiology still needs
      clarification in order to reach feasible means of preventing the disease. This study aims in
      defining the differences in pancreatic and intestinal blood flow between subjects with and
      without type 1 diabetes and validating the methodology to achieve this. Earlier animal
      studies have demonstrated changes in pancreatic islet blood flow using microspheres. The aim
      of this study is to test and validate a method for the assessment of islet perfusion in
      humans using molecular imaging. The investigators hypothesize that glucose-stimulated
      pancreatic perfusion is enhanced specifically in islets in healthy subjects and that this
      increase is mostly suppressed in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging technique, which can be used to
      study flow and metabolism of different organs. Using radiowater ([15O]H2O) and PET, cellular
      perfusion can be measured directly and noninvasively. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic
      resonance imaging (DWI) has also been applied as a complimentary method for the assessment to
      quantitate changes in pancreatic blood flow.

      In the study 10 healthy subjects and 10 subjects with type 1 diabetes will be imaged on two
      separate days. Pancreatic and intestinal perfusion are first measured with [15O]H2O and
      combined PET/magnetic resonance imaging before and 5 and 15 minutes after intravenous glucose
      infusion. On the second day, PET imaging is replaced by dynamic DWI conducted in the same
      time schedule and with intravenous glucose stimulation.
