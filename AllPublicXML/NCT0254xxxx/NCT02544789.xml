    <textblock>
      Outcomes for children with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are
      dismal. Therefore, the investigators performed this multicenter, phase II study to evaluate
      the efficacy and , safety and pharmacokinetic of clofarabine in Chinese pediatric patients
      with R/R ALL

    <description>Clofarabine (Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, Zhejiang, China) was administered intravenously at 52 mg/m2 over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days. During the first two induction cycles, patients who did not achieve an objective response were taken off the study, and responsive patients continued to receive consolidation for a maximum 11 cycles if non-hematological toxicity was grade 2 or less.</description>
