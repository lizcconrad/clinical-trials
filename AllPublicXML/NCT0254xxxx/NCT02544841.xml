      The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of the offer to participate in Safer Sex
      Intervention (SSI) (treatment) relative to the offer to participate in Female Sexual Health
      (control) on three self-reported sexual behaviors (condom use, other contraceptive use, and
      frequency of sex) six months after the end of treatment.

      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) will be evaluating the Safer Sex Intervention (SSI). The
      Safer Sex Intervention is based in Social Cognitive Theory, the Transtheoretical Model of
      Behavior Change, and motivational interviewing. Coupled with skill-building exercises, the
      intervention is intended to increase knowledge related to risk and safe-sex behaviors, to
      increase awareness of risk and need for behavior change, to help build self-efficacy to
      engage in safe-sex behaviors, and, ultimately, to motivate participants to engage in and
      maintain safe sex practices. The intervention is meant to be delivered in four, one-on-one
      sessions over the course of six months. Each session is to be conducted in a private setting
      by a female health educator trained in motivational interviewing and Safer Sex Intervention.
      The initial or primary intervention session should take approximately 30 to 50 minutes.
      Subsequent &quot;booster sessions&quot; delivered 1, 3, and 6 months following the initial session are
      to take 10 to 30 minutes. Booster sessions are intended to sustain any resulting behavior
      change. The control (counterfactual) condition, Female Sexual Health, was developed
      specifically for use in this study; it consists of a 30-minute PowerPoint presentation,
      intended to be delivered in one face-to-face session that provides information about
      reproductive anatomy and STIs. After the presentation, participants receive free condoms.
      This is the only session for the control condition; there are no booster sessions. Though
      there were some variations in consent requirements across sites, there were no differences in
      the recruitment process between the treatment and control groups. All eligible individuals
      who provided the proper consent to participate were randomized and enrolled into the study at
      the time they attended their first scheduled study session. Data were collected via
      self-administered questionnaires that were scheduled at baseline and six months post
      treatment (12 months after baseline). The study took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, at five
      clinics that served young women between the ages of 14 and 19.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Two questionnaire items measuring consistency of condom use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The risk outcome is operationalized as the proportion of times in the past three months a person reports having any type of sex without using a condom. The measure is calculated from the following items on the Outcome Questionnaire administered 6 months after the program ends:
In total, how many times have you had any type of sex in the past 3 months?
Now, think about the number of times that you had any type of sex in the past 3 months. How many of those times did you use condoms? The resulting variable is a continuous proportion with values that range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that a person has not engaged in sex without a condom in the past three months, and 1 indicates that the person has engaged in sex without a condom 100% of the times they had sex in the past three months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Two questionnaire items measuring consistency of contraceptive use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The risk outcome is operationalized as the proportion of times a person reports having sexual intercourse without using any form of birth control (including condoms). The measure is calculated from the following items:
In total, how many times have you had sexual intercourse in the past 3 months?
In the past 3 months, how many times have you had sexual intercourse without using any of these methods of birth control (options listed)?
The measure is calculated by dividing the total number of times a person reported having sexual intercourse without using any contraception by the total number of times she reported having sexual intercourse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One questionnaire item measuring frequency of sexual activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The risk outcome is operationalized as the number of times in the past three months a person reports having any type of sex.
The measure is taken directly from the following item:
â€¢ In total, how many times have you had any type of sex in the past 3 months?
The variable is continuous, with values ranging from 0 to k, where 0= no sexual activity reported in past 3 months and k = number of times sex reported.</description>
