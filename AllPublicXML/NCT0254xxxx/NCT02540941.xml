  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will extract single cells and analyze the molecular composition of single
      cells as well as bulks using the latest protocols for single cell and bulk genomics analyses
      including genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses using the latest
      available protocols. A broad list of such example protocols are listed below.

      The samples and their molecular characterization (including sequencing &amp; molecular levels)
      will serve as the basis for development of methods for single cells analysis. The developed
      methods are aimed at genomic transcriptomic, epigenetic, or proteomics analysis of single
      cells and share the same structure: the measured feature will be translated to a DNA library
      which will represent the feature by a dedicated assay.

      This library alongside with proper mathematical analysis of the sequencing results will be
      performed in order to conclude the desired feature. The general structure of such protocols
      is described in our review paper (Single-cell sequencing-based technologies will
      revolutionize whole-organism science, E. Shapiro, T. Biezuner &amp; S.Linnarsson, Nature Reviews
      Genetics 14, 618-630, 2013) which is attached to our proposal.

      In addition, the researchers will use sequencing based methods (existing and future
      developed) in order to compare single cells and bulks from different tissues and/or different
      time points from the same donor in order to measure genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and
      proteomic diversity.

    <description>Individual cells samples from multiple tissues, possibly at multiple time points, will be characterized using advanced single-cell genomics protocols. The genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of the cells will be measured. Genomic signatures will be used to establish lineage relations among cells. Transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures will be used to characterize cell type and functional state. Statistical analysis will be performed to characterize cell type and state variability and its correlation with lineage relations, tissue of origin and donor age. Bulk samples will be analyzed as controls, as well as for comparing the information gleaned from single-cell analysis to that obtained solely by bulk analysis.</description>

        We will obtain human single and bulk cells from healthy donors. Volunteers will be sperm
        donors who shall designate part or full donation to the proposed research. Egg donors who
        shall designate part of the eggs to the proposed research; for women who come to the
        clinics of fertility problems. Reaching the donors will be using advertisements in sperm
        banks and in women's health centers or asking for student volunteers.
