  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few data regarding anti-anginal effects between beta-blockers with and without
      vasodilating property. Beta-blocker without vasodilating property is generally known to have
      unfavorable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the investigators compared
      carvedilol and atenolol on anti-anginal and metabolic effects in patient with stable angina
      pectoris.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-blockers are effective in reducing not only
      ischemia but also cardiovascular mortality following myocardial infarction. And, recent
      guidelines have suggested the potential for use of beta-blockers as first-line agents in
      chronic stable angina. However, beta-blockers are a diverse class with different mechanisms
      of action and physiological effects. Various pharmacologic properties that characterize
      beta-blockers include cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and concomitant
      vasodilating alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, which might exhibit differential anti-anginal
      efficacies. In addition, traditional beta-blockers, particularly nonvasodilating
      beta-blockers, have been reported to have negative metabolic effects, including
      hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. These unfavorable effects of
      beta-blockers should be considered in patients with stable angina pectoris, because the
      pathophysiology of coronary artery disease is associated with abnormalities in glucose and
      lipid metabolism. Carvedilol, a newer vasodilating beta-blocker, has been shown to differ
      from traditional beta-blockers in terms of metabolic effects in patients with hypertension
      and diabetes. However, few data regarding comparative anti-anginal and metabolic effects
      between beta-blockers with and without vasodilating property have been reported, particularly
      in patients with angina pectoris. In this study, we simultaneously compared anti-anginal and
      metabolic effects of carvedilol and atenolol in patients with stable angina pectoris.
