    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how much warfarin gets into the blood stream and how
      long it takes the body to get rid of it when given both with and without lanabecestat.
      Another purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of warfarin therapy to prevent blood clots
      when given with lanabecestat by measuring international normalized ratio (INR). INR measures
      the time it takes for blood to clot and compares it to an average. Information about any side
      effects that may occur will also be collected. The study will last about 5 weeks from the
      first dose to follow-up for each participant.
