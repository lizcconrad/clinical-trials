    <textblock>
      The investigators will use multiple methods (including Oxytocin intranasal inhalation,
      neuroimaging, behavioral measures, peripheral hormone measurements) to examine how
      individuals' behavior, cognition, and brain function is impacted by the neuro-hormone
      Oxytocin. Specifically, the investigators plan to evaluate the influence of Oxytocin
      administration on affective processing in non-trauma exposed and trauma-exposed adults (both
      with and without posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD).

      The investigators will use multiple methods (including Oxytocin intranasal inhalation,
      neuroimaging, behavioral measures, peripheral hormone measurements) to examine how
      individuals' behavior, cognition, and brain function is impacted by the neuro-hormone
      Oxytocin. Specifically, the investigators plan to evaluate the influence of Oxytocin
      administration on affective processing in non-trauma exposed and trauma-exposed adults (both
      with and without posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD). The investigators expect oxytocin
      (compared to placebo) to positively influence affect processing in healthy subjects, as well
      as among those diagnosed with PTSD. Given current literature, the investigators expect
      oxytocin to elevate the processing\perception of positive-related stimuli, and reduce the
      salience of aversive or un-pleasant cues. The investigators expect oxytocin to impact
      participants' brain function as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      while visually processing social and affect-related stimuli, rendering brain function and
      affective processing to be &quot;more typical&quot; or &quot;adaptive&quot; compared to placebo. Oxytocin's
      effect on human repertoire is not necessarily direct, but can interact with the individual's
      socioemotional characteristics, early life environment, and psychiatric symptoms. Therefore,
      the investigators will incorporate measures that capture the various dimensions that likely
      shape the effect of oxytocin.

    <description>Change in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast signal in regions of interest relevant to fear/threat (e.g., decrease in amygdala activation) and reward processing (increase in ventral striatum activation) in oxytocin versus placebo sessions. Expect this change across tasks with different types of stimuli (auditory, tactile). The fMRI data will be analyzed using signal processing and multivariate statistical techniques within a combination of commercially available (Brain Voyager QX, Analyze) and in-house software. Group differences will be evaluated using standard regression and general linear model approaches. Research hypotheses concerning the effect of exogenous oxytocin on neuro-affective processing will be tested using repeated-measures ANOVA or ANCOVA, linear regression models, and correlational analysis.</description>
