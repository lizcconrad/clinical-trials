  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the contract-relax technique of
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, and the static stretching exercise are effective
      in reducing the frequency, intensity and duration of headache and in improving the perception
      of quality of life in women with migraine.
