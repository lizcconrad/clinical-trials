      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter parallel group
      study assessing the effects of rosuvastatin 20 mg treatment for 104 weeks on the change in
      intimamedia thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA), carotid bulb, and internal
      carotid artery (ICA) in adult Chinese subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis.
