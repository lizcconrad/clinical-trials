    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, open-label study will evaluate the immune response to vaccines
      (tetanus toxoid [TT]-containing adsorbed vaccine, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide
      vaccine [23-PPV] either unboosted or boosted with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      [13-PCV], influenza vaccine, keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH]) after administration of a dose
      of ocrelizumab (OCR) in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).
