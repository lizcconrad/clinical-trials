  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigational product , the active ingredients which has been proven to
      reduce postprandial glucose in healthy and diabetic patients, will be tested. The primary aim
      of this clinical study is to evaluate the possibility of the investigational product to
      reduce the rise of postprandial glucose AUC level in overweight Caucasian subjects with
      normal to prediabetic biomarkers (IFG/HbA1C), without prompting a disproportionate rise in
      insulin levels.
