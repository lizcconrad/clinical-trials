  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether external neuromodulation using transcranial
      electrical stimulation (TES) can reduce the perception of self-motion that is experienced by
      patients with MdDS. Mal de debarquement is translated as the &quot;sickness of disembarkment,&quot; and
      refers to the chronic feeling of rocking dizziness that occurs after exposure to passive
      motion. A similar form of rocking dizziness can be experienced without a motion trigger in
      individuals with certain risk factors.

      Treatment for MdDS is limited and morbidity is high.The goal of the study is to determine
      whether TES can suppress the rocking dizziness of MdDS either as a standalone therapy or as
      an adjunctive therapy to other forms of neuromodulation such as transcranial magnetic
      stimulation. The investigators will determine the optimal treatment duration and stimulation
      parameters.

      Eligible participants who meet study criteria and pass the safety screen will be invited to
      participate in the study. If TES is used as add-on treatment to repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), the training for TES application will be done on-site. However,
      in a portion of the study that does not involve rTMS, remote training will be performed via a
      webcam provided that a suitable &quot;Study Buddy&quot; is available to assist the participant.

      Participants will maintain web-based diaries of their symptoms for up to four weeks prior to
      treatment with TES. Before the actual treatment sessions are started, the subjects will
      complete baseline questionnaires online which will be repeated once a week for up to 12
      weeks. Over the course of the study, the subjects will also keep a daily log of their
      sessions such as how many sessions they performed, for how long, and whether they had any
      side effects with each session.

      The studies will include a sham arm, allocated at a ratio of 1:1. On-site studies will
      involve the application of EEG, MRI, balance, cognitive, and visual/auditory stimulation
      tests.

    <description>The participant will perform real TES. The forms of TES used in this study will include transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). Each stimulation session will last for 20-minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The participant will perform sham TES for 20-minutes. The form of sham TES will depend on the active arm, e.g. if tACS is on the active arm, then the sham tACS will be a different frequency of stimulation. If tDCS is the active arm, then a short ramp up of tDCS followed by a ramp down (about 60-seconds) will be used as the sham arm.</description>
