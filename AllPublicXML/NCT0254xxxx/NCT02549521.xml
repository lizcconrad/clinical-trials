  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium and vitamin D substitution has for a long time been used to improve osteoporosis.The
      main storage place for magnesium is in the bone. Magnesium is direct under calcium in the
      periodic system making it possible to interact with the crystal structure. Some small studies
      have shown beneficial effects of magnesium substitution on osteoporosis. Evidence has shown
      improvement with calcium, alcohol, fruit and vegetable nutrients on bone loss. It has been
      uncertain however, which of these factors can contribute to such a change. The effect of
      magnesium substitution 240 mg daily as therefore studied in two parallel groups where both
      received calcium carbonate 1000 mg/day and cholecalciferol 10 ug/day, one got placebo and the
      other received magnesium. This was studied on various expressions for bone metabolism after
      zero, seven and 28 days in elderly females aged 70 years old.

    <textblock>
      Elderly 70 year old ladies who had been to an outpatient X-ray investigation were invited to
      participate in this study. They were all healthy without any signs of osteoporosis, or
      fractures.They were stimulated to participate by having done bone density measurements free.
      Patients who had used biphosphonates, oestrogens, glucocorticoids , diuretics,
      immunomodulating agents, or prolonged use of heparin were excluded.

      Patients with possible secondary osteoporosis due to primary hyperthyroidism or chronic lung
      disease were also excluded. The participants were randomized into placebo or Mg-treatment
      groups. They were seen by the dietician, and blood and urine samples were taken at day 0, 7
      and 28 at the same time these days. Medicine was prepacked for intake twice daily. They
      received medicine for 30 days and should only take for 28 days. The number of tablets which
      should be left was controlled the last day. The participants were informed about the results
      of the bone density measurements taken the first and the last day. All the patient contacts
      were undertaken by the same dietician.
