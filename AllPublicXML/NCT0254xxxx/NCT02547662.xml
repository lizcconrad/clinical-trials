    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pomalidomide, ixazomib citrate, and dexamethasone work
      in treating patients with previously treated multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia.
      Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide and dexamethasone, use substances made from living
      organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer
      cells from growing. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pomalidomide, ixazomib citrate, and dexamethasone
      together may be more effective in treating multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the confirmed response rate (&gt;= partial response [PR]) of ixazomib citrate
      (ixazomib), used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with
      previously treated multiple myeloma (MM) with extramedullary disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities associated with ixazomib in combination with pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone in patients with previously treated MM with extramedullary disease.

      II. To determine the differential response rates (biochemical versus extramedullary disease)
      with ixazomib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously
      treated MM with extramedullary disease.

      III. To determine the progression free survival following treatment with ixazomib in
      combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously treated MM with
      extramedullary disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negative
      status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, pomalidomide PO on days
      1-21, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for up to 3
      years.

    <description>A confirmed response is defined as a patient who has achieved a stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (PR), or PR on two consecutive evaluations. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

The biochemical response rate will be estimated by the number of responders divided by the number of evaluable patients who have measurable disease by serum M-protein, urine M-protein, or serum FLC assay at baseline. Exact binomial confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>
