      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic dose proportionality of 50 μg
      and 100 μg Clonidine and comparative bioavailability of clonidine with that from the
      Reference drug, Catapres® 100 μg oral tablets following single dose administration in healthy
      subjects.

      A single blind, randomised, 3-period, 3-sequence single-dose crossover study to determine the
      pharmacokinetic dose proportionality of Clonidine MBT 50 μg and Clonidine MBT 100 μg and
      comparative bioavailability of clonidine from the Reference drug, Catapres® 100 μg oral
      tablets following single dose administration in healthy male and female subjects.

      36 subjects will be randomised for 30 to complete the study. The study will comprise of 3
      Treatment Periods (1, 2 and 3) and a post study follow up (7 - 12 days after the last dose).
      Study drug will be administered on the morning of Day 1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples
      will be collected for each of three treatment periods. Safety will be evaluated at specified
      times throughout the study. There will be at least 7 days between dose administrations.
