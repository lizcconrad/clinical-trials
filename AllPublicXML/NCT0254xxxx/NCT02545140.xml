  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of PRE-STARt Phase 1 is to pragmatically evaluate and refine a risk
      assessment tool to identify those children with chronic disease risk factors (including Type
      2 Diabetes).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected in 5 European Commission countries (500 adolescents in total). A range
      of biological and lifestyle measures will be collected in order to investigate the
      adolescent's lifestyle and will include body weight and other anthropometric measurements,
      blood pressure, blood capillary sample, self-reported physical activity, sedentary behaviour
      and dietary habits. Their parent/guardian will complete a number of questions to gather
      information about variables that have been associated with chronic disease (including type 2
      diabetes) and include peri-natal history (birth weight, gestational diabetes), socioeconomic
      status, family health and medical history.

      A draft risk tool to identify those children with a 'higher risk' of developing type 2
      diabetes in the future has been developed systematic review results and a Delphi procedure.
      This draft tool will be evaluated and refined. This draft risk tool will be evaluated by
      independent clinical reviewers against the data collected from the 500 adolescent data sets.
      The results for each adolescent will be independently reviewed by clinicians who will assign
      either a &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;higher&quot; risk to each case. The results will be compared to the results
      from the draft 'PRE-START tool', used to further refine this identification tool using
      appropriate statistical methods.

      The outputs of this study will be a fit for purpose 'PRE-STARt tool' that can be used for
      recruitment to interventional studies whose primary objective is to reduce the risk of
      developing chronic disease (including type 2 diabetes) in the future.

    <description>A draft risk tool to identify those children with a 'higher risk' of developing type 2 diabetes in the future that has been developed systematic review results and a Delphi procedure. Each adolescent will complete a diet and lifestyle questionnaire about their physical activity, sedentary behaviour and dietary habits and the parent/guardian will complete a questionnaire about their family health history and about their child's early years (including gestational period, birth weight, whether they were breast or bottle fed). This draft tool will be evaluated and refined using these data and the data from the assessments mentioned in 1-9. The draft risk tool will then be refined based on data from the 500 adolescents using appropriate statistical methods resulting in an externally validated risk tool that can be used to screen young people aged between 12-14 years for being at risk of developing of type 2 diabetes in the future.</description>
