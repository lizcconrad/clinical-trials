      To evaluate the safety, efficacy and deliverability of the Combo bio-engineered
      sirolimus-eluting stent versus the Nano polymer-free sirolimus- eluting stents in the
      treatment of patients with de novo stenotic lesions of native coronary artery.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial
      which plans to enroll 436 subjects. All subjects enrolled will be randomly assigned to the
      test group (n=218) and the control group (n=218). Subjects in the test group and the control
      group will receive Combo stents and Nano stents respectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinical evidence of asymptomatic or symptomatic ischemic heart disease,
             stable or unstable angina, old myocardial infarction;

          -  De novo lesions of native coronary arteries (lesions number ≤2);

             branch diameter &gt;2.5mm or graft lesions;

          -  Heavily calcified or tortuous lesions which cannot be successfully pre-dilated, and
             lesions which are not suitable for stent delivery and deployment;

          -  In-stent restenosis;

          -  Thrombotic lesion;

          -  Patients who had received any other stent in the past six months;

          -  Patients with acute or chronic renal dysfunction (defined as creatinine greater than
             2.0 mg/dl);

          -  Patients with cardiogenic shock, acute infection, known bleeding or coagulation
             disorder, or with a history of active gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcer, cerebral
             hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke within 6 months;

          -  Patients who are allergic to aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine, heparin,
             contrast agent, sirolimus, stainless steel , polymer, or with contraindication to
             aspirin or clopidogrel or ticagrelor;

          -  Patients who had previously received murine therapeutic antibodies and exhibited
             sensitization through the production of HAMA;

          -  Patients with a life expectancy less than 1year;

          -  Patients who had participated in another investigational drug or device trial that has
             not completed the primary endpoint;

          -  Patient who has received any organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ
             transplant;

          -  Patient is in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply with the requirements
             of the study protocol
