    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of secukinumab at Week 16
      based on psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 75 in subjects who had inadequate response
      to cyclosporine A.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved ≥ 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a combined assessment of a lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs; each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for a final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area * area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4). PASI 75 was defined as participants achieving &gt;= 75% improvement from baseline.</description>

PASI 90 was defined as participants achieving &gt;= 90% improvement from baseline. The IGA scale is static, i.e. it referred exclusively to the participant's disease at the time of assessment and did not compare with any of the participant's previous disease states at previous visits. The scores are: 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate and 4 = severe.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a ten item general dermatology disability index designed to assess health-related quality of life in adult participants with skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, acne and viral warts. It is a self-administered questionnaire which includes domains of daily activity, leisure, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment and school/work activities. Each domain has 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is a valid score also and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of all 10 responses. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment. A negative mean percentage change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved ≥ 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75)</title>
        <description>PASI is a combined assessment of a lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs; each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for a final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area * area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4). PASI 75 was defined as participants achieving &gt;= 75% improvement from baseline.</description>

          <description>PASI is a combined assessment of a lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, arms, trunk, legs; each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for a final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, erythema, induration and desquamation; scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area * area score weight of section (head: 0.1, arms: 0.2, body: 0.3, legs: 0.4). PASI 75 was defined as participants achieving &gt;= 75% improvement from baseline.</description>

It is a self-administered questionnaire which includes domains of daily activity, leisure, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment and school/work activities. Each domain has 4 response categories ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). &quot;Not relevant&quot; is a valid score also and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of all 10 responses. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment.
