    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of community health workers when added to routine care
      for patients with diabetes and high blood pressure in rural clinics in Chiapas, Mexico. It
      does so by recording information on adherence to therapy, blood pressure and blood sugar
      while a non-governmental organization working in Mexico trains and introduces a community
      health worker program.

      Compañeros en Salud (CES), an affiliate project of Partners in Health, has been working in
      the rural Sierra of Chiapas, Mexico since February 2012. CES works in partnership with the
      local Ministry of Health to rehabilitate and staff existing government primary care clinics.
      Each community's clinic is staffed by one CES project physician year-round. CES activities
      span the range of allopathic medicine, but the focus of the project is in the prevention,
      detection, diagnosis and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and
      hypertension. CES currently operates in several rural communities with catchment areas of
      approximately 1,500 - 2,500 people. Routine care for NCDs is based on national guidelines and
      consists of monthly in-clinic visits by primary care physicians.

      Over 9 months in 2014, CES will introduce a community health worker program called
      &quot;Acompañantes&quot; to its project communities to augment care of patients with NCDs. Acompañantes
      are lay health workers and members of the community who bridge the gap between project
      clinics and patients, improving understanding of NCDs, their treatments, and adherence to
      therapy. The introduction of Acompañantes to communities is planned in a
      once-every-three-months fashion, the most rapid roll-out logistically feasible for CES. The
      investigators' project will document their experience over this time, and for one year after
      introduction of the Acompañantes program to all four study communities, by documenting
      adherence to therapy, hemoglobin a1c, and blood pressure at every-three month intervals over
      this time frame.

    <description>All patients in the four study communities will receive the community health worker intervention provided by CES, as it is incorporated into the standard of care. However, they will receive the intervention at different points in time depending on which community they lived in, as community health worker programs can only be started at every-three-month intervals</description>
