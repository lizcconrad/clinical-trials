      Pelvic ultrasound is frequently performed in the ED in non-pregnant women to assess for
      ovarian pathology, though its use has not been described in the medical literature. This
      observational study aims to describe its use in clinical ED practice.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic ultrasound is frequently performed in the ED in non-pregnant women to assess for
      ovarian pathology. During the pelvic examination a transvaginal ultrasound probe is used to
      visualize ovarian size, determine echotexture, assess whether ovarian tenderness is present,
      and sometimes measure ovarian blood flow. Though pelvic ultrasound is used in the Hennepin
      County Medical Center ED routinely, there is a paucity of literature assessing it's utility.

      This observational study will help determine the usefulness of this imaging modality, and how
      often it changes management in clinical practice.

      Specifically, this study will attempt to determine how often transvaginal ultrasound
      identifies the structures of interest, and then will correlate these findings with the final
      ED diagnosis. If a formal ultrasound is obtained, the findings of the ED ultrasound will also
      be compared to the findings of the formal ultrasound.

      The treating physicians will be queried the diagnosis and management plans before and after
      the pelvic US to ascertain changes in management.

    <measure>Change in diagnosis before/after pelvic US</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours (or less, this will measure what occurs during an ED stay)</time_frame>
    <description>The treating physician will be queried the likelihood of EMERGENT and NON-EMERGENT ovarian pathology before and after pelvic US using the following scale: Definite, Probable, Possible, Very Unlikely. The ED tests reviewed before each of these judgements will be noted. EMERGENT is defined as ovarian torsion or tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). NON-EMERGENT is defined as all other causes, including ovarian cyst, ovarian mass, ovarian malignancy, adnexal mass). The clinician will also free text the most likely diagnosis. A change of two or more levels (eg definite to possible, definite to very unlikely, probable to very unlikely, or vice versa) will be assumed to be a significant change in diagnosis.</description>

    <description>The treating physician will choose from the following regarding the management plan before/after the pelvic US: outpatient referral to OB/GYN, formal pelvic US after bedside US, consult GYN in the ED, urgent/emergent operative intervention, None of the above. Any difference in management before/after pelvic US will be considered a significant change in management.</description>
