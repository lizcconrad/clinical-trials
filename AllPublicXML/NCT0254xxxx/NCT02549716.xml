  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the bioavailability of IV and PO acetaminophen in both blood and the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients following subarachnoid hemorrhage. The study will also
      compare the temperature and levels of inflammatory cytokines in both blood and CSF of
      patients treated with IV and PO acetaminophen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In individuals diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), fevers have been shown to have
      detrimental micro and macroscopic effects on the brain that can ultimately cause secondary
      brain injury. The anti-pyretic effects of oral acetaminophen have been studied in critically
      ill patients but no study has been able to compare these effects to the IV form of
      acetaminophen also known as OFIRMEV. The investigators wish to explore the notion that IV
      acetaminophen will be more effective than enteral acetaminophen in reducing the incidence of
      non-infectious fevers in critically ill patients. In addition, the investigators propose to
      study the levels of inflammatory cytokines after administration of IV or enteral
      acetaminophen, as well as, determine the incidence of vasospasm in SAH patients treated with
      IV acetaminophen. Currently, external ventricular drain (EVD) placement is the &quot;standard of
      care&quot; in patients who present with SAH and altered mental status/coma. The presence of an EVD
      allows for continuous sampling and removal of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) as necessary to
      alleviate dangerous elevations in intracranial pressure. This clinical scenario allows for a
      unique, continuous outlet to access the CSF, without placing patients at risk, and without
      further invasive procedures (i.e. repeated spinal taps). These samples of CSF can be assayed
      for levels of acetaminophen, as well as inflammatory markers of fever which include
      interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and thromboxane-2 (TXA-2), in patients selected
      to be given enteral or IV acetaminophen.

    <description>Patients in both IV and PO groups will have samples taken from their CSF and blood at the above times after acetaminophen is administered for the first time. They will then have additional samples taken every 24 hours following the time of first drug administration for 14 days. Patients will also have a sample collected every 35 hours (1 hour before the 6th loading dose) to determine the steady state level of acetaminophen.</description>

    <description>Patients in both IV and PO groups will have samples taken from their CSF and blood at the above times after acetaminophen is administered for the first time. They will then have additional samples taken every 24 hours following the time of first drug administration for 14 days. These samples will be examined to determine concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, and TXA-2 in both the CSF and blood. This will enable the team to determine if route of entry of acetaminophen plays a significant role in the level of inflammatory markers in critically ill patients.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 0-14 following diagnosis with subarachnoid hemorrhage.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the incidence of vasospasm in patients with SAH who receive 1g Q6 of IV acetaminophen starting on post-bleed day 0 and continuing for 14 consecutive days (typical vasospasm window). Clinical vasospasm will be defined as the presence of new focal neurological deficits (motor or speech deficits) that developed after SAH, a decrease in the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 2 or more points for &gt;6hrs, a new cerebral infarction unrelated to post-treatment (coiling or clipping) complications, re-bleed, progressive hydrocephalus, electrolyte or metabolic disturbance, or infection. The incidence of clinical vasospasm will be identified in the patients EMR after the 14 day period.</description>
