    <description>In the telemedicine arm, all patients will be supported by Telemedicine protocol according to the development of telemedicine in the region.
The use of teleconsultation allows the couple expert doctor / nurse expert to perform a complex of wound assessment consultation and / or chronic. The use of telemedicine allows for acts of telecare, when the nurse applicant sought a remote support of an expert nurse (under the responsibility of a doctor) for the realization of an act. The use of tele-expertise enables physicians to remotely bring special expertise to improve patient care.</description>

    <description>In the control arm, patient care depend on his home, as is currently the case:
If it is in the action zone of Cicat-LR network, then it will be supported by an expert nurse of the network that are physically visit the patient's home-lon is the protocols established by the network.
If not, then it will be supported by the customs of the attending physician and nursing teams who follow him.</description>
