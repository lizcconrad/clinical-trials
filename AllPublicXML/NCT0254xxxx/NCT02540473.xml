      Physicians in general are at risk for burnout, and this risk is heightened among women,
      particularly mothers. In a randomized design, central hypotheses in this study are that
      mothers who attend our 12-week Relational Psychotherapy Mothers Group (RPMG) intervention
      will show significantly greater decreases in stress, depression, burnout, and associated risk
      biomarker indices, as compared to comparison controls (who would meet in unstructured
      gatherings, for an hour a week for 12 weeks). Additionally the investigators hypothesize that
      the gains would be maintained three months after the intervention is completed.
