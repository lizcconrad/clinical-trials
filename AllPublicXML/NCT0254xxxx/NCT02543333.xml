      Validation of Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) in patients with asthma, in patients
      with acute asthma; an observational study in healthy participants and during patients'
      clinical investigation of broncho-reversibility in the asthma groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomised observational study to validate Structured Light Plethysmography in three
      groups of participants: those with stable asthma and those with acute asthma, who are
      undergoing routine clinical investigation of broncho-reversibility using spirometry. We will
      also observe a normal healthy group who will receive no clinical intervention. SLP data
      capture and spirometry (as part of the patients clinical care) will be performed before and
      after a Bronchodilator reversibility test which is part of the patients normal clinical care
      (except in the normal healthy group where no bronchodilator will be given). The data
      collected from this study will allow us to examine the effect of bronchodilators on breathing
      patterns in these patients and also compare breathing patterns in asthma patients to those in
      healthy individuals.

      The participant will wear a plain white t-shirt. Alternatively, the measurement can be taken
      on bare skin or with the participant (if female) wearing a plain material white bra. The
      participant is asked to sit down on a chair or lie down with their neck in a neutral position
      and their back as straight as possible in front of the SLP device (Thora-3Di, Pneumacare
      Ltd). The projector is lined up to project the grid of light over the participant's chest and
      upper abdomen. and will be instructed to perform a period of 5 minutes of tidal breathing,
      They will otherwise be asked to remain as still as possible throughout the measurement.
      During the sequence of breathing, thoracoabdominal wall movements will be captured by the
      device.

      participant on completion of their Bronchodilator Challenge within the Lung Function
      Department or clinic

      The SLP measurement is repeated on completion of their Bronchodilator reversibility test
      within the Lung Function Department or clinic.
