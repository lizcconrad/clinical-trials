  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the functional benefits of a myoelectric
      Elbow-Wrist-Hand orthosis for persons with upper limb paralysis caused by a cerebrovascular
      accident (CVA).

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the functional gains provided by a myoelectric
      Elbow-Wrist-Hand orthosis for CVA patients with hemiparesis. The subjects will be fit with
      the device, provided general training in the operation of the EMG-controlled technology, and
      then guided through a series of standard clinical outcome measures used routinely as part of
      stroke rehabilitation medicine. The outcome measures employed in this study include the
      Fugl-Meyer assessment, the Box and Blocks test, and a battery of common functional tasks and
      activities. These outcome measures will allow the researchers to approximate the changes in
      the subjects' ability to successfully perform functional tasks with and without the MyoPro
      device.
