  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the John Wayne Cancer Institute (JWCI) at Providence Saint John's Health
      Center (PSJHC) are trying to examine whether acupuncture reduces joint pain in patients being
      treated with aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer and whether the reduction in
      pain happens by lowering inflammation.

      The investigators propose to investigate the effect of acupuncture on patients experiencing
      joint pain from aromatase inhibitor therapy. The investigators will serially measure
      patient's symptoms and track current medications, joint pain, daily activities, fatigue, and
      quality of life. The investigators will collect peripheral blood at baseline, weeks 4 and 7,
      one week after the last acupuncture treatment and 4 weeks after the last acupuncture
      treatment. The investigators will study the samples collected at the five predetermined
      time-points to test for immune parameters, such as the innate and adaptive immune responses,
      as well as the proliferative capabilities and pro-inflammatory mediators reflected in innate
      and adaptive functional immune responses.

    <description>Based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, investigators will use the systemic treatment methods (full body treatment with the joint specifications). Every patient will receive the standard protocols of these points uniformly regardless of their symptoms. The only variable will be the location of placement of the four electrodes (two positive charges and two negative charges) to the needle points at the most painful joints bilaterally. Needles will be in place a total of 45 minutes per session. The Thermal Design Power (TDP) infrared heat lamp will be applied concurrently to the most painful joint(s) for the entire 45 minutes. Acupuncture will be administered twice a week for 6 weeks, then once a week for an additional 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The standard textbook of Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion is the source for the name and location of the points for this study. A total of 38 points will be used, divided between two acupuncture sessions: 20 points or 37 locations in the supine position; 18 points or 36 locations in the prone position. Other than points governing vessel (GV) 20, conception vessel (CV) 6, CV 10, all points will be performed bilaterally.</description>
