  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study of fulvestrant in women scheduled
      for mastectomy or lumpectomy. Eligible subjects will be identified with breast cancer or
      DCIS. The first subject of each of five groups will receive fulvestrant intramuscularly. The
      subsequent 5 subjects of each group will receive fulvestrant by intraductal instillation. All
      subjects will be monitored for systemic and local adverse events during the procedure, and
      following the procedure until mastectomy or lumpectomy. Subjects that receive fulvestrant
      will undergo serial blood draws to determine fulvestrant blood concentration levels.
