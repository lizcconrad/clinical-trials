      Primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of sugar reduction (starting
      from glucose and sucrose, respectively) on postprandial glycemic response to apple juice by
      comparing the reference food item apple juice (control) with the test product (apple juice
      with low sugar content) in male humans with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (5.6-6.9mmol/l
      resp. 100-125mg/dL) (Kerner and Brückel, 2012 (DDG recommendation)) Secondary objective of
      this study is to investigate the effect of sugar reduction on postprandial insulinemic
      response.

      Exploratory objectives are to investigate further characteristics of postprandial glucose and
      insulin response and insulin sensitivity, gastrointestinal side effects and safety aspects.

      Objectives:

      Investigating the effect of sugar reduction in apple juice on glycemic and insulin response
      to ingestion of this drink.

      Subjects/Methods:

      In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with cross-over design 30 male
      adults with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) received an oral drink of 500mL: 1. Verum: Apple
      juice, treated (low sugar content); 2. Control: Untreated apple juice (normal sugar content).
      Capillary blood glucose and venous plasma insulin were measured twice at baseline and then at
      times 0 (start of drink), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min.

    <description>Each study participant consumed 500 mL test juice at the morning of the interventional day. The 500 mL bottle content had to be ingested within 5 minutes. an intravenous catheter was inserted into a forearm vein for blood withdrawal at baseline, directly before (time point 0) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after starting the ingestion of the test product. From all samples plasma insulin was measured. From the blood samples taken at baseline and 120 minutes after consumption of the test product safety parameters were determined. Capillary blood was taken from the finger pad using a HemoCue® Safety Lancet at baseline (twice) and once directly before (time point 0) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after ingestion of the test product.</description>
