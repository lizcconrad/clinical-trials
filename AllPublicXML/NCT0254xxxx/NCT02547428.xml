    <measure>Total Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items and is designed to reflect the participant's current ADHD symptomatology; the severity, frequency, and impairment are measured for each of the items. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Inattentiveness. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), with the total score for the rating scale ranging from 0 to 54. The scale is subdivided into 2 subscales of 9 symptoms each: hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness.</description>

    <measure>Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PERMP is a 10-minute, individual performance adjusted, math test that provides an objective measure of performance that is time-sensitive and ADHD medication-sensitive. Participants are given 5 pages of 80 math problems and are instructed to complete as many problems as possible in 10 minutes. Performance is measured by the PERMP, which is a permanent product score (the number of problems worked correctly and number of problems attempted). Total score, number of math problems attempted, and PERMP score for the number of math problems answered correctly will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is performed to rate the severity of a participant's condition on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1 (Baseline), Week 2, Week 3, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, and Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I permits a global evaluation of the participant's improvement over time. The CGI-I is a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The CGI-I is completed by the clinician and assesses the participant's improvement relative to the symptoms at Baseline.</description>

          2. Participant meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
             (DSM-5) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD, any presentation, established by a
             comprehensive psychiatric evaluation based on DSM-5 criteria with at least 5 of the 9
             subtype criteria met, as determined by the Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview
             for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)
             (CAADID Part II)

          3. Participant has a Baseline score of greater than or equal to 28 using the ADHD-RS-IV

          4. Participant has a minimum score of 4 on the CGI-S at Baseline

          5. Participant is functioning at an age-appropriate level intellectually, as judged by
             the Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has a current comorbid psychiatric disorder that is either controlled with
             medications prohibited in this study or is uncontrolled and associated with
             significant symptoms. Exclusionary conditions include any severe comorbid Axis II
             disorder or severe Axis I disorder (such as post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD],
             psychosis, bipolar illness, severe obsessive compulsive disorder, severe depressive or
             severe anxiety disorder) or other symptomatic manifestations that, in the opinion of
             the examining physician, will contraindicate CTN SR treatment or confound efficacy or
             safety assessments. Specifically, participants with mild to moderate forms of Axis I
             disorders (e.g., social phobia and dysthymia) may be included, whereas participants
             with a lifetime history of psychosis or bipolar disorder will be excluded. Comorbid
             psychiatric diagnosis will be established by a Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for
             DSM-5 Axis I Disorders (the Mini lnternational Neuropsychiatric lnterview, Version 6.0
             [M.I.N.I. 6.0]).

             previously made a suicide attempt, or those who are currently demonstrating active
             suicidal ideation as measured by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
             at Screening, or if in the opinion of the investigator the participant is considered a
             suicide risk. Participants who develop suicidal ideation or behavior during the trial
             as measured by the C-SSRS will be discontinued and followed appropriately.

          3. The participant has a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 or greater than or equal

             arrhythmia

          8. Participant has a history of significant bleeding or coagulation disorder and/or low
             platelet levels (less than 130 X 109/L) or increased international normalized ratio

         16. Participant has a known history of hypertension

         17. Participant exhibits lifestyle that may be confounding to safety or efficacy

         18. Participant has a known history of glaucoma

         19. Participant has failed to respond to 1 or more adequate courses (e.g., adequate dose
             and duration with poor response as judged by the Investigator) of stimulant therapy

         21. Participant is taking other medications that have central nervous system (CNS) effects
             or affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant
             sympathomimetic, or was recently on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (during or within 14
             days of investigational product [IP] administration). Stable use of bronchodilator
             inhalers is not exclusionary. This also includes use of any psychoactive prescription
             medication within 30 days prior to Screening or psychoactive over-the-counter (OTC)
             medication or herbal products that require more than a 7-day washout. Participants
             currently treated with methylphenidate or amphetamine products are permitted and will
             undergo a 7-day washout period. Participants who have taken atomoxetine will be
             required to undergo a 30-day washout.

         22. Participant requires the frequent or regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen

             (CYP) enzymes, including herbal products

         24. Participant has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) result at Screening or Baseline.
             NOTE: The UDS must be negative at Screening (with the exception of the participant's
             current ADHD psychostimulant, if applicable) or Baseline, if applicable, for the
             participant to potentially be eligible for study participation. The Investigator, in
             conjunction with the Medical Monitor, will evaluate the potential impact of a positive
             UDS regarding the continued participation of the participant.

         25. Participant has taken an investigational product or taken part in a clinical study
             within 30 days prior to Screening

         26. Investigational site personnel are not permitted to participate in the study

             Baseline, and be either postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea and greater than or equal to 51 years of age), surgically sterile and at
             least 6 weeks poststerilization or, for females of childbearing potential, have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to entering the study and agree to use acceptable
             methods of contraception

             Contraceptive Requirements

         33. Condoms are to be used with all forms of contraception (i.e., double-barrier method).
