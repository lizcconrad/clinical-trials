  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving medical compliance and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people with
      epilepsy (PWE) has become the focus of various treatment programs and behavioral
      interventions which continue to be challenging to both patients and health care
      professionals.

      In order to design an effective intervention on the management of epilepsy, the drug
      management of epilepsy by community health workers was evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants must have a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy for at least 6
             months, based on the clinical judgement of the investigators. Epilepsy is defined by
             two or more unprovoked seizures. Clinical history, electroencephalography, and imaging
             data are all instrumental in rendering a formal decision. The seizure type, frequency,
             or severity are not criteria for exclusion, although this information will be
             recorded.

          -  Patients must have a seizure frequency of at least two seizures in a 6 month period of
             time.

          -  Patients must be on at least one anti-epileptic medication.

          -  Patients must be able to report seizure frequency with either a paper or electronic
             diary.

          -  Patients must be able to read and understand either English or Hindi.

          -  Patients must be able to complete questionnaires and provide informed consent to this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures

          -  Severe depression, anxiety, or psychosis

          -  Recent problem with substance abuse.
