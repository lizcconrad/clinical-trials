        Eligible patients are ≥ 18 years old and have been treated with at least 2 doses of
        tolvaptan for one occurrence of hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH during 2014. If the number
        of patients treated with tolvaptan in 2014 in the participating centres is not sufficient
        to reach the intended sample size, this retrospective enrolment period could be extended to
        include patients treated in 2013.

        A mix of centres and treating departments (e.g. endocrinology, nephrology, etc.), will be
        selected within each participating country in order to provide a sufficiently
        representative sample of patients treated with tolvaptan for hyponatraemia secondary to
        SIADH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of patient informed consent unless a) not required by local regulations, b)
             it would take a non reasonable effort or c) if the source patient is deceased or
             untraceable.

          -  Female and/or male patients aged 18 years and over.

          -  Patients who received at least 2 doses of tolvaptan, for the treatment of one
             occurrence of hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient cannot take part in this study if participating in any other clinical study
             in which the medicinal product aims to treat the causes or symptoms of hyponatraemia
             at the time of the hyponatraemia episode being documented in the current study.
