  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schemas describe mental structures storing recurrent and organized pattern of information.
      Schemas may have a strong influence on the process of storing and retrieving new information
      into memory. Previous approaches in the cognitive neuroscience of memory have entirely
      focused on the individual dimension of preexisting schemas. In the real world though, much of
      the researchers' experiences and knowledge are collective or shared. Such social-cultural
      frameworks stored in collective memory may also reshape and reconfigure the construction of
      individual memories. Attempting to ascertain the influence of collective schema on the neural
      substrates of individual memories using cutting-edge brain imaging methods represents the
      challenge that MULTIBRAIN2 seeks to tackle. To achieve this goal, the researchers will record
      brain activity during MRI scanning sessions in a group of 24 participants while they are
      performing an encoding followed by episodic memory retrieval tasks on pictures of the World
      War II Memorial of Caen. This study will seek to identify brain areas of the prefrontal
      cortex encoding the organization of knowledge in collective memory using multivariate
      analyses of brain activity patterns, and then to understand how such regions might modulate
      the recruitment of the hippocampus during episodic memory retrieval using analyses of
      effective connectivity. The organization of knowledge in collective memory is measured in
      parallel through 1) the analysis of French social memory of World War II using a corpus of
      thousand of television and radio shows from the National Institute of Audiovisual, and 2) an
      internet task measuring the organization of shared individual knowledge about World War II.
      Once collected, these data will help us to understand how collective schemas may shape the
      organization of individual memories.
