    <textblock>
      Gay Poz Sex (GPS) is an HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program for HIV-positive
      gay and bisexual men, which takes place in a group counselling format. All participants
      provided written informed consent at the outset of the study. Eligible participants filled
      out a 1-hour computer-assisted self-interview questionnaire. Subsequently, participants
      attended seven 2-hour group sessions, led by 2 peer facilitators, who were HIV-positive gay
      men, in groups of 5-8 men. Immediately and 3 months following the completion of the GPS
      program, participants were scheduled to attend a 1-hour session to complete the same
      questionnaire package. Participants received an honorarium and a list of community resources,
      including mental health or substance use counseling services, at the end of each assessment.
      Participants also participated in a program evaluation interview at the 3-month follow-up
      assessment.
