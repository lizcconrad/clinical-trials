        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Female over 18 years

             pumping session

          -  The participant is pumping at least 2 times a week

          -  The participant is 1-6 months after giving birth (postpartum) at the day of data
             assessment

             start of the pumping sessions

          -  The participant agrees that the pumped breast milk cannot be fed to her infant (will
             be disposed)

          -  The participant agrees to photograph and video record the breast and upper body (no
             face)

          -  The participant agrees to the presence of up to 3 men in the room during the pumping
             session

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participant or their baby is dependent on life-sustaining electric devices (e.g. heart
