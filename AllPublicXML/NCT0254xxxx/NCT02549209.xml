      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center phase II study for subjects with measurable
      advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer using pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel chemotherapy. As this combination of agents has not been tested in this
      subject population, the first six subjects enrolled will constitute a safety run-in cohort.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      To ensure the safety of this combination treatment, an initial safety run-in will be
      conducted for the first 6 subjects. This initial cohort of 6 subjects will be enrolled and
      treated with standard doses as described below. Based on toxicity analysis of the initial 6
      subjects following completion of 18 weeks of treatment, it will be determined if an extended
      safety run-in period would be beneficial.

      In the absence of receiving any prior therapy, eligible subjects will be treated as follows
      on D1 of cycles lasting 21 days (3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 cycles:

        -  Pembrolizumab 200mg will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion every
           3 weeks.

        -  Paclitaxel will be dosed at 175mg/m2 and be administered as a 3-hour continuous IV
           infusion.

        -  Carboplatin will be dosed at area under the curve (AUC) of 6 and given as an IV infusion
           in 250ml of D5W over 30 minutes.

      Subjects who have had prior radiotherapy/platinum-based chemotherapy must initiate paclitaxel
      and carboplatin at the following reduced dose levels if they have had prior external
      radiotherapy involving the whole pelvis or abdomen or over 50% of their spine, and/or prior
      platinum-based chemotherapy for this, or any other cancer. Eligible subjects will be treated
      as follows on Day 1 (D1) of cycles lasting 21 days (3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 cycles:

        -  Pembrolizumab 200mg administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks.

        -  Paclitaxel will be dosed at 135mg/m2 and be administered as a 3-hour continuous IV
           infusion.

        -  Carboplatin will be dosed at an AUC of 5 and given as an IV infusion in 250ml of D5W
           over 30 minutes.

      Subsequent doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin may be escalated to the higher doses as
      indicated above, provided these subjects do not exhibit hematologic or nonhematologic
      toxicity &gt; Grade 1, except alopecia.

      The following laboratory values must be obtained within 14 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9 g/dL (without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency within
           7 days of assessment)

        -  Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine or measured/calculated creatinine clearance (as calculated by institutional
           standard) ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limits of normal (ULN) OR ≥60mL/min for subjects
           with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x institutional ULN

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for
           subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase
           (ALP) &lt; 2.5 x ULN OR ≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver metastases

        -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL

      Coagulation (Blood Clotting) Tests:

        -  International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject
           is receiving anti-coagulant therapy as long as partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is
           within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants

        -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving
           anti-coagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use
           of anticoagulants

             1996 (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health information prior to
             registration for protocol therapy. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the
             informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 within 28 days
             prior to registration for protocol therapy.

             who have had definitive surgery for endometrial cancer (at least hysterectomy and
             bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Pathologic documentation of the recurrence is
             required if there is only a single site of disease on imaging and that site is less
             than 2cm. If a subject with recurrence is undergoing a biopsy for clinical indications
             and is willing and able, an optional collection of 3 frozen tissue cores of the
             recurrence site is requested for correlative analysis.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 and obtained by imaging within 28 days
             prior to registration for protocol therapy. Disease in an irradiated field as the only
             site of measurable disease is acceptable only if there has been clear progression
             since completion of radiation treatment.

          -  The subject must have recovered (&lt;/= grade 1) from the acute toxic effects of prior
             therapy. NOTES: Subjects may have received a single platinum-based cytotoxic
             chemotherapy regimen. Subjects having received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy must have
             completed their treatment more than 6 months prior to registration. Subjects may have
             received prior therapy with hormones or biologic agents, but such therapies must be
             discontinued at least 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy.

          -  The subject must have completed prior radiation therapy at least 28 days prior to
             registration for protocol therapy. NOTES: Subjects may have received prior radiation
             therapy for treatment of endometrial carcinoma. Prior radiation therapy may have
             included pelvic radiation therapy, extended field pelvic/para-aortic radiation
             therapy, and/or intravaginal brachytherapy. Chemotherapy used for radiation
             sensitization is allowed. Chemotherapy used for radiation sensitization will not count
             as second chemotherapy regimen.

          -  Subjects with recurrence, subjects must have a documented complete response upon
             completion of initial definitive therapy.

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has
             been disease-free for at least 5 years.

          -  Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential
             are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses
             for ≥1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with carcinosarcoma.

          -  Subjects who have a solitary central pelvic recurrence which can be curatively
             resected.

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to
             registration for protocol therapy or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to registration for protocol therapy and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior registration for protocol therapy. This exception
             does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical
             stability. NOTE: Subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT scan or
             brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis.

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days prior to registration for

             Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has received systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy
             within 7 days prior to registration for protocol therapy.

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Pulmonary conditions such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or
             hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or active,
             non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Evidence of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy with the exception of an
             uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy that is ≥ Grade 2 by CTCAE v 4 criteria.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 agent.
