  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, single-arm study is designed to evaluate clinical experience of
      participants (or caregivers) administering lebrikizumab at home in participants with asthma.
      Eligible participants will receive four doses of subcutaneous (SC) lebrikizumab every 4 weeks
      (q4w) up to Week 12. Primary analysis visit occurs at Week 13. After study treatment, all
      participants will complete a 12 week safety follow up. All participants will get training for
      the administartion of lebrikizumab using the device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18 to 75 years at Week -1

          -  Asthma diagnosis for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 12 months prior to Week -1

          -  Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of &gt;=40% predicted at
             Week -1 or Week 0 (Day 1; prior to entering treatment phase), based on an established
             spirometry reference equations

          -  Competent and willing, as determined by the investigator, to independently administer
             lebrikizumab at home. The investigator needs to confirm that the participant (or
             caregiver) will be able to follow the instructions to administer lebrikizumab

          -  Able and willing to take home the pre-filled syringes of lebrikizumab at the
             conclusion of Week 0 (Day 1) and store these according to the requirements highlighted
             within the Instructions for Use (IFU) document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to a biologic agent or
             known hypersensitivity to any component of the lebrikizumab injection

          -  Hospitalization for any reason, including acute exacerbation event, within 4 weeks
             prior to Week -1 or during the screening period

          -  Infection that required hopitalization, treatment with intravenous (IV) or
             intramuscular antibiotics within 4 weeks and oral antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to
             Week -1 or during screening

          -  Taken part in a previous clinical trial of lebrikizumab and discontinued from the
             trial prematurely or discontinued study drug prematurely due to an adverse event
