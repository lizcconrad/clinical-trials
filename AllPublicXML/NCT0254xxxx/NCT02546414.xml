      To validate the PC/SD ratio to be used to predict the variceal haemorrhage in Chinese
      patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatic cirrhosis.

      Esophageal variceal bleeding remains the leading cause of acute mortality in patients with
      cirrhosis. Using noninvasive parameters for high-risk variceal haemorrhage may reduce the
      need for endoscopies. The ratio of platelet count/diameter of the spleen (PC/SD ratio) is the
      principal noninvasive predictor of esophageal varices. This was an analytical cross-sectional
      study to validate the diagnostic test for HBV hepatic cirrhosis and was performed between
      January 2013 and August 2015. This study is to validate the PC/SD ratio to identification of
      those patients with high bleeding risk and selection for prophylactic treatment.

    <description>HBV hepatic cirrhosis with first esophageal varices haemorrhage were included and stratified using their Child-Pugh score. The platelet count were evaluated, and ultrasound was used to measure the longest diameter of the spleen. The platelet count(PC)/spleen diameter (SD)ratio was calculated and analyzed to determine whether it can predict the variceal haemorrhage. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used as the gold standard.</description>
