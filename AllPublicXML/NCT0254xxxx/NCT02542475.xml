      To assess the effects of daily LFMS treatments for those suffering from affective or anxiety
      symptoms. We hypothesize a reduction in affective and or anxiety symptoms after active
      treatment over the period of one week, with improvement through the following week.

      The Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) procedure is an application of a series of
      electromagnetic pulses to the brain. The field and timing parameters of the LFMS pulses, such
      as pulse timing, duration, frequency, and electric and magnetic field distribution and
      direction are different from other neurostimulation methods. LFMS electromagnetic fields are
      significantly weaker (&lt; 100x) than those used in ECT and rTMS.

      LFMS was discovered at McLean Hospital and has thus far been studied as an experimental
      antidepressant treatment at McLean Hospital. LFMS is also being studied at Massachusetts
      General Hospital and 5 other hospitals in an NIH sponsored trial (RAPID) as well as in
      studies at Cornell-Weill School of Medicine. The mechanism of action for the antidepressant
      effects of LFMS is hypothesized to be an interaction between the electromagnetic fields and
      neurons in cortical regions, brought about by low level electrical stimulation applied with
      particular timing.

      The current study proposes to assess the effects of daily LFMS treatments in participants
      suffering from affective disorders and/or anxiety. This is an open-label study. All subjects
      will receive active LFMS treatments. Potential subjects will be referred to the study by
      their clinicians and will be pre-screened by phone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be accepted into the study upon written referral by a McLean clinician
             or outside psychiatrist.

          2. Subjects will be men or women over the age of 18.

          3. Subjects must have failed at least one FDA approved treatment before enrolling in this
             study.

          4. Subjects must be capable of providing informed consent.

          5. Subjects must have either a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score &gt; 14
             indicating moderate depression or Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) score &gt; 18
             indicating moderate anxiety.
