    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, two-arm, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      that examine the effect of the consumption of a plant sterols-enriched low-fat milk. Half of
      the participants will consume of 1.5g of plant sterols daily as provided by two servings of
      the plant sterols-enriched low-fat milk product for 3 consecutive weeks, while the other half
      will consume placebo low-fat milk.

    <textblock>
      Plant sterols are the naturally occurring functional equivalent of mammalian cholesterol.
      Plant sterols differ structurally from cholesterol by a methyl or ethyl group in their side
      chains and are not synthesized by the human body. These structural differences render them
      minimally absorbable in the intestine. It has been consistently reported that dietary
      incorporation of plant sterols(1.5-2 g/day) reduces serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) levels with minimal adverse events. The hypochoelsterolemic effects of plant sterols
      is explained by an inhibition of cholesterol absorption, which is ascribed to a competition
      with intestinal cholesterol for incorporation into mixed micelles, although other possible
      mechanistic explanation have been proposed.
