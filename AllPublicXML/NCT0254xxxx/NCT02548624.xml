      The primary objective of the study is to examine the effectiveness of the Zephyr BioPatch in
      measuring position changes of a non-patient subject in a lab setting and to examine the
      effectiveness of the Zephyr BioPatch in measuring position changes of hospitalized patients.

    <description>The ZephyrLIFE Hospital System includes the BioPatch™ device (consisting of the BioModule™ sensor, BioModule™ holder, and snap ECG electrodes), the ECHO radio system, and a software monitoring interface. The BioModule™ sensor is a Class II device, 510(k) cleared by the FDA, and commercially available.
The ZephyrLIFE Hospital System stores, transmits and displays vital sign data including ECG, HR, RR, body orientation, and activity to caregivers via a central station.</description>

        The laboratory observation will consist of one non-patient subject (N=1). The hospital
        observation will consist of 18 patients (N=18) hospitalized at the Columbia University
        Medical Center on the general care floor at-risk for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. The
        hospitalized subjects will be stratified into three groups. Six subjects with normal BMI
        classification (18.5 -24.9), six with overweight BMI classification (25.0-29.9), and six
        with overweight BMI classification (30.0-39.9) will comprise the study sample.
