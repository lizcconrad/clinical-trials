  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta
      cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. This process is identified by circulating
      islet autoantibodies to beta cell antigens, and is mediated by a lack of immunological
      self-tolerance. Self-tolerance is achieved by T cell exposure to antigen in the thymus or
      periphery in a manner that deletes autoreactive effector T cells or induces regulatory T
      cells. Immunological tolerance can be achieved by administration of antigen under appropriate
      conditions. Administration of oral insulin in islet autoantibody-negative children who are
      genetically predisposed for T1D offers the potential for inducing immunological tolerance to
      beta cells and thereby protect against the development of islet autoimmunity and T1D.

      The purpose of the Pre-POINT-Early Study is to investigate and consolidate the finding from
      the preceding Pre-POINT Study, namely safety and immune efficacy at a daily dose of 67.5 mg
      oral insulin. Since younger children will be tested in Pre-POINT-Early, the 67.5 mg dose will
      be reached by dose escalation starting at 7.5 mg for 3 months followed by exposure to 22.5 mg
      for 3 months, and reaching the desired 67.5 mg dose, which is administered for 6 months in 22
      children.

      The active substance for oral application is human insulin, synthesized in a special
      non-disease-producing laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been
      genetically altered by the addition of the gene for human insulin production (Lilly
      Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). The physical, chemical and pharmaceutical
      properties of the human insulin have been well documented by the manufacturer. Oral Insulin
      will be applied as a capsule containing 7.5; 22.5 and 67.5 mg of the active substance
      together with filling substance cellulose. After oral administration insulin will be rapidly
      degraded by gastric acids. Enteric delivery and systemic availability is therefore unlikely
      and efficacy of active insulin is likely to be restricted to the oral mucosa.

      In human studies oral insulin administration was safe and without adverse side effects at
      doses between 2.5 and 7.5 mg per day. Additionally Bonifacio et al. have conducted and
      completed the Pre-POINT study, the first primary autoantigen vaccination dose-finding study
      in which children with high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes were administered insulin orally
      daily. Oral insulin at all tested doses (2.5 mg; 7.5 mg; 22.5 mg and 67.5 mg) in Pre-POINT
      was considered safe: None of the children who received study drug or placebo experienced
      hypoglycaemic episodes after administration of medication, and no allergic reactions were
      observed.

      The Pre-POINT-Early intended doses for oral application are 7.5, 22.5 and 67.5 mg per day.
      The aim of the study is to determine whether daily administration of oral insulin starting
      with dose 7.5 mg (3 months), moving to dose 22.5 mg (3 months) and to the highest dose of
      67.5 mg (6 months) insulin to young children aged 6 months to 2 years with high genetic risk
      for T1DM induces immune responses to insulin and/or proinsulin with features of immune
      regulation.

    <description>The primary outcome for immune efficacy is the activation of an immune response (antibody or CD4+ T cell) against insulin. Each participant will be categorized as reaching a response or not. A response is defined as a &gt;2-fold increase that reaches a stimulation index of &gt;3.0.</description>

    <description>An antibody response is defined as an increase from baseline of &gt;10 cpm in serum IgG binding to insulin from baseline to 12 months, or a positive salivary IgA binding to insulin at 12 months.</description>

    <time_frame>gene expression profile measurement on insulin-responsive CD4+ T cells at 12 months visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of responders in the insulin treated group will be compared with the number of responders in the placebo treated group. As secondary outcomes, responder status in individual measures of antibody response to insulin, CD4+ T cells response to insulin, and CD4+ T cell response to proinsulin will be compared between insulin treated and placebo treated groups. For a mechanistic secondary outcome, the proportion of insulin responsive and of proinsulin responsive CD4+ T cells that have a Treg gene expression profile, an IFNg profile, and the Treg/IFNg cell ratio will be compared between the insulin treated and placebo treated groups.</description>

    <description>Metabolic changes within two hours after receiving study drug.

At these visits, blood glucose concentrations will be measured at 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes after receiving study drug to determine whether the treatment induces hypoglycaemia which is defined as &lt;50 mg/dl (&lt;2.8 mmol/L).</description>
