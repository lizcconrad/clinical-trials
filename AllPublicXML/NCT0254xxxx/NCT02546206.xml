    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yoghurt on the development of
      gingival inflammation.

      Fifty-one periodontally healthy individuals were given standard oral hygiene instructions and
      randomly divided into two groups. The test group subjects (n=26) consumed probiotic yoghurt
      containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and the control subjects (n=25) natural
      yoghurt for 28 days. Following yoghurt consumption, mechanical plaque control was interrupted
      for the next 5 days in both groups. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples and clinical data
      (consisted of plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, bleeding on probing) were collected
      at baseline, after 28 and 33 days. Interleukin-1β levels were determined in GCF by ELISA.

      Probiotics are viable bacteria with scientifically confirmed health benefits for
      gastrointestinal system. However, there is paucity of information on its impact in
      periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic yoghurt
      on the development of gingival inflammation.

      Fifty-one periodontally healthy individuals were given standard oral hygiene instructions and
      randomly divided into two groups. The test group subjects (n=26) consumed probiotic yoghurt
      containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and the control subjects (n=25) natural
      yoghurt for 28 days. Following yoghurt consumption, mechanical plaque control was interrupted
      for the next 5 days in both groups. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples and clinical data
      (consisted of plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, bleeding on probing) were collected
      at baseline, after 28 and 33 days. Interleukin-1β levels were determined in GCF by ELISA.

    <description>Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3. (0 = No plaque in the gingival area. 1 = A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may only be recognized by running a probe across the tooth surface. 2 = Moderate accumulation of soft deposits within the gingival pocket, on the gingival margin and/or adjacent tooth surface, which can be seen by the naked eye. 3 = Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the gingival margin and adjacent tooth surface. Tendency to spontaneous bleeding.)</description>
