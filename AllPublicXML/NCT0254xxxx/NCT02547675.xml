  <brief_summary>

      To provide access to rociletinib for patients with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC
      who have been treated previously with EGFR directed therapy and have evidence of a T790M
      mutation (T790M+).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study in the US, which allows for expanded access to
      rociletinib for patients with advanced or metastatic, EGFR-mutant T790M+ NSCLC who were
      previously treated with at least one prior EGFR TKI therapy (â‰¥2nd line). Patients will
      receive oral rociletinib twice daily on study as long as they have clinical benefit and until
      they have access to FDA-approved rociletinib.
