      This study will evaluate several potential risk factors for postoperative delirium in cardiac
      surgery patients. The risk factors will include use of specific preoperative, intraoperative,
      and/or postoperative medications. Other risk factors investigated may include exposure to
      cardiopulmonary bypass, surgical technique, and or duration of surgery.

    <textblock>
      In order to understand the role of medication usage and/or cardiopulmonary bypass, the
      investigators propose to leverage the perioperative data warehouse (PDW), an IRB approved
      data registry, to retrospectively evaluate the subjects. All patient data available in the
      warehouse may be included in the review. At this time, there are approximately 750,000
      patients in the PDW. All data will be accessed retrospectively after the patient has been
      seen for their care here at Vanderbilt.

      The Vanderbilt Perioperative Information Management System (VPIMS) is part of an integrated
      system that covers the entire perioperative process including instrument &amp; supply management,
      scheduling, and status displays. Because of the extensive effort that has been put toward
      in-house intraoperative software development, the Vanderbilt Anesthesiology &amp; Perioperative
      Informatics Research (VAPIR) Division is able to benefit from the availability of thousands
      of historical intraoperative records, each containing detailed physiologic information. The
      PDW incorporates VPIMS and electronic healthcare records (EHR) to build its database. In
      addition to PDW, information from the Society for Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database will be
      used in our study.

      The database uses algorithms created by programmers with the assistance clinicians to screen
      the data and assess for accuracy and completeness. Once the data is compounded and uploaded,
      each variable is screened for outliers by a clinician. Outliers will be assessed and
      validated by a clinician based on trends from the raw data. The data collected for this study
      includes an extensive data dictionary listed below:

      The size of the registry for cardiac surgery patients in currently over 8,000 patients which
      should be more than enough to demonstrate an effect.

      The following is a brief description of the investigators data analysis:

        -  Categorical variables will be expressed as frequency and percentage.

        -  Continuous variables will be reported as median and interquartile range (IQR).

        -  the investigators will compare the prevalence of medication use with the incidence of
           postoperative delirium and adjust for confounders.

        -  Analysis will initially be completed with adjusting for confounders, and then consider
           matching patients with propensity score based on initial results.

        -  Statistical significance (pâ‰¤0.05) for categorical variables will be computed using the
           Fisher's exact test or chi-squared and the Deuchler-Wilcoxon procedure or t-test for
           continuous variables.

        -  An iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm will be considered to account for
           missing values or other form of imputation method unless deletion of missing data is
           more ideal.
