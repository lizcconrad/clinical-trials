  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation Phase 1/1b study in patients with acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML)/MDS or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), intended to investigate safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and the pharmacodynamic effects of FT-1101 administered via one or more
      intermittent dosing schedules alone and in combination with azacitidine. Once the MTD has
      been established for a treatment cohort, up to 20 additional patients may be enrolled in up
      to 4 expansion cohorts each of select populations of patients with either AML/MDS or NHL at
      the recommended dose for future studies to confirm safety.
