  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics of OPT-302 administered as monthly intravitreal injections for 3 months with
      and without Lucentis™ in patients with wet age related macular degeneration (AMD). This study
      will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 will comprise an open label, sequential dose
      escalation and Part 2 a randomized dose expansion.

      OPT-302 is a soluble form of VEGFR-3 comprising the extracellular domains 1-3 of human
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-3 and the Fc fragment of human IgG1. It
      functions by binding and neutralizing the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF)-C and VEGF-D on endogenous VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3.

      VEGF-C and VEGF-D promote blood vessel development (angiogenesis) by binding and activating
      VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. VEGF-C is also a potent inducer of vascular permeability or leakage.
      Angiogenesis and vascular leakage are key hallmarks of wet AMD. Approved therapies for wet
      AMD include Eylea™ and Lucentis™ which block the activity of VEGF-A, but not VEGF-C or VEGF-D
      which are alternate members of the same family of molecules.

      VEGF-C and VEGF-D can stimulate blood vessel growth and leakage through the same pathway as
      VEGF-A (via VEGFR-2), as well as through pathways that are independent of VEGF-A (via
      VEGFR-3). Published studies have also indicated that VEGF-C and VEGF-D play an important role
      in mediating resistance to therapies that block VEGF-A such as Lucentis™ and Eylea™.

      Combination therapy with OPT-302 an anti-VEGF-A agent provides a more complete blockade of
      the VEGF family. This strategy targets functional redundancy in the VEGF pathway and
      mechanisms of 'resistance' or sub-response to VEGF-A inhibition.
