  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiological complexity of gait, a measure of the interaction of multiple control mechanisms
      for walking within a biological system, is decreased in persons with chronic stroke compared
      to those without disability. Thus, it is assumed that the quantification of gait complexity
      represents the adaptability and health of the individual. However, it is unknown if the level
      of gait-related complexity improves over time with recovery from stroke. Therefore, the
      primary purpose of this study is to determine if the physiological complexity of gait changes
      over the first six months post stroke within the contemporary healthcare environment.
      Secondary aims include 1) determining if there is a difference between the amount of
      physiological complexity of gait and lateralization of hemispheric damage after stroke and 2)
      exploring the relationship of complexity to lower extremity motor impairment, walking speed
      and balance. Sixty individuals within one month post stroke from the greater Indianapolis
      area will be recruited for this prospective, longitudinal outcomes study. Testing sessions
      will occur at intervals across the first six months post stroke: within 1 month, at 3 months,
      and at 6 months post stroke. During each testing session, participants will complete a
      2-minute walking task during which accelerometer signals from wireless inertial measurement
      units will be collected and converted to sample entropy to quantify the physiological
      complexity of gait. Additionally, measures to quantify lower extremity motor impairment,
      walking speed and balance will be collected and analyzed. Changes in complexity of gait from
      early to later stages of stroke recovery may serve as a foundation for prognosticating
      outcomes, such as predicting capacity for community mobility and/or risk of fall. The
      proposed study will meet a critical need to develop methods that differentiate among
      capacities for adapting movement patterns in individuals with neurological dysfunction. This
      work will ultimately build upon evidence that will assist therapists in tailoring
      interventions in such a way to optimize function.

    <description>Participants will complete a 2-minute walking task on a level indoor surface using their preferred pace during which accelerometer signals from wireless inertial measurement units will be collected. This data will be used to calculate multivariate multiscale sample entropy in order to quantify the complexity index in all lower segments (thigh, shank, foot) and pelvis during gait.</description>
