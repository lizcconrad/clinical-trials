      Primary Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of convection achieved with two different
      haemodiafilters designed for haemodiafiltration and clotting during haemodiafiltration
      treatment.

      This is a prospective observational cohort pilot study of patients under the care of the
      Royal Free Hospital with chronic kidney disease who have been established on regular thrice
      weekly haemodiafiltration treatments in a dialysis centre. Information on the study will be
      disseminated to the Royal Free consultant nephrologists at the dialysis centre with primary
      responsibility for the individual patient.
