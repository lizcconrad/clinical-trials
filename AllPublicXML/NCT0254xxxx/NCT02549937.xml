      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sulfatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors
      and to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

      Secondary Objective： To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple dose sulfatinib in
      patients with advanced solid tumors and to evaluate the anti cancer activity of sulfatinib in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, dose escalation clinical trial of sulfatinib orally once daily
      (QD) in patients with advanced solid tumor.

      The study consists of two phases:

      Dose escalation phase - A 3+3 design will be used for this portion of the study.

        -  Approximately 15 to 30 evaluable patients will be enrolled. The actual number of
           patients depends on the Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) situation as well as the RP2D dose
           level reached in this trial.

        -  The trial will approximately evaluate five sulfatinib dose levels at 50,100, 200, 300
           and 400 mg/day.

      Expansion phase:

      The expansion phase will confirm the MTD or the selected RP2D from the dose escalation phase.
      In consultation with the study investigators, observed toxicities, tolerability, and drug
      exposure will be evaluated.

      Approximately 6 patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in this phase to further
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics to confirm the
      selected sulfatinib dose.

      Subjects will receive RP2D sulfatinib daily treatment continuously with every 28-day
      treatment cycle until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity at the
      investigator's discretion for a favorable benefit to risk balance.
