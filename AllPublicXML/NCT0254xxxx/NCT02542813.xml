  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intramuscular (IM) oxytocin is the gold standard prophylactic therapy for post partum
      haemorrhage (PPH). However, in resource-poor settings within the developing world, the
      stability and therefore effectiveness of prophylactic IM oxytocin is diminished by a lack of
      appropriate refrigeration facilities and availability of trained health care professionals
      (HCPs) to administer IM injections. This study will be the first investigation of oxytocin in
      humans via the inhaled (IH) route and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      inhaled oxytocin and the five non-pharmacologically active components in the placebo, and to
      establish the PK characteristics of up to four fixed escalating doses of inhaled oxytocin. In
      this single blind ascending dose-escalation study, the systemic exposure from up to four
      proposed escalating inhaled fixed-dose levels (50 micrograms [mcg], 200 mcg, 400 mcg and 600
      mcg) will be compared with the systemic exposure following 10 international units (IU) of IM
      oxytocin in healthy premenopausal females.. A total of 15 subjects will be enrolled after
      screening sufficient number of healthy female subjects and the subjects will be assigned to
      one of the two treatment sequences. The total duration of this study is approximately 20
      weeks.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
