  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RET fusions are present in 1% to 2% of unselected population of non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Existing US Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of RET tyrosine kinase
      show promising therapeutic effects in a non-small cell lung cancer patients. Apatinib is an
      oral multi-kinase inhibitors including RET fusions. This study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of Apatinib in patients with RET fusion positive advanced NSCLC.

      To observe objective response rate (ORR) of apatinib in RET fusion positive pre-treated
      advanced NSCLC.

      To observe Progression free survival （PFS）. To assess the overall survival (OS). To assess
      safety and tolerability. To evaluate quality of life. To explore the relationship between
      biomarkers and the toxicity/efficacy of apatinib.
