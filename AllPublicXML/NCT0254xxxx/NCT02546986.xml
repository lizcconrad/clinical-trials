  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination therapy of CC-486 (oral
      azacitidine) and pembrolizumab provides improved patient outcomes compared to pembrolizumab
      alone in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind
      study to assess the safety and efficacy of CC-486 and pembrolizumab combination therapy
      versus pembrolizumab plus placebo in previously treated patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had received one prior platinum-based
      chemotherapy regimen.

      Approximately 100 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive CC-486 plus pembrolizumab or
      placebo plus pembrolizumab as follows:

        -  Arm A: CC-486 300 mg administered orally daily on days 1 to 14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg
           administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle

        -  Arm B: Placebo administered orally daily on days 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg
           administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle

      Randomization will be stratified between treatment arms by histology (non-squamous versus
      squamous).

      The decision to discontinue a patient, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor,
      remains the responsibility of the treating physician. However, prior to discontinuing a
      patient, the Investigator may contact the medical monitor and forward appropriate supporting
      documents for review and discussion.

      In the follow-up phase, anticancer treatment administered following the last dose of
      investigational product (IP) and survival will be followed every 8 weeks until death,
      withdrawal of consent, or lost-to follow-up, whichever occurs first, or the End of Trial.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      Primary analysis will be conducted when 70 Progression Free Survival (PFS) events have
      occurred.

    <measure>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Methodology</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 of study drug treatment to the date of disease progression; up to the clinical cut-off date of 12 April 2017; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined according to the FDA Methodology as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (documented by computed tomography scan, not including symptomatic deterioration) or death for (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Those who did not have disease progression or had not died as of the data cutoff date were censored at the time of the last radiologic assessment where the participant was documented to be progression-free prior to the data cutoff date. Progressive disease includes at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion.</description>

    <time_frame>From Day 1 of study drug treatment to the date of disease progression; up to the clinical cut-off date of 12 April 2017; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined according to EMA methodology as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (documented by computed tomography scan result, not including symptomatic deterioration) or death for (any cause) on or prior to the data cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the last known time that the participant was progression free. However, occasional missing observations or initiation of subsequent new anticancer therapy would not result in censoring for this analysis. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for a Minimum Duration of 18 Weeks Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until DP, new anticancer initiation, or withdrawal of consent; maximum treatment exposure for CC-486 + PBZ was 61 weeks and 60 weeks for PBO +PBZ</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed stable disease, complete or partial response during the course of study, according to RECIST v1.1, as evaluated by the investigator.
RECIST v 1.1 is defined as:
Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions
Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline
Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion. When stable disease was believed to be the best response, it must have met the minimum duration of 10 weeks from randomization.</description>

    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time in months between day 1 of treatment and death from any cause. Participants who were still alive as of the clinical cut-off date had their OS censored at the date of last contact or clinical cut-off, whichever was earlier. Participants who were lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study or who were withdrawn from the study were censored at the time of last contact.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Overall Response of Complete Response or Partial Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until DP, new anticancer initiation, or withdrawal of consent; maximum treatment exposure for CC-486 + PBZ was 61 weeks and 60 weeks for PBZ + PBO</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an objective confirmed complete response or partial response according to RECIST v1.1, compared with baseline where baseline was the last computed tomography (CT) scan obtained prior to or on day 1 of study treatment.
RECIST v1.1 is defined as:
Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions
Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline
Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of IP; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the investigational product (IP) through 28 days after the last dose of IP. In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 and based on the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild; Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life threatening Grade 5 = Death.</description>

             start. Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.

         12. Participant has not recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior anticancer
             therapy, radiation, or major surgery/significant trauma.

         13. Participant has an active infection requiring therapy.

         14. Participant has had an allogenetic tissue/solid organ ransplant.

         15. Participant has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within
             the past 2 years (eg, with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

         16. Participant has known active Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or tuberculosis. Active
             Hepatitis B is defined as a known positive HBsAg result. Active Hepatitis C is defined
             by a known positive Hepatitis C antibody result and known quantitative Hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) results greater than the lower limits of detection
             of the assay.

         17. Participant has had any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization, with
             the exception of adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, uterus, or
             nonmelanomatous skin cancer (all treatment of which should have been completed 6
             months prior to enrollment).

         18. Participant has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis), celiac disease (ie, sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel
             removal, or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the IP and/or predispose the
             participant to an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.

         19. Participant has persistent diarrhea or clinically significant malabsorption syndrome
             or known sub-acute bowel obstruction ≥ Grade 2, despite medical management

         20. Participant has significant active cardiac disease within the previous 6 months
             including unstable angina or angina requiring surgical or medical intervention,
             significant cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4
             congestive heart failure.

         21. Participant has history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR a history of pneumonitis
             that has required oral or IV steroids. Participants whose pneumonitis was solely as a
             result of radiation therapy for their NSCLC would not be excluded from the study
             unless they received oral/IV steroids to manage the pneumonitis.

         22. Participant has a known history or current diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) infection, regardless of treatment status.

         23. Participant has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that
             would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate patient participation in the
             clinical study (eg, chronic pancreatitis, etc.).

         24. Participant with uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases
             and/or carcinomatous meningitis Participants with controlled and asymptomatic CNS
             metastases may participate in this trial. The patient must have completed any prior
             treatment for CNS metastases (must include radiotherapy and/or surgery) ≥ 28 days (≥
             14 days for stereotactic radiosurgery) and, if on corticosteroid therapy, should be
             receiving a stable dose of no greater than 4 mg/d dexamethasone (or equivalent
             anti-inflammatory potency of another corticosteroid) for at least 14 days before start
             of study treatment). Patients must not be receiving corticosteroids for brain
             metastases.

         25. Partcipant has not recovered from the acute toxic effects (Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ≤ 1) of prior anticancer therapy, radiation, or major
             surgery/significant trauma (except alopecia or other toxicities not considered a
             safety risk for the particiapants at the Investigator's discretion).

         26. Participant has an impaired ability to swallow oral medication.

         27. Participant is pregnant or breast feeding.

         28. Participant has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the
             study.

         29. Participant is or has an immediate family member (spouse or children) who is
             investigational site or sponsor staff directly involved with this trial, unless
             prospective Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (by chair or designee) is given
             allowing exception to this criterion for a specific participant.

          <description>Disease Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Stages range from 0 (not spread) to IV (spread throughout the body). Stage 0 - the cancer has not spread beyond the inner lining of the lung Stage I - the cancer is small and hasn't spread to the lymph nodes Stage II - the cancer has spread to some lymph nodes near the original tumor Stage III - the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or spread to far away lymph nodes Stage IV - the cancer has spread to other organs of the body such as the other lung, brain, or liver.</description>

Those who did not have disease progression or had not died as of the data cutoff date were censored at the time of the last radiologic assessment where the participant was documented to be progression-free prior to the data cutoff date.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for a Minimum Duration of 18 Weeks Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Disease control rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed stable disease, complete or partial response during the course of study, according to RECIST v1.1, as evaluated by the investigator.
RECIST v 1.1 is defined as:
Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions
Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline
Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion. When stable disease was believed to be the best response, it must have met the minimum duration of 10 weeks from randomization.</description>
        <time_frame>Response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until DP, new anticancer initiation, or withdrawal of consent; maximum treatment exposure for CC-486 + PBZ was 61 weeks and 60 weeks for PBO +PBZ</time_frame>

        <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time in months between day 1 of treatment and death from any cause. Participants who were still alive as of the clinical cut-off date had their OS censored at the date of last contact or clinical cut-off, whichever was earlier.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Overall Response of Complete Response or Partial Response</title>
        <description>The best overall response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an objective confirmed complete response or partial response according to RECIST v1.1, compared with baseline where baseline was the last computed tomography (CT) scan obtained prior to or on day 1 of study treatment.
RECIST v1.1 is defined as:
Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions
Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from baseline
Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion.</description>
        <time_frame>Response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until DP, new anticancer initiation, or withdrawal of consent; maximum treatment exposure for CC-486 + PBZ was 61 weeks and 60 weeks for PBZ + PBO</time_frame>

        <title>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on European Medicines Agency Methodology</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was defined according to EMA methodology as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (documented by computed tomography scan result, not including symptomatic deterioration) or death for (any cause) on or prior to the data cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the last known time that the participant was progression free. However, occasional missing observations or initiation of subsequent new anticancer therapy would not result in censoring for this analysis. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion.</description>
        <time_frame>From Day 1 of study drug treatment to the date of disease progression; up to the clinical cut-off date of 12 April 2017; overall maximum treatment duration was 61 weeks for the CC-486 + PBZ arm and 60 weeks for the PBZ + Placebo arm</time_frame>
