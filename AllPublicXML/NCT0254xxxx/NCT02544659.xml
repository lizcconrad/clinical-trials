  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate long term efficacy of intravenous bisphosphonates for bone
      marrow edema in patients with SAPHO syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the long term efficacy at 3 days, 3 and 6 months after pamidronate
      disodium administered. Patients will be administered pamidronate disodium 1 mg/kg, IV, QD,
      for 3 days, and every 3 months (up to month 6).
