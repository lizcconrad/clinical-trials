      Primary Objectives: To determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the south zone of the
      di@bet.es study (Andalusia and the Canary Islands) at 6 years follow-up. To determine the
      main risk factors associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes and to check the role of
      diet and physical inactivity. To determine whether the interaction between diet fatty acids
      with the genetic variability of the fatty acid transport systems regulated by VEGFB influence
      the risk of diabetes and related diseases. To test in a general population the predictive
      value of some of the risk scores currently available: Finrisc, PREDIMED-clinical Score, etc..

      Secondary Objectives: To determine the incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the
      south zone of the di@bet.es study. To determine the main risk factors associated with the
      incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome: to check the role of diet, physical inactivity
      and certain polymorphisms in genes related to the handling of fatty acids Methodology:
      Prospective population-based cohort study where the incidence of type 2 diabetes, obesity and
      metabolic syndrome at 6 years follow-up will be determined in the sampling south zone of the
      di@bet.es study (1600 subjects aged 18 years baseline data from a randomized cluster
      sampling). Considering follow up losses in 25%, statistical power to detect as significant a
      relative risk of 1.5 (incidence = 10/1000 person-years) is greater than 85% (alpha = 0.05).
      Risk factor / exposure: alterations in glucose estimated from the baseline surveys, the
      presence of insulin-resistance (HOMA) score Finrisk / PREDIMED-clinical Score / adherence to
      Mediterranean diet transport and metabolism of fatty acids and genotypes of genes involved in
      the handling of fatty acids. Covariates: all collected in the baseline study.

      1. Introduction Though type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a strong genetic component, the
           genetic basis of T2DM (at least the genes so far studied) do little to predict the risk
           of T2DM from traditional risk prediction criteria, such as family history, obesity, or
           previous glycemic alterations. From this perspective, T2DM is the prototype of a complex
           disease, considered to be the result of the interaction of different genes and of genes
           with environmental factors such as diet or sedentary habits.

           Because of this, the study of gene-environment interactions is extremely important in
           determining the risk of developing diabetes and/or asociated metabolic diseases. Our
           overall objective is to study these interactions in a representative sample of the
           Spanish population, as part of a study of prevalence and incidence of T2DM.

           Fatty acid transporters. The management of lipids, and particularly the regulation of
           the uptake of fatty acids by the tissues and their relation with disease is of much
           interest.

           Several proteins undertake the transport, with some of the most important being fatty
           acid translocase (FAT/CD36), fatty acid binding protein (FABP) and fatty acid transport
           protein (FATP). The reason for such a variety of transporters is unclear.

           In the muscle of obese persons with T2DM the speed of fatty acid transport is increased
           in comparison with lean or overweight persons. They found that this was associated with
           an increase in the membrane content of the fatty acid transporter FAT/CD36, but not
           FABPpm. The increased fatty acid uptake contributes to the excess accumulation of
           triglycerides in the cytoplasm due to an increase in esterification, with no alterations
           in the rates of oxidation. These proteins are highly regulated in all tissues by
           hormones (insulin and leptin) and transcription factors. The adipocyte concentration of
           FABP in serum correlates with the components of the metabolic syndrome and may be a
           prognostic indicator of the efficacy of a weight loss intervention.

           The fatty acids present in the blood must cross the endothelium to reach the tissues
           where they are metabolized. The vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) plays an
           important role in this process. Knock-out mice for VEGF-B have a lower uptake and
           accumulation of fatty acids in muscle, cardiac and brown adipose tissues but they
           accumulate more lipids in white adipose tissue. The process is mediated by the receptors
           VEGFR1 (FLT1) and neuropilin-1 expressed by the endothelium.

           The lower accumulation of lipids in myocytes has been related with their greater insulin
           sensitivity. Thus, a low VEGF-B activity reduces the intramyocellular lipids and
           improves insulin sensitivity, as the tissue tends to take up more glucose to obtain the
           sufficient energy for its purpose, diverting the fatty acids to the adipose tissue.

           The participation of VEGF-B in lipid uptake opens up the possibility of new strategies
           to modulate the pathological accumulation of lipids that is produced in diabetes,
           obesity or cardiovascular diseases.

           No studies have yet related the genetic variability of VEGF-B with alterations in
           glucose homeostasis. In addition, the risk value in a prospective study of the genetic
           variants of the transporters or their regulatory proteins, very particularly VEGF-B, is
           still an unexplored aspect.

           The di@bet.es study. This is the first national study in Spain designed with the
           objective of determining the prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus. The team
           requesting this project is part of the Steering Committee of the di@bet.es study. The
           results of the cross-sectional study were recently published. The study has collected
           numerous anthropometric, biochemical and lifestyle (exercise and diet) variables that
           will allow detailed analysis of factors associated with the prevalence of diabetes in
           this population (13 articles have been published so far).

           The DNA samples collected, together with the phenotype information obtained, will enable
           us to examine the associations mentioned above between the genetics of fatty acid
           transporters, the regulatory mechanisms, and the relation (cross and longitudinal) with
           diabetic phenotypes, among others, and their interactions with nutritional factors. The
           fact that this is a Spanish population based cohort study makes it an extremely useful
           test bench to examine the gene-gene and gene-nutrient interactions in the explanation of
           the incidence of diabetes.

        2. Hypothesis and Objectives

      General hypothesis:

      In a state of excess intake, the genetic variants of VEGF-B that induce low tissue VEGF-B
      activity could protect from diabetes (and the metabolic syndrome) whilst the adipose tissue
      accommodates the excess energy, whereas persons with a high activity quickly develop insulin
      resistance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, due to the lipotoxicity produced by the excess
      of fatty acids introduced into the tissues.

      Specific hypotheses:

        1. The genetic variants of the fatty acid transporters and their regulatory proteins
           (VEGF-B) are related with the risk of diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome and affect
           the onset of T2DM.

        2. Various gene-nutrient interactions exist in the explanation of factors affecting the
           development of diabetes.

      Objectives A. To determine the incidence of type 2 diabetes in Spain

      B. To show that the presence of particular alleles of genes encoding fatty acid transporters
      and their regulatory proteins (VEGF-B):

        1. are associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes or other carbohydrate
           metabolism disorders after four years of follow up.

        2. are associated with the risk of becoming obese, or having hypertension or the metabolic
           syndrome after four years of follow up.

      C. To demonstrate gene-gene and gene-nutrient interactions. 3-Work planning 3.1- Design: A
      prospective, population-based cohort study. 3.2- Definition of the outcome variable whose
      risk the investigators want to measure: Presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed by
      OGTT and/or metabolic syndrome after five years of follow up.

      3.3- Defining the population at risk: The study is based on the di@bet.es study, a
      cross-sectional study undertaken from 2007-2010 from a random cluster sampling in the Spanish
      population over 18 years of age. DNA samples are available in the Biobank CIBERDEM.

      Exclusion criteria: subjects with diabetes in cross-sectional study, serious illness,
      pregnancy, surgery within the previous month, or any other disabling situation that prevents
      participation will be excluded from the study.

      The investigators have data on 5072 people. Of these, about 4400 were free of diabetes in the
      cross-sectional study. Follow-up losses could be about 25% (known from previous studies). The
      expected final sample will comprise 3300 persons.

      3.4- Identification of the exposure factors:

      Primary exposure factors:

        -  Subjects will be classified according to their blood glucose as having a normal OGTT
           (unexposed subjects) or having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose
           tolerance (IGT) (exposed subjects).

        -  Insulin Resistance Homeostasis Model Assessment quartiles, calculated from prior
           knowledge of the distribution of the variable IR-HOMA in the entire study population.

        -  The genotypes of the genes involved in fatty acid transport. About 160 SNPs from the
           following genes: VEGF-B, FLT1 (VEGF-B receptor), neuropilin (VEGF-B receptor), CD36,
           FABP1, FABP1, FABP4, FABP6, FATP1, FATP2, FATP3, FATP4, FATP5 and FATP6.

      Secondary exposure factors and potential confounders

        1. Anthropometric variables: weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip
           circumference, waist to hip ratio.

        2. Sociological variables: age, education level, marital status.

        3. Habits: Physical activity (general, sports, IPAQ questionnaire), smoking habit, alcohol
           intake, psychotropic drug intake.

        4. Associated diseases: hypertension, dyslipidemia.

        5. Food frequency questionnaire and dietary habits.

        6. Biochemical variables, liver profile, serum iron and ferritin, hsCRP (unspecified
           inflammatory state).

      3.5-Exposure time: The cross-sectional study was undertaken between 2007 and 2010, assuming
      that the development of this particular project is in 2015-16, follow-up times will be:
      median = 5.9 years, minimum = 5.1 years and maximum = 7.3 years.

      3.6-Proceedings. 3.6.1-Fieldwork: The subjects selected for follow-up will be sent a letter
      by mail inviting them to participate in this second phase of the study. Data collection will
      be conducted through an appointment in health center Will be recorded: 1: doctor visits, 2:
      history of diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, other diseases, 3: weight, waist,
      hip, blood pressure, 4: medications they are taking, 5: if they follow any type of special
      diet, 5: Standarized OGTT, with blood-drawn at time 0' a 120'.

      3.6.2- Power analysis: Considering a 25% loss to follow-up, a sample size of about 3300
      people free of diabetes at baseline will be obtained.

      With this sample size, the investigators have calculated the statistical power to detect as
      significant a relative risk of 1.3 taking into account an expected incidence in the unexposed
      group of about 10 per 1000 person-years (data from previous local Spanish studies). Assuming
      95% confidence, the resulting statistical power is 86.4%.

      3.6.3- Genetic study: About 160 SNPs from the following genes: VEGF-B, FLT1 (VEGF-B
      receptor), peripilin (VEGF-B receptor), CD36, FABP1, FABP1, FABP4, FABP6, FATP1, FATP2,
      FATP3, FATP4, FATP5 and FATP6 will be studied.

      Methods:

        1. DNA extraction

        2. Measuring the concentration of DNA and standardization

        3. SNPs study in TaqMan Openarray Genotyping System (Applied Biosystem, Madrid).
           3.6.4-Statistical analysis: At present, all the information from the cross-sectional
           study is computerized in databases specially designed for this project. At the end of
           the follow-up five groups of variables will be obtained:

      In databases:

        1. Cross sectional clinical and anthropometric variables

        2. Cross sectional nutritional and physical activity data

        3. Cross sectional biochemical variables

           To be determined in this project:

        4. Follow up clinical variables.

        5. Genetic variables: population frequencies of SNPs of the selected genes.

      Will be calculate:

      Estimation of the prevalence of different genotypes. Estimation of the global incidence of
      type 2 diabetes and related diseases in the population.

      Estimation of the incidence of diabetes and related diseases according to baseline clinical
      phenotypes and genotypes of the genes studied.

      Calculation of relative risks using logistic regression models adjusted for potential
      confounders.

      Calculation of gene-gene and gene-diet interaction, building interaction terms in the
      logistic regression analysis.

      Likewise, the attributable risk will be calculated (incidence of diabetes that is
      attributable to the exposure), population attributable risk (incidence of diabetes in the
      population associated with the exposure factor) and population attributable fraction
      (fraction of disease in a population attributable to exposure to a risk factor).

      Finally, to define which set of variables predict the risk, a strategy will be designed to
      carry out a principal component analysis.

      Analysis will be made using the R statistical package. 4-Limitations Being a population
      study, certain groups tend to participate more likely than others (bias in participation), it
      will be compensate working also on weekends and holidays to prevent working people
      participate less.

      The study will diagnose diabetes based on a single OGTT, when the right thing would be to
      repeat the test at different times for confirmation. The logistical difficulties of this
      approach are hard to overcome, but the diagnoses were confirmed by simultaneous measurement
      of HbA1c.
