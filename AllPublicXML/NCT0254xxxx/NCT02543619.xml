    <textblock>
      Forty healthy patients with including criteria who failed to infra alveolar nerve block
      injection (without lip numbness) have been randomly divided into two groups on a random basis
      and have received Gow-Gates or another inferior alveolar nerve block injection. Endodontic
      access cavity preparation has been initiated after complete anesthesia. If patients felt any
      pain during the steps of caries or dentin removal, Endodontic access cavity preparation or
      canal working length determination, treatment has been stopped and their pain has been
      measured by Heft Parker 170 mm Visual Analog Scale (Zero as no pain and 170 as maximum pain
      ).The data has been analyzed by Mann-U-Whitney and CHI- SQUARE tests.

      The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Gow-Gates and inferior alveolar nerve
      block on success rate of anesthesia in patients with irreversible pulpitis. In this
      prospective, randomized, double-blind study , forty healthy patients with symptomatic
      irreversible pulpitis and including criteria who failed to infra alveolar nerve block
      injection (without lip numbness) have been randomly divided into two groups on a random basis
      and have received Gow-Gates or another inferior alveolar nerve block injection. Their pain
      has been evaluated by electric pulp tester every 5 minutes for two times. Endodontic access
      cavity preparation has been initiated after complete anesthesia. If patients felt any pain
      during the steps of caries or dentin removal, Endodontic access cavity preparation or canal
      working length determination, treatment has been stopped and their pain has been measured by
      Heft Parker 170 mm Visual Analog Scale (Zero as no pain and 170 as maximum pain ). The
      patients have been instructed to rate any pain during each of the mentioned steps. The data
      have been analyzed by Mann-U-Whitney and CHI- SQUARE tests.
