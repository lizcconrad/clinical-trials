      This study evaluates whether supplementations with a highly bioavailable green tea extract
      may help obese women to counteract weight regain after a 3-month weight loss intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most obese subjects regain weight after weight loss due to compensatory adaptations finalized
      to maintain stable body energy stores. In lean or obese individuals, maintenance of a 10% or
      greater reduction in body weight is associated with a decline in 24-hour energy expenditure
      of approximately 20%-25%. The restraint of the energy expenditure decline during dieting by
      green tea (GT) preparations should be a useful strategy to facilitate weight maintenance. To
      increase absorption of GT, the investigators used a formulation with phospholipids
      (Greenselect Phytosome® ) added with piperine, a thermogenic agent and a booster of
      absorption for various phenolics.

      At the end of a 3-month lifestyle intervention, all patients giving written informed consent
      were randomly assigned to two groups for the weight-maintenance phase: 20 of them were
      supplemented twice a day for 3 months with a dietary supplement (Globes®, Pharmextracta,
      Pontenure, Piacenza, Italy) and 20 with placebo.Women were blind to the supplementation
      throughout the whole trial. All women attended a monthly clinical visit during the
      supplementation period and 3 months after the end of supplementation.
