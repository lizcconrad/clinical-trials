      The goal of the proposed research is to adapt and rigorously evaluate educational mobile
      games, designed as a downloadable mobile apps to be played on smartphones or tablets.
      Investigators will be partnering with Yogome for this project. Yogame is a company dedicated
      to creating educational games that aim to reinforce knowledge acquired in school and help
      children learn new things in an entertaining and fun way.

      This study will modify and evaluate the Heroes of Knowledge (HoK) games, beginning with the
      Math Heroes game which was designed to be played for up to 8 hours. Other games in the HoK
      series may be included in this process if they are fully developed and available for testing.
      In testing the efficacy of the Math Heroes game, children will play the game for 1-1.5 hours
      per week, 2-3 times per week, for 2-4 weeks (to accumulate 6-8 hours of game play). The game
      has been designed to target math knowledge skills identified by the Common Core Standards for
      Mathematics (2012).

    <description>Self-Competence will be captured using a &quot;structure alternate format&quot; scale designed for young children adapted from the 28-item Perceived Competence Scale in Children. For this study, self-competence is defined as a child's sense of cognitive competence. Each item is scored from 1 to 4, where a score of 1 indicates low perceived competence and a score of 4 reflects high perceived competence. Scores are summed and then averaged.</description>
