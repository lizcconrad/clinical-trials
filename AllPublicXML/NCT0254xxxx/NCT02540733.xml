  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) plays an important role in the occurrence of the cerebral infarction
      (CI). Clinical studies have demonstrated that the CI patients with DM had a poor prognosis
      compared with those without DM. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown
      that patients with DM had abnormalities in cerebral vessels, nerves and functions, similar
      with the findings in mice models. In this study, with multi-modal MRI technologies,
      investigators tend to observe structural and functional changes of the brain in both DM and
      non-DM CI patients and assess their neural rehabilitation using clinical scales in the
      following 6 months. Investigators also expect to find out dynamic changes of brain structure
      and function, to reveal the weights of factors including brain blood vessels, nerves and
      function remodeling related with stroke recovery, as well as the potential mechanism in CI
      patients with DM.
