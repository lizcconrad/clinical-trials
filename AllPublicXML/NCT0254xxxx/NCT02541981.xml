      The outcome of heart transplantation has improved by years. The renal dysfunction is a major
      complication after heart transplantation.The natural course of renal function following
      orthotopic heart transplant is not clear in Taiwan. A retrospective study was conducted on
      patients who received a heart transplant at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1987
      and 2015.

      The investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who received a first
      heart transplant at the NTUH(Taiwan) between 1987 and 2015 . Clinical data were obtained and
      a retrospective chart review, and were collected up to 10 years .

      Data was collected from medical records and the heart transplant electronic database
      including: demographic parameters such as age and gender; etiology of heart failure; the
      presence of any of the following comorbidities: history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension,
      peripheral vascular disease and previous sternotomy; pre-transplant cholesterol levels; the
      use of any of the following pretransplant hemodynamic support measures:intravenous inotropes,
      intra-aortic balloon pump and ventricular assist device;creatinine levels; listing status
      according to the UNOS classification; waiting time; heart ischemic time;immunosuppression
      drug levels(cyclosporine,prograft or certican) and development of end stage renal disease
      requiring onset of dialysis therapy.

      Creatinine levels and GFRwere collected before transplantation and then the closest level to
      every month after heart transplant.

      The clinical outcomes of interest analyzed in this study included the development of
      post-transplant end stage renal disease and death.

        This study included patients with a first HTx performed at NTUH between1987 and 2015.

        Patients were excluded if their first HTx was a combined transplant involving a KTx, they
        had renal replacement therapy prior to their HTx.
