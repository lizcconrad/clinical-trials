  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The search for genetic alterations in primary tumor by NGS techniques followed by the
      detection of these alterations in circulating tumor DNA and/or CTC/DTC present in peripheral
      samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, possibly urine) collected during several
      steps and after the treatment could be a tool to monitor the response during and after the
      treatment.
