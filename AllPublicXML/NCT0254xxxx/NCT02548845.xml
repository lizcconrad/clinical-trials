  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, the Spanish Sociedad Española de Oncología Médica (SEOM) algorithm for the treatment
      of hyponatraemia secondary to to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in
      oncology patients was developed. Since it is hypothesised that the adherence to the SEOM
      algorithm is not 100%, the current retrospective non-interventional study will investigate
      the perceived and actual adherence of participating centres to the SEOM algorithm and its
      impact on patient outcomes

      <textblock>
        Eligible patients are oncology patients ≥ 18 years old who had been diagnosed with at least
        one occurrence of hyponatraemia secondary to the SIADH and who had been managed ein one of
        the Spanish centres who have implemented the SEOM algorithm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             it would represent a non-reasonable effort or c) if the source patient is deceased or
             untraceable.

          -  Female and/or male oncology patients aged 18 years and over

          -  Patients who have experienced at least one occurrence of hyponatraemia secondary to
             the SIADH.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient cannot take part in this study if participating in any clinical study in
             which the medicinal product aims to treat the causes or symptoms of hyponatraemia at
             the time of the hyponatraemia episode being documented in the current study.
