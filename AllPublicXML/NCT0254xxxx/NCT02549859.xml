  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our recent study (Xie et al, Neurology 2015; 84: 415-420) found that 60Hz stimulation,
      compared to the traditional 130Hz, decreased the aspiration frequency and swallowing
      difficulty, medication refractory freezing of gait (FOG), and other axial symptoms and
      parkinsonism in Parkinson patients with bilateral STN DBS. The benefit of 60Hz stimulation
      persisted during the 6-week study period, with worsening tremor in one patient. However, it
      remains unknown whether the benefit of 60Hz would persist on prolonged stimulation period,
      and whether there is carry-over effect across different conditions. Clarifying these
      questions is essential for the application of 60Hz stimulation chronically and confidently to
      treat medication refractory axial symptoms. Hence, the investigators would test the
      hypothesis that the 60Hz stimulation, compared to 130Hz, would have persistent benefit over
      an extended period (on average &gt; 8-month study period) in reducing the swallowing
      dysfunction, FOG, and other axial symptoms in PD patients with bilateral STN DBS and
      medication refractory FOG at 130Hz stimulation, even after correcting the potential
      carry-over effects between stimulation conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 14 Parkinson patients with bilateral STN DBS and medication
      refractory FOG at 130Hz for two visits of at least 6-month apart. The 6 patients remaining on
      60Hz stimulation after our previous study consisting of 7 patients will be assessed again
      once as visit-2 at least 15-month after previous visit-1 of their last study. It will have 20
      patents complete for vist-1 and at least 18 patients complete for visit-2 in this randomized
      double-blind prospective crossover study with their usual medication &quot;on&quot; state, with 6-7
      patients on each starting condition (60Hz vs 130Hz vs DBS off). Swallowing function on
      modified barium swallowing test and swallowing difficulty on questionnaire, FOG in
      stand-walk-sit test and questionnaire, and other axial and motor function will be assessed
      under each DBS condition. Changes in measurements between 60Hz and 130Hz at each visit and
      under 60Hz between two visits will be analyzed, with swallowing function and FOG as primary,
      and the rest as secondary outcomes, correcting for potential carryover effect. Changes
      between other DBS conditions might also be explored in this 2-year study.

      This would be the first study on the long-term effect of 60Hz stimulation on dysphagia, FOG
      and other axial and motor symptoms in Parkinson patients with bilateral STN DBS and
      medication refractory FOG at 130Hz stimulation, which will have significant impact on the
      treatment of difficult axial symptoms of high morbidity and mortality.

    <description>Patients will have a randomized double-blind prospective crossover study with usual medication &quot;on&quot; state under 3 different DBS stimulation frequency condition (60Hz vs 130Hz vs DBS off). Aspiration frequency on modified barium swallowing test and swallowing difficulty on questionnaire, FOG in stand-walk-sit test and questionnaire, and other axial and motor function will be assessed under each DBS condition. Changes in measurements between 60Hz and 130Hz at each visit and under 60Hz between two visits of 8 months apart on average will be analyzed, with swallowing function and FOG as primary, and the rest as secondary outcomes, correcting for potential carryover effect. Changes between other DBS conditions might also be explored in this 2-year study.</description>
