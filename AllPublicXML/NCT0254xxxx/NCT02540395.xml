    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate the utility and safety of the IFN-γ
      (Interferon Gamma) ELISPOT (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) marker for the stratification
      of kidney transplant recipients into low and high IS (Immunosuppression) regimens. The
      enrichment study will test non-inferiority of low IS regimen compared to high IS regimen,
      assuming 10% of BPAR at 6-months in the control group, and allowing a non-inferiority limit
      of maximum 10%.
