  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major liver resection is associated with substantial intraoperative blood loss. Blood loss in
      elective liver surgery is a significant factor of perioperative morbidity and mortality, as
      well as possibly long-term oncologic outcome. The purpose of this study is to use whole blood
      phlebotomy to decrease the central venous pressure, resulting in a state of relative
      hypovolemia. It is hypothesized that this intervention will lead to a decrease in blood loss
      at the time of liver resection.

      Major liver resection is associated with significant intraoperative blood loss. Blood loss in
      elective liver surgery is a key determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well
      as possibly long-term oncologic outcome. Whole blood phlebotomy is a simple intervention,
      whose aim is to decrease the central venous pressure yielding a state of relative hypovolemia
      and thus lead to decreased blood loss. Small studies, mostly from the liver transplant
      literature, would suggest that phlebotomy with controlled hypovolemia can result in decreased
      blood loss and blood transfusion. Since blood loss is an important issue in liver surgery,
      and the benefits of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia are unknown in liver resection
      patients, a rigorously conducted trial in a representative population of patients undergoing
      liver resection is warranted, and feasible. In this proposal, it is hypothesized that by the
      use of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia, it is possible to decrease blood loss and blood
      transfusions. To test this hypothesis the investigators plan to randomly allocate
      participants to phlebotomy plus standard of care or to standard of care. Participants will be
      those patients undergoing elective major liver resection at the Ottawa Hospital for any
      indication. The primary outcome will be intraoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes will
      include transfusion requirements, perioperative morbidity and mortality, safety, physiologic
      parameters, and feasibility elements. A total of 62 patients will be randomized. The efficacy
      of phlebotomy in terms of blood loss prevention will be assessed.

    <description>Intraoperative blood loss is notoriously difficult to measure. It is suggested that calculation of blood loss using preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels in most consistently accurate. In order to minimize the risk of bias associated with any one method of intraoperative measurement of blood loss, three methods will be used independently. In the operating room, all blood and fluid aspirated from the abdomen will be measured accurately using graduated suction containers. As well, the amount of irrigation fluid will be carefully monitored and recorded. Finally, the weight of all surgical sponges will be measured. This information will be used by the surgeon and anesthesiologist to independently visually estimate blood loss, as is commonly done in clinical practice. In parallel, intraoperative blood loss will also be calculated based on an equation.</description>

Strict aseptic technique will be maintained. A total volume of whole blood of 7-10 mL per kg of body weight will be removed, as tolerated. The volume of removed blood will not be replaced by intravenous fluid administration. Collected blood will be transfused back at the end of the liver parenchymal transection, or within 8 hours of collection.</description>
