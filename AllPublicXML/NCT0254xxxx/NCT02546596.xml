  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer increases the possibility of
      complete resection and anal sphincter preservation. However, a treatment period of from 5 to
      6 weeks is an obstacle of proper surgical intervention. Also, radiotherapy itself is
      confronting challenges for maximizing the therapeutic effect and minimizing the side effects.
      Electro-hyperthermia is appropriate treatment method to solve these kinds of problems. In
      this clinical trial, therapeutic effect of the high-frequency electro-hyperthermia is to be
      verified during preoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. The ultimate
      goal is to establish a safe and effective treatment protocol.

      the trial is treatment safety and non-inferiority of tumor regression to conventional
      schedule of preoperative radiotherapy.
