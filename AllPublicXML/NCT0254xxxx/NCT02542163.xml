      Purpose: To conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the NimbleHeart wireless
      telemetry vest in cardiac rehabilitation.

      Study Design: This is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, pilot trial evaluating
      the NimbleHeart chest harness system.

    <textblock>
      20 subjects will be consented to participate at an early cardiac rehabilitation exercise
      session (typically sessions 1-6). Subjects will wear the NimbleHeart vest concurrently with
      existing telemetry system during exercise sessions, and thus not replace existing telemetry
      monitoring. Both staff and subjects will be queried for their (user) experiences during and
      after each session. Experiences will be documented on surveys after each session.
      De-identified ECG rhythm strips from the NimbleHeart monitor will be collected to assess
      quality of tracings. Subjects will be asked to wear the NimbleHeart vest for 2 sessions.
      Study participation will end after the 2nd session.
