    <textblock>
      The microcirculatory alterations is common in circulatory failure, especially during sepsis.
      The severity of these changes and their sustainability are responsible of multi organ failure
      and ultimately death. The optimization of microcirculatory flow could be a central objective
      of the management of patients hospitalized in intensive care.

      Microcirculation includes all blood vessels of a diameter smaller than 100 micrometer. It
      represents the largest heat exchange surface of the body and is involved in tissue
      oxygenation. Microcirculatory flow is conditioned by the macrocirculation (heart rate and
      blood pressure) and the state of the microcirculation (thrombosis, vasoconstriction ...). The
      role of the CO2 in regulating microcirculatory flow is little studied. A recent work of our
      team and the oldest work in the literature lead to believe that CO2 has a specific role in
      modulating microcirculatory flow. No study to date precisely studied the impact of changes in
      the microcirculatory flow carbonemia .

      The hypocapnia test is carried out in a standardized manner by inhalation of a mixture
      enriched in CO2 7% allows a significant increase in carbonemia. Hypocapnia will in turn
      obtained by a calibrated voluntary hyperventilation test.

      Direct visualization of microcirculation by confocal microscopy is now considered the gold
      standard for exploring the microcirculation.
