  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most common form of vulvodynia and despite its high
      prevalence and important sexual, conjugal and psychological deleterious repercussions,
      effective evidence-based interventions remain limited. For a high proportion of women,
      significant pain persists despite the currently available treatments. Transcranial
      direct-current stimulation (tDCS) was shown to be effective in various chronic pain
      conditions. So far, only one case report study has shown significant pain reduction in women
      with vulvodynia. The main goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of tDCS in women with PVD compared to sham tDCS. Forty women diagnosed with PVD, by
      a gynecologist following a standardized protocol will be randomized to either active or sham
      tDCS for ten 20 minute sessions of 2 mA stimulation over a 2-week period. Outcome measures
      will be collected at baseline, after treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome
      is pain during intercourse assessed with a numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary
      measurements focus on sexual function, vestibular pain sensitivity, psychological distress,
      treatment satisfaction and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The investigators
      expect that active tDCS treatment will significantly reduce pain during intercourse
      (post-treatment and 3-month follow-up compared to pre-treatment assessment). This trial will
      provide important information for determining the efficacy of a novel and promising
      intervention for women with PVD.

    <measure>Pain during intercourse (Numeric rating scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the NRS scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain during intercourse will be assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain at all, and 10 is the worst pain ever. This method for measuring pain has been shown to detect significant treatment effects in women with PVD and demonstrates a significant positive correlation with other pain intensity measures. Pain during intercourse is the main symptom of PVD and the one that most interferes with quality of life, hence the most relevant measure of functional outcome (Bergeron et al., 2008; Bergeron et al., 2001; Morin et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2011).</description>

    <time_frame>Change in the McGill-Melzack scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The McGill-Melzack questionnaire allows the assessment of sensory, affective and evaluative components of pain. This world-renowned questionnaire, studied for its validity, reliability and responsiveness to change, is commonly used in RCTs (Bergeron et al., 2001; Melzack, 1975; Davidoff et al., 1987; Hays et al., 1994; Bansal et al., 2009; Moy et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2010).</description>

    <measure>Vestibular sensitivity (algometer)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the pain threshold and pain tolerance scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A gradual pressure (1 to 1000 g) will be applied to three distinct points of the vestibule at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions (Cyr et al., 2014). Each of these pressure points will be applied randomly (e.g. 3,6,9 or 3,9,6 or 6,9,3.). During this procedure, each participant will be asked to indicate when they start to feel pain (pain threshold) and subsequently the maximal pressure that can be tolerated (pain tolerance). Pain intensity is assessed throughout the test using a Computerized Visual analog scale (CoVas). This assessment has shown good reliability and validity (Cyr et al., 2014).</description>

    <measure>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the FSFI scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a multidimensional measure of sexual function evaluating desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. In addition to good psychometric properties (reliability, internal consistency and responsiveness to change (Rosen et al., 2000; Goldfinger et al, 2009), normative data are available for this questionnaire suggesting clinical level of dysfunctions (Wiegel et al., 2005).</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the PCS scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing will be assessed using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995), which consists of 13 items measuring exaggerated negative thoughts and feelings about the meaning of pain. Items are scored on a 5-point scale with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS is a reliable and valid measure that has demonstrated a stable factorial structure across clinical and general populations, including a French population (French et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2000; Sullivan, et al., 1995).</description>

    <time_frame>Change in the IASTA state and IASTA trait scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI - (Spielberger, Gorsuch, &amp; Lushene, 1970); ASTA - (Gauthier &amp; Bouchard, 1993)). The STAI is a 40-item, well-known and widely used measure of state and trait anxiety that has demonstrated very good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha State = .93, Trait = .97) in various clinical and non-clinical samples including pain populations (Gauthier &amp; Bouchard, 1993; Greenberg &amp; Burns, 2003; Rule &amp; Traver, 1983; Tanaka-Masumi &amp; Kameoka, 1986).</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the BDI scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Depression or depression symptoms will be measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II is comprised of 21 items, with scores for most items ranging from 0 (low intensity) to 3 (high intensity) (Beck, Steer &amp; Brown, 1996; Beck, Steer &amp; Garvin, 1988). This measure of depression has been validated for use in chronic pain populations (Turner &amp; Romano, 1984).</description>

    <measure>Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the PASS-20 scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20), evaluating fear of pain, also shows good psychometric properties (Coons, Hadjistavropoulos &amp; Asmundson, 2004; McCracken &amp; Dhingra, 2002).</description>

    <measure>Patient's global impression of change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the PGIC scores from 2-week post-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient self-reported improvement [scale of 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)] and treatment satisfaction [scale of 0 (worse) to 10 (complete cure)] will be measured at the 2-week post-treatment and 3-month post-treatment structured interview in order to assess the clinical significance of results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction scale (GMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the GMSS scores from pre- to 2-week post-treatment, and from pre-treatment to 3-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual satisfaction will be assessed using the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction scale, which consists of 5 items assessing global sexual satisfaction. Internal consistency of this scale is high (alpha = 0.90), as is test-retest reliability (r = 0.84) (Lawrance &amp; Byers, 1998).</description>

    <description>tDCS is a painless technique which consists in applying low direct-current through electrodes (one electrode serving as an anode, the other as a cathode) placed on the scalp to target the cerebral cortex. In patients with chronic pain, the anode is commonly placed over the motor cortex (M1) (Valeriani et al., 1999).</description>
