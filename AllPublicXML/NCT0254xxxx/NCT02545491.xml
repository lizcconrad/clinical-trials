  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Responsive stimulation and/or enhanced nutrition interventions delivered to
      children through health programs shows improved cognitive, language, and motor, and the
      social-emotional status. This could benefit young children in Lebanon and worldwide to
      improve their developmental potential.

      Aim: This study aims to implement Care for Child Development (CCD) intervention for children
      aged 0-3 years within a supportive environment in Day Care Centers and to investigate its
      effectiveness on early child development.

      Methodology: CCD program will be implemented in 10 randomly selected daycare centers in
      Lebanon where three providers in each center will be trained (CCD-group). Another group of 10
      day care centers will serve as controls (WV-group). 228 Children in each group will receive
      either early stimulation based on CCD and education from the World Vision Infant and Young
      Child Feeding (WV-IYCF) project (CCD-group) or education from the WV-IYCF project (WV-group).
      Caregivers' knowledge and behaviors will be assessed before and after the intervention using
      a predetermined questionnaire and behavioral checklist. Early child development will be
      assessed using Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) and Bayley Scale for infant
      Development (BSID-III).

      Expected Outcome: Implementation of CCD program in day care centers will be feasible and will
      lead to enhanced early child development. This study will serve as a prototype for program
      implementation throughout the country and the region.

      This study aims at testing the implementation and effectiveness of the CCD program on early
      child development in selected day care centers in Beirut. It is being conducted in
      collaboration with World Vision and the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.

      Day Care centers are invited by the ministry of health to participate in this proposed study.

      After securing the approval of the Center's director, caregivers working at those day care
      centers are being invited to participate in this study.

      Those caregivers who agree to participate will receive either training on the CCD program AND
      early child nutrition from World Vision (Infant &amp; Young Child Feeding Project WV-IYCFP)
      (Intervention group) or training on early child nutrition from WV-IYCFP only (control group).

      The Care for Child Development (CCD) Program developed by World Health Organization (WHO)
      /UNICEF provides caregivers with recommendations for stimulating child development through
      play and communication activities.

      WV-IYCFP provides activities related to raising awareness on breastfeeding and complementary
      food introduction to optimize child nutrition.

      The Intervention group (CCD-Group) consists of 10 day care centers chosen randomly. Three
      caregivers from each center (total 30 caregivers) will attend a day-and-a-half CCD training
      at the Center of Excellence for Early Child Development at AUBMC. In addition, they will
      participate in the World Vision activities related to the Infant &amp; Young Child Feeding
      Project (WV-IYCFP). The day care centers in this group will receive a manual including early
      child development concepts and techniques to be used as a reference.

      The Control group (WV-Group) consists of 10 day care centers chosen randomly. Three
      caregivers from each center (total 30 caregivers) will participate in activities related to
      the WV-IYCFP.

      Caregivers in both groups will be asked to take a knowledge assessment questionnaire on child
      development before and after each training, then at 6months and 12 months after the
      intervention.

      In both groups, caregivers' behavior in early child stimulation will be assessed before and
      after the trainings. Caregivers will be observed delivering child care as per each center's
      routine; their behavior will be assessed using a predetermined behavioral check list
      developed based on the CCD program.
