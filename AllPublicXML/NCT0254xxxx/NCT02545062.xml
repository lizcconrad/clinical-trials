  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T2D and cognitive impairment are two of the most common chronic condition found in persons 60
      years and older. Diabetes type 2 increases with age and studies suggest that the diabetes is
      one of the risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia.

      Although there is much recent research showing that diabetics at every age have more
      cognitive impairment and dementia than non-diabetics, relatively little attention has been
      paid to the implications of this complication in the management of T2D in terms of screening,
      prevention, education and treatment adherence.

      There are now guidelines for periodic evaluation of patients with diabetes as early detection
      of complications of the disease, but so far there are no similar assessment and monitoring of
      cognitive function.

      In this study the investigators examine cognitive function in young diabetic patients (from
      20 to 55) using the MoCa test, that allows detection of mild cognitive impairment, and may be
      carried out during a visit, an annual advisory diabetes clinic.

      1. Patients on a routine visit to the diabetes clinic, who meet the inclusion criteria,
           will be recruited for the test. They will be given an explanation of the study and the
           questionnaire by the principal investigator.

        2. Sign a consent form.

        3. Performance and execution of MOCA test:

             -  Fingerstick blood glucose for pre-cognitive testing performed (to avoid testing any
                participant with a serum glucose &lt; 70 mg/dl);

             -  In the presence of hypoglycemia, the participant should be given a snack and begin
                the test only after the glucose level rises. Alternatively delay executing the Test

        4. Details from the patient's file are registered, such as: duration of the disease, family
           history, presence of macro and micro vascular complications, lifestyle, years of
           education, and the results of relevant laboratory accuracy.

        5. For each patient a medical file is opened containing the initials and serial number of
           his research. All results are then encoded and analyzed anonymously

    <description>A group of type 1 and 2 diabetes patients who meets the inclusion criteria will be done the MoCa test. A fingertip blood glucose will be made previous to the begin with the test in order to avoid doing it on a hypoglycemia event. The participants are instructed to do or respond the items in a organized manner. For each items there's a score. If the participant has 12 years of education or fewer, a point is added to his total score. At the end of the test the investigator will sum all sub items scores listed on the right side of the test paper. The maximum score is 30.
The MoCa test will be done in a control group, no diabetics, that meets the inclusion criteria.</description>

    <description>The MoCa test is actually used for the screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment . It is a one page 30 points test that can be done in 10 minutes in a routine annual visit to the Diabetes Clinic. The MoCa assesses several cognitive domains, and it is available in hebrew language.</description>
