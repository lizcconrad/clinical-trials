  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following tooth extraction ridge preservation procedure have been suggested to limit bone
      resorptive dimensional changes to facilitate prospective implant placement. While this is
      particularly true for anterior teeth, no evidence is available to establish clinical
      guidelines in posterior sites, i.e. following molar extraction.

      This research project will answer the following question:

      What are the dimensional changes of the hard and soft tissues encountered following molar
      extractions with and without ridge preservation?

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be included in this study if they qualify the following inclusion
             criteria:

               -  One molar tooth that has been identified by dental faculty as requiring a single
                  tooth extraction

               -  A dental implant is indicated and treatment planned to replace the missing molar
                  tooth

               -  Have adequate restorative space for a dental implant-retained restoration

               -  Have at least 10mm of alveolar bone height, without impinging on the maxillary
                  sinus or inferior alveolar canal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Obvious exclusions are patients who do not meet all the inclusion criteria or who will
             not cooperate with the follow-up schedule.

          -  Patients will not be entered who are mentally incompetent, prisoners, or pregnant.

          -  Pregnant women or women intending to become pregnant during the study period. As
             standard practice prior to dental surgery, females of child-bearing age are asked
             verbally if there is any possibility that they are pregnant. If not, we proceed with
             surgery and no pregnancy test is done. If the woman states that there is a possibility
             that she is pregnant, we do a urine pregnancy test to rule pregnancy in or out. So use
             of the urine pregnancy test is only done if she says she may be pregnant. [If needed:
             An over-the-counter urine pregnancy test will be provided to female subjects in the
             graduate periodontics clinic of UTHSCSA. Patients will be allowed access to a private
             restroom and the results of the tests will be read by one of the named investigators.
             Only those with a negative pre-operative pregnancy test will be eligible for the
             study.] Female patients who have undergone a hysterectomy, tubal ligation or menopause
             will be excluded from pregnancy testing.

          -  Patients who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn and standard care will
             be delivered.

          -  Clinical and/or radiographic determinations which will preclude inclusion in this
             study are:

               -  Active localized or systemic infection other than periodontitis.

               -  Untreated periodontal diseases

               -  Inadequate bone dimensions or restorative space dimensions to place a dental
                  implant

               -  Presence of a disease entity, medical condition or therapeutic regimen which
                  decreases probability of soft tissue and bony healing, e.g., poorly controlled
                  diabetes, chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive agents, or autoimmune diseases.

               -  Positive medical history of endocarditis following oral or dental surgery.

          <title>Ridge Preservation</title>
          <description>The molar extraction socket is grafted with FDA approved materials, which includes a bone graft material derived from human donors (enCore®, Osteogenics biomedical, Lubbock, TX) and a membrane (like a thin sheet of paper) covering the grafted extraction socket. The membrane used will need to be removed at a later point since it is non-resorbable (it will not “dissolve” by itself). This membrane is made of dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE) (Cytoplast™, Osteogenics biomedical, Lubbock, TX). The procedure is called “Ridge preservation”
Ridge preservation: Ridge preservation is a procedure which consists in grafting the tooth extraction socket with a bone grafting material and cover the site with a membrane to protect the site.</description>

          <title>No Ridge Preservation</title>
          <description>The molar extraction socket is left to heal by itself without any grafting material or membrane, i.e. “Spontaneous Healing” (No ridge preservation is performed)
