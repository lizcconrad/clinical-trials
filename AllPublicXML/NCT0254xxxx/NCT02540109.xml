  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study aims to ascertain the effectiveness of HD-tDCS for adjunctive treatment
      of anomia in chronic aphasia post stroke. Furthermore, it will help explore factors such as
      alternate outcome measures, subject selection criteria, and benefits of extended treatment
      duration. These results will be compared to an existing trial using conventional non-targeted
      tDCS with the same design and outcomes. Patients will be treated with HD-tDCS while
      performing computerized anomia treatment. The basis behind this method is that language
      therapy is mediated by cortical areas that are most effectively activated during the training
      tasks, thus increasing electric stimulation in these areas may improve learning outcomes. To
      better understand the long term benefits of the adjunctive treatment, patients will be
      screened again four weeks and six months after study using the same anomia tests. If HD-tDCS
      shows promising results in increasing the learning outcomes of anomia treatment, a Phase III
      trial can be considered.

    <description>Determine alternate outcome measures, such as naming performance at 4 weeks and 6 months after treatment and improvements in more general discourse performance. An additional secondary exploratory objective is to perform a screening comparison of HD-tDCS with historical data on conventional non-targeted tDCS using sponge electrodes.</description>
