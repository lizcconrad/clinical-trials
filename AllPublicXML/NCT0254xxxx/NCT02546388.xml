    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study to find out if a drug called OctreoScan or DOTATATE can
      help doctors diagnose people with cardiac sarcoidosis better.

      OctreoScan and DOTATATE are both approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      diagnose certain tumors.

    <measure>Visual signal of OctreoScan or DOTATATE in the heart</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate if patients with clinically suspected cardiac sarcoidosis exhibit a myocardial OctreoScan or DOTATATE signal high enough (heart-to-blood pool ratio â‰¥ 2.0) to be visually detected compared to a control group of individuals (expected heart-to-blood pool ratio of ~ 1.0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early versus delayed imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate whether 4-hour (early) compared to 24-hour (delayed) post-OctreoScan injection imaging yields similar lesion detection performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate localization and number of increased foci</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To correlate localization and number of increased radiotracer foci between FDG-PET and OctreoScan or between FDG-PET and DOTATATE studies.</description>

    <description>Patients with biopsy-proven extra-cardiac sarcoidosis OR atypical findings on FDG PET and MRI without previous biopsy will be recruited to receive an injection of the FDA-approved radiotracer Indium-111 Pentreotide (OctreoScan) or Gallium-68 DOTATATE. The imaging protocol will consist of imaging at 4 and 24 hours after OctreoScan injection or 1 hour after injection for DOTATATE.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals aged 18 or older

          -  Documentation of biopsy-proven sarcoidosis OR patients with typical findings on FDG
             PET and MRI without previous biopsy

          -  Clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement defined as the presence of any of the
             following: high-degree A-V nodal block, complete bundle branch block, reduced left or
             right ventricular systolic function, any cardiac arrhythmia, and/or unexplained chest
             pain, dyspnea or syncope

          -  PET/CT imaging demonstrating abnormal myocardial FDG uptake consistent with active
             inflammatory myocardium.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Initiation of steroids or any other immunosuppressive medication(s) following the
             completion of FDG-PET, as these medications, in theory, may subsequently suppress
             OctreoScan or DOTATATE uptake in the heart.

          -  Patients with history of neuroendocrine tumors (specially insulinomas)

          -  Patients taking the medication Octreotide

          -  Patients on total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
