      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HER2-CAR-T cell Infusion
      for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By enrolling patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer adapted to enrolled criteria,
      this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy
      of HER2-CAR-T cell infusion for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.The CAR consists of a
      HER-2 targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta
      and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus
      vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning
      treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse
      reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
