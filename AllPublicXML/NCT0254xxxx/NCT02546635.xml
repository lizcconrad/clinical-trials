  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A: Food effect (a single oral dose of 500 mg AX-024.HCl under fasted and fed states)
      Eight (8) healthy male volunteers will receive a single dose of 500 mg AX-024.HCl in the
      fasted state (10 h overnight fast), and will return 2 weeks later to receive the same dose of
      AX-024.HCl following a meal.

      Part B: Multiple doses (a once daily dose of AX-024.HCl or Placebo for 10 days).

      Part B is a double-blind, dose escalating, placebo controlled, randomised, multiple dose
      study to assess the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics in 24 healthy male subjects.
      Subjects will be allocated to one of 2 dosing cohorts. Each cohort will have 12 subjects with
      9 subjects randomised to receive AX-024.HCl and 3 subjects randomised to receive placebo.

      There will be a data review following each dose level. Dose administration in the subsequent
      cohorts will only proceed after satisfactory data review on the blinded safety data and
      plasma PK data in the previous cohort.
