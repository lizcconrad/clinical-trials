  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilia is a rare and serious congenital defect of blood coagulation due to a genetic
      mutation on a sexual chromosome. It affects quasi-essentially the men and it is responsible
      for bleeding. There are two types of haemophilia: Haemophilia A, (85 % of cases), due to a
      factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency and Haemophilia B (15 % of cases) due to factor IX (FIX)
      deficiency. According to the intensity of the defect, there are three forms of haemophilia:
      severe (FVIII or FIX lower than 1 %), moderate (factor level between 1 and 5 %), minor
      (factor level between 5 and 40 %). For a same level of factor VIII or IX, hemorrhagic
      manifestations are variable from one patient to the other. Moreover, several studies showed
      that haemophilic B patients bleed less and consume fewer anti-hemophilic concentrate that
      haemophilic A patients.

      The main inhibitors of the coagulation are antithrombin, Protein C-Protein S-Thrombomodulin
      system, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). TFPI is the specific and exclusive
      inhibitor of tissue factor pathway that is the main way by which plasmatic coagulation
      starts. TFPI is a potent direct inhibitor of factor Xa and Xa-dependent inhibitor of the
      VIIa-Tissue Factor (TF) complex. In hemophilic patient, the production of Xa by the
      amplification pathway being strongly altered because of factor VIII or IX deficiency,
      thrombin generation (via Xa) comes exclusively from TFPI regulated tissue factor pathway. We
      can thus say that if haemophilic patients bleed, it is also because of the presence of TFPI
      that inhibits at the same time Xa and the complex TF-VIIa as soon as factor Xa is generated.

    <description>Hemorrhagic score is established on the 5 to 10 last years. For severe hemophilic patients: it will use a composite scoring system designed to reflect the clinical severity of haemophilia and named HSS for Haemophilia Severity Score (HSS). It consists in the sum of three components: annual incidence of joint bleeds, orthopedic joint score and annual factor utilization. The orthopedic joint score combines pain and physical examination scores as recommended by the orthopedic Advisory Committee of the World Federation of Haemophilia.
For mild or moderate hemophilic patients, HSS is not suitable. A composite measure will be used and consist in all bleeding events and consumption of factor concentrate in surgical situation.
Free TFPI levels will be measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's recommendations</description>
