    <textblock>
      A clustered randomized controlled trial (CRCT) was employed where participating high school
      sites were randomly assigned either to a treatment group that implemented the Positive
      Prevention PLUS program or a control group. Students completed a self-administered survey at
      baseline (prior to program implementation) and a 6 month follow-up survey (post program
      implementation). Eligible students in the sample included all male and female 9th-grade
      students from 21 high schools enrolled in mandatory 9th-grade health, science, or physical
      education classes, to which the district assigns students randomly. Of the 7,042 eligible
      students, 4,267 received parental consent and were enrolled in the study. Outcome variables
      include initiation of sexual activity, ever been pregnant, and birth control use.
