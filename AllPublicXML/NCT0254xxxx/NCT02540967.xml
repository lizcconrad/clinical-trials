      The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Gadovist.

      This is a prospective, non-interventional, continuous submission safety study that includes
      patients who planned Gadolinium (Gd) contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in
      accordance with approved label. The investigator will have made the choice of Gd enhanced MRI
      (the decision to use Gadovist according the Japanese Package Insert prior to enrolling the
      patient in this study).

      The study period is 3 years. Data analysis period is 1 year. In total, 3300 patients will be
      recruited.

      For each patient, data are collected as defined in the case report form (CRF) at the visit
      for MRI examination (as per investigators routine practice).
