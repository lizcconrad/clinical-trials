      The present study investigates the levels of certain soluble factors in the blood of patients
      with severe burn injury. Serum levels of different soluble factors will be correlated with
      the clinical outcome, presence of sepsis, the area of burn, and other clinical parameters in
      order to make a statement regarding their use as biomarkers in the prediction and monitoring
      of burn patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burn patients still represent a critical patient collective with a high mortality rate
      although treatment technologies have improved over the years. One problem healthcare
      professionals face is the fact that reliable biomarker which predict the clinical outcome,
      the onset of sepsis, and monitor the severity of disease in burn patients are still missing.
      These biomarkers would allow an early adoption of treatment modalities to improve the outcome
      and prevent life-threatening complications.

      Blood samples from severely burned patients will be collected over a period of five days and
      different cytokines (for example the macrophage migration inhibitory factor protein family)
      will be measured in the serum. Clinical data of the patients (sepsis, total body surface area
      of burns, abbreviated burn severity index, sepsis-related organ failure assessment, etc.)
      will be documented and correlated to the levels of soluble factors.
