      The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of time on levels of
      Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)
      biomarker levels in a population of head injured subjects over the age of 18 presenting
      acutely with a Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15 as well as in a group of uninjured control
      subjects.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects eligible for study participation will be over the age of 18 with a standard of
        care head CT result from the local neuroradiologist and be able to undergo an initial blood
        draw within 6 hours of head injury. Subjects who will be permitted into the study include
        those who will meet all the inclusion criteria and will have none of the exclusion
        criteria. Subjects enrolled into the control cohort will be recruited from the general
        population.
