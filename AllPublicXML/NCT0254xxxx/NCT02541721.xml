  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness in clinical symptomatic control and
      tolerability of LabiaStick#01 in women with symptomatic non-hypertrophic chronic vulvar
      dermatoses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar dermatoses are skin disorders that affect the vulva, causing pruritus, irritation and
      pain. Although the prevalence of these disorders is unknown, it is well accepted that the
      vulvar symptoms are a common problem for women.

      LabiaStick#01 has emollient agents whose main function is to increase the skin hydration,
      provide physical protection and decrease the symptoms and possibility of recurrence of vulvar
      dermatoses.

      The medical device should be applied once daily, in the evening, after intimal hygiene care.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of LabiaStick#01 on the
      relief of pruritus caused by symptomatic non-hypertrophic chronic vulvar dermatoses.

          -  Diagnosed with symptomatic non-hypertrophic chronic vulvar dermatoses.

          -  A pruritus score of at least 20 on a 100-mm VAS-PR.

          -  Willing and able to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Participant of childbearing potential agrees to remain abstinent or to use an
             acceptable contraceptive measure for the entire duration of the study.

          -  Participant not of childbearing potential (e.g., is not sexually active, whose current

             weeks prior to admission.

          -  Treated with daily topical therapy (e.g. topical corticosteroids, pimecrolimus, and
             tacrolimus) at the target vulvar area within 2 weeks prior to admission, which in the
             opinion of the investigator might compromise study results.

          -  Immunocompromised (e.g., lymphoma, AIDS, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) or have an
             uncontrolled malignant disease.

          -  Suffers from systemic or generalized infections (bacterial, viral or fungal).
