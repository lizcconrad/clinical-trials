    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is two-fold: first, to observe the effect of one session of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the error-prediction abilities of
      patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as well as healthy individuals; and second,
      to observe the clinical effect of 10 sessions of rTMS in patients with OCD.

      A battery of cognitive tasks designed to selectively measure several aspects of anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) function, will be administered before and after one session of rTMS in
      all participants. The first neurocognitive session will be administered in a separate day
      from the rTMS session. The second neurocognitive session will be performed immediately after
      rTMS and in the same day. Participants will perform five tasks designed to test: error
      processing, error likelihood assessment, meta-memory, response inhibition, and affect
      recognition.

      The rTMS paradigm will consist of four short trains of magnetic pulses which include 5
      minutes of stimulation with 1Hz frequency (overall 1200 pulses in one session) with an
      intensity of 110% of each participant's motor threshold, and 2 minute intervals between the
      stimulation trains. Stimulation will be applied over the dorsal ACC (dACC) using a
      double-cone rTMS coil. dACC will be precisely targeted using neuronavigation software loaded
      a high resolution MRI of each subjects' brain.

      OCD patients will go on to receive two weeks (10 sessions) of daily rTMS treatments using the
      same protocol described above.
