  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atelectasis is common during and after general anaesthesia and a number of interventions have
      been suggested in order to prevent their formation. The use of Positive End Expiratory
      Pressure (PEEP) during general anaesthesia has in recent years been questioned.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of PEEP as a single intervention improves
      oxygenation and prevents atelectasis as investigated by computed tomography compared to a
      control group with zero PEEP.

    <description>Induction of anaesthesia is performed in a conventional manner using a target controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Intubation of the trachea is facilitated by rocuronium.
As soon as correct position of the endotracheal tube is confirmed, controlled ventilation is started with a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg body weight and a respiratory frequency of 10. The fresh gas flow is set to 1 litre/min with an oxygen mixture of 40%, aiming for an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 30-35%. Positive end-expiratory pressure is set to 6 or 8 cm H20 (8 if BMI&gt;25) in the intervention group.
Unless the patient´s SpO2 falls below 90%, the FiO2 remains unchanged throughout the procedure.</description>
