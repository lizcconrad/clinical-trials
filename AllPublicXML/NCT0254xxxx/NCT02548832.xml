  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemia, is a cardiovascular risk factor of great importance whose prevalence has
      increased over the last decade. Part of the components of metabolic syndrome and consensus so
      far contemplated to increased triglycerides and reduced HDL-C as part of the elements for
      classification, which includes mixed dyslipidemia.

      Currently fibrates, such as bezafibrate, are drugs whose utility in treating
      hypertriglyceridemia is fully proven, besides reducing the risk of coronary disease. However,
      although this treatment is safe, it is not without risks; with increased prevalence of
      adverse effects as the dose thereof is increased or joins combination with a statin drug for
      the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia long term.

      Among the alternative therapies is berberine, which to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides
      may be useful in combination with the bezafribrato in the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia and
      as an option with lower cost and lower frequency of adverse events.

      Clinical trial, double-blind, simple random assignment and parallel groups. Three study
      groups of patients will be between 30-60 years of age diagnosed with mixed dyslipidemia with
      failure to control medical nutrition therapy, which by simple random assignment with random
      numbers will be assigned to one of three groups:

        1. 20 patients will receive berberine, 1500 mg / day

        2. Patients receive 20 bezafibrate 400 mg / day

        3. 20 patients will receive combination of berberine (1500 mg / day) plus bezafibrate (400
           mg / day) They were determined before and after the intervention: lipid profile (total
           cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL), weight, BMI, waist circumference,
           glucose, blood pressure, tolerability.

      Statistical analysis was performed upon the sample of subjects. Before starting the
      statistical analysis of the groups will proceed to verify the behavior of the distribution of
      the variables included by Z Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit. The distribution of all the
      variables under this test is cataloged in normal or not normal, which define the type of
      statistical test would be performed (parametric or non-parametric). However, based on the
      sample size, non-parametric tests will be those considered most suitable for application. The
      data obtained will be expressed and presented using measures of central tendency and
      dispersion for quantitative (mean and standard deviation) variables and qualitative variables
      are expressed as frequencies and percentages.
