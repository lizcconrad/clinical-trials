      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or
      grade 3b follicular lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and rituximab, may
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab
      together with combination chemotherapy may be with a better treatment for diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when co-administered with
      full-course RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine
      sulfate, and prednisone) in subjects with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess clinical outcomes including response rate, event-free survival, and overall
      survival after MK-3475 + RCHOP induction for subjects with previously untreated DLBCL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure baseline expression of proteins in the programmed death-1 (PD-1) family on
      tumor cells and coexisting immune infiltrates, using archival tissue when available.

      II. To measure peripheral blood T cell subsets before and after treatment using flow
      cytometry, and to measure baseline vitamin D (25-hydroxy, total).

      III. To explore relationships with these parameters and likelihood of response to therapy and
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and prednisone
      orally (PO) on days 1-5. Patients also receive rituximab IV, cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 2 of course 1 and on day 1 of subsequent
      courses. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up to 5 years.
