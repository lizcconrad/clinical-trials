  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Non Invasive Ventilation are effective in
      prevention of reperfusion pulmonary edema after pulmonary artery angioplasty. Our hypothesis
      is that administration of Non Invasive Ventilation during the procedure and systematically in
      post procedure period is a protective factor against the development and severity of
      reperfusion pulmonary edema.

    <description>Patients will not receive the NIV during the procedure of pulmonary angioplasty; in case of respiratory decompensation in post procedure period they will receive NIV during the whole hospitalization in PACU according to the following criteria: paradoxical breathing, respiratory rate above 25/minutes, a ratio of arterial oxygen pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen values (PaO2/FiO2) below 200.</description>

    <description>The same amount of blood sample is collected from both arms of study at the same time of the procedure.
In each patient, in the per procedure period, a total of 50 milliliters of blood sample is drawn from the pulmonary circulation downstream and upstream of obstructive lesion, the trunk of pulmonary artery, the superior vena cava and the femoral arterial line prior to angioplasty and at the end of procedure; in the post interventional care unit 10 milliliters of blood sample will be draw daily from the superior vena cava catheter line and femoral arterial line.</description>
