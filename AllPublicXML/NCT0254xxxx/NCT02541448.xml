      This study is designed to evaluate physician preference related to the use of the SURGIQUEST
      AIRSEAL® INSUFFLATION SYSTEM (AIS) at low verses high pressure for the management of
      pneumoperitoneum.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate physician preferences related to use of the
      SurgiQuest AirSeal Insufflation System (AIS) used at low vs. higher pressures for maintaining
      pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic/robotic surgical procedures.

      The study is designed and powered to demonstrate superiority of the AIS used at low
      insufflation pressure (9±mmHg ±1mmHg) vs higher pressure (15mmHg ±1mmHg) in relation to a
      single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain. Patients will be randomized 1:1
      to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9±1mmHg) or to AIS with an insufflation
      target pressure of 15±1mmHg.

      Secondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and
      medication use, procedure time, the number of procedure interruptions, length of hospital
      stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal CO2 and the frequency of adverse
      events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population undergoing
      laparoscopic/robotic surgery.

    <description>The SurgiQuest AirSeal Optical Trocar &amp; Cannula System with integrated Insufflator DPIS 2000 (the &quot;DPIS 2000 System&quot;) is intended for use in diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopic procedures to distend the peritoneal cavity by filling it with gas (establish and maintain pneumoperitoneum), to establish and maintain a path of entry for endoscopic instruments, and to evacuate surgical smoke. The trocar of the DPIS 2000 System is indicated for use with or without visualization.</description>
