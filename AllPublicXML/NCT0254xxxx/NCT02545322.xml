      Aim of this study is the clinical evaluation of an image-guided adaptive radiotherapy
      concept. This involves the adaption of the radiotherapy treatment plan according to changes
      in tissues and variations in patients position and posture during a radiotherapy treatment
      course, based on repeat CT scans.

      It is investigated, if dosimetric improvements can be achieved using this approach and if the
      method using the software-package &quot;ReDeform&quot; can be implemented in clinical Routine.

      Aim of this study is the clinical evaluation of an image-guided adaptive radiotherapy (ART)
      concept. This involves the adaption of the radiotherapy treatment plan according to changes
      in tissues and variations in patients position and posture during a radiotherapy treatment
      course, based on repeat CT scans.

      It is prospectively investigated, if dosimetric improvements can be achieved using this
      approach and if the method using the software-package &quot;ReDeform&quot; can be implemented in
      clinical Routine. For that purpose 2 repeat CT scans are acquired during the radiotherapy
      course (week 3 and week 5 of radiotherapy). The Initial CT scan is &quot;matched&quot; to the follow-up
      CT-scan by means of deformable image registration.

    <description>Dose coverage of the planning target volume: Number of participants with a decrease in the planning target volume (PTV) coverage (D98%) above 5%. The Parameter &quot;D98%&quot; denotes the minimum dose to 98% of the volume according to the ICRU (International Commission on Radiation Units &amp; Measurements) Report No. 62. It is a widely accepted classification index for dose coverage.
The &quot;Planing Target Volume&quot; is a volume, consisting of the clinical target volume and additional safety margins, that should receive a certain radiation dose.</description>

    <description>Follow-up CT scans during week 3 and week 5 of Treatment
Image-guided adaptive Radiotherapy arm:
Follow-up CT scans are performed on a conventional CT-simulator. Deformable Image Registration between the planning-CT and the follow-up CT (fCT) is done using a dedicated Software package. Delineations for target volumes and organs at risk are transferred to the fCT based on the Deformation vector fields calculated during deformable Image registration. Volumetric changes in target volumes and organs-at-risk are assessed. The initial treatment plan is transferred to the fCT scan. Dosimetric consequences of morphologic changes are analysed with the Focus on target dose coverage for the planning target volume. Adaption and plan re-optimisation are performed.</description>

          <title>Adaptive Radiotherapy</title>
          <description>Follow-up CT scans during week 3 and week 5 of Treatment
Image-guided adaptive Radiotherapy arm:
Follow-up CT scans are performed on a conventional CT-simulator. Deformable Image Registration between the planning-CT and the follow-up CT (fCT) is done using a dedicated Software package. Delineations for target volumes and organs at risk are transferred to the fCT based on the Deformation vector fields calculated during deformable Image registration. Volumetric changes in target volumes and organs-at-risk are assessed. The initial treatment plan is transferred to the fCT scan. Dosimetric consequences of morphologic changes are analysed with the Focus on target dose coverage for the planning target volume. Adaption and plan re-optimisation are performed.</description>
