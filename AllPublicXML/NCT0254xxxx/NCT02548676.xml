  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes for blindness in industrialized countries. It is
      characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, morphological changes in the
      optic nerve head and a characteristic loss of visual field. It has been speculated for a long
      time that vascular factors may also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. This
      concept has been supported by several epidemiological studies showing that small retinal
      vessel calibre are associated with the disease. In the recent years tremendous enhancements
      in the field of optical coherence tomography has been achieved. These developments made it
      possible to visualize the retinal vasculature in a full depth manner without the application
      of an intravenous marker. The proposed study tests the hypothesis that patients with glaucoma
      show altered vascular morphology compared to healthy subjects. This is of importance because
      it may clarify the degree of vascular involvement in glaucoma.

    <description>This measurement will be obtained after the dilation of the pupil. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive optical imaging modality enabling cross-sectional tomographic in vivo visualization of internal microstructure in biological systems. In ophthalmology OCT has become a standard device in visualizing the retina and is also considered a standard tool in the diagnosis of retinal disease. In optical angiography blood vessels contrasting against static tissue are visualized in a full depth resolved and label-free manner.</description>
