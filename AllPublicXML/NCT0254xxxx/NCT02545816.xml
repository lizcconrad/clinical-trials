  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After any acute brain injury, a primary pathophysiological response arises, enabling the
      brain to develop seizures and/or a status epilepticus (SE). These are frequently reported in
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with traumatic brain injury and brain
      injury caused by subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. Seizures can be presented without
      any clinical motor signs, which are then termed as nonconvulsive, and therefore remain
      frequently clinically unrecognized. As such, it is of great importance that these patients
      are diagnosed as early as possible since the increased metabolic demand and blood flow
      associated with an epileptic insult may further compromise the brain at risk. Thus far,
      continuous EEG (cEEG) is the only clinical instrument that is able to detect the development
      of early epileptic activity. Unfortunately, cEEG is not available in most ICUs and is
      labor-intensive, expensive and difficult to interpret for non-trained physicians. Therefore,
      a more simple and prognostic accurate EEG device is highly warranted to detect seizures in an
      early stage so that patients might benefit from a specific and early treatment. A validation
      study in comatose patients with an acute neurological insult will be conducted to provide
      evidence that simplified Bispectral Index EEG monitoring has the potential to detect
      epileptic activity as reliable as its gold standard, full EEG monitoring. Thereby, BIS EEG
      monitoring could possibly be used to facilitate the prognostication and management of
      epileptic seizures in this patient cohort which could eventually improve the clinical
      outcome.

    <description>The Bispectral Index (BIS) EEG monitor is a simplified EEG monitoring device which was originally designed to monitor the depth of hypnosis during general anesthesia. It does this by analyzing changes in the processed electroencephalogram (EEG) which occur with the hypnotic state and creating a measure (or index) indicative of these changes. A number between 0 and 100 is derived, with values above 70 associated with an awake state. The monitor also provides a single channel EEG, an electromyogram (EMG) and an index of signal quality (SQI), all in real time.</description>
