  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-period crossover study is
      to assess the effect of single oral doses of MK-1064 on latency to persistent sleep (LPS) as
      measured by polysomnography (PSG) in healthy young male participants, and to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of single oral doses of MK-1064 and MK-6096 in healthy young male
      participants. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that at least one dose of MK-1064 is
      superior to placebo in decreasing LPS in healthy male participants as assessed by PSG.

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Choice Reaction Time (CRT) Following Single Doses of MK-1064 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 10 hours post dose, within each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>CRT assessment used in this study is a two-choice, computer-controlled test in which the participant responds to stimulus words presented on the screen of a laptop computer. During the test either the word &quot;NO&quot; or the word &quot;YES&quot; is presented on the screen and the participant is instructed to press the corresponding button as quickly as possible. There are 50 trials for which each stimulus word is chosen randomly with equal probability and there is a varying inter-stimulus interval. The mean reaction time of accurate responses is determined. The assessment is performed pre-dose and at 10 hours post dose. The outcome measure is change from baseline to post dose in reaction time.</description>

          <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE.</description>

        <description>CRT assessment used in this study is a two-choice, computer-controlled test in which the participant responds to stimulus words presented on the screen of a laptop computer. During the test either the word &quot;NO&quot; or the word &quot;YES&quot; is presented on the screen and the participant is instructed to press the corresponding button as quickly as possible. There are 50 trials for which each stimulus word is chosen randomly with equal probability and there is a varying inter-stimulus interval. The mean reaction time of accurate responses is determined. The assessment is performed pre-dose and at 10 hours post dose. The outcome measure is change from baseline to post dose in reaction time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CRT Following Single Doses of MK-6096 and Placebo</title>
        <description>CRT assessment used in this study is a two-choice, computer-controlled test in which the participant responds to stimulus words presented on the screen of a laptop computer. During the test either the word &quot;NO&quot; or the word &quot;YES&quot; is presented on the screen and the participant is instructed to press the corresponding button as quickly as possible. There are 50 trials for which each stimulus word is chosen randomly with equal probability and there is a varying inter-stimulus interval. The mean reaction time of accurate responses is determined. The assessment is performed pre-dose and at 10 hours post dose. The outcome measure is change from baseline to post dose in reaction time.</description>

Note: Data included are those obtained from subjects during MK-6096 dose in Period 5 and during administration of placebo in any period. 1 subject took placebo within Periods 1-4 and also in Period 5.
