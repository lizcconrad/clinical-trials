      The aim of this phase I/II trial is induction of anti leukemic T cell immunity in a clinical
      situation of &quot;minimal residual disease&quot;. This might be a strategy to immunologically
      eradicate the residual leukemia cells. Patients to be included are chronic phase bcr/abl+ CML
      (chronic myeloid leukemia) patients in stable cytogenetic and/or molecular remission.

      These patients can be included if they have:

        1. not achieved a CMR (complete molecular response) or

        2. achieved bcr/abl &lt; 10% on qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) (=MCyR) (Major
           cytogenic Response), but less than a CCyR (complete cytogenic Response).

      Autologous DC (Dendritic cells), generated under GMP (Good manufacturing conditions)
      conditions, are used as a vaccine. These DC constitutively express all putative tumor
      antigens. In order to ensure sufficient presentation of distinct CML-related antigens,
      particularly in good responders to TKIs, DC are additionally pulsed with peptides from
      bcr/abl, WT-1 (Wilms Tumor Protein) and proteinase-3. Monitoring of T cell reactivity against
      these peptides can then serve as surrogate marker for anti leukemic immunity induced by the
      vaccine. Vaccination is performed with 10^7 DC i.d. (intra dermal) in weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 11,
      14, 17, 20, 23 and 26. KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) is used as an adjuvant for vaccine
      preparations in weeks 3, 5 and 8 (and 11).
