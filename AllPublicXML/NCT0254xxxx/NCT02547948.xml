      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19-targeting CAR T
      Cells infusion for B Cell Lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 will be evaluated for safety and
      efficacy in patients with B cell lymphoma or leukemia. The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting
      antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28.
      Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior
      to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell
      infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of
      CAR T cells and efficacy.

    <description>In interventional studies, participants are assigned to accept CD19-targeting CAR T Cells infusion so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. Arm refers to each group or subgroup of participants in a clinical trial that receives specfic interventions (or no intervention) according to the study protocol. This is decided before the trial begins.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell lymphoma.

          2. Measurable disease.

          3. Performance status ECOG 0-2.

          4. Age:18-80.

          5. Fertile females/males must consent to use contraceptives during participation of the
             trial.

          6. Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant medical or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from
             giving informed consent or from following the study procedures.

          2. Patients with primary CNS lymphoma.

          3. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          4. Active and/or severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic
             infections, active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or active hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             infection).

          5. Other serious underlying medical conditions, which, in the Investigator's judgment,
             could impair the ability of the patient.

          6. Treatment with an investigational product within 30 days prior to enrollment, or at
             least 5 half lives of that drug, which is longest.

          7. Patients that do not consent to that tissue and blood samples are stored in a biobank.

          8. Pregnancy.
