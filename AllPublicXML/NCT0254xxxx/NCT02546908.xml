    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document prostate cancer (PC) management including diagnosis,
      prognosis, treatment, and care in real-world practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient number of persons
      over a sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the
      selection of the study group), longitudinal, observational registry (clinical study in which
      participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the
      investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions [as in an interventional
      study])of PC participants. The following 3 participant cohorts will be enrolled: high-risk
      localized PC, non-metastatic biochemically recurrent PC, and metastatic PC. This is an
      observational study and treatment decisions and clinical management of participants will
      follow routine clinical practice. Medical care given to participants will not be influenced
      by participation in the study. Enrolled participants will be prospectively followed
      throughout their course of treatment, during which data on PC treatment, clinical
      progression, and outcomes (including death) will be collected. At the end of registry medical
      resource utilization (MRU) will also be collected. The maximum observational period will be 5
      years. Safety will be monitored throughout the study for participants being treated with JNJ
      products.

    <measure>Metastasis-free survival (MFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>MFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first occurrence of radiographic bone or soft tissue distant metastasis, incidental pathologic finding of distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression (TTPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTPP is defined as time from enrollment to the date of PSA progression. In participants who has PSA level decreased, PSA progression is defined as 25 percent (%) increase (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 25%) from nadir (lowest value including baseline) and an increase in the absolute value of at least 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL (&gt;=2ng/mL) and is confirmed by a subsequent measurement at least 3 weeks (&gt;=21 days; PCWG2) after the increase. In participants in whom the PSA level had not decreased, PSA progression is defined as 25% increase (&gt;=25%) from baseline and an increase in the absolute value of at least 2ng/mL (&gt;=2ng/mL) after 12 weeks.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is the new 5-level version of EQ-5D. It describes health-related quality of life (HRQoL) states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each item of the EQ-5D within these dimensions has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or extreme problems). Data captured by EQ-5D-5L relates to the patient's status at the time of completion, and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-P consists of the FACT-General (FACT-G) and a PC-specific subscale. The FACT-G contains a 27-item questionnaire and is composed of 4 dimensions of HRQoL: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. The PC-specific subscale is composed of 12 items, which span the dimensions of sexual function, bowel/bladder function, and pain. The FACT-P questionnaire has a 7 day recall, and takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>No intervention will be administered in this study. Participants with High-risk localized PC will be enrolled. High-risk localized PC involves clinical T stage greater than or equal to (&gt;=) cT3a and one of the following high risk features: Gleason score 8-10 or prostate specific antigen (PSA) level above 20 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

    <description>No intervention will be administered in this study. Participants with Non-metastatic biochemically recurrent PC will be enrolled. A non-metastatic biochemically recurrent PC involves a confirmed PSA value of &gt;0.2 ng/mL following prostatectomy (European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines), a PSA value of 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir following radiation therapy (American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines).</description>
