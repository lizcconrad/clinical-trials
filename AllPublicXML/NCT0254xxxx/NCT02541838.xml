    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes results in a host of neuromuscular, muscular, and autonomic system
      impairments that accelerate age-associated limitations in functional independence and the
      risk of falls. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) contributes to functional declines in
      balance and mobility because of limitations metabolic abnormalities. The constellation of
      impairments accompanying type 2 diabetes diminishes muscle function and performance including
      strength and power. Loss of strength at higher speeds of movement (deficit in power) occurs
      in neural activation of muscles, changes in muscle properties, and through in older
      individuals with DPN compared to older controls. Consequently, this deficit in speed
      dependent muscle power production leads to limitations in rapidly responding to sudden loss
      of balance stability to prevent falling. The goal of this pilot research program is to
      determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a mechanism-based therapeutic intervention fro
      improving balance and mobility functions and preventing falls in older adults with DPN. The
      investigators pan to use the results from this pilot study to design and implement a larger
      randomized control trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to establish the effectiveness of a mechanism-based
      therapeutic intervention for improving balance and mobility functions and preventing falls in
      older adults with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

      Specific Aim 1 will determine if combined high intensity isolated leg muscle power exercise
      with balance perturbation training (ActiveStep) and aerobic exercise achieves greater
      improvements in balance stabilization (protective stepping behavior and kinematics) and
      mobility function (gait parameters and timed functional measures) than a lifestyle based
      intervention that primarily focuses on aerobic exercise through underlying mechanisms of
      improved neuromuscular activation (rate and magnitude) and sensorimotor control, improved
      muscle quality, and increased blood flow to enhance neuromuscular and sensorimotor
      performance in people with DPN.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine if a neuromotor balance training program combined with muscle
      power exercise training and aerobic exercise, leading to improved neuromuscular and
      sensorimotor mechanisms, is more effective in improving clinical tests of balance and
      mobility functions in those with DPN compared with a traditional exercise intervention.

    <description>The Four Square Step Test (FSST) will be used to evaluate changes in clinical balance. The FSST is a single item, evaluator-administered tool that assesses the ability to change directions while stepping. It requires the individuals to move in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions while stepping. Changes from baseline to 3 and 6 months will be examined.</description>

    <description>The modified physical performance test will be used to evaluate changes in mobility. This test requires individuals to perform a variety of every day tests such as going up and down the stairs, standing from a chair, and putting on a coat. Changes from baseline to 3 and 6 months will be examined.</description>
