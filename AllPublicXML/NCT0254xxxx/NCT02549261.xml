  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located
      in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical
      efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the efficacy
      and safety of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with NSCLC .There is a tolerance trial of Nimotuzumab in
      Combination With Radiochemotherapy treatment before the randomization,double
      blind,muti-center sites trial of this treatment.
