  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current study was to investigate whether the consumption of vitamin D3
      enriched, reduced-fat yellow cheese can counterbalance the expected decrease in serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration during winter in postmenopausal women in Greece, and in
      what degree it can contribute as a potential food-based strategy for the prevention of
      vitamin D deficiency. A secondary aim was also to investigate any potential effect of the
      intervention in several quality of life (QoL) indices in the population of postmenopausal
      women under study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D status in postmenopausal women is of interest because of the association of low
      vitamin D status with increased risk of osteoporosis and related fractures. In addition,
      since there is increasing evidence that the dietary supply is often insufficient to offset
      the seasonal deficit in sunlight during winter months, fortified food and supplements are
      becoming important sources of dietary vitamin D intake to achieve optimal vitamin D status,
      especially in this high risk population. Although most studies have examined the
      effectiveness of vitamin D enriched milk and yogurt, there have been limited studies also
      exploring the effectiveness of vitamin D enriched cheese in enhancing vitamin D status and
      preventing vitamin D deficiency. However, fortification of cheese with vitamin D has certain
      technological considerations, particularly for reduced-fat varieties considering that vitamin
      D is a fat soluble nutrient.
