  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nanoparticles (NP) are particles whose length, width and height are less than 100 nanometres.
      Over the past decade, industrial applications of NP have increased dramatically. Despite
      their widespread use, their true impact on human health remains unknown and poorly studied.
      NP exposure in humans primarily occurs via inhalation through the respiratory system. The aim
      of this study is to estimate the relationships between the nanoparticle load in the lung and
      bronchi and some interstitial lung diseases. In the aftermath of human exposure to asbestos,
      the pathological consequences of environmental exposure to nanomaterials could be evaluated
      upon a mineralogical analysis of pulmonary samples.

    <description>The load of NP is a composite outcome. It will be described according to their level of presence (high, moderate or low), their size and chemical analysis.
Analysis: The presence of NP will be assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The elemental compositions of both the particulate (pellet) and the soluble (supernatant) fractions of each sample will be measured by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The samples for which DLS and ICP-OES corroborated a relatively stronger NP load will be observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field-emission electron microscopy (FESEM).</description>

    <description>The load of NP is a composite outcome. It will be described according to their level of presence (high, moderate or low), their size and chemical analysis.
The accurate diagnosis of the disease will be determined in accordance to the latest international guidelines, including the past history of each patient, the
professional courses with focus on potential NP exposure, environmental studies, tobacco or drug use and exhaustive research of collagen or vascular diseases.</description>
