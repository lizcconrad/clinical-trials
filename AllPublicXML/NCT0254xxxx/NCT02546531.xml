  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pancreatic cancer, targeting the tumor microenvironment has become a promising therapeutic
      strategy. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway activation is essential for promoting a
      fibrotic and inflammatory tumor microenvironment, and FAK inhibitors have demonstrated
      reasonable anti-tumor activity in the preclinical setting. Furthermore, a maximal synergetic
      effect was achieved when a FAK inhibitor was given in combination with a PD-1 antagonist and
      chemotherapy in multiple pancreas tumor animal models. This supports the concept of using FAK
      inhibitors to reduce stromal fibrosis during checkpoint immunotherapeutic treatment.
      Therefore, these robust preclinical findings will be tested in the proposed phase I trial.

    <description>The recommended phase II dose will be determined from the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) found in the dose escalation cohort.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle (21 days). Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached or the completion of cycle 5.</description>

          -  Prior treatment with systemic gemcitabine less than 6 months

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or

             are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) or any other form of

             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Patients that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidisms stable on hormone replacement
             or Sjorgen's syndrome would not e excluded from the study.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first study treatment.

          -  History or evidence of cardiac risk including any of the following: history or
             evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias or arrhythmia
             requiring treatment with the exceptions of atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal
             supraventricular tachycardia; history of acute coronary syndromes within 6 months
             prior to the first dose of study therapy (including myocardial infarction and unstable
             angina, coronary angioplasty, or stenting); or any history of congestive heart failure
             with most recent ejection fraction &lt; 45% (screening LVEF assessment without history of
             CHF is not required).

          -  Known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive)
             or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected)

          -  Requires continued use of warfarin for anticoagulation and cannot stop warfarin or be
             safely switched to another anticoagulant

             study medication.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, immunosuppression, autoimmune conditions, underlying pulmonary disease, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab and/or defactinib. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
