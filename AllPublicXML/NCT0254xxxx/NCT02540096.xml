  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a neurovascular event characterized by impaired blood supply to the brain due to
      rupture or obstruction of certain cerebral arteries, which often results in hemiparesis and
      can affect individuals of any age and sex, being prevalent in the elderly population.

      Among the main treatments available for stroke rehabilitation, most of them demands an
      appropriate structure and high-qualified personnel. Searching for more affordable treatment
      options, several studies suggest the use of mental practice with motor imagery as a potential
      therapeutic tool, since it can be performed at any place or any time the patient wishes,
      including their own homes.

      Motor imagery can be defined as the covert cognitive process of imagining a movement of your
      own body(-part) without actually moving that body(-part).

      Within this context, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of mental
      practice for mobility, gait function and speed and muscle strength of the lower limb in
      subacute post-stroke hemiparesis.

      Post-stroke patients will be invited to participate after hospital discharge, based on
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, after acceptance, participants will be randomized
      (block strategy) into two groups: Control group (Physiotherapy and Cognitive mental exercise)
      and Intervention group (Physiotherapy and Mental Practice group).

      At baseline, 4 weeks (end of intervention) and 6 weeks, participants will be evaluated
      through the following tests: Timed-Up and Go test, 5-Meter Walk Test, TUG-ABS, WHOQOL-Bref,
      DASS-21 and muscle strength.

    <description>The sessions will be individualized and carried out in a peaceful setting.The aim of the mental practice protocol was to promote motor imagery of the following activities: get up from a chair and walk and sit, which enrolls the basic and instrumental activities of daily living. The sessions will consist of six steps: (1) &quot;Physical Practice&quot; (2) &quot;Familiarization&quot; (3) &quot;Memory&quot; (4) &quot;Relaxation&quot; (5) &quot;Repeat&quot; and (6) &quot;post-practice mental relaxation&quot;. After the mental practice session, participants will be submitted to individual and structured physiotherapy sessions (the same as the control groups).</description>
