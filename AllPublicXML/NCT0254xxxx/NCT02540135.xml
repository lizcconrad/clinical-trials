    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about if fluorescein with intraoperative Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) is as good as intraoperative MRI (iMRI) alone in detecting the presence of
      tumor tissue during surgery.

      Both fluorescein and intraoperative MRI have been studied and routinely used to aid the
      neurosurgeon in distinguishing normal brain from tumor, helping the neurosurgeon to safely
      resect more tumor tissue during surgery.

      This study will enroll patients with malignant high grade glioma who are going to have a
      surgery to remove their brain tumor.

      For half of the patients, fluorescein and intraoperative MRI will be used together during
      surgery. For half of the patients, only intraoperative MRI will be used during surgery. iMRI
      is used as final verification of complete, safe resection in both arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extent of surgical resection of malignant high grade glioma has been established as one of
      the most important predictors of overall survival and six-month progression free survival.
      Unfortunately, it is often difficult in surgery to distinguish between tumor and normal
      brain. Various technologies have been developed to help the surgeon more readily safely
      increase extent of resection in order to achieve an improved survival after glioblastoma
      resection. Fluorescein has been used at some institutions for a number of years to improve
      visualization of high-grade gliomas enabling their better resection. Intraoperative MRI has
      also been developed with similar intent, allowing the patient to be imaged intraoperatively
      to determine extent of resection and any need for further resection prior to leaving the
      operating room. While there is some evidence these technologies improve extent of resection
      in comparison to historical controls, they have never been tested against each other in any
      prospective fashion.

      Intraoperative MRI has significant cost and significantly increases operative time.
      Fluorescein is a very inexpensive injectable agent and, if as good at achieving gross total
      resection as intraoperative MRI, would offer patients similar surgical outcomes with less
      anesthetic time and cost than intraoperative MRI. This study aims to investigate the value of
      fluorescein or intraoperative MRI in malignant glioma patients' extent of tumor resection in
      a prospectively randomized manner.
