    <textblock>
      Bulimic patients suffering from binge eating or &quot;craving&quot; a pressing need to eat, with a
      sense of unease and anxiety, relieved by food intake. The phenomenon of craving bulimia may
      be considered appropriately by using paradigms developed in the framework of embodied
      cognition theories.

      In bulimic, a study with 20 bulimic patients proved an automatic attraction (unconscious) for
      food in these patients, as measured by reaction time.

      Moreover, a therapeutic explored in bulimia (particularly on reducing craving), is repeated
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Studies have shown that a single session of rTMS to
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex left (DLPFC) reduces significantly the food craving among
      bulimics, 24 hours after stimulation. But the therapeutic efficacy of TMS on bulimia to more
      than 24 hours has not yet been demonstrated, and the psycho-cognitive underlying mechanisms
      have not yet been explored.

      The exams / treatments of the study include:

        -  a 20 minute session of rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz.

        -  cognitive testing and attention, which will be made on the computer before and 24 hours
           after the session of rTMS.

      Cognitive test consist in , on a computer screen:

        -  Is first displayed, food and non-food words. The patient must pull a lever to it if the
           letter A is present in the word and push the lever if the letter A is missing the word.

        -  Then presents a series of food and non-food words. The patient must pull a lever to it
           if it deems that the word has a positive meaning and push the lever if it determines
           that the word has a negative meaning
