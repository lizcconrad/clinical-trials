    <textblock>
      Currently there is uncertainty on how schizophrenic patients feel pain. Pain has several
      components including cognitive behavior which allow humans to perceive it as a negative
      emotion. It is difficult to say precisely what are the differences in cognitive processing
      between the emotional component of pain and painless another negative emotion (eg fear).
      However, pain and negative emotion have some neural networks together and there are many
      common ways between emotional processing (pain or negative) and storing information (limbic
      system).

      The study is to go 1 time in hospital for memory test. These tests consist in:

        -  Group 1: words to painful sense will be shown on a screen, one at a time for 5 seconds.
           Patient or healthy volunteer will need to retain them. Then these same words, mixed with
           others that patient/healthy volunteer will not learn, will again be displayed on the
           computer screen one at a time for 5 seconds. Upon the occurrence of a word,
           patient/healthy volunteer must press the 'L' key if they think they have learned the
           word or the &quot;D&quot; key on the keyboard if they feel that they have not learned this word.

        -  Group 2: words to negative sense will be shown on a screen, one at a time for 5 seconds.
           Patient or healthy volunteer need to retain them. Then these same words, mixed with
           others that patient/healthy volunteer will not learn, will again be displayed on the
           computer screen one at a time for 5 seconds. Upon the occurrence of a word,
           patient/healthy volunteer must press the 'L' key if they think they have learned the
           word or the &quot;D&quot; key on the keyboard if they feel that they have not learned this word.

           15 schizophrenic will be included in group 1 and 15 other schizophrenics in group 2.

           15 Healthy volunteer will be included in group 1 and 15 other Healthy volunteer in group
           2.
