  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CDH is a birth defect characterized by the development, very early in gestation, of a hole in
      the diaphragm, the breathing muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. As a result,
      the intestines and other organs in the abdomen can move into the chest and press on the
      developing lungs. This prevents the lungs from growing and developing normally.

      In severe cases, CDH can lead to serious disease and death at birth. For these babies,
      treatment before birth may allow the lungs to grow enough before birth so these children are
      capable of surviving and thriving.

      Study Summary

      All patients will complete a standard prenatal evaluation at the Center for Fetal Diagnosis
      and Treatment (CFDT) to find out if they are candidates. The standard clinical assessments
      include: Medical history and Physical exam, Level II ultrasound, Fetal echocardiogram, Fetal
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a Psychosocial assessment.

      If determined eligible, patients will be extensively counseled by the CFDT Team and those who
      choose to participate will provide written, informed consent for study enrollment.

      Up to 10 women will be enrolled in the FETO study. The mother and her unborn baby will
      undergo two procedures. A balloon will be placed in the unborn baby's airway between 27+0/7 -
      31 + 6/7 gestational age. The balloon blocks the airway and remains in place until balloon
      removal. The timing for balloon removal will be determined by the CFDT Management Team and
      can occur between 34 +0/7 - 34+6/7 gestational age.

      Mothers enrolled in this study must remain near the fetal center, under close supervision,
      from the time of balloon placement through delivery in the Garbose Family Special Delivery
      Unit.

      Weekly prenatal monitoring will occur after the first procedure at the CFDT and planned
      delivery will occur in the Garbose Family Special Delivery Unit at term.

      Postnatal stabilization and subsequent surgery to repair the diaphragm will take place at
      CHOP.

      Infants will be followed at CHOP at 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years of age and then
      long-term in the Pulmonary Hypoplasia Program study at The Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia.

The maximum duration of balloon implantation, if placed at 27 weeks 0 days and removed in the 34th week, is 7 weeks. For those balloons placed later in gestation or removed earlier electively or emergently, the duration will be shorter.</description>
