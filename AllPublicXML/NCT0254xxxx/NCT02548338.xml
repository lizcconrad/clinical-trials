  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are selecting sixty (60) with breast cancer diagnoses where the surgical
      treatment is indicated.Furthermore the investigators divided in two groups : 1) surgical
      treatment using regular electric scalpel ; 2) surgical treatment using argon plasma
      coagulation scalpel. Our primary goal is to measure the bleeding during the surgery using the
      weight of the surgical tissues used. Secondary we'll evaluate the immediate post operative
      outcomes, like infection, hematomas and seromas. All these variables will be evaluated by a
      doctor using our standard clinical record and it will be measured using reliable parameters,
      for exemple: if the investigators clinically detect a hematoma then we'll perform an
      ultrasound to take the real extension; if the investigators clinically pick an infection
      we'll measure the extension of the hiperemia; and if the investigators clinically pick a
      seroma we'll drain and quantify it. Secondary the investigators going to evaluate and measure
      (centimeters) the terminal damage caused on the surgical specimens (samples) using the
      microscope.
