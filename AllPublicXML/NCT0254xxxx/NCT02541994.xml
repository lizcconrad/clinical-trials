  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in for treatment of benign intracranial hypertension will undergo two tests that are
      not routinely performed for these patients: central corneal thickness and axial length of the
      eye. The data obtained from these measurements will be assessed to see if the correlate with
      aspects of vision loss including visual acuity, visual field status, optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) results, and fundus photographs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with benign intracranial hypertension would be identified at diagnosis from the
      general ophthalmic and neurologic patient population in the Ochsner Health System. All would
      have a baseline eye examination with visual field and optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      testing, a standard step in managing any patient with this condition. Two measurements would
      be taken at minimal risk to the patient that they would not normally have done at the
      baseline exam: central corneal thickness and axial length. These procedures are routinely
      done on patients with glaucoma, corneal disease, and cataracts without a significant risk of
      injury. The theoretical risks with central corneal thickness and axial length measurements by
      A-scan ultrasonography are related to the small risk for transmission of infection or corneal
      abrasion due to a probe touching the cornea. These tests would be performed at no charge to
      the patient and would not significantly increase the time of the ocular examination. Patients
      would have neuro-imaging studies and lumbar puncture to confirm the diagnosis of benign
      intracranial hypertension as standard parts of the work up for the condition independent of
      the research study. The authors will statistically analyze the standard measures of visual
      field function and health of the nerve fiber layer by OCT to see if any or all of the
      proposed risk factors correlates with deterioration of visual function. Data would continue
      to be collected at follow up visits related to visual fields and OCT as would normally be
      performed on standard visits for this condition. The measurements of central corneal
      thickness and axial length would be performed solely at the time of enrollment in the study
      since these measurements do not change over time.
