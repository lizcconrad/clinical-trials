      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of autologous
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) treatment for patients with primary
      osteoarthritis knee. Three intra-articular injections of autologous ADMSCs will be performed
      to subjects at a weekly interval.
