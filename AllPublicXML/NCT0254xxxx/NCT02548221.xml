  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiologic basis for relief from dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis remains poorly
      understood. Improvement of the heart and lung function may contribute to the dyspnea relief.
      But there is no data support this phenomenon. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is a
      non-invasive viewing of the heart, which can quickly assess the heart function through
      real-time images. The investigators performed thoracentesis on patients with large-volume
      pleural effusions, and utilized TTE to access the change of heart and lung function before
      and after this medical procedure.

    <textblock>
      Patients with large pleural effusions often experience dramatic and immediate relief from
      dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis. Although this is a well-recognized phenomenon, the
      physiologic basis for such relief remains poorly understood. Primary physiologic basis for
      the relief in dyspnea after thoracentesis may include the improvement of the heart and lung
      function. In some cases the improvement in breathlessness cannot be attributed to the
      improvement of gas exchange, due to the atelectatic lung(not fully expansion of the lung).
      Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is a non-invasive, real-time viewing of the internal parts
      of the heart using ultrasound, which can get highly accurate and quick assessment of the
      various heart images, though which doctors can quickly assess a patient's heart valves and
      degree of heart muscle contraction.
