      Open-labeled, multicenter phase II study of VIDL (VP-16, Ifosfamide, Dexamethasone,
      L-asparaginase) chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
      transplantation in patients with stage III/IV extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a rare and aggressive lymphoma subtype, but standard
      front-line therapy has not been established. The clinical outcome of patients (pts) with
      ENKTL after the treatment of conventional chemotherapy, especially pts with advanced stage,
      was generally poor. Therefore, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) as a consolidation could be one of promising strategies to improve the
      outcome of ENKTL. However, there have been few studies reporting the survival outcome or
      prognostic significances of front-line ASCT in pts with ENKTL. Thus, the aim of this study
      was to investigate the outcome of patients with advanced-stage ENKTL who had undergone
      front-line ASCT.
