    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy between covered stent of
      diameter of 7mm and 8mm in TIPS(transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt ).Half of
      the participants will receive stent of diameter of 7mm ,while the other half will receive
      stent of diameter of 8mm.

      TIPS is effective in the treatment of hemorrhage of digestive tract and intractable
      ascites,which are the complications of cirrhosis. At present, the high incidence of hepatic
      encephalopathy has been a major problem after TIPS. The high incidence rate of hepatic
      encephalopathy was closly associated with the diameter of the stent. We often use the stent
      of diameter 8mm in TIPS.In this study, we try to use the stent of smaller diameter of 7mm in
      TIPS,and compare the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy between the stent of diameter of 7mm
      and 8mm .
