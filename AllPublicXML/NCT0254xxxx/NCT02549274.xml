  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of non-specific neck pain is 12.1 / 1000 patients / year. Their support is
      most often based on analgesics combined with physical therapy. More recently authors have
      advocated the use of self-rehabilitation, that is to say, the use by the patient himself of
      physiotherapy exercises to perform at home regularly. However, if there are currently many
      studies on the effectiveness of self-rehabilitation for low back pain, there are few data on
      neck pain.

      In this context we have chosen to implement a prospective, randomized study, on the
      effectiveness of self-rehabilitation in patients with chronic neck pain.

      Patients included in the &quot;self-rehabilitation&quot; group will, in addition to conventional
      physiotherapy, to visit two training sessions in self-rehabilitation at the hospital. Each
      patient received a booklet including advices to perform different kinds of exercises at home.
      The patients learn the exercises with the help of the physiotherapist and have to traine
      daily at home.

      Patients will have to answer questionnaires about their pain at follow-usual consultations of
      their disease at 2 months and 4 months after the start physical therapy and during a phone
      call after 1 year.
