  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a strategy to eradicate
      intestinal colonization of extended-spectrum resistant (ESC-R) Enterobacteriaceae in
      pediatric patients.

      FMT will be performed on subjects with a history of at least one infection due to ESC-R
      Enterobacteriaceae.

      This protocol aims to determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy
      of FMT in pediatric patients with a history of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study of fecal microbiota transplantation in pediatric patients
      with a history of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
      and provide written, informed consent will undergo screening studies and provide a pre-FMT
      stool sample to confirm intestinal carriage of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. The FMT will be
      administered by nasogastric tube in the outpatient setting by trained personnel. The subjects
      will be monitored for potential adverse events, recurrence of MDRO infections, infections
      that may be related to FMT, and worsening of existing comorbidities or development of new
      comorbidities for the 12 months post-FMT with the option of participating in long-term
      follow-up for up to 5 years post-FMT. Patients will provide stool samples 2 days, 2 weeks, 4
      weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-FMT. These samples will be testing for ESC-R
      Enterobacteriaceae.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children and adolescents between 7 and 21 years of age.

          2. A history at least one infection due to ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. ESC-R isolates will
             be defined as those non-susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime.

          3. Parent/guardian and participant must be able to attend baseline and follow-up study
             visits.

          4. Subject must be willing and able to provide written informed consent or assent (as
             appropriate by age).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any history of malignancy or any immunocompromised state (e.g. absolute
             neutrophil count outside the normal range) induced by disease or therapy will be
             excluded.

          2. Patients with past or current use of systemic immunosuppressive agents will be
             excluded. Receipt of non-systemic agents such as inhaled, nasal, or topical steroids
             or immune-modulating agents are allowed.

          3. Lack of intestinal carriage of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae (negative selective stool
             culture for ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae).

          4. Allergy or hypersensitivity to omeprazole and polyethylene glycol.

          5. Pregnancy.

          6. Current history of frequent (&gt;1 per week) vomiting.

          7. Active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease

          8. Active mucositis or acute graft versus host disease of the gastrointestinal tract

          9. Concurrent abdominal radiation therapy.

         10. Inability to tolerate nasogastric tube placement or contraindication to having an NG
             tube placed.

         11. Presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or other intrabdominal device, receipt of
             renal dialysis, presence of ascites, or other conditions/devices that would increase
             the risk of peritonitis.

         12. Bleeding diatheses

         13. Patients with current active ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae infection who have not yet
             completed antibiotic treatment will be excluded until their treatment is completed
