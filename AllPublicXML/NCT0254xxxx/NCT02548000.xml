  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the effects of resistance training on neuromuscular, vascular and
      functional adaptations of elderly diabetics type 2. Half of participants will be the
      intervention group that will perform resistance training, while the other half will be the
      control group that will perform stretching sessions.

      Resistance training may be an interesting strategy to fight diabetes deleterious conditions,
      as it is known to increase muscle mass and quality, strength, functional capacity, vascular
      health, and decrease inflammation status and blood lipids, besides leading to improves in
      glycemic control. To test this hypothesis, 42 diabetic patients will be recruited and
      randomized to two groups that will be evaluated before and after 12 weeks of both
      intervention or control period. The resistance training group will perform all body
      resistance exercises three times per week, while the control group will perform a stretching
      session one time per week.

The blood pressure and the casual glycemic will be measure before and after the training in each session. Before to start the exercises, patients will perform a warming on treadmill for 10 minutes and after the training will perform some stretching exercises for muscles groups trained.</description>
