  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemia is commonly reported in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and may
      result from acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), sepsis, trauma
      and postoperative complications. In an attempt to preserve or increase the oxygenation,
      conventional mechanical ventilation is initiated in these patients. Unfortunately, patients
      frequently become refractory to standard ventilatory techniques and as such, gas exchange
      remains unaltered or becomes worse. High Frequency Percussive Ventilation (HFPV), on the
      other hand, is an advanced mode of ventilation which can be a salvage option in these patient
      cohorts as it has already been proven to improve gas exchange with success. The volumetric
      diffusive respirator (VDR-4; Percussionary, Corp., Sandpoint, ID) is the only commercially
      available system to deliver HFPV. This ventilator mechanically ventilates the lung by
      administering small successive subtidal volumes or percussions at unconventional high
      frequencies to reach an optimal diffusive oxygenation.

      Since it has been known that hypoxemia due to a reduced oxygenation results in secondary
      brain injury, it is conceivable that the cerebral tissue oxygenation might be impaired as
      well. It has been strongly suggested that a cerebral tissue oxygenation in the optimal range
      has an ameliorative influence on hypoxic events and in turn leads to a better clinical
      outcome. Thus far, no studies have been conducted to investigate if an improved oxygenation
      by means of a switch to HFPV automatically leads to an increment in the cerebral tissue
      oxygenation. With the use of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) technology, investigators will
      investigate whether this alternation of ventilation strategy is associated with a
      (beneficial) change of the cerebral tissue oxygenation.

    <description>The primary objective is to investigate whether a switch from conventional mechanical ventilation to High Frequency Percussive Ventilation is associated with a change of the SctO2. Therefore, a comparison of SctO2-values two hours before and four hours after the switch will be made.</description>

    <description>Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique that uses near infrared light between 700 and 1100nm which penetrates several centimeters through skin and bone structures. Light is absorbed by chromophores. There are multiple chromophores which can be detected in the NIR spectrum such as water, lipids, melanin, myoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Each chromophore has a specific absorption spectrum. By using different wavelengths, it is possible to differentiate chromophores. The difference between oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin can be calculated using the modified Beer-Lambert law, resulting in a numeric value which is a representation of the regional cerebral oxygen saturation</description>
