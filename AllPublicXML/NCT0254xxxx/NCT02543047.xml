      Feasibility Study to Demonstrate the Safety of the Angioshield System to Provide Mechanical
      Support for Vein Grafts Used in CABG Surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the feasibility of using an applied support
      (Angioshield) to a saphenous vein to be used in Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery. It is a
      feasibility to determine safety prior to launching a larger pivotal study. The primary
      endpoint, 30-day safety, will be assessed by recording and reporting of adverse events during
      surgery and throughout the investigation until the 30-day follow-up visit. The secondary
      endpoints, long term safety and patency, will be assessed by recording and reporting of
      adverse events and graft patency (via serial CT angiograms) at the 30, 90, and 365 day
      follow-up visits.
