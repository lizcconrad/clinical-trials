    <intervention_name>Elotuzumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Elotuzumab will be administered intravenously at a dose of 10mg/kg weekly (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-233k cycle) of the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks (Day 1 and Day 15) thereafter.
A window of -1 to +3 days is permitted in Cycles 1 and 2. In Cycle 1 and 2, an elotuzumab dose that falls outside of the pre-specified window must be skipped. In Cycles 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing may be delayed for up to 1 week as clinically indicated. If unable to administer within 1 week, then the dose should be skipped and resumption of the elotuzumab continues per the guidance document defined schedule. In addition the following premedication must also be administered 30-90 minutes prior to any elotuzumab:
H1 blocker: diphenhydramine (25-50mg PO or IV) or equivalent
H2 blocker: ranitidine (50mg IV) or equivalent
acetaminophen (650-1000mg PO)</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Written Informed Consent

             a) Before any program procedures are performed, the patient will have the details of
             the program described to him or her, and she or he will be given a written informed
             consent document to read. Then, if the patient consents to participate in the program,
             she or he will indicate that consent by signing and dating the informed consent
             document in the presence of program personnel.

          -  Other Criteria

             a) Patients must be willing to refrain from blood donations during program drug
             therapy and for 8 weeks after therapy.

          -  Age and Reproductive Status

               1. Men and women, aged 18 years

               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24
                  hours prior to the start of study drug.

               3. Women must not be breastfeeding

               4. WOCBP must use method(s) of contraception as indicated in the Informed Consent
                  Form. Because of the teratogenic potential of elotuzumab, a highly effective
                  method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) is required.
                  The individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in
                  consultation with the investigator. In this study men and WOCBP must be using
                  methods of contraception for at least 1 month (4 weeks) before and women for up
                  to 8 weeks, men for up to 90 days, after the last dose of elotuzumab.

               5. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
                  failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review
                  contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed.
                  Men that are sexually active with WOCB must agree to follow instructions for
                  method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with elotuzumab plus 5
                  half-lives of the program drug plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a
                  total of 90 days post-treatment completion.

               6. Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or
                  surgically sterile and azoospermic men do not require contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sex and Reproductive Status

               1. WOCBP not using 2 forms of effective birth control.

               2. Women with a positive pregnancy test at enrollment or prior to administration of
                  program medication.

          -  Other Exclusion Criteria

               1. Prisoners or patients who are involuntarily incarcerated.
