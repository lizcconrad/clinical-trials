      The central goal of the proposed study is to generate essential pilot data necessary to
      support an established line of research leading to future extramural grant submissions. The
      aims of the current study are two-fold: 1) to compare cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and
      gait endurance across three groups of people: (1) individuals with Parkinson Disease (PD) who
      participate in boxing on a regular basis, (2) individuals with PD who participate in exercise
      other than boxing on a regular basis and (3) healthy controls of the same age who exercise on
      a regular basis and 2) to examine the relationship between CRF and motor symptoms of PD
      (bradykinesia, tremor and postural instability). Forty-five participants (15 for each group)
      who participate in exercise on a regular basis (at least 120 minutes of exercise per week for
      the past 3 months) will be recruited for this cross-sectional study. In a single testing
      session, participants will perform the following tests: (1) clinical performance measures and
      (2) a CRF assessment. A one-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests will be used to examine
      differences in dependent variables across the three exercise groups. Relationships between
      CRF and clinical performance measures will be evaluated with Pearson's correlation
      coefficients.

        A total of 45 individuals will be enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Three groups will
        each consist of 15 individuals (individuals with Parkinson Disease that participate in
        boxing, individuals with Parkinson disease that participate in group exercise other than
        boxing, and individuals without disability that participate in group exercise other than
        boxing).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants included in this study must be between the ages of 55 and 75

          -  Be able to ambulate independently without physical assistance, assistive device, or
             lower extremity orthosis

          -  Be able to follow at least 3-step verbal commands

          -  Participate in a community-based group exercise program

          -  Be classified as regular exercisers by participating in 120 minutes per week for at
             least 3 months

          -  And have a physician's consent to undergo a graded exercise test (GXT).

          -  Furthermore, only participants that are identified as low or moderate risk for
             cardiovascular disease based on ACSM's risk stratification guidelines will be included
             in the study.

          -  Participants for the two PD groups must have a diagnosis of idiopathic PD

          -  Have a Hoehn-Yahr score of 1, 2, or 3

          -  And either participate regularly in boxing training at Rock Steady Boxing or
             participate in another community-based group exercise program on a regular basis,
             classified as 120 minutes per week for at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:
