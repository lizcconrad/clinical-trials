  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival time and the number of long time survivors after radiotherapy in brain cancer
      patients have increased for the last decades. Therefore the topic of late-delayed neurotoxic
      effects of this therapy gains more and more importance. Among these side effects, the main
      and most frequent one is the leukoencephalopathy, a diffused and progressive damage of the
      white matter characterized by myelin loss, loss of axons and vascular lesions. The incidence
      rate assessment, as well as the occurrence time, is based on retrospective studies with low
      numbers of patients, but seems to reach 30 to 50 % of the patients according to the
      follow-up. The risk seems to be increased during the first two years after the radiotherapy,
      but persists for decades.

      To gain further insight in the radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy, the objective of this
      project is to study the onset and evolution of leukoencephalopathy in a 3-year prospective
      cohort of patients having undergone cerebral radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3-4), using
      specific cognitive tests, Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) scans of the brain and predictive
      bio-markers of cognitive impairments.

      Context The survival time and the number of long time survivors after radiotherapy in brain
      cancer patients have increased for the last decades. Therefore the topic of late-delayed
      neurotoxic effects of this therapy gains more and more importance. Among these side effects,
      the main and most frequent one is the leukoencephalopathy, a diffused and progressive damage
      of the white matter characterized by myelin loss, loss of axons and vascular lesions. The
      incidence rate assessment, as well as the occurrence time, is based on retrospective studies
      with low numbers of patients, but seems to reach 30 to 50 % of the patients according to the
      follow-up. The risk seems to be increased during the first two years after the radiotherapy,
      but persists for decades.

      No complete characterization of this cognitive impairment has been done yet due to crucial
      discrepancies in the neuropsychological assessments that were used (namely missing of
      pre-treatment assessment), in the follow-up of patients and in the applied treatment.
      However, based on previous studies, it can be said that the short term memory and the frontal
      functions are mainly affected and the quality of life is exceedingly impaired. Irradiation
      schemes, in particular high doses and large irradiated volume, have been identified as risk
      factors of leukoencephalopathy. However, in spite of modified protocols that tended to limit
      the risk, the remaining occurrence of the disease suggests a high dependency on individual
      risk factors, that are still poorly known and make the individual sensitivity to develop
      these secondary effects unpredictable. Other factors such as cardio-vascular factors,
      smoking, old age and combined radio-chemotherapy are linked to leukoencephalopathy as well,
      although only few of these associations were proved in large studies. Moreover, some specific
      bio-markers could complete clinical examinations to predict risk of cognitive impairment in
      these patients. Several biomarkers could be of interest:

      The protein S-100B is a protein synthesized mainly by glial cells and cells of Schwann. It is
      an intracellular protein regulating the cytosolic availability of calcium. Its concentration
      is 30-100 times brought up in the cerebral tissue that in the other tissues. Its plasmatic
      half-life is a 1 hour, its elimination is renal. So, the protein S-100B is a marker of
      traumatic brain injury, certain neurodegenerative disorders and malignant gliomas. The dosage
      maybe so realized in serum and urines.

        -  Growing evidence implicates oxidative/nitrative damage in the pathogenesis of
           neurodegenerative disorders. Subsequent studies were undertaken showing that specific
           isoprostanes (iPs) levels are elevated in urine and blood of Alzheimer Disease patients
           and that these values correlate with memory impairments. This suggests that iPs are
           useful biomarkers in neurological diseases. Their levels could be measured in urine and
           plasma of patients.

        -  Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid, derived from the metabolism of
           methionine. Higher levels of homocysteine were associated with worse memory performance
           in a large group of older subjects. While homocysteine is not a diagnostic test, it may
           represent a modifiable risk factor for dementia.

      Highlighting neuropsychological disorders including at an early stage requires a reliable and
      reproducible assessment of the patient's cognitive state. However, a comprehensive
      neuropsychological assessment takes several hours and a qualified staff, making it difficult
      to implement in the conventional patient monitoring. The use of a simple and fast tool to
      detect cognitive impairment would help to develop a systematic approach for screening these
      disorders. A detection computerized neuropsychological standardized test (Computerized
      Cognitive Speed Test - CSCT) assessing processing speed of information, attention and working
      memory has been validated in multiple sclerosis patients compared to healthy volunteers. CSCT
      quickly detects patients with cognitive impairment, who could be then tested with more
      complete tests. It can be conducted by people with no neuropsychology training and the
      testing time is less than 2 minutes.

      This study will allow a better understanding of the impact of cognitive sequelae in patients
      treated for glioma with current standard treatments, including radiation. The validation of a
      new screening test, the CSCT, in this disease will eventually detect earlier these effects
      and possibly initiate treatment before lesions are too advanced. Feasibility of the
      implementation of the CSCT in &quot;routine&quot; practice for all patients treated with brain
      radiotherapy will be tested.

      • Objectives and methodology To gain further insight in the radiation-induced
      leukoencephalopathy, the objective of this project is to study the onset and evolution of
      leukoencephalopathy in a 3-year prospective cohort of patients having undergone cerebral
      radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3-4), using specific cognitive tests, MRI scans of the brain
      and predictive bio-markers of cognitive impairments.

      Primary objective:

      - To constitute a prospective cohort of patients treated for glioma (stage 3-4) with
      radiotherapy in order to estimate the incidence rate and occurrence time of the
      leukoencephalopathy at the end of the follow-up (3 years after first inclusion).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To validate the CSCT- Computerised Speed Cognitive Test to detect early cognitive
           impairment in this patients population compared with complete cognitive tests

        -  Estimate precisely the dose received by the different anatomical parts of the brain

        -  To study the relation between the risk of leukoencephalopathy and the received dose to
           the brain

        -  To analyze the prognostic risk factors of leukoencephalopathy (either linked to
           radiation treatment or to patients' clinical conditions) among patients with glioma
           (stage 3-4)

        -  To propose and test some bio-markers as predictive factors of cognitive impairment

        -  To study the radiological changes on MRI associated with neurological abnormalities

        -  To build a biological collection for patients treated in the Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital

      Patients with a diagnostic of glioma (stage 3-4) treated with radiotherapy in 2 hospitals
      (Hospital Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris and Institut Paul Strauss, Strasbourg) will be eligible
      for the study.

      Taking into account that about 100 patients with glioma are treated every year in the
      Radiation Oncologic department of the Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital and 50 in the Paul Strauss
      Institute, the inclusion of 200 patients will take about 2 years. Considering that the
      survival of these patients is rather short, median of 2 years for glioma 3-4, complete
      follow-up will be available for the majority of the highest glioma stages, those who are most
      likely to develop leukoencephalopathy.

      The study will be mainly observational with a follow-up of patients based on classical
      monitoring. The only additional information collected will come from a CSCT test, a very
      simple and quick test (90 seconds) to identify mild cognitive dysfunction. A detailed
      neurological assessment by a neuro-psychologist will be performed before radiotherapy, at 12
      and 36 months after radiotherapy and in case of abnormalities of the CSCT.

      Methodology

        -  Study design: Observational prospective cohort of 200 patients, who will be followed
           every 2-3 months for a period of 3 years after enrolment.

        -  Eligibility:

      Study population: Patients undergoing brain radiotherapy for glioma (stage 3 to 4) between
      April 2015 and April 2017 at the Mazarin Radiotherapy Department, Pitié-Salpêtrière
      University Hospital and in the Paul Strauss Institute, Strasbourg .

      Before the radiotherapy:

        -  Description of the cancer: histological type, date of diagnosis, treatment of the
           cancer: type of surgery (total or partial resection), chemotherapy, etc…

        -  The radiotherapy planning record: type of radiotherapy (whole brain radiotherapy,
           stereotactic radiotherapy), total and fractionary delivered doses,

        -  Results of the CSCT test and of the detailed neuro-psychological tests before treatment
           Comorbidities will be collected from medical records: hypertension, diabetes, smoking
           habits, cardiovascular diseases, etc…

      After radiotherapy, every 2-3 months:

      During routine consultations with neuro-oncologists, the following information will be
      collected:

        -  Clinical examination: brain features: intracranial high pressure, progressive focal
           neurological deficit, epilepsia… and toxicity features: alert symptoms (amnesia,
           dysexecutive disorders, gait troubles, urinary dysfunction)

        -  MRI scan of brain: tumor features: progression, stability, response and toxicity
           features

        -  Results of the CSCT test

      Additional data will be collected:

        -  Neurocognitive tests results performed during a dedicated consultation with
           neuropsychologist: before the radiotherapy and 12 and 36 months after the radiotherapy

        -  Blood samples : before the radiotherapy and 12 and 36 months after the radiotherapy In
           case of abnormal results at 2 consecutive CSCT tests (-1.5 Standard deviation (SD) of
           loss) with the exclusion of relapse at MRI, additional cognitive tests will be performed
           during a dedicated consultation with neuropsychologist. At the end of the follow-up, the
           vital status of the lost to follow-up patients will be assessed through the National
           Register for Identification of Physical Persons (RNIPP).

             -  Outcomes:

      Primary outcome Cognitive dysfunction due to leukoencephalopathy defined by both abnormal
      results at the CSCT test (confirmed by a complete cognitive test) and a MRI scan of the
      brain(exclusion of brain tumor relapse).

      Secondary outcomes

        -  Overall death

        -  Death associated with leukoencephalopathy or cognitive dysfunction ● Data analysis: In
           this longitudinal study, survival analysis methods will be applied. Occurrence time of
           the leukoencephalopathy and incidence rates at different follow-up time points (month 6,
           12, 18 and 36) will be considered. The Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate
           the leukoencephalopathy free survival function. For potential risk factors, hazard
           ratios associated with outcomes will be estimated using Cox models.

      Specificity and sensitivity of the CSCT will be assessed in comparison with complete
      cognitive test (gold standard)

      This project will involve the Neurology department and in the Radiotherapy department in the
      Pitié Salpétrière University Hospital and in the Paul Strauss Institute
