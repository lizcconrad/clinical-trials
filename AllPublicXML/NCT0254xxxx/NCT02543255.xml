    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of chemotherapy with cabazitaxel in addition to abiraterone
      acetate, prednisone, and leuprolide in neoadjuvant setting prior to radical prostatectomy in
      patients with high-risk prostate carcinoma. Half of the participants will receive treatment
      with abiraterone acetate, prednisone, leuprolide, and cabazitaxel, while the other half will
      receive only abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and leuprolide.
