      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-491. TAK-491 is being tested to treat
      people who have hypertension. This study will look at the pharmacokinetics of TAK-491 in
      Chinese people who take TAK-491.

      The study will enroll approximately 64 participants.

      The first 16 enrolled subjects have been randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin)
      to 1 of the 2 treatment groups:

        -  TAK-491 40 mg

        -  TAK-491 80 mg

      All participants will be asked to take 1 tablet at the same time on Day 1 and Day 4 to 10
      during the study.

      The following 48 randomized participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping
      a coin) to 1 of the 3 treatment groups:

        -  TAK-491 40 mg

        -  TAK-491 80 mg

        -  TAK-491 placebo

      All participants will be asked to take two tablets at the same time on Day 1 and Day 4 to 10
      during the study.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 52 days. Participants will be admitted in the clinic for the first 12
      days, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
