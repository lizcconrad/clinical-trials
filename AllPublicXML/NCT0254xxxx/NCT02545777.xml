  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is based on spleen trapped by dampness and turbid which is the pathogenesis of
      gouty arthritis.It uses effective prescription of Endocrinology of Dongzhimen Hospital.In
      this study, the investigators use multi-center randomized parallel controlled clinical
      trials.The treatment groups are afforded oral traditional Chinese medicine
      decoction-tonifying spleen and descending the turbid decoction as well as soaking and wet
      wrapping.The control groups are afforded diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets as a
      positive control drug.The outcome is evaluated by condition of symptoms remission,pain relief
      time, recurrence rate and laboratory index to determine the efficacy of internal and external
      treatment.And the research will provide optimized diagnosis and treatment program. The
      investigators hope this research will also get tonifying spleen and descending the turbid
      internal and external treatment for gouty arthritis effective clinical treatment.

    <description>This measure is a composite outcome according to the joint red and swollen, joint pain, and restricted movement(Excellent:Complete resolution of symptoms, joint function returning to normal. The score of joint pain, joint red and swollen and joint motion is 0.Effective:The main symptoms mostly disappear. Joint function is improvement, but still have the joint red,swollen,pain and limited activity.Invalid: There is no improvement compared with before treatment).The unit of measure is scale.</description>
