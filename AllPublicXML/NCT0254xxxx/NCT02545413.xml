  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional GI disorder in which abdominal
      pain and/or discomfort is associated with changes in bowel habit, and with features of
      disordered defecation. IBS affects 10-20% of the population and causes a marked reduction of
      quality of life in affected individuals.The high prevalence of IBS is accompanied by large
      societal economic burdens and negative effects on the quality of life in affected patients.
      It is divided into 3 types IBS-D diarrhea predominant, IBS-C constipation predominant, IBS-M
      mixed sub type.

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional GI disorder affecting 10-20% of
      the population and causing a marked reduction of quality of life in affected individuals. An
      altered brain-gut axis has been accepted as a main pathogenetic mechanism of IBS, which is
      associated with a dysfunction of the GI autonomic nervous system. These alterations may lead
      to abnormal visceral hypersensitivity and aberrations of gut motility. Recently, additional
      potential mechanisms of IBS have emerged including alteration of gut microbiota and low-grade
      inflammation/immune activation. These factors might lead to abnormal motility and visceral
      hypersensitivity and contribute to the symptoms. Na√Øve gut microbiota plays important roles
      in the maintenance of gut homeostasis by direct bactericidal effects and the evolution of
      both innate and adaptive immune systems. Gut microbiota is thought to play important roles in
      the pathogenesis of IBS. This is evident from the fact that IBS occurs more frequently after
      intestinal infection or antibiotics treatment. Studies have shown that the alterations of the
      intestinal microbiota are observed in IBS patients.Considering the relationship between
      alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation of gut, manipulation of gut microbiota by
      probiotics appears to be an ideal treatment modality for IBS. However, the beneficial effects
      and efficacy of altering gut microbiota by probiotics to improve the symptoms of IBS have not
      been consistent in clinical trials and therefore it remains uncertain as an effective
      treatment.
