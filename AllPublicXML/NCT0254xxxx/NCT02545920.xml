    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational pilot study of patients under the care of the Royal Free
      Hospital with chronic kidney disease who have been established on regular thrice weekly
      haemodialysis treatments in a dialysis centre,to measure the changes in blood flow in the ear
      during haemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 patients, attending for thrice weekly outpatient haemodiafiltration shall be studied
      during a dialysis session using a CE marked commercially available digital otoscope capable
      of recording digital videos of the tympanic membrane and ear canal.

      Patients will receive standard clinical care and monitoring of their dialysis session, which
      includes recording of blood pressure and changes in haematocrit and volume status during
      dialysis and noting patient symptoms.
