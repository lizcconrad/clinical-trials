  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-dimensional therapeutic lifestyle program that offers cooking and
      nutrition education as well as email-based health coaching to diabetic patients in an
      underserved Cleveland community. This is an innovative project as it is one of the first
      focused efforts within this community to improve diabetes control and prevent diabetes
      progression through cooking and nutrition as well as to systematically measure both clinical
      and behavioral outcomes.
