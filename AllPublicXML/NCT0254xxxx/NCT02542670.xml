      Colorectal cancers (CRC) are the third most common human malignancy, and are also the leading
      cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Early detection of premalignant lesions such as
      adenomatous polyps has decreased the risk of CRCs; however, cases which are initially
      undetected and progress to advanced CRC with distant metastasis are still unfortunately
      incurable. The development of CRC is a complex and heterogeneous process arising from an
      interaction between multiple etiological factors, including genetic factors and environmental
      factors such as diet and lifestyle. The challenges are to understand the molecular basis of
      individual susceptibility to colorectal cancer and to determine factors that initiate the
      development of the tumor, drive its progression, and determine its responsiveness or
      resistance to antitumor agents. Next generation sequencing(NGS)-driven genomic studies are
      already reporting novel features of cancer genomes beyond the traditional mutational
      categories. Recent advance in sequencing technology has enabled comprehensive profiling of
      genetic alterations in CRC.These methods are facilitating an increase in the efficiency and
      resolution of detection of each of the principal types of somatic cancer genome alterations,
      including nucleotide substitutions, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations,
      chromosomal rearrangements,DNA methylation sequencing such as bisulfite-sequencing and
      microbial infections. Besides the microsatellite instability (MSI), some researchers reported
      novel mitochondrial mutations in the cancer genomes. NGS technology will help the
      investigators for understanding of entire CRC genomes and the obtained knowledge will lead to
      a better diagnosis and personalized targeted therapeutics for CRC management

      Identification of the problem:Colorectal cancers (CRC) are the third most common human
      malignancy, and are also the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Early
      detection of premalignant lesions such as adenomatous polyps has decreased the risk of CRCs;
      however, cases which are initially undetected and progress to advanced CRC with distant
      metastasis are still unfortunately incurable. The development of CRC is a complex and
      heterogeneous process arising from an interaction between multiple etiological factors,
      including genetic factors and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle. The
      challenges are to understand the molecular basis of individual susceptibility to colorectal
      cancer and to determine factors that initiate the development of the tumor, drive its
      progression, and determine its responsiveness or resistance to antitumor agents. Next
      generation sequencing(NGS)-driven genomic studies are already reporting novel features of
      cancer genomes beyond the traditional mutational categories. Recent advance in sequencing
      technology has enabled comprehensive profiling of genetic alterations in CRC.These methods
      are facilitating an increase in the efficiency and resolution of detection of each of the
      principal types of somatic cancer genome alterations, including nucleotide substitutions,
      small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, chromosomal rearrangements,DNA
      methylation sequencing such as bisulfite-sequencing and microbial infections. Besides the
      microsatellite instability (MSI), some researchers reported novel mitochondrial mutations in
      the cancer genomes.NGS technology will help the investigators for understanding of entire CRC
      genomes and the obtained knowledge will lead to a better diagnosis and personalized targeted
      therapeutics for CRC management.Experimental design: The study design to attempt to identify
      the unique mutational spectrum and novel targets of genomic, epigenetic alterations in
      Egyptian colorectal cancer patients in Delta Regionusing Whole Exome and Epigenetic deep
      sequencing.Expected results:NGS-based genome analysis facilitates the identification of
      unrecognized gene mutation of Egyptian CRC cancer especially in Delta Region which may be
      biologically different from Western CRC as the environmental factors are
      different.Significance of the expected results:The results of this project will benefit in(1)
      Identification of novel features or mutation types in CRC genomes In Delta Region. (2)
      Understanding the advancement of pathway-level in colorectal carcinogenesis and (3) Identify
      Clinically relevant genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis and
      clinically actionable targets for personalized targeted medicine.
