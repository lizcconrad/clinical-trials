      The purpose of the study is to investigate the molecular biology of the tumor in relation to
      treatment response to chemotherapy, in particular paclitaxel compared to the combination
      paclitaxel and carboplatin. The study is carried out in two different, separate cohorts:

      Cohort I: Patients with large primary breast cancer (&gt; 2.0 cm) including locally advanced
      disease, are treated with weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks, before continuing on anthracycline
      containing regimen for another 12 weeks before surgery. Patient are randomized 1:1 to receive
      carboplatin in addition to paclitaxel for the first 12 weeks of the treatment.

      Cohort II: Patients with metastatic disease, available for biopsies before and during therapy
      are included to receive paclitaxel for 24 weeks. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive
      paclitaxel alone or paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin.

      High-throughput methods in molecular biology have revealed considerable alterations in the
      breast cancer genome, transcriptome and proteome with extensive heterogeneity between tumors,
      potentially explaining the large variation in response to treatment. Classification of breast
      cancer can be based on such molecular alterations, and have shown to be of clinical
      relevance. Studies on how genome-wide mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) /miRNA (microRNA)
      expression, copy number alterations (CNAs) and DNA methylation, in addition to the detection
      of circulating tumor DNA could be used to improve prognostication and aid in therapy decision
      are highly needed. This project includes a phase II clinical trial where patients will be
      randomized to treatment with standard anthracycline- and taxane containing chemotherapy with
      or without the addition of carboplatin. The study aims to include patients in two cohorts as
      described, with large primary breast cancer (cohort I - 150 patients) and patients with
      metastatic disease (cohort II - 60 patients). Essential for the study is the mandatory tissue
      samples for comprehensive molecular analyses to identify markers of response.
