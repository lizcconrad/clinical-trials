      This study aimed to investigate the clinical utility of Annexin A2 serum level as a novel
      diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to correlate its level with alpha
      fetoprotein the current marker ofhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      This study was carried out in HCC clinic , Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo; Egypt and
      included :Group 1: Fifty patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma(BCLC stage A);
      Group 2:Twenty five patients with chronic liver disease diagnosed based on clinical,
      laboratory, and ultrasonographic investigations; Control Group: Fifteen healthy, age and
      sex-matched subjects with seronegative hepatitis viral markers .All groups were subjected to
      thorough history taking, full clinical examination, and laboratory investigations including
      viral hepatitis markers: HBsAg and HCV antibodies using ELISA technique and HCV RNA using
      real time PCR for HCV antibody positive patients, AFP by electrochemiluminescence and Annexin
      A2 estimation using ELISA technique.
