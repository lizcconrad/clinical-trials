  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and is needed to improve effective
      therapeutic strategies including targeted agents.

      Poziotinib is a panHER tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) that showed stable activity with
      feasible toxicity for MBC patients as a salvage treatment strategy after failure of
      anthracycline and taxane in phase I trial. Poziotinib has rational benefit compared with
      other salvage agents, especially for patients with HER2 overexpression breast cancers.
      Additionally, a recent report showed that possible rational background for patients with HER2
      mutation-positive breast cancers.

      Based on this rationale, the investigators are to conduct phase II single-arm study of
      poziotinib for patients with MBC who showed refractoriness to conventional treatments as
      salvage treatment.
