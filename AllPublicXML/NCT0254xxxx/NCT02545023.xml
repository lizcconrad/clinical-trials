      This phase I/II research trial studies supportive care questionnaires in gathering data on
      unmet needs and health-related quality of life in Latina breast cancer survivors after
      surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Questionnaires that address unmet supportive
      care needs and health-related quality of life of breast cancer survivors may help doctors
      learn about barriers to cancer care that are linked to language, acculturation, knowledge
      about diagnosis and care, and financial concerns. Learning about unmet needs of breast cancer
      patients may help increase quality of life and decrease healthcare utilization and costs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the supportive care needs and preferences of breast cancer survivors at Los
      Angeles County + University of Southern California (USC) Medical Center (LAC+USC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the lifestyle-related challenges of individuals with breast cancer being
      treated at LAC+USC.

      II. To determine the communication and healthcare delivery style needs and preferences of
      individuals with breast cancer being treated at LAC+USC.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the demographic questionnaire, Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS)-34,
      36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Lifestyle Needs Survey. Within 1 year of
      completing questionnaires, some participants may complete a one-hour in-person one-on-one
      interview comprising questions about the challenges and experiences of cancer survivorship,
      their health and well-being, and supportive care needs.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For descriptive purposes, means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages will be calculated for each survey measure as well as for demographic variables. The remaining statistical analysis will consist of a comparison of HRQOL and all SNCS-34 domains. Correlation coefficients between SF-36 total score and total score of each SNCS domain will be calculated. All analyses will be conducted using a two-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level.</description>
