  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A goal-directed fluid management is definitely beneficial in high risk surgery. The fluid
      administration can be directed by cardiac output monitoring which evaluate the response to
      repeated fluid challenge or by preload dependence indices. These indices are not well
      validated in laparoscopic surgery while pneumoperitoneum can alter venous return or pulmonary
      compliance.

      The aim of the study is to study the validity of pulse pressure variation to predict fluid
      response under laparoscopic conditions and to describe the effect of the pneumoperitoneum on
      the dynamic preload indicators, i.e. the pulse pressure variation, the plethysmographic
      waveform of pulse oximetry variation and the stroke volume variation.

    <description>The measurements of pulse pressure variation, plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximetry variation and stroke volume variation will be performed before pneumoperitoneum at the beginning of the surgery, and will be repeated after pneumoperitoneum insufflation applying each time modification of preload conditions (applying reverse Trendelenburg position followed by Trendelenburg position). The responses will be appreciated by the measurements of the stroke volume.</description>
