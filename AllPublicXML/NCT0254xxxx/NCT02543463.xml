        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who is a candidate for a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with cementless
             acetabular and femoral components.

          2. Patient who has a diagnosis of degenerative joint disease and no bacterial infectious
             disease.

          3. Patient who is age 20 or over.

          4. Patient who signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved, study specific
             Informed Patient Consent Form.

          5. Patient who is willing to and able to comply with postoperative scheduled evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who has a bacterial infectious disease or has a high risk of a bacterial
             infection.

          2. Patient who requires revision surgery of a previously implanted total hip
             arthroplasty.

          3. Patient who is morbidly obese, defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 45.

          4. Patient who is or may be pregnant female.

          5. Patient who has neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits ability to
             evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device.

          6. Patient with diagnosed systemic disease (i.e. Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy).

          7. Patient who is immunologically suppressed or receiving chronic steroids.

          8. Patient who is judged ineligible with specific reason by primary doctor.
