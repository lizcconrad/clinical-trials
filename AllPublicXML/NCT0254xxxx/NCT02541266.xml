  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is aimed at finding out what may influence the decision of patients to
      participate in trials involving imaging so that the investigators may improve our future
      studies so they are more patient focused and acceptable in regards to scan schedules.

      This is a questionnaire study aimed at gaining a greater understanding of the patient
      perspective on undertaking imaging procedures, MRI and PET/CT, for research purposes. The
      study is to evaluate the patient opinion and perceptions of the burden of imaging associated
      with research. We will look at different scanning procedures of varying duration, intensity,
      frequency and scheduling; this will enable us to have a better understand of the factors that
      influence participation in research and thus help us develop protocols that are more patient
      focused and acceptable.
