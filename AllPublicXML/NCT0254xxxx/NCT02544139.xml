      This study assesses the specificity of Chagas Detect™ Plus (CDP) rapid test versus standard
      reference tests (e.g. RIPA or IFA) for Chagas diagnosis in the US.

      The Chagas Detect™ Plus Rapid Test is a rapid immunochromotagraphic strip assay for the
      qualitative detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) in human serum or whole
      blood samples. Reactive assay results are presumptive evidence of Chagas infection.

      This study will enroll males and females 18-70 years of age from areas non-endemic for Chagas
      infection. A fingerprick blood sample and a venous blood sample (for processing to serum)
      will be collected from each subject. Subject age, gender, and symptoms will be recorded. For
      this study, samples will have no personally identifiable information.

      CDP and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff
      members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples from
      each method independently.

        The study will enroll male and female subjects between 18 and 70 years of age without known
        risk factors for Chagas. Typically Chagas disease is a chronic, asymptomatic disease.
