      This clinical study is an open label investigation into the use of the Celluma3 for the
      effective treatment of periorbital wrinkles.

      Test subjects will visit a study center for thirty minute treatments, three times per week,
      for a period of four weeks, and a twelve week post-treatment follow up after the final
      treatment. Test subjects will have photos taken at the start, at the end of the four week
      treatment, and at the final twelve week post-treatment follow up visit.

      One of the three Clinical Investigators, will act as the Principal Investigator and all three
      Clinical Investigators will evaluate the test subjects for inclusion and final results. The
      Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will monitor the study for conformance to the test
      protocol.

      There will be seven estheticians participating in the study and there will be fifty test
      subjects recruited.
