    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to compare the efficacy of 8 mm Fluency covered stent and bare stent in
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for the treatment of cirrhotic portal
      hypertension.

    <textblock>
      From January 2006 to December 2010, the covered (experimental group) or bare stent (control
      group) was used in 131 and 127 patients, respectively. The recurrence rates of
      gastrointestinal bleeding and refractory hydrothorax/ascites, the cumulative restenosis rates
      in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5-years, the incidence rate of hepatic encephalopathy, the rate of
      secondary interventional therapy, the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-year survival rates were compared
      between the experimental group and the control group.

    <description>A one piece laser cut, self-expanding nitinol stent combining a micromesh design with a multi segmental construction.
The 36 strut, 6 bridge construction of the Stent provides an unmatched balance of radial force, scaffolding, and longitudinal stability.
The design offers crush recoverable flexibility in the most challenging vasculature, with optimal wall apposition, conformability and minimal foreshortening.
It offers a broad portfolio of sizes for the treatment of routine and challenging Iliofemoral lesions.</description>
