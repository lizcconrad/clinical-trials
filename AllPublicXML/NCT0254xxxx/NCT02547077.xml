      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 2-octylcyanoacrylate during
      repair of linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure
      with 5-0 fast absorbing gut.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 2-octylcyanoacrylate during
      repair of linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure
      with 5-0 fast absorbing gut. The investigators will use a split wound model, where half of
      the wound is treated with 2-octylcyanoacrylate and the other half is repaired with 5-0 fast
      absorbing gut. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician
      observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument. The scar width, and adverse
      events will also be recorded.

    <description>After surgical procedure, half of the subject's wound will be with 2-octylcyanoacrylate, while the other half is closed 5-0 fast absorbing gut sutures. After 3 months, subjects will return to clinic for evaluation of the cosmesis of both types of closure techniques.</description>
