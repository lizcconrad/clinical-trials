      Development and Clinical Evaluation of the Stemina Metabolic Biomarker-Based Test to Diagnose
      Autism Spectrum Disorder in Early Childhood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a metabolite signature in blood plasma and/or urine
      using a panel of biomarker metabolites that differentiate children with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) from children with delayed development (DD) and/or typical development (TD),
      to develop an algorithm that maximizes sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker profile,
      and to evaluate the algorithm as a diagnostic tool.

      A secondary objective is to define metabolites capable of classifying subtypes of ASD that
      may increase understanding of the metabolic basis of the condition, as well as inform on
      personalized therapy.

      The population targeted for this study includes children aged 18 months to 48 months,
      diagnosed with ASD or DD using behavioral criteria, and TD children, identified as having no
      indications of ASD or DD using behavioral criteria. The target size for each of the three
      groups is 500 children, for a total of 1500 subjects. The targeted male:female ratio is 4:1
      in all three groups. If the diagnostic biomarkers identified in the study do not perform well
      in females during the biomarker discovery phase, the study may be expanded to recruit more
      females to examine the possibility of a female-specific diagnostic test.

      Subjects will be qualified for entry into the study and will be invited to participate. On
      the first study day, subjects' parents will sign an informed consent form and will be asked
      questions on the mother's pregnancy and of both parents' medical history. A complete medical
      history, a physical examination, and information needed to obtain a diagnosis of ASD, DD, or
      TD will be obtained on the study subject. If possible, a urine sample will be collected
      during the visit. Up to four tubes of blood (&lt;25 mLs total) will be drawn at the clinic
      during the visit or within 14 days following this initial visit. An overnight fast is
      required prior to the visit where blood will be taken from the subject. A subset of the
      subjects will be asked to return to the clinic 30-60 days later to obtain a replicate
      metabolic profile.

      The study will be divided into a biomarker discovery/method development phase followed by a
      validation phase of the analytical methods and algorithm that will be used in the clinical
      test.

      The first 375 subjects enrolled in each group (ASD, DD, TD) will be used in the
      discovery/training set and the remaining 125 subjects will be held aside for use as a
      validation set. The training set will be used for discovery of the biomarkers and development
      of the analytical methods intended for the diagnostic test. The validation sample set will be
      used to evaluate performance of the final clinical methods and algorithms.

      Consent will also be sought from all subjects for follow-up contact up to 2 years following
      enrollment to determine the accuracy of the original behavioral diagnosis. Subjects chosen
      for follow-up will be identified based on the strength of the diagnosis from the behavioral
      scores and physician assessments as well as the biomarker profiles observed in individuals.

        Subjects will be identified as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmentally delayed
        (DD) subjects by standard behavioral techniques; Typically developing (TD) subjects will be
        recruited from the communities in which the autism research centers are situated. The
        ADOS-2 (research reliable), the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), as well as an
        evaluation based on the DSM-V checklist will be administered to each subject enrolled in
        the study suspected to have a developmental delay or autism. Typically developing children
        enrolled in the study will be given an MSEL evaluation to document that they are neither
        ASD nor DD subjects.
