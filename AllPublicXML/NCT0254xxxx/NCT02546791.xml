    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, multicenter, descriptive analysis of patients with a diagnosis of
      chronic myeloid leukemia, treated with dasatinib for at least 45 days. The study will include
      100 patients treated in different public centers in the Mexican Republic.

Absence of palpable splenomegaly
Complete Molecular Response (CMR)
Undetectable BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts by real time quantitative and/or nested Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCR) in two consecutive blood samples of adequate quality (sensitivity &gt;104) Major Molecular Response (MMR)
Ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL (or other housekeeping genes) ≤0.1% on the international scale</description>
