    <textblock>
      A higher number than expected of patients with hip fracture have only insufficient analgesic
      effect of a femoral nerve block, which is the nerve block commonly used for this group of
      patients. One of the possible causes of this failure to provide analgesia from a single nerve
      block could be the that other nerves are involved in transmitting the pain signal. One of the
      nerves that is believed to give off branches to the hip is the obturator nerve.

      With ultrasound it is possible to make a selective proximal nerve block of the obturator
      nerve.

      The aim of this trial is to test the analgesic effect of a femoral nerve block i combination
      with an obturator nerve block compared to femoral nerve block alone in a randomized and
      placebo controlled design.

    <textblock>
      A higher number than expected of all patients with hip fracture have only insufficient
      analgesic effect of a femoral nerve block. One of the possible causes of this failure to
      provide analgesia from a single nerve block could be the that other nerves are involved in
      transmitting the pain signal. One of the nerves that is believed to give off branches to the
      hip is the obturator nerve. Earlier it was believed that the so called '3-in-1-block' or the
      iliac fascia compartment block would anesthetize also the obturator nerve, and these two
      nerve blocks have been uses extensively in the emergency ward for preoperative analgesia.
      Today that is not believed to be true and consequently is the part of the obturator nerve in
      patients with hip fracture unknown.

      With ultrasound it is possible to make a selective proximal nerve block of the obturator
      nerve before it branches into an anterior and a posterior branch. A selective nerve block of
      the obturator nerve to access its effect in patients with hip fracture has to our knowledge
      never been done.

      The aim of this trial is to test the analgesic effect of a femoral nerve block i combination
      with an obturator nerve block compared to femoral nerve block alone in a randomized and
      placebo controlled design.
