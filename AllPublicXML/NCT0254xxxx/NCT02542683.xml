      1. Compare physical activity and cognitive functions between children having cardiac
           surgery with an age-matched group of children undergoing non-cardiac surgery, as well as
           otherwise healthy siblings or best buddies (or age and gender-matched children if no
           siblings or best buddies available) before surgery and after surgery or six months
           following initial assessment.

        2. Determine the effects of a structured physical activity program for 6 months following
           surgery on cognitive functions and adaptive behavior in children following congenital
           cardiac surgery.

        3. Determine the effects of a structured physical activity program for 12 months following
           surgery on cognitive functions and adaptive behavior in children following congenital
           cardiac surgery.

        4. We will perform exploratory analysis to determine whether any effects of a 12-months
           structured physical activity program on cognitive functions and adaptive behavior
           persist beyond 12 months after cessation of the program.

    <textblock>
      Mortality associated with congenital heart defects (CHD) has decreased significantly
      world-wide over the past decades. As more CHD patients are surviving beyond infancy and
      childhood, these patients are found to be at significant risk for developmental disabilities
      and developmental delay. In CHD patients, their neurodevelopmental impairments, as suggested
      by recent data from the Boston Circulatory Arrest Trial, appear to become more serious with
      increasing age. As they mature into adolescents and adults, more areas of neurocognitive
      abnormalities become evident. These abnormalities significantly influence their ability to
      function independently in their daily living and impact their quality of life. Physical
      activity has been shown to improve cognitive function in adults and improve attentional
      inhibition and cognitive flexibility in school-age children between 7 to 9 years of age. An
      exercise program has also been shown to improve self-reported cognitive functioning and
      parent-reported social functioning in older children and adolescents (age 10-25 years) with
      Tetralogy of Fallot or single ventricle physiology. Of note, neuroimaging studies have
      further documented that physical activity induces an increase in hippocampal volume which
      corresponds to the observed improvement in memory tasks. Since neurocognitive functions in
      CHD patients become worse as they get older, any early intervention that can mitigate the
      neurocognitive impairment in these patients will modify their negative neurodevelopmental
      trajectory and thus could have a major impact on the mental and cognitive well-being of CHD
      patients. The purpose of our study is to test the hypothesis that a regular, structured
      physical activity program as recommended by the American Heart Association will improve
      cognitive function and adaptive behavior in children with CHD after cardiac surgery.

      Because the blood sampling will only be performed when the study subject will be having his
      or her routine blood tests either as a part of preoperative testing, or as follow up for his
      or her clinical condition, there will be no additional discomfort or problems associated with
      the blood draw.

      The amount of blood we will be asking for the study is approximately 5 ml, of about one
      teaspoonful. We will test for the following: cytokine panel (Tumor necrosis
      factor(TNF-alpha), Interleukins (IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8), CRP and other relevant biomarkers as
      indicated
