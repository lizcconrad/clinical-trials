  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Tadalafil treatment, by lowering Myeloid Derived
      Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), can prime an antitumor immune
      response and promote a permissive environment that should increase the efficacy of anti-tumor
      vaccine in a setting of minimal residual disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a phase I/II placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients
      with HNSCC whose tumor has recurred, or secondary primary tumor is detected, post
      conventional radiotherapy with or without prior surgery or chemotherapy. For these patients,
      salvage surgery is the only standard curative therapeutic option, post-surgical recurrence
      rate is high, and life expectancy is poor. Patients will be given Tadalafil (or Placebo) in
      combination with vaccination (anti-MUC1 + anti-Influenza vaccines or placebos) prior to
      surgery, and in 3 additional courses after surgery in combination with
      anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccines (or placebo vaccines). A final booster vaccination (with
      anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccines or placebo vaccines alone) will be administered
      approximately one-year post salvage surgery. Response to treatment will include
      antigen-specific immune response and characterization of the leukocytes subset. As a
      secondary endpoint, tumor recurrence at 2 years will be evaluated to determine whether a
      trend toward a beneficial prognosis might be observed in treated patients.

      Eligible patients who are unwilling to receive study treatment but who undergo standard
      curative resection and consent to be followed for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and/or to
      donate specimens for correlative research studies (blood and/or tumor) will also be included
      in all analyses as an additional non-randomized control group. These analyses may include all
      blood tests obtained as for non-control patients at specified study intervals and DTH testing
      as for non-control patients at specified intervals. Control group patients may elect to not
      undergo blood tests and or DTH testing at any specified time interval at their discretion but
      will continue to be followed for recurrence free survival.

    <description>The primary objective of the lead-in, open-label, single-arm, phase I part of study will evaluate the safety of Tadalafil in combination with anti-MUC1/anti-influenza vaccines (TV) in terms of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-limiting toxicities (TLTs).</description>

    <measure>Phase 2 - Rate of tumor-specific immune response to protocol therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of phase II is to evaluate immune response (tumor-specific immune response of the anti- MUC1 and anti-influenza vaccines when combined with Tadalafil. Immune response will be evaluated by determining patients' immunological profile (e.g. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), leukocyte subsets, and serum cytokine levels) and immunological reactivity (e.g. through DTH skin test, T cell proliferation, by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT), specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, and immune response by peripheral blood sera) before and after surgery, and during treatment with Tadalafil and the anti-MUC1 and anti-Influenza vaccines.</description>

    <measure>Phase 1/2 - Rate of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with recurrent or second primary HNSCC after salvage surgery. RFS is defined as the time from date of Surgery to the date of first documented recurrence. All patients will be rendered disease free (i.e. no measurable disease) after surgery, thus any confirmed evidence of disease recurrence regardless of size or site will constitute the recurrence time point. Recurrence will be demonstrated by clinical assessments such as clinical examinations and tumor assessments (possibly) by CT, PET/CT or MRI.</description>
