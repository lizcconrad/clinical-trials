      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the morphological characteristics of the uterus with
      three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) at the time of embryo transfer in women undergoing
      IVF/ICSI treatment and correlate it to clinical outcomes. The uterus will be assessed in the
      3D coronal plane and measurements including the fundal wall thickness, fundal wall
      indentation and interostial distance will be performed to assess whether they correlate with
      clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate.

      INTRODUCTION

      There has been a lot of increased interest in the recent years in the prevalence and
      diagnosis of congenital uterine anomalies (Chan et al 2011; Saravelos et al 2008). This has
      been further intensified by the introduction of several new classifications for these
      malformations, including the most recent ESHRE-ESGE classification (Grimbizis et al, 2013).

      Most of the clinical interest, and what affects daily clinical practice is the diagnosis and
      treatment of the septate uterus, which is the commonest anomaly amenable to treatment (Homer
      and Li, 2000). Since the new ESHRE-ESGE classification, which has introduced a new objective
      method for diagnosis of this anomaly, by measuring the percentage of fundal indentation and
      considering to be a septate uterus when it is &gt;50%.

      To our knowledge there have been no studies as yet assessing women undergoing ART in order to
      demonstrate whether indeed the percentage of fundal indentation is correlated to either
      clinical pregnancy or clinical miscarriage. Indeed, this is of upmost importance, as the
      decision to operate on a so-called septate uterus should be based on whether it has a true
      impact on clinical outcomes. This is all the more most topical in the present era of
      IVF/ICSI, and the new classifications for uterine anomalies, as certain authors have
      criticized the new ESHRE-ESGE classification as significantly over-diagnosing the septate
      uterus which risks causing unnecessary interventions (Ludwin et al, 2015).

      AIMS AND HYPOTHESES Aim: To determine whether and to what extent a fundal indendation of the
      uterus can have a negative effect on the clinical outcomes of women undergoing IVF/ICSI.

      Hypothesis: Fundal indentations of &gt;50% will be associated with a lower clinical pregnancy
      rate and a higher miscarriage rate.

      PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Subject recruitment: Women with infertility will be recruited from the
      Assisted Reproductive Technology Unit of the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecological,
      Prince of Wales Hospital. They will be informed about the possibility of having a 3DUS
      assessment at the time of embryo transfer. Since all women in our unit undergo
      ultrasound-guided embryo transfer as a routine, we anticipate that over 90% of subjects
      undergoing embryo transfer will participate and consent to having a 3DUS assessment.

      Study design: Prospective cohort observational study.

      Inclusion criteria: Described Elsewhere

      Exclusion criteria: Described elswhere

      Power calculation: To our knowledge no previous study has been performed using the ESHRE-ESGE
      classification in a similar context, therefore a power calculation is not easily applicable.
      Nevertheless, given that the most recent meta-analysis suggest that the septate uteri have a
      relative risk of 2.65 (Venetis et al, 2014) for first trimester miscarriage, therefore, and
      for our unit the miscarriage rate is approximately 15%, 53 women with septate uteri and 53
      women with normal uteri would be adequate to demonstrate a significant difference in
      miscarriage rate when applying the ESHRE-ESGE classification. Since the pregnancy rate in our
      unit approaches 40%, and with the new ESHRE-ESGE classification our preliminary findings
      indicate that approximately 25% of women are diagnosed as having so-called septate uteri, 530
      women would need to be recruited to establish this association (using alpha of 0.05, beta of
      0.2 and power of 0.80)

      Procedure: All ultrasound examinations will be performed using the GE Voluson series
      ultrasound machines, with a standard 3D transvaginal probe (model RIC5-9-D; 6.6 MHz central
      image frequency). The examination with 3DUS will be identical to the routine 2D examination
      including an acquisition of a 3D volume which takes a few seconds. The images will be shown
      instantly to the operator and can be stored digitally onto the hard disc attached to
      ultrasonography machine for subsequent analysis. For the purpose of homogeneity and to reduce
      operator bias, the principal applicant (SS) will perform all 3DUS examinations.

      Outcome measures: Described elsewhere

      Data processing and analysis: The researchers will ensure the confidentiality of sensitive
      data by minimizing the number of personnel who handles subject data. The computer data will
      be encrypted as required to maximize security. Data processing for statistical analysis will
      be performed using the Statistical Packages of Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS, Inc). Data
      will be presented by percentage, mean and standard deviation, median and range where
      appropriate. Comparisons between groups will be carried out by Student T test for continuous
      variables, ANOVA for mean value comparisons, Chi-square/Fisher's exact test for categorical
      data. Stepwise logistic regression analysis may be performed as part of systematic analysis
      for primary outcomes. P-values of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

      Monitoring and interim analysis: As the study is perceived to be safe and poses no additional
      hazard, a Data Monitoring Committee and interim analysis is not considered necessary. There
      are no known adverse effects of routine ultrasound No extra pain or discomfort is associated
      with the 3DUS.

      Consent: All subjects will be given detailed explanation of the study and a written consent
      form will be signed by the patient and retained in our confidential records.
