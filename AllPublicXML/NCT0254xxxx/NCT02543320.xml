  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn how the brain processes pain and if using neurofeedback
      training can help teach patients ways to modify their own brain waves to decrease the
      perception of pain and improve quality of life.

      Baseline:

      If you choose to take part in this study, before starting radiotherapy the following tests
      and procedures will be performed:

      You will fill out 4 questionnaires about your pain, how you have been feeling, and your
      general quality of life. The questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete.

      You will have an electroencephalograph (EEG -- a test that measures the electrical activity
      of the brain) performed. The EEG should take about 1 hour to complete.

      Neurofeedback Training:

      If you develop pain during the first 4 weeks of radiotherapy, you will take part in 3
      neurofeedback training sessions each week during either Weeks 4 and 5 or Weeks 5 and 6 of
      radiotherapy, for a total of 6 training sessions. The neurofeedback training sessions may
      take place on any day of the week. The session can be at any time, but can be on the same day
      as a radiation treatment if that is more convenient.

      Neurofeedback training is a type of therapy that uses EEG and a computer software program to
      measure brain wave activity. The neurofeedback training will be given in a video-game format
      and is designed to teach you ways to slowly re-train your brain wave activity by using
      &quot;feedback&quot; that you will hear and/or see when your brain waves change in the way the
      researchers are looking for.

      With continuing feedback, coaching, and practice, researchers hope you will be able to learn
      how to produce the brain wave patterns that may help to reduce the perception of pain and
      improve your quality of life.

      For the EEG during each neurofeedback training session, researchers will place a cap
      containing 19 sensors on your scalp, and 1 sensor on each earlobe. The sensors will measure
      and record your brain wave activity, similar to the way a doctor listens to your heart beat
      from the surface of your skin.

      During each training session, you will sit quietly and relax while watching a computer
      screen. A neurotherapist will be present during each neurofeedback session to provide
      one-on-one assistance and guidance. Each neurofeedback training session will take up 1 hour
      to complete (about 15 minutes to get set up and about 45 minutes to complete the training
      session).

      At each neurofeedback training session:

      You will rate your pain and comfort level on a scale of 0-10 before and after the training
      session.

      You will rate how much you believe your mouth sores interfere with your quality of life on a
      scale of 0-10.

      You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Within 1 week of having completed the neurofeedback training sessions, you will fill out the
      same 4 questionnaires you completed at baseline and have an EEG performed.

      Length of Participation:

      After you complete the questionnaires at the follow-up visit 1 week after the completion of
      your LORETA neurofeedback, your participation on this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The equipment used for neurofeedback training is FDA
      approved and commercially available equipment. Using neurofeedback equipment to teach
      patients ways to modify their own brain waves to decrease the perception of pain and improve
      quality of life is investigational.

      Up to 25 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
