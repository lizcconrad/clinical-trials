  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the single‐dose pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine (RPV)
      after intramuscular (IM) injection of rilpivirine long‐acting parenteral formulation (RPV‐LA)
      and 'aged' RPV‐LA, in healthy adult participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), open‐label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), parallel‐group, sequential study in healthy adult
      participants to investigate the effect of different storage conditions for RPV‐LA on the
      single‐dose pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine (RPV) after intramuscular injection. A total of
      60 healthy adult participants will be enrolled in this study. The study will consist of 2
      treatment sessions in a fixed sequential order : session 1 of up to day 8, all participants
      will receive a single oral dose of rilpivirine 25 milligram (mg) tablet on day 1, session 2
      will consists of 2 treatment groups. The participants will be randomized in session 2 on Day
      1 in a 1:1 ratio to Treatments A and B. Each treatment group will receive one IM injection of
      RPV LA on Day 1 of session 2. Session 1 and 2 will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 14 days. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 6.5
      months. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
