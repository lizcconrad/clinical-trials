  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve the survival rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients by 2%
      through a bundle of three intervention measures including: 1) dispatcher-assisted CPR, 2)
      multi-tiered response team CPR, and 3) feedback CPR.

      The project aims to implement gold standard emergency medical services (EMS) cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) programs, which will result in increased bystander CPR, reduced EMS
      response time, and high quality CPR during prehospital resuscitation through a bundled
      approach including 1) dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR), 2) multi-tiered response team CPR,
      and 3) feedback CPR.

      The DA-CPR program aims to contribute to improved bystander CPR rate and reduced EMS response
      time interval through rigorous monitoring of cardiac arrest detection at primary call
      receiving stage as well as increased number of dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction initiation
      in the target time of 90 seconds. The Team CPR protocol will render synergetic efforts among
      participating EMS personnel from both basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support
      (ALS) units within the new tiered dispatch system and subsequently deliver uninterrupted CPR
      to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients before hospital arrival. The feedback CPR
      monitoring and quality assurance program will contribute to high quality CPR delivered to the
      patients on the scene as well as during transport.
