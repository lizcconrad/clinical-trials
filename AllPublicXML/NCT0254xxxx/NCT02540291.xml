  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of E7046 to assess the safety and
      tolerability of E7046 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7046.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a dose escalation part to determine the MTD and/or
      RP2D of E7046, and a cohort expansion part with 6 to 16 participants to better characterize
      safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) at the RP2D. In the dose
      escalation part, increasing doses of E7046 will be administered to cohorts of 6 participants,
      at dose levels ranging from 125 mg to 750 mg.

             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential
             unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic, in the
             appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been
             sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral
             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). Females of
             childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days
             prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception,
             from the last menstrual period prior to initiation of treatment, during Treatment
             Cycles, and for 30 days after the final dose of study treatment, and have a male
             partner who uses a condom. Highly effective contraception includes:

               -  Double barrier methods of contraception such as condom plus diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault cap with spermicide

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device

               -  Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable, or implant. Females
                  who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must
                  continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after
                  study drug discontinuation. Female participants exempt from this requirement are
                  participants who practice total abstinence or have a male partner who is
                  vasectomized with confirmed azoospermia. If currently abstinent, the participant
                  must agree to use a double barrier method as described above if they become
                  sexually active during the Treatment Cycles, and for 30 days after study drug
                  discontinuation

         20. Male participants must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they
             and their female partners must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception and use a condom throughout the
             study period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for basal or squamous cell
             skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast
             that has completed curative therapy

          2. Participants with any active autoimmune disease (Appendix 2) or a documented history
             of autoimmune disease, poorly controlled asthma or history of syndrome that required
             systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for participants with
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this
             study.

          3. Participants with inflammatory bowel disease

          4. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

             inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption)

          8. Inability to take oral medication, or malabsorption syndrome or any other uncontrolled
             gastrointestinal condition (eg, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting) that might impair the
             bioavailability of E7046

          9. Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially
             increase the risk associated with the participant's participation in this study

         10. Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever
             is shorter) before study drug administration

         11. Prior exposure to drugs that are antagonists of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor
             (CSF1R) like but not limited to emactuzumab (RG7155) (Roche), PLX3397 (Plexicon), and
             JNJ40346627 (J &amp; J)

             unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke within 6 months of the first dose of
             study drug; or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment (including oral
             anticoagulation)

         15. Females who are pregnant (positive urine test) or breastfeeding

         16. Any history of a medical condition or a concomitant medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to safely complete
             the study
