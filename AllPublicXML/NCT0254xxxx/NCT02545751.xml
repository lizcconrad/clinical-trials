      Patients with esophageal cancer that had metastatic lesions after been treated with
      definitive surgery or chemoradiotherapy are being asked to participate in this study.

        1. To observe immunity-mediated tumor response after Stereotactic Body Radiation
           Therapy(SBRT) of a metastatic site in metastatic esophageal cancer patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy, SBRT and
           thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic esophageal cancer patients; This study
           will help find out what effects (good or bad) the combination of radiotherapy and
           thymalfasin has on metastatic esophageal cancer.

      1. To observe immunity-mediated tumor response after Stereotactic Body Radiation
           Therapy(SBRT) of a metastatic site in metastatic esophageal cancer patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy, SBRT and
           thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic esophageal cancer patients; Eligible are
           patients with metastatic esphageal cancer who have achieved stable disease or have
           disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy) and
           have at least two measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic disease
           is recorded both at CT and PET/CT scanning. Radiation is given during combined therapy
           to one of the lesions, 25Gy in 5 fractions over one week interval with SBRT, conformally
           to maximally spare normal tissue or organ. Thymalfasin treatment is given twice a week
           with an interval of 3-4 days each week for a total of 8 weeks. Tumor response is
           evaluated by assessing clinical and CT/MRI response for all of the measurable metastatic
           sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon design is
           used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if there
           are no tumor responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more tumor
           responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed esophageal cancer which is persistent and
             metastatic or recurrent and metastatic;

          2. Patients must have at least 2 distinct measurable metastatic sites at least 1 cm of
             larger in their largest diameter;

          3. Age ≥18 years;

          4. Metastatic disease measurable on a CT/MRI scan. The primary tumor is not considered
             measurable disease. Metastatic lesions within a prior radiation field are acceptable
             as long as disease has progressed in the radiation field by RECIST criteria. The same
             imaging modality performed at baseline (CT or MRI) will be repeated at subsequent
             imaging.

          5. ECOG performance status: 0-1;

             than 50 000 per μL, total bilirubin less than 1•5 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase less than 2•5 times the
             ULN, and serum creatinine less than 1•5 times the ULN;

             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

          9. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
