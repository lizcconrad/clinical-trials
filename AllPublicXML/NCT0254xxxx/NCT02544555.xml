  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two ways of approaching atherosclerotic chronic occlusive femoro-popliteal arterial
      lesion with guide wire. One is the intraluminal approach of passing guide wire through the
      atheroma, the other is the subintimal approach of passing wire through the subintima of the
      vessel.

      Either of these two interventional technique can be chosen depending on the character of the
      lesions they have their own pros and cons which affects the success of the intervention. The
      study is limited to retrospective studies to which interventional technique is better for
      post-procedural recurrence rate, however there is no prospective randomized controlled study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During interventions for atherosclerotic femoro-popliteal arterial lesion, chronic occlusive
      lesions are commonly encountered. The decision to approach these lesions by either guide
      wire, intraluminal approach or subintimal approach is by the decision of the operator. The
      subintimal approach intentionally passes the guide wire through the subintimal layer of
      vessel which was developed by Dr. Bolia. Through the subintimal approach, the success rate of
      procedure has increased. However this technique has shown some limitations which are guide
      wire re-entry, intimal injury, lengthening of the original lesion, periadventitial hematoma,
      perforated vessel, collateral vascular occlusion and limited usage of atherectomy devices.

      On the contrary, intimal approach is not only able to overcome the limitations of the
      subintimal approach, but it has shown an advantage in improving the success rate of the
      procedure by the variable techniques of anterograde, retrograde and trans-collaterals
      approach. These techniques however usually require longer procedure time with more exposure
      to larger amounts of intravenous contrast and radiation. It often cause the need for more
      interventional devices which results in higher expense such that it is a less cost-effective
      method.

      Recently the recommendation is the combination of these 2 interventional techniques depending
      on the character of lesions. As above, these approaches are chosen depending on the character
      of the lesion, however there are only limited retrospective studies without prospective
      randomized controlled study present to decide which method is better in terms of
      post-procedural recurrence rate.

    <description>Intentional intraluminal approach is the way that the passage of guidewire in chronic total occlusive femoro-popliteal arterial lesion is performed via intraluminal route using various intraluminal devices. in an intraluminal approach, the response to the balloon is more favorable, but the outcome depends on the experience of the surgeon, and the approach requires more time and is more costly.</description>

    <description>Intentional subintimal approach is the method that recanalization is performed via subintimal route with a 0.035-inch looped guidewire and a supporting catheter at the occlusion site. Due to its simplicity and low cost, this approach has been used for many patients with femoropopliteal occlusion.</description>

    <description>Interventionist performs intentional intraluminal approach to angioplasty. Dedicated 018 and 014 guidewire for Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesion and Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) devices such as Truepath or Frontrunner can be chosen by interventionist. Methods to confirm successful intraluminal wiring will be selected, as follows; 1) examination for guidewire position in different two angles on fluoroscopy or 2) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) exam after predilation is performed with an appropriately sized angioplasty balloon. After the guidewire is passed through the lumen of target lesion, predilation of the target lesion with an optimally sized balloon will be performed prior to stent implantation. Provisional stenting should be performed, if the case that optimal ballooning response is not obtained.</description>

    <description>Interventionist performs Intentional subintimal approach to angioplasty. 035 Terumo guidewires will be used. If 035 Terumo guidewire is not able to re-entry, Re-entry devices such as Offroad or OUTBACK catheter can be used. After the guidewire is passed through the subintimal layer of target lesion, predilation of the target lesion with an optimally sized balloon will be performed prior to stent implantation. Provisional stenting should be performed; the case that optimal ballooning response is not obtained should be enrolled. The sub-optimal balloon response is defined as a residual pressure gradient of &gt;15 mmHg, residual stenosis of &gt;30%, and flow-limiting dissection.</description>
