      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body
      radiation therapy in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in
      the body (metastatic) or has come back (recurrent). Stereotactic radiosurgery, also known as
      stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a
      single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause
      less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish that patients can be treated with 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) to all sites of metastatic disease with a low (&lt; 16%) rate of severe (grade 4)
      toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of SBRT. II. To determine the feasibility of delivering
      5-fraction SBRT per protocol based on proposed normal tissue constraints in a variety of
      organ sites. (i.e., the ability to treat &gt; 80% of enrolled patients according to protocol
      guidelines).

      III. To describe treated lesion control (LeC), progression free survival (PFS), and patterns
      of failure.

      IV. To determine the feasibility of accrual and adequacy of eligibility criteria by defining
      the proportion of eligible cases of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presented at the
      weekly multidisciplinary genitourinary conference at the University of Chicago Medical
      Center.

      V. To make a preliminary evaluation regarding potential biomarkers in patient serum which may
      be endpoints in a follow-up study (e.g. genetic or immunologic biomarkers).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy on day 1 over 3 times a week for 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up once a month for 3 months and
      then every 3 months for 1 year.
