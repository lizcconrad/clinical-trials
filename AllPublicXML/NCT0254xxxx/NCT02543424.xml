  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological pathologies cause important and permanent disabilities in every day life. These
      pathologies can follow stoke, affecting two people per one thousand each year or cerebral
      palsy, affecting two births per one thousand each year. To date, the diagnosis and the
      rehabilitation of motor and cognitive problems has been carried out separately by different
      domains. For example, physiotherapists have focused on motor problems and neuropsychologists
      have focused on cognitive functions. However, a number of studies have demonstrated a link
      between motor and cognitive abilities in adults and children. The present study has three
      main aims: (1) to better evaluate motor and cognitive problems in brain damaged patients (all
      ages), (2) to understand the link between motor and cognitive abilities in patients and
      healthy participants and, (3) to propose new types of therapies based on the link between
      motor and cognitive functions.

    <description>Kinematics will be measured with a robotic tool called the REAplan. This tool is a distal effector robotic device that enables the patients to perform upper limb movements in a horizontal plane. The robot comprises a distal effector, a visual interface for the patient and a visual interface for the experimenter. It is fitted with incremental position sensors allowing the record of the distal effector's trajectory in the X and Y plane as function of time (125 Hz). From these records, all kind of quantitative and objective indices of upper limb quality of movement can be computed. Motor and cognitive tasks have been created on this device and have to be validated. These new tools on the robot provide a more accurate measure to better understand the participant's motor and cognitive functioning through kinematics analyses. Moreover, the robot can be used as a rehabilitative device, providing cognitive and motor assistance for specific exercises depending on participant performance.</description>
