  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiplegic adults after stroke (stroke), children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP)
      have both muscles spastic and paresis. These movement disorders are likely to cause muscle
      changes both structural and viscoelastic involved in the alteration of neuromotor functions
      such as walking. Therefore, it seems interesting to study the structure of these muscles with
      available imaging techniques. The medial gastrocnemius muscle presents architectural
      characteristics which allows easy evaluation 2D ultrasound. The literature lacks data on the
      reproducibility of the measurement, by 2D ultrasound, of the pennation angle and muscular
      thickness, particularly in children. In addition, the sonoelastometry by Supersonic ShearWave
      Imaging (SSI) is a new technique of ultrasound, non-invasive, dynamic, which allows the
      calculation of the modulus of elasticity within a muscle tissue. This allows to consider new
      perspectives evaluation of the viscoelastic properties of the muscle. No studies have
      evaluated the reproducibility of this method in adults/children/ adolescent after stroke and
      hemiplegia.

      A 1 week apart, an ultrasound examination will be conducted on the hemiplegic leg side, while
      lying on his stomach and on the back. The thickness, elasticity and the pennation angle of
      the medial gastrocnemius muscle will be measured.
