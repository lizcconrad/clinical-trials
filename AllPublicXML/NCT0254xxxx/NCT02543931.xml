      The purpose of this study is to find out whether turmeric dietary supplements that are
      available over the counter for general use in the United States are safe and useful when
      taken specifically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and how the active
      principles in turmeric are broken down and metabolized by the body in individuals with RA.

      A placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-arm Phase Ib clinical trial assessing two doses of
      a commercially available curcuminoid formulation with enhanced bioavailability vs. placebo in
      a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population is proposed. The primary aim of this clinical planning
      study is to determine the dose-dependent tolerability of an enhanced bioavailability
      curcuminoid formulation in an RA population, including pharmacokinetic analyses, to inform
      the design of a future Phase II trial assessing the anti-inflammatory efficacy of
      curcuminoids in the treatment of RA. Secondarily, estimates of effect size for changes in
      known biomarkers of inflammation in RA will be determined.
