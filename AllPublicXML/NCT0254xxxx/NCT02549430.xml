  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the activity of PD0332991 in monotherapy and in combination with
      the endocrine therapy (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane or fulvestrant) on which the
      patient has progressed in the previous line for advanced breast cancer in order to reverse
      endocrine resistance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a clinical context, there is a lack of molecular compounds with demonstrated clinical
      activity in delaying/reversing resistance to endocrine agents. CDK 4/6 inhibitors may
      represent a biologically-driven option in this context.

      With the present study investigators aim to complement the ongoing trial on PD0332991 by
      acquiring information on its clinical activity in post-menopausal patients with ER positive,
      Her2 negative advanced breast cancer patients already pretreated with a first-line or second
      line endocrine therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) ≥24 weeks (clinical benefit)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>All randomized patients with adequate baseline disease assessment with measurable disease, the disease under study and who start treatment on the assigned arm will be considered evaluable for clinical benefit (CB). The probability of CB on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by dividing the number of patients with CB by the number of evaluable patients randomized to the treatment arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is the time from randomization date to date of first documentation of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Documentation of progression must be by objective disease assessment as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. All patients randomized will be considered evaluable for PFS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>All randomized patients with adequate baseline disease assessment with measurable disease, the disease under study and who start treatment on the assigned arm will be considered evaluable for objective response (CR or PR). The probability of OR on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by dividing the number of patients with OR by the number of evaluable patients randomized to the respective treatment arm (&quot;response rate&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is the time from randomization date to date of death due to any cause. All patients randomized will be considered evaluable for OS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTP is the time from randomization date to date of first documentation of objective progression. All patients randomized will be considered evaluable for TTP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with an objective response (CR or PR), duration of response is the time from first documentation of CR or PR to date of first documentation of objective progression or death. Date of first documentation of progression and date of first documentation of CR or PR will be based on investigator assessment of response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>All patients treated with at least one dose of trial treatment will be included in safety analyses. Adverse events will be summarized by treatment and by the frequency of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events corresponding to body systems and MedDRA preferred term. Adverse events will be graded by worst NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade.</description>
