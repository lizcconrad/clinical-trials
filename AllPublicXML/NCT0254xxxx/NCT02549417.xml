      This study is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of KHK7580 orally administered once
      daily for 32 weeks for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving peritoneal
      dialysis. After 32-week treatment period, the subjects will receive KHK7580 in the 20-week
      extension period to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy.
