  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with osteogenesis imperfecta are described as extremely sedentary and therefore
      fatigable, which strongly impacts their daily activities. The physical rehabilitation of
      these children is a fundamental aspect of treatment.

      It has been shown that playing Wii console causes the same increase in energy expenditure
      than practicing moderate exercise, while ensuring user safety. This type of physical exercise
      with this type of fun game console might have a role in the treatment of OI children on the
      physical side but also on the psychological side.
