      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of Liraglutide on albuminuria in type 2
      diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial findings point to a clinically significant antiproteinuric effect of liraglutide
      treatment, possibly independent from blood pressure reduction. The mechanism behind is
      unclear and the magnitude of albuminuria reduction needs to be verified. Antiproteinuric
      effects are usually renoprotective and potentially also cardioprotective and may suggest an
      additional benefit from liraglutide treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the magnitude of the antiproteinuric effect of
      short-term liraglutide treatment (12 weeks) in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria.
      In addition, possible mechanisms causing the antiproteinuric effect will be explored.

          2. Male or female patients &gt;18 years with type 2 diabetes (WHO criteria).

          3. HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6.5 %)

          4. eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (estimated by MDRD formula)

          5. Fertile female patients must use chemical, hormonal or mechanical contraceptives or be
             in menopause (i.e. must not have had regular menstrual bleeding for at least one year)
