    <textblock>
      Development of an active second-line treatment option for metastatic breast cancer patients
      previously pre-treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative
      settings.For each randomisation arm, 100 patients will be included. The trial was performed
      as a 2-stage phase II study according to the optimal design by Simon with overall response
      rate as the primary objective.

      Study Design:

      Arm A Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 d1, 8;Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 d1, 8 q 3 weeks Arm B Vinorelbine 25
      mg/m2 d1, 8;Cisplatin 25 mg/m2 d1, 2,3 q 3 weeks
