      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of epirubicin plus
      cyclophosphamide versus docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide in lymph node negative, estrogen
      receptor (ER) positive, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast

      This is a non-inferiority study. According to previous study results, the investigators
      hypothesize the incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia is 40%, with a α of 0.05 and β of 0.8, a
      sample size of 264 cases if needed.
