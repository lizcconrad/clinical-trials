          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccines
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the

             confirmed lung cancer). Please note that subjects with mild pulmonary obstruction
             (i.e. FEV1/ FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 with FEV1 ≥ 80% of normal predicted values [GOLD grade 1])
             can be enrolled.

          -  Has contraindication for spirometry testing (such as recent eye surgery, recent
             thoracic or abdominal surgery procedures, unstable cardiovascular status, recent
             myo-cardial infection or pulmonary embolism).

          -  Laboratory evidence of clinically significant haematological (complete blood cell
             count [RBC, WBC], WBC differential count [lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils],
             platelets count or haemoglobin level) and biochemical (ALT, AST or creatinine)
             abnormalities.

          -  Has significant disease, in the opinion of the investigator, likely to interfere with
             the study and/or likely to cause death within the study duration.
