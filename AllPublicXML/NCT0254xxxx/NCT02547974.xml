             can be enrolled.

          -  Has contraindication for spirometry testing (such as recent eye surgery, recent
             thoracic or abdominal surgery procedures, unstable cardiovascular status, recent
             myo-cardial infection or pulmonary embolism).

          -  Laboratory evidence of clinically significant haematological (complete blood cell
             count [RBC, WBC], WBC differential count [lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils],
             platelets count or haemoglobin level) and biochemical (ALT, AST or creatinine)
             abnormalities.
