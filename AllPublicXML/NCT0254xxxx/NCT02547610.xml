  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, we will recruit newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients and
      perform MR/PET before and after chemoradiation therapy. In MR, new image sequences will be
      added to the conventional sequences, such as high resolution image, DWI, DCE, cine imaging.

  <detailed_description>

      Total 80 patients will be recruited and followed after treatment complete for at least two
      years. We will compare the staging accuracy of MR/PET and PET/CT, and also analyze parameters
      that are predictive of disease recurrence and patient survival.
