  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rising, single oral doses MK-1064 in
      healthy, young, male participants. The primary pharmacokinetic hypothesis is that at least
      one dose of MK-1064 that is generally safe and well tolerated produces an average MK-1064
      plasma concentration from 0 to 4 hours of ≥2.2 μM. Since this is an early Phase I assessment
      of MK-1064 in humans, the study protocol allows for modifications to the outlined dose,
      dosing regimen and/or clinical or laboratory procedures, if required to address study
      objectives and/or to ensure appropriate safety monitoring of participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two panels (Panels A and B), will receive alternating single rising oral doses of
      MK-1064/placebo (i.e., order of administration will be Panel A 5 mg, Panel B 10 mg, Panel A
      25 mg, Panel B 50 mg, and continuing in this alternating sequence). Following dosing for a
      given treatment period, a minimum of 3 days will elapse before administration of the next
      scheduled dose. After administration of each dose, safety and tolerability will be reviewed.
      The decision to proceed to the next Panel/Period in the alternating sequence will be
      contingent on acceptable safety and tolerability data from the preceding Panels/Periods.

There was to be a minimum 7 day wash-out between treatment periods for any given participant.</description>
