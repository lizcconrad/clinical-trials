      A randomized, two-way crossover, single-dose pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of a test formulation of Esomelone powder for solution for injection/infusion
      40mg (Esomeprazole 40mg), compared to an equivalent dose of a reference drug product (Nexium
      powder for injection and infusion 40mg) in healthy adult subjects.
