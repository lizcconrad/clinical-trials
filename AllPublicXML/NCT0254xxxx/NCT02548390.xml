    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/Ib, dose escalation study of intravenous RXDX-107 administered
      to subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study is designed to explore the safety, maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity
      of RXDX-107 and to define a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)

    <description>Subjects in this study will receive RXDX-107 intravenously at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 25 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 2 of a 28-day cycle and will escalate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or (RP2D) is determined. An additional schedule of administration of RXDX-107 on Day 1 of a 28 day cycle may be assessed. Cycles will be repeated in four-week (28 day) intervals for up to 6 cycles or until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met.</description>

             uncontrolled cardiac condition such as angina pectoris, significant cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring therapy, uncontrolled hypertension, or CHF.

          4. Another concurrent illness which would preclude study conduct and assessment,
             uncontrolled: medical condition, active infection, risk of bleeding, diabetes
             mellitus, or pulmonary disease, or alcoholic liver disease, or primary biliary
             cirrhosis.

          5. Malignancy within 3 years or active disease requiring treatment other than the target
             cancer. The exceptions are prostate cancer (Gleason grade &lt; 6 with normalized PSA
             levels), treated in situ cervical, breast carcinoma, squamous or basal cell skin
             cancer.

          6. Any condition that may compromise the ability to give written informed consent or to
             comply with the study protocol.
