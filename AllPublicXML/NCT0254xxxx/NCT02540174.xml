    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, interventional, randomized study among patients with a first lung or
      head &amp; neck cancer who are still active smokers ± alcohol misusers.The study will aim to
      compare the systematic implementation of an addiction treatment program initiated at hospital
      and integrated to the initial cancer treatment program (Arm A), versus the as-usual
      procedure, which consists in recommendations to follow an addiction treatment program (Arm B)

      -  Study proposal at the first medical consultation for therapeutic management of a first
           upper aerodigestive tract cancer or lung cancer.

        -  Selection criteria validation

        -  Collection of an informed consent

        -  Randomization :

      Arm A: Experimental arm : Addiction consultation to the overall cancer treatment

      Arm B: standard of care

      The completion of questionnaires , the measurement of exhaled carbone monoxide rate using a
      CO tester for all patients, and the integrated addiction treatment among patients randomized
      in Arm A will not interfere with the medical treatment of cancer.

At 3, 6, and 12 months : a 20 min interview to assess the alcohol-tobacco consumption and the obstacles and incentives to stop the consumption.
