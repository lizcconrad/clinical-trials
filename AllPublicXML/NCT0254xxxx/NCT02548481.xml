  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year in France, from 100 000 to 145 000 people are affected by a stroke. 75% patients
      survived with aftereffects, in particular aphasic disorders.

      A sketch of a new tool called BESTA aiming to a rapid handover to the acute phase post stroke
      had been worked out. After a meeting, 13 multidisciplinary experts have discussed, adjusted
      and a new complete tool (BESTA) had been created in order to evaluate the different states of
      aphasia.

      The goal of this study is the validation and the standardization of this new BESTA tool.

    <description>T0: the gold standard was determined by the expert group is the LAST screening tool.
The tool to be evaluated is the BESTA at T0. However, as written expression is not evaluated in the LAST, only the dimensions and Oral Expression Listening Comprehension of BESTA may actually be faced with LAST scale.</description>
