    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of 12 weeks vs. 24
      weeks of field-based directly observed therapy (DOT) for HCV therapy in a resource-limited
      setting. The investigators will compare treatment completion rates among 50 persons
      chronically infected with HCV who will be randomized to receive either 1) 12 weeks of
      sofosbuvir (SOF) + ribavirin (RBV) + pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG); or 2) 24 weeks of
      SOF + RBV. Treatment will be delivered daily by field workers at a location of a participants
      choosing. Secondary objectives are 1) To compare the efficacy of SOF+RBV with or without PEG
      as measured by the proportion of subjects with sustained viral response at 12 weeks after
      discontinuation of therapy (SVR12); 2) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SOF+RBV
      with or without PEG; 3) To assess the impact of SVR12 on insulin resistance.

      This will be a non-blinded randomized clinical trial with 50 participants randomized at a 1:1
      allocation ratio to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm 1: Sofosbuvir (400mg/daily) + Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a (180µg/weekly) + Ribavirin
      (800mg/daily) for 12 weeks

      Arm 2: Sofosbuvir (400mg/daily) + Ribavirin (800mg/daily) for 24 weeks

      Pegylated-interferon alfa-2a (PEG) will be delivered subcutaneously once weekly. Sofosbuvir
      (SOF) and ribavirin (RBV) will be taken orally once daily for the entire study period.

      The study will take place at the YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education
      (YRGCARE). YRG CARE is a non-profit medical and research institution in Chennai. YRGCARE
      Medical Centre provides medical care for more than 18,000 persons with HIV disease. Currently
      more than 8000 persons are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy at the center.

      Participants will be recruited from the YR Gaitonde Centre for Substance Abuse Research
      (YRGCSAR), which is affiliated with YRGCARE. The investigators will primarily recruit
      subjects from a cohort study of current and former people who inject drugs (PWID) that is
      ongoing at the same center. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the two
      treatment arms after providing written informed consent. Treatment will be delivered directly
      to participants daily by field workers at a location of the participants choosing.
      Participants will be asked to visit the study clinic every four weeks during treatment and 12
      weeks after completing treatment for additional study procedures. In addition, participants
      in Arm 1 will be asked to visit the clinic every week to receive their PEG injection.

      The primary outcome is treatment completion. Secondary outcomes include SVR12, safety and
      tolerability and insulin resistance.
