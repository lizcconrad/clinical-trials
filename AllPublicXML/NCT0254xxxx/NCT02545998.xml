  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Report of Asthma Deaths published in 2014 highlighted significant deficiencies
      in both primary and secondary care resulting in one of the highest mortality rates in Europe.
      A key recommendation in the report is the provision of an annual asthma review in primary
      care.

      Telehealthcare is an alternative means of service delivery incorporating the use of telephone
      and e-mail consultations which may improve access and quality of patient care. There is scant
      data on the role of teleheathcare in asthma care.

      This is a single-centre, primary care-based, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use
      of telehealthcare to conduct the annual asthma review for adult patients with well-controlled
      asthma. This will be compared with standard care (face-to-face consultations).

      Telehealthcare will consist of a telephone consultation followed by an e-mail with an
      attached personalised asthma action plan and a link to a video demonstrating inhaler
      technique.

      Standard care will involve a face-to-face consultation in primary care. The two patient
      groups will be compared prospectively to determine whether there is a difference in the
      quality of care evaluated in terms of the patient experience/ satisfaction, health-related
      quality of life, asthma control and frequency of asthma exacerbations over a 6 month period
      after the asthma review.

      The data will be presented in the form of frequency tables, bar charts and pie charts.
      Non-parametric tests will be applied to determine whether there is a significant difference
      in the quality of care received.
