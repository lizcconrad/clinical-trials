  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the conduct of this study is that the Intone device (along with pelvic
      physiotherapy) can be used to help females suffering from urinary stress incontinence by
      using electrical stimulation and biofeedback during pelvic floor muscle training. This
      investigation is important because it can aid in the greater acceptance and development of
      non-surgical treatments for Stress Urinary Incontinence if these areas are looked into. The
      study results will address if the Intone device is beneficial and promotes long-term
      improvement in women that suffer from urinary incontinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is very common in women and is linked to a reduced quality of life
      (Corcos et al., 2002). The three main types of urinary incontinence are Stress Urinary
      Incontinence (SUI), Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) and Mixed Urinary Incontinence (MUI). SUI
      and UUI involve losing urine involuntarily. In SUI this is during either effortful motion
      such as coughing or sneezing, or in UUI is associated with a feeling of urgency. Urinary
      incontinence has various treatment options including: surgery, medication, pelvic floor
      muscle exercises and electrical stimulation (Norton &amp; Brubaker, 2006).

      The most common physiotherapy treatment used for women with urinary incontinence is pelvic
      floor muscle training (Dumoulin &amp; Hay-Smith, 2010). Several studies have investigated the
      effects of PFMT in comparison to other treatments such as no treatment and vaginal cones.
      They found that women in the PFMT group reported more improvement and better quality of life
      than women in other treatment groups. The PFMT group also had fewer daily incontinence
      episodes and less leakage (Bø, Talseth, &amp; Holme, 1999; Dumoulin &amp; Hay-Smith, 2010).

      Electrical stimulation of the pelvic floor muscles is another treatment for urinary
      incontinence, and may often be combined with PFMT. Success rates of electrical stimulation in
      treating urinary incontinence range from 50-90% (Bent et al., 1993; Erikson, Bergmann, &amp;
      Mjølnerød, 1987; Fall, 1984; Pelvnik et al., 1986).

      A new product has been developed called InTone which combines PFMT, electrical stimulation
      and biofeedback. This device is inserted into the vagina and facilitates PFMT while providing
      electrical stimulation and biofeedback to the patient. This study will examine the
      effectiveness of the InTone device in treating urinary incontinence in women.
