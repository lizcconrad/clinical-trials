      The goal of this research study is to find out if providing patients who are enrolled in
      phase 1 clinical trials with structured supportive care will enable them to continue in the
      Phase 1 trial longer and improve their quality of life by reducing or treating side effects
      and by providing emotional and social support to the patient and family. The structured
      supportive or palliative care intervention will be provided by a team of trained specialists
      which include doctors, nurses, social workers and spiritual care providers. The supportive
      care team will provide treatment to address symptoms, such as pain or anxiety, caused by the
      cancer itself or from the treatment. The team can make referrals to other specialists. Such
      as psychologists or nutritionist, if needed, and can help arrange for services to address
      home care needs.

      Primary Objective(s): To assess symptoms, adverse events, duration on study, reason for study
      discontinuation, and quality of life among patients participating in phase I clinical trials
      who receive structured palliative care, and those who receive standard supportive care.
      Duration on study will serve as the primary objective for sample size determination.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      1. To describe the quantity (e.g. hours), type, and cost of palliative care personnel
      services used by patients and caregivers receiving structured palliative care.

      Exploratory:

        1. To compare adverse event profiles, duration on study, and quality of life between
           patients who receive structured palliative care and those receiving standard supportive
           care.

        2. To compare caregiver burden and quality of life between the study arms.

    <description>Measure of central tendency of adverse events. AE will be described and further categorized as modifiable (primary symptom experience) and non-modifiable (laboratory abnormalities). The influence of adverse events on study outcomes particularly duration on study and reason for study discontinuation will be assessed. An exploratory weighted adverse event score will be calculated using the equation: adverse event score = âˆ‘ (NAE * GAE) where N denotes the adverse event number, G denotes grade, AE denotes adverse event. These scores will be compared between study arms</description>
