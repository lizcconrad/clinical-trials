      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and
      efficacy of LifePearl™ microspheres loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of unresectable
      HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, prospective dose escalation/PK study, designed to assess the clinical
      performance of LifePearl™ beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the primary treatment of
      unresectable HCC by chemoembolization. Data from this study will be used as supportive data
      post CE-mark approval.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of
      LifePearl™ beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with unresectable liver
      cancer (HCC) by chemoembolization. This will be measured as treatment-related complications
      and plasma levels of Doxorubicin in peripheral blood.

      In addition, objective tumour response will be assessed by computed tomography or MRI.

      Two cohorts of patients will be evaluated:

      Cohort I to assess safety (dose escalation) and pharmacokinetic profile; Cohort II will
      assess pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy with the doxorubicin dose determined with
      Cohort I.

    <description>First cohort: Chemoembolization with Doxorubicin-loaded LifePearl™ microspheres (TACE): Escalation of dose loaded in microspheres from 75 mg to 150 mg. Pharmacokinetic testing in all patients.

    <description>First, an angiography of the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and hepatic artery will be obtained by using a peripheral arterial approach.
Arterial embolization will be performed through catheterization of intrahepatic arteries, as selectively as possible (tumor feeders, subsegmental, segmental). The size of the microcatheter must be consistent with the size of LifePearl beads used. Microspheres of 200 µm will be be used. They will be loaded with the appropriate dose of doxorubicin injectable solution, mixed with the contrast media and distributed according to the location of the HCC lesions. The endpoint of the procedure will be achieved end when stasis of the feeders is achieved and confirmed with angiography of the whole liver.</description>

In addition to blood samples taken for biochemistry and haematology analysis, blood will be taken for pharmacokinetic assessment: Whole venous blood samples (6 ml in 2 tubes) will be taken from peripheral blood into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes prior to and at 5mins, 20mins, 40mins, 1h, 2h, 6h, 24h, 48h and 7 days after the procedure, and if needed (i.e. value at d7 is detectable) at 1 month (for safety assessment visit) either during hospital stay or in the outpatient clinic.</description>
