    <textblock>
      MoMaTEC2 aims to test, in clinically oriented studies, the applicability of already
      identified and promising molecular biomarkers, to promote individualisation of treatment for
      patients with endometrial cancer. Predominantly, but not exclusively, such biomarkers have
      shown to be interesting in retrospective analysis of our large prospectively collected
      MoMaTEC1 series.

      Part 1: Performance of a phase 4 implementation trial for optimised stratification of
      surgical treatment, specifically the performance of (para-aortic and pelvic) lymphadenectomy
      guided by validated biomarkers.

      Part 2: Performance of a phase 2b clinical biomarker study to evaluate the predictive
      potential of the biomarker stathmin for taxane treatment response in endometrial and ovarian
      cancer. In this study stathmin will be used as integrated biomarker.

    <description>The percentage of lymphadenectomy can be reduced safely and significantly, from 70% (MoMaTEC1 study results) to 30% in the MoMaTEC2 study through a better risk stratification of patients, especially better identification of low risk patients. Additionally The percentage of patients who need to be subjected to adjuvant (chemo) therapy can be reduced similarly from 20 to 10%, based on the same, optimised risk stratification and better identification of low risk patients. Patients will be rigorously followed during 5 years to detect any unexpected increase in the percentage of patients suffering a recurrence compared to the historical MoMaTEC1 cohort.</description>

    <description>The historical MoMaTEC1 outcome data, collected from 2001-2015 serve as control arm. These data have been rigorously collected and quality controlled with extensive clinical annotation and follow-up data, and reflect the outcome in (for a larger part) the same population as expected for MoMaTEC2 as there have not been major changes in surgical or medical treatment for endometrial cancer in this time period that could cause confounding. Internal validity, and to a degree also external validity, covering practice in multiple countries, should in this way be assured.</description>

    <description>For the current study, stathmin is used as an integrated marker and does not dictate treatment modality, therefore there is no requirement for a control arm.</description>

    <intervention_name>Biomarker (ER/PR) guided lymphadenectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Lymphadenectomy in the pelvis and para-aortic, will, for patients who are considered otherwise low risk (endometrioid tumours grade 1 or 2, or grade 3 with &lt;50% myometrial infiltration (MI), with no sign of extrauterine disease), be dependent on the preoperative hormone receptor status (ER and PR).
Patients will be defined low risk when endometrioid, grade 1 or 2, or grade 3 with &lt;50% MI, AND positive hormone receptor status for both ER AND PR. These patients will not undergo lymphadenectomy.
Patients with endometrioid tumours grade 1 or 2, or grade 3 &lt;50% MI,, with either negative ER or PR status, are defined high risk and will undergo pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy as part of their surgical procedure.
Patients will receive routine clinical follow-up for 5 years. Follow-up data will be collected for the study, focusing on survival and recurrence of disease. All patients will, as part of the study fill out validated quality of life questionnaires (QoL) at follow-up.</description>

    <intervention_name>Biomarker guided weekly taxane treatment in endometrial/ ovarian cancer</intervention_name>
    <description>A 5mm tissue biopsy will be analysed for stathmin level in the recurrence as well as urine and a second 5mm biopsy on termination of study participation. The second biopsy could help explain why patients have stopped responding to the treatment. Determination of stathmin level both from the tissue and the urine will take place at the pathology department. Stathmin serves as an integrated biomarker, which enables a central biomarker analysis at Haukeland university hospital. Stathmin level is defined as high with an immunohistochemical score 9 (max score). All other scores are considered low. Pre-treatment all patients undergo CT or MRI, maximum 1 month prior to treatment start.
During treatment, urine and bloods will be collected every treatment cycle (weekly basis). Imaging will take place every 8 treatment cycles. Treatment will continue until disease progression.</description>
