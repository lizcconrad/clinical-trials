      This prospective randomized pilot clinical trial studied the effect on preoperative anxiety
      of watching a series of YouTube videos designed to create a virtual hospital experience for
      patients undergoing primary total hip and knee arthroplasty as compared to routine
      preoperative education.

      Hypothesis: Preoperative anxiety related to hip and knee replacement surgeries can be reduced
      by patient exposure to a virtual hospital inpatient experience delivered by a series of
      YouTube videos.

    <textblock>
      As high patient anxiety prior to surgery has been linked to more severe and persistent pain
      after joint replacement surgery, the Orthopedic Surgery Department at Mayo Clinic in Florida
      created a playlist of 16 YouTube videos aimed at creating a virtual hospital experience for
      primary total hip and knee joint replacement patients. A pilot study was then performed to
      evaluate the potential impact of viewing this playlist on preoperative anxiety.

      Methods: Each patient completed a Generalized Anxiety Disorder Score (GAD) assessment at the
      time of the routine preoperative clinic visit and were then randomized based on their gender,
      type of surgery, and initial GAD score to either the control group of standard education
      (education at face-to-face clinical visits as well as printed educational materials) or the
      treatment group of standard education plus access to the YouTube playlist. On the morning of
      the patient's surgery the same survey was repeated.
