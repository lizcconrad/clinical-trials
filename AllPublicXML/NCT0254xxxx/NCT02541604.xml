      This early phase, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab in
      pediatric and young adult participants with solid tumors for which prior treatment was proven
      to be ineffective.

             intolerable

          -  Disease that is measurable as defined by RECIST v1.1, mINRC, Revised Response Criteria
             for Malignant Lymphoma, RANO criteria (as appropriate) or evaluable by nuclear
             medicine techniques, immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers, or other reliable
             measures

          -  Archival tumor tissue block or 15 freshly cut, unstained, serial slides available for
