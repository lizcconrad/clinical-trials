    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of tacrolimus extended release in stable patients who have
      undergone a heart transplant. All patients will receive the study medication free of charge
      for the 1 year duration of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus has been extensively studied in solid organ transplantation. It is FDA approved
      for heart transplant recipients as a twice a day formulation (Prograf brand name, as well as
      generic formulations). A modified release formulation is available and FDA approved for
      kidney transplant recipients (Astagraf, Astellas Pharmaceutical), but is not approved for
      heart transplant patients.

      In this study the investigators will study 100 patients who are stable on twice a day
      Tacrolimus and convert these subjects to once a day modified release Tacrolimus. The
      investigators will observe these patients for 1 year following the switch and assess safety
      and efficacy in a heart transplant population.
