        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Healthy, non-smoking, male or female between the ages of 18 and 55 years (inclusive).

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI between 18 and 32 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  If female, is of non-child bearing potential (i.e., surgically [bilateral
             oophorectomy, hysterectomy, hysteroscopic sterilization, or tubal ligation]. Or, is
             naturally sterile [&gt;12 consecutive months without menses]) with verification by
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at screening.

          -  If male and non-vasectomized, must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain
             from sexual intercourse during the study until 30 days beyond the last dose of study
             drug. No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has
             been performed 4 months or more prior to first dose of study drug. A male who has been
             vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study start must follow the same procedure as
             a non-vasectomized male.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal findings during physical examination including
             blood pressure, heart rate or rhythm, clinical laboratory tests or 12-lead ECG.

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, endocrine, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological or psychiatric disease.

          -  Thyroid stimulating hormone test at screening outside the normal range. Repeat testing
             is allowed once at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Current or recent (&lt;6 months) hepatobiliary disease; or aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or direct bilirubin greater than the upper limit
             of reference range at screening. Repeat testing is allowed once at the discretion of
             the Investigator.

          -  Elevated creatine kinase (CK) at screening (one repeat test allowed).

          -  Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  Positive screening test for HIV antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C
             antibody.

          -  Abnormal screening ECG: including machine-read QTc &gt;450 msec (confirmed by manual over
             read), QRS &gt;110 msec, intermittent bundle branch block, frequent premature atrial or
             premature ventricular contractions, or any rhythm other than normal sinus rhythm which
             is interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  History of sensitivity to a similar study drug (e.g., Karo Bio KB2115 or Metabasis
             MB7811), or a history of important drug or other allergy (except for untreated,
             asymptomatic seasonal allergies at time of dosing) unless deemed not clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          -  History of sensitivity to thyroid medication.

          -  History of intolerance to or adverse reaction to a statin, or history of myopathy
             including rhabdomyolysis.

          -  Intolerance to beta-blockers (beta-blocker treatment could be appropriate to alleviate
             tachycardia if observed).

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or medical device)
             within the last 30 days prior to the first dosing day, or who have been exposed to
             more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.

          -  Use of St. John's Wort within 28 days before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Unwilling to forgo consumption of red wine, Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit
             juice and/or pomelos, star fruit, grapefruit hybrids or other citrus juices from 5
             days prior to the first dose of study drug and throughout the study.

          -  Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse as defined by the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual 5th Edition.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of
             hard liquor) within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Use of acetaminophen within 7 days before dosing and throughout the study except for
             the treatment of an adverse event as directed by the Investigator.

          -  History of regular use of tobacco or nicotine containing products within the past 6
             months relative to screening.

          -  Positive urine drug screen or alcohol test at screening or Day -1.

          -  Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or are nursing.

          -  Strenuous physical activity which could cause muscle aches or injury, including
             contact sports, at any time from 3 days prior to first dose of study drug until
             completion of the study.

          -  Excessive caffeine intake (&gt;3 cups of coffee/day or equivalent).
