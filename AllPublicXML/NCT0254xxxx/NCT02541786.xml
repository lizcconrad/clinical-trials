  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexlansoprazole MR is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole that is delivered by a dual delayed
      release formulation. It is effective for symptom control of patients with gastroesophageal
      reflux disease. However, its efficacy in the treatment of H.pylori infection remains unclear.
      This study was conducted to investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose dexlansoprazole
      MR-based triple therapy was non-inferior to double-dose rabeprazole-based triple therapy in
      the treatment of H.pylori infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infect more than 50% of humans globally. It is the major cause
      of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma). H.pylori eradication has become the
      standard and most widely adopted therapy to cure peptic ulcer disease. This therapy is also
      strongly recommended in the treatment of H pylori-related MALToma. In regions with high
      incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma, eradication of H pylori is advocated as a preventative
      measure. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is one of the key medicines in anti-H pylori regimens.
      It possesses anti-H pylori activity, and, by reducing gastric acid secretion, it also
      increases bioavailability and activity of some antibiotics. This study was conducted to
      investigate whether the efficacy of single-dose dexlansoprazole MR-based triple therapy was
      non-inferior to double-dose rabeprazole-based triple therapy in the treatment of H pylori
      infection.
