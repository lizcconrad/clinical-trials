    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of connective tissue massage and
      lifestyle modifications in adolescents tension type headache, pain severity, pain duration,
      pain frequency and quality of life and pressure pain threshold rates. The patients will be
      accepted to study according to 'The International Classification of Headache Disorders-III'
      criteria. Including criteria are; being between 10-19 ages adolescents, suffering from
      tension type headache at least for 6 months, pain severity between 4-7 on visual analog
      scale. Excluding criteria are; current pregnancy, having any history of cancer, traffic
      accident, head trauma and any kind of neurological disorder. Patients will be divided into
      two groups randomly. The investigators plan to receive 30 patients to the study. 15 of them
      will be in control group, 15 in study group. Control group will just receive some advices
      including life style modifications, like using right glasses, not smoking, true posture
      habits and regular and quality sleep habits. In addition to life style modifications, the
      other group will be treated with connective tissue massage. Connective tissue massage will be
      applied on basic part, lower thoracic, scapular, inter scapular and neck regions, 5 times a
      week, totally 20 sessions in a month. Each session lasts approximately 20-30 minutes.
      Patients detailed medical history and demographic data will be recorded. Pain severity,
      duration, frequency, analgesic usage, connective tissue evaluation of back, range of motion
      of neck, pressure pain threshold for pain sensitization measurements and quality of life will
      be evaluated before treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment.

    <description>It is a manual reflex therapy in that it is applied with the therapist's hands which are in contact with the patient's skin. The assessment of the patient and the clinical decision-making that directs treatment is based on a theoretical model that assumes a reflex effect on the autonomic nervous system which is induced by manipulating the fascial layers within and beneath the skin.</description>
