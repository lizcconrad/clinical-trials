  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of Erbium:Yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Er:YAG) in the treatment
      of enlarged pores.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Enlarged pores are caused by multifactorial factors such as sex, genetics, aging, etc.

        -  The gold of the treatment is to recollagenesis of the dermis and resurfacing of the
           epidermis.

        -  Modalities that have been proved on their efficacy for enlarged pores treatment included
           topical retinoic acid, chemical peeling, intense pulsed light, radiofrequency device,
           laser such as Q-switched and Long Pulsed Neodymium-Doped Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet
           (Nd:YAG) 1,064nm, Long pulse duration pulsed dye laser 595nm, etc.

        -  Er:YAG laser is an ablative laser which creates both recollagenesis and resurfacing. It
           ha been proved to be safe and effective in the treatment of atrophic acne scar.

        -  However, the efficacy of this laser for enlarged treatment has not yet been established.
