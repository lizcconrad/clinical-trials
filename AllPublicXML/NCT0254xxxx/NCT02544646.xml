  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that the biomechanical properties of the optic nerve head and/or
      sclera play a role in the development of glaucoma. One approach of gaining insight into the
      biomechanical properties of the eye by the means of clinical studies is based on the
      Friedenwald equation, representing a pressure-volume relationship. This equation represents
      the so called ocular rigidity, which expresses the elasticity of the globe.

      In order to be able to solve the equation, measurements of fundus pulsation amplitude (FPA)
      with laser interferometry and dynamic contour tonometric assessment of the pulse amplitude
      (PA) have to be performed.

      In addition choroidal thickness will be assessed with OCT before and after trabeculectomy,
      since results in choroidal thickness measurements in patients with glaucoma are
      controversial.

      The focus of this study lies on the changes of ocular rigidity and choroidal thickness after
      surgical trabeculectomy in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or
      pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEX).
