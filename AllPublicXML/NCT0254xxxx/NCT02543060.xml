             this study;

          -  Agree to delay any elective dentistry (including dental prophylaxis) until the study
             has been completed;

          -  Agree to maintain their current oral hygiene routine between the Screening and
             Baseline Visit and not to add/change their oral care products during this time;

          -  Agree to refrain from any form of non-specified oral hygiene during the treatment
             periods (after the Baseline Visit), including but not limited to the use of products
             such as floss or whitening products;

          -  Agree to return for all scheduled visits and follow study procedures;

          -  Must have at least 16 natural teeth;

          -  Be in good general health, as determined by the Investigator/designee based on a
             review of the health history/update for participation in the study;

          -  Agree to refrain from all oral hygiene for at least 12 hours prior to each visit;

          -  Agree to refrain from eating, chewing gum, drinking and using tobacco for 4 hours
             prior to each visit;

          -  Have minimum 3 sampling sites with bleeding and pocket depth ≥3mm but not deeper than
             4mm;

          -  Have minimum 3 sampling sites without bleeding and with pocket depth ≤2mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are excluded from study participation where there is evidence of:

          -  Have had a dental prophylaxis within 2 weeks of plaque sampling visits;

          -  Have taken antibiotics or used anti-gingivitis / anti-bacterial oral care products
             such as chlorhexidine or Listerine within 2 weeks of plaque sampling visits;

          -  Have rampant caries, open or untreated caries, or advanced periodontitis requiring
             prompt treatment;

          -  Need an antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental visits;

          -  A history of hypersensitivity to oral care products containing hydrogen peroxide;

          -  A history of hypersensitivity to dyes (from products containing food dyes);

          -  Present with any disease or condition(s) that could be expected to interfere with
             examination procedures or the subject's safe completion of the study; or
