  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perineal body is commonly injured during labor. It is possible to perform a secondary
      repair, a perineorraphy, which aims to reduce the symptomatology after an improperly healed
      perineal tear. The aim of the randomized trial is to evaluate the results of such an
      operation compared with conservative treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial which aims to evaluate objective and subjective outcomes
      following perineorraphy compared with pelvic floor exercise after vaginal delivery. 70 women
      seeking help for improperly healed perineal tear following vaginal delivery, matching our
      inclusion- and exclusion criteria, will be randomised into two different treatment groups, 35
      to operative treatment, perineorraphy, and 35 to conservative treatment, tutored pelvic floor
      exercise. Assessment pre-and 6 months postoperatively will include clinical evaluation and
      condition specific validated questionnaires. Surgical characteristics and adverse events
      during follow-up are also registered.
