  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal Disease is a ubiquitous in nature affecting about 80% population of India. The
      Periodontal Disease is a multifactorial but the dental plaque is considered as main
      etiological agent.The dental plaque, a adhesive bacterial coating accumulate around and in
      between teeth, if not removed by effective daily brushing and flossing, plaque can cause Gum
      infection and tooth loss. Though, many scientific periodontal procedures are available to get
      the treatment but because of lack of man power and poor socioeconomic condition it is not
      possible for every group of population in our India.

      The need exist for continued research to find the use of home made mouthwashes in preventing
      periodontal diseases. Although, Chlorhexidine mouthwash is regarded as Gold standard
      mouthwash as antiplaque but have some limitations like cost factor and side effects like
      staining of teeth, loss of taste, oral mucosal ulcerations,paresthesia and may enhanced
      supragingival calculus formation. Use of various indigenous products and home made
      preparations are easily available and are being used since ancient time in India and still in
      practice in various parts of India especially rural and remote areas.

      At the same time the use of potassium permanganate is still in practice in various parts of
      India and also it was in practice before the availability of Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine
      and other antiseptic solutions, as they are used since about 30 years only. Use of hot salt
      water rinsing is in practice especially to reduce the symptoms of various throat infections
      such as pharyngitis, tonsillitis and also to improve oral hygiene.It is also being used in
      oral surgery and their effects are also mention in literature.

      Hence, the aim of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy of home made remedies like
      hot salt water and potassium permanganate as a mouthwash in reducing Plaque accumulation and
      improving Gingival conditions with Gold standard Chlorhexidine mouthwash if found effective
      may be used as affordable mouthwash for the benefit of population of India.
