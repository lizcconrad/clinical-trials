      Overall, this proposal seeks to improve treatment strategies for the significant public
      health problem of prescription opioid dependence by determining whether gabapentin, a
      non-narcotic pharmaceutical agent with minimal abuse potential and preliminary efficacy, will
      be effective in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, craving and illicit drug use in
      prescription opioid dependent participants undergoing a 10-day detoxification from
      buprenorphine. In addition, the acceptability and feasibility of transitioning to depot
      naltrexone therapy will also be determined. If successful, this study would provide data to
      support further development of gabapentin as a pharmacological tool for improved outcomes
      during opioid detoxification as well as an integrated outpatient approach for treating
      prescription opioid dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid dependence is a serious public health problem, particularly with the dramatic rise in
      prescription opioid abuse, but long-term opioid agonist maintenance with methadone or
      buprenorphine (BUP) may not be optimal for many prescription opioid abusers. Yet current
      opioid detoxification strategies are limited by high relapse rates and/or lack of efficacy in
      relieving subjective symptoms. In addition, antagonist maintenance with naltrexone (NTX),
      which may be an optimal longer-term strategy for this population, requires prior opioid
      detoxification and has been associated with relatively poor outcomes in heroin abusers. This
      application takes a novel, broad approach to address the problem of prescription opioid
      dependence by determining the 1) utility of adjunct gabapentin (GBP) during outpatient BUP
      detoxification to improve initial outcomes and 2) feasibility of transitioning prescription
      opioid -dependent patients to depot NTX following detoxification, which may improve
      longer-term outcomes. GBP, an N-type calcium channel blocker with low abuse potential,
      potentiates opioid analgesia, decreases both postoperative morphine consumption and
      movement-related pain, and reverses tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. GBP
      is also well tolerated and effective in reducing craving and illicit opioid use in pilot
      detoxification trials. The efficacy and tolerability of adjunct GBP during BUP-assisted
      detoxification and the feasibility of subsequent transition to depot NTX therapy in
      prescription opioid -dependent participants will be assessed. This 12-week, randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial will determine the potential utility of adjunct GBP in 150
      prescription opioid -dependent individuals undergoing outpatient BUP detoxification and
      whether transition to short-term depot NTX therapy is feasible. Our three specific aims are
      to determine (1) the efficacy and tolerability of GBP to reduce craving and illicit use of
      opioids in prescription opioid-dependent individuals undergoing outpatient BUP
      detoxification; (2) acceptability and feasibility of transition to, and short-term
      maintenance on, depot NTX following detoxification; and (3) prognosticators of completion of
      the BUP taper, successful induction onto depot NTX, symptomatology, and longer-term outcomes.
      Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for the treatment of opioid withdrawal are the
      opioid agonists methadone and BUP, both of which have abuse liability, and NTX, which can
      produce low levels of withdrawal-like symptoms, especially early in treatment. Findings, if
      positive, will support further development of GBP as an adjunct medication as well as provide
      an integrated, seamless approach to outpatient prescription opioid-dependence treatment.
      Ultimately, this work could impact the addiction field by providing both procedural and
      pharmacological tools for treating prescription opioid dependence that significantly improve
      outpatient detoxification outcomes and markedly enhance access and transition to NTX therapy.
      This would shift clinical practice, establishing an effective adjunct regimen for BUP
      detoxification and an integrated approach for transition to NTX therapy. GBP may also be
      clinically useful for other situations where opioid withdrawal is a concern.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. be between the ages of 18-65

          2. be available to attend clinic 6 days a week for approximately 30-60 minutes per day
             during the first 4 3 weeks

          3. fulfill Diagnostic Statistical Manual-V criteria for moderate to severe opioid
             dependence. These criteria will be ascertained in the following manner: the physician
             will determine whether the individual is appropriate based on several clinical
             assessments that are routinely employed by methadone program physicians, including
             history and severity of opioid use, presence of track marks, prior treatment history,
             self-reported and/or observed signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If any
             individual's degree of opioid dependence is questionable, that person will be excluded
             from further consideration as a participant.

          4. submit a urine sample negative for benzodiazepines or barbiturates prior to starting
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. report having had a severe adverse reaction to study medications

          2. have an unstable medical condition or stable medical condition that would interact
             with study medications or participation, including a current chronic pain or other
             medical condition that requires ongoing opioid agonist treatment (determined by
             physician assessment)

          3. have a major psychiatric disorder (psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar)

          4. have major depression or anxiety disorder requiring psychoactive medication (as
             determined by physician)

          5. physiological dependence on alcohol or drugs other than opioids, tobacco or marijuana
             (as determined by physician assessment)

          6. are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or have inadequate birth control, if relevant

          7. report ongoing use of over-the-counter or prescription drug (including Maalox) that
             would have major interaction with study drugs

          8. have any of the following: liver function tests &gt;3 times normal, blood urea nitrogen
             and Creatinine outside normal range; electrocardiogram abnormalities including but not
             limited to: bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm); prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate
             (&gt;450 msec); Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome; wide complex tachycardia; 2nd degree,
             Mobitz type II heart block; 3rd degree heart block; left or right bundle branch block;
             pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic).

        Individuals with anxiety or depression will not be excluded unless they are taking
        prescription medication for their disorder under a physician's care or findings during
        screening indicate a need for immediate treatment determined by the study physician and/or
        the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.
