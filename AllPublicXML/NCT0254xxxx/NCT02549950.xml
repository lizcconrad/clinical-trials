      1 Aim of the study- Part I:

      This prospective controlled clinical trial (CCT), Split Mouth Design is conducted to assess
      the efficiency of piezo-corticision in accelerating tooth movement and in reducing treatment
      time during retraction of canine teeth in class II div 1 subjects.

      Specific aim- Part I:

      A- To compare rate of tooth retraction between piezo-corticised and the conventionally
      orthodontically moved canines

      B- To compare length of treatment of both approaches.

      2- Objectives of the Study Part II:

      This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is designed to assess the
      efficiency of piezo-corticision in accelerating tooth movement and in reducing treatment time
      during retraction of anterior teeth in class II div 1 and class 1 bi-maxillary protrusive
      subjects.

      Specific aim Part II:

        1. To compare rate of tooth retraction between piezo-corticised and the conventionally
           orthodontically moved incisors

        2. To compare length of treatment of both approaches.

        3. To evaluate the quality of treatment outcome of both treatment approaches according to
           American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) standards.
