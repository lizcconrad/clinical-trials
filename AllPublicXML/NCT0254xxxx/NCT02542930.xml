    <textblock>
      Patients with Non-small cell lung cancer that had metastatic lesions after been treated with
      definitive surgery or chemoradiotherapy are being asked to participate in this study.

        1. To observe immunity-mediated tumor response outside the radiation field (abscopal
           effect) after chemoradiotherapy of a metastatic site in metastatic Non-small cell lung
           cancer patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy,
           chemoradiotherapy and thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic Non-small cell lung
           cancer patients;

        3. To explore the role of PET/CT scanning to assess tumor response/abscopal effect.

      This study will help find out what abscopal effects (good or bad) the combination of
      radiotherapy and thymalfasin has on metastatic Non-small cell lung cancer.

      1. To observe immunity-mediated tumor response outside the radiation field (abscopal
           effect) after chemoradiotherapy of a metastatic site in metastatic Non-small cell lung
           cancer patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy,
           chemoradiotherapy and thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic Non-small cell lung
           cancer patients;

        3. To explore the role of PET/CT scanning to assess tumor response/abscopal effect.

      Eligible are patients with metastatic Non-small cell lung cancer who have achieved stable
      disease or have disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive
      chemoradiotherapy) and have at least three separate measurable sites of metastatic lesions.
      Extent of metastatic disease is recorded both at CT and PET/CT scanning. Radiation is given
      during combined therapy to one of the lesions, 35Gy in 10 fractions over a two week interval,
      conformally to maximally spare normal tissue or organ. Thymalfasin treatment is given twice a
      week with an interval of 3-4 days each week. At day 22 radiation is re-started and the same
      radiation dose is delivered to a second metastatic site, again with thymalfasin. Abscopal
      response is evaluated by assessing clinical and PET/CT response in the non-irradiated
      measurable metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II
      Simon design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one;
      if there are no abscopal responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more
      abscopal responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.

         10. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
