  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal interphalangeal joint injuries of the fingers may be treated in various ways and no
      treatment has been shown to be superior. The investigators wish to study the effectiveness of
      syndactyly versus digital splint when comparing joint mobility. The investigators also wish
      to study the effectiveness of finger compression in reducing edema and therefore allowing a
      greater arc of motion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) injuries of the fingers are a common occurrence. They
      may be treated various ways: strict immobilization in a finger splint for one to three weeks,
      syndactyly, no immobilization. Immobilization is often responsible for joint stiffness
      whereas immediate mobilization might produce pain.

      Injuries to the joints of the hand produce edema that is responsible for additional
      stiffness. Compressive garment may be worn to limit the extent of the edema and help its
      resorption.

      Although PIPJ injuries are frequent, their treatment does not benefit from a consensus. Most
      studies are retrospective or aimed at a pediatric population. The investigators wish to
      evaluate the outcome of PIPJ injury after different treatments: either strict immobilization
      in a rigid splint for three weeks, of relative immobilization in a syndactyly for three
      weeks.The investigators also wish to study the effect of finger compression on edema
      resolution and finger motion. Therefore there will be four treatment groups: syndactyly with
      and without compression, rigid splint with and without compression.

      The study will be conducted in the hand surgery unit of a university hospital in a
      prospective way. The assignment to a particular treatment group will be randomly performed.
      Patients will be followed for 6 months.
