      Outcomes study to test the hypothesis that patients first identified by community-based
      neurologists, implanted by a networked movement disorders center, and then managed by the
      same community-based neurologist will have clinical outcomes comparable to movement disorders
      centers.

      The proposed outcomes study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single blind,
      non-inferiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation
      therapy applied in a community-based model for 62 subjects with Parkinson's disease
      appropriate for STN DBS therapy.

      Eight community-based private neurology practices will be networked to Vanderbilt University
      Medical Center (VUMC). Neurologists for each practice will attend structured educational
      programs offered by Medtronic in the identification, selection, and management of Parkinson's
      disease patients with DBS therapy. Following this educational program, each practice will
      identify subjects for implantation VUMC. Following screening and baseline visits at VUMC,
      appropriate patients will be implanted with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain
      stimulating therapy. The initial post-operative programming will be done at VUMC four weeks
      after implantation. 8 subjects will then be equally randomized with half being followed for
      long-term management by the community-based neurologist. The other half will be followed at
      VUMC.

      All subsequent outpatient evaluation management of medications and deep brain stimulation
      will be managed per standard of care at the location assigned by randomization,
      community-based private neurology practice or VUMC.

      All subjects will be enrolled during the first 24 months of the study. Follow-up evaluations
      at 12 months will be performed at VUMC. Each patient identified by the community-based
      neurologist for implantation will be assessed at VUMC. This assessment will include a
      videotaped off and on UPDRS III rating, neuropsychological testing, and appropriateness as
      outlined in the patient selection educational program. Patients will be implanted by
      bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation therapy within 120 days of their initial
      assessment. The initial post-operative programming will be performed four weeks
      post-operatively, this is all standard of care.

      Subjects will then be randomized to be either managed by their community-based neurologist or
      at VUMC. Follow-up evaluations at 12 months will include a videotaped on and off UPDRS rating
      and neuropsychological testing, anti-parkinson medication dosages, and quality of life
      measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of probable idiopathic PD. The diagnosis will
             be based upon the presence of at least three of four clinical features according to
             diagnostic utility (Resting Tremor, Bradykinesia, Rigidity, Asymmetric Onset) and an
             absence of clinical features suggestive of an alternative diagnosis.

          2. Demonstrated response to dopaminergic therapy. In order to exclude patients with a
             possible alternative diagnosis, all subjects included in the study must have
             demonstrated a good response to DA drugs, defined as demonstrating at least 30%
             improvement in parkinsonian motor signs, based upon the UPDRS motor examination
             subscore, following the administration of their DA drug(s) during the screening
             neurological examination.

          3. Advanced Parkinson's disease.

          4. No contraindications to surgery.

          5. Age between 50 and 75 years old.

          6. Available for follow-up for the entire duration of the study.

          7. Informed Consent: The subject understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the
             study procedures and participation in the study.

          8. MRI within normal range for age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of an alternative diagnosis or secondary parkinsonism, as suggested by
             features unusual early in the clinical course: Prominent postural instability,
             freezing phenomena, or hallucinations unrelated to medications in the first 3 years
             after symptom onset; dementia preceding motor symptoms; supranuclear gaze palsy (other
             than restriction of upward gaze) or slowing of vertical saccades in the first year;
             severe, symptomatic dysautonomia unrelated to medications; documentation of a
             condition known to produce parkinsonism and plausibly connected to the subject's
             symptoms (such as suitably located focal brain lesions or neuroleptic use within the
             past 6 months)

          2. Uncontrolled medical condition or clinically significant medical disease that would
             increase the risk of developing pre- or postoperative complications (e.g., significant
             cardiac or pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension).

          3. Evidence of dementia

          4. Major psychiatric disorder

          5. Previous brain operation or injury.

          6. Active participation in another clinical trial for the treatment of PD.

          7. Patients who have demand cardiac pacemakers or who have medical conditions that
             require repeat MRI scans.
