  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, observational study investigates the efficiency, safety and
      acceptance of MIRCERA in participants, who received erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA)
      using a self-application system. For each participant, the investigator documents 9 months of
      treatment with Mircera with respect to efficacy, safety and acceptance.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Satisfied With Previous Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) Treatment</measure>

    <description>Participant satisfaction was measured using 3 categories (1=satisfying, 2=undecided, 3=non- satisfying). Percentage of participants who were satisfied (with a rating of 1 [satisfying]) with previous ESA treatment was reported. For participants who had multiple previous ESA treatments, the latest applied ESA before start of Mircera therapy was considered.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1-9</time_frame>
    <description>Pain sensation was reported by participants using a visual scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (strong pain). Pain sensation at baseline referred to pain sensation regarding previous ESA. Change of pain sensation = pain sensation regarding previous ESA (baseline)' minus 'pain sensation regarding MIRCERA (Month 1-9). Positive numbers indicate less pain sensation during MIRCERA application.</description>

    <description>Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using 3 categories (1=satisfying, 2=undecided, 3=non-satisfying). Participant pre-post comparison of satisfaction rating was done by considering the difference of baseline rating (satisfaction rating for previous ESA) and rating at respective visit (satisfaction rating for MIRCERA). Thus, possible results were -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, with positive values indicating a greater satisfaction with MIRCERA than with the previous ESA (acceptance and preference of MIRCERA over previous ESA). Percentage of participants with each possible result category (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) is reported at each visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Pre-Post Shift for Participant Satisfaction With Treatment</title>
        <description>Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using 3 categories (1=satisfying, 2=undecided, 3=non-satisfying). Participant pre-post comparison of satisfaction rating was done by considering the difference of baseline rating (satisfaction rating for previous ESA) and rating at respective visit (satisfaction rating for MIRCERA). Thus, possible results were -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, with positive values indicating a greater satisfaction with MIRCERA than with the previous ESA (acceptance and preference of MIRCERA over previous ESA). Percentage of participants with each possible result category (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2) is reported at each visit.</description>

          <description>Participants receiving MIRCERA ready-to-use-syringes (methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta) at the discretion of treating physician were followed for 9 months. The recommended starting dose for MIRCERA in naive participants was 0.6 mcg/kg body weight, administered at intervals of 2 weeks. After hemoglobin value reached the target level of 11 g/dL, the interval of administration could be adopted to one monthly dose (1.2 mcg/kg body weight).</description>
