    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the
      uterus.Endometriosis affects 5%-15% of women in the reproductive age. Deep endometriosis is
      mostly defined as a single endometrial nodule, located in the vesico-uterine fold or close to
      the distal 20 cm of the large bowel. Current guidelines recommends that laparoscopy with
      histology should be done to diagnose endometriosis. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy
      (pCLE) has been used as a GI tract endoscopy additive tool in recent years, providing in-vivo
      cellular-level imaging, a concept known as &quot;optical biopsy&quot;. considering the rectal bleeding
      that occurs in patients suffering from bowel endometriosis, usually with a normal mucosa seen
      at standard endoscopy (personal data), we hypothesized that there might be histological
      architectural changes in the vessels or the mucosa/sub mucosa in bowel endometriosis.

      Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the
      uterus, most commonly over the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, recto-sigmoid colon and the
      uterine myometrium.Endometriosis affects 5%-15% of women in the reproductive age causing
      pelvic or abdominal pain, infertility and occasionally rectal bleeding (if involving the
      bowel). Deep endometriosis is mostly defined as a single endometrial nodule, usually larger
      than 1 cm which is located in the vesico-uterine fold or close to the distal 20 cm of the
      large bowel. Those lesions usually infiltrate at least 5 mm into the tissue involved. The
      gold standard of diagnosis is histological proven endometriosis, usually obtained during
      explorative laparoscopy. Other imaging tests that aid in the diagnosis are trans-vaginal or
      trans-rectal sonography (TRUS), MRI &amp; CT. Current guidelines recommends that laparoscopy with
      histology should be done to diagnose endometriosis. Negative (normal) laparoscopy is highly
      accurate in excluding endometriosis, but a positive laparoscopy (i.e. with macroscopic
      findings) without biopsy has a limited value. In practice, many clinicians refrain from
      taking biopsies due-to the risk of bowel surgery, particularly on an un-prepared bowel.

    <description>a probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy examination will be done using a standard recto-sigmoidoscopy, in women suffering from endometriosis who are referred for a TRUS examination as part of a suspected deep endometriosis diagnostic workup. pCLE images will be compared to normal bowel mucosa.</description>

    <description>Eligible women will be offered to undergo pCLE examination. Conscious sedation will be offered to all patients, who will choose to receive it or not. pCLE will be done using a standard gastroscope, reaching a distance of 25 cm from the anus, to the level of the rectosigmoid angle.
At this point, 2.5 ml fluorescein 10% will be injected. The pCLE probe (GastroFlex-UHD probe, Mauna Kea tech, Paris, France) will be inserted through the endoscope working channel and images will be recorded from areas suspected of harboring an endometriotic tissue.</description>
