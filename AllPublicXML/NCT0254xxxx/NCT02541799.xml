  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that patient comprehension of telemedicine-enabled research
      informed consent is not inferior to standard face-to-face research informed consent.

      The procotol will involve a prospective, randomized control trial to test the effectiveness
      of a telemedicine medium in obtaining research informed consent. Within a single emergency
      department, the investigators will conduct a simple, low risk randomized trial (single does
      of oral chlorhexideine to prevent hospital acquired pneumonia among adult patients with
      expected hospital admission). Prior to being approached for informed consent, potential
      participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to standard face-to-face consent
      vs. consent provided by audio-visual telemedicine. After standard clinical care, potential
      participants will be approached according to their allocation. Comprehension of research
      informed consent will be the primary outcome, and will be measured using the modified Quality
      of Informed Consent (QuIC) instrument.
