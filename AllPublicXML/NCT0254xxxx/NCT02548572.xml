  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that TES in RP patients may help to slow the progressive
      deterioration of this degenerative disease. The end point of this clinical trial is to slow
      or stop disease progression with weekly treatment using TES for 1 year.

      The following proposed study (ICM1TES/RP) will investigate the therapeutic aspects of
      transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES) on the eye in patients with retinitis pigmentosa
      (RP). It will utilize the Okuvision TES system, a Wills Eye Hospital-sponsored FDA
      non-significant risk (NSR) medical device, OkuStim® (CE-marked OkuStim®) for the application
      of electrical stimulation directly to the eye via a corneal contact electrode.

      Study Design - Multi-center, prospective, randomized sham controlled 1:1 Clinical trial.

      Study treatments - Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in treatment group
      will have TES at 200% of phosphene threshold for 30 minutes once weekly for 52 weeks in both
      eyes. Patients in sham group will also wear electrodes on both eyes, but no energy is turned
      on and both eyes are sham.

      Duration of study - anticipated duration is 36 months, 12 months for recruitment, 12 months
      for treatment and sham groups and followed for 18 months, plus 6 months for analysis.

      Inclusion Criteria - Diagnosis of RP, 22-80 years of age, no other ocular disease, able to
      complete all visits.

      Treatments - TES, 30 minute treatment weekly for 52 weeks at 0.8mA

      Number of patients - 90 patients in treatment arm and 90 patients in sham arm. Electrodes
      will be placed on both eyes, both eyes will be treated in treatment group and in the sham
      group both eyes will be considered. However due to the possibility of drop out using 15% we
      will recruit 210 patients (15 patients per center).

      Screening -

        1. VA &amp; Phosphene threshold evaluation

        2. Vfiii4e, vfVe, Octopus 900, complete eye exam, fundus photo, OCT and Contrast
           sensitivity, electro-physiology.

        3. Eligibility requirements met, then schedule baseline.

      Contrast sensitivity, NEI VFQ-25, Photopic B-wave ERG, blood draw for genetic test (unless

    <intervention_name>Transcorneal Electrical Stimulation using Okustim device</intervention_name>
    <description>The Okustim® stimulation device is a battery-powered electronic neuro-stimulator, which delivers a weak electrical pulse. This current is delivered to the eyes by the OkuStim® device using the &quot;OkuEl®&quot; electrodes, which are held in place via the &quot;OkuSpex®&quot; frame. In this study the treatment level will be held constant at 0.8 mA for all study subjects. After switching on the neuro-stimulator, the subject's retina will be stimulated through specific electrodes (OkuEl, held in position by the OkuSpex) worn on the face with the predetermined intensity and time period (delivered by the OkuStim device).</description>
