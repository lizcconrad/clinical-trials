    <textblock>
      This open-label, proof-of-principle two center cohort study will evaluate the ability of
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to induce tolerance in recipients of
      deceased or live donor liver transplants (ASCOTT). A maximum of 10 participants will be
      entered at a minimum of 3 months post liver transplant. The participants will undergo
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) to &quot;re-educate&quot; their immune systems to
      accept the graft without the need for long term immunosuppression (tolerance).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although short-term results for liver transplantation are excellent, the need for
      immunosuppression limits quality of life and long-term survival.

      Investigators plan to examine the utility and safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) to allow withdrawal of immunosuppression in 10 liver transplant
      recipients who are at a high risk of developing recurrent liver damage from repeated bouts of
      rejection, or recurrent disease or who have a high likelihood of developing serious medical
      complications from complications of immune suppression.

      Hematopoietic stem cells will be mobilized, purified and cryopreserved. Following a
      chemotherapy and Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG) based-regimen for immune ablation, the
      purified stem cells will be thawed and infused back into participants (autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant - HSCT). Participants will be converted to everolimus, a
      mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi), which will be continued for 6 months and
      then withdrawn based on histologic evidence of graft acceptance.

      Participants will be followed closely for a total of 24 months for any biochemical and
      histologic evidence of tolerance or rejection. Re-vaccination to common viral and bacterial
      antigens will be undertaken as required using a standard protocol for recipients of a
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

    <description>Step 1: Participants will receive intravenous chemotherapy and cytokine-based treatment for mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into the circulation, followed by collection using peripheral vein leukopheresis. The HSC graft product will undergo ex vivo purification with CD34 selection using Miltenyil CliniMACS and cryopreserved.
Step 2: Intravenous busulphan, cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin will be administered to participants to achieve immune ablation prior to the infusion of the participants' own thawed HSC graft product (HSC transplant). Routine supportive measures will be employed during the recovery from the chemotherapy and HSCT. Participants' immune suppression will be stopped at the time of immunoablative therapy and will be switched to everolimus which will be discontinued at 6 months post HSCT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Participants must be a minimum of 6 months post-transplant;

          3. Participants are recipients of a hepatic allograft for alcohol induced liver disease;
             or a genetic form of liver disease such as hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease; or an
             autoimmune liver disease including sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis,
             and/or primary biliary cirrhosis.

          4. Participants have a complication of transplantation that might be ameliorated by HSCT
             and/or withdrawal of immunosuppression such as: evidence of recurrent autoimmune
             disease in the graft; repeated episodes (minimum of 2) of acute cellular rejection;
