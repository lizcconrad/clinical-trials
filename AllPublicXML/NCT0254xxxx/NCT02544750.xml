  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 2 parts: a double-blinded phase and an open-label extension phase. The
      open-label extension phase only will be described in this record. All participants will
      receive the same dose of GWP42003-P. However, investigators may subsequently decrease or
      increase the participant's dose until the optimal dose is found.
