      The purpose of the clinical trial is to study the therapeutic efficacy and safety of
      Stemchymal® infusions for polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxia treatment by a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. Eligible subjects will receive Stemchymal®
      through intravenous infusion.
