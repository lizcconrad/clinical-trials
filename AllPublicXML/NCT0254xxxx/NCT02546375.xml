    <description>The cumulative response rate for haematological outcomes (PHR/CHR) defined as;
Proportion of patients presenting with a CHR during treatment with bosutinib
Proportion of patients presenting with PHR during treatment with bosutinib
The cumulative response rate for cytogenetic outcomes (CCyR/MCyR/PCyR) defined as;
Proportion of patients presenting with CCyR during treatment with bosutinib
Proportion of patients presenting with MCyR during treatment with bosutinib
The cumulative response rate for molecular outcomes (MR3/MR4/MR4.5) defined as;
Proportion of patients presenting with CMR (MR3; MR4; MR4.5) during treatment with bosutinib
Proportion of patients presenting with MMR (MR3) during treatment with bosutinib</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>• Progression-free survival at 1 year in patients treated with bosutinib
Progression will be defined as change from chronic to accelerated phase or to blast crisis.
Progression-free survival will be defined as the duration between initiation of bosutinib and date of progression estimated by the participating doctor or death of patient (all causes combined). Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to plot the survival data.</description>

    <measure>The rate of cross-intolerance between bosutinib and previously prescribed TKIs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>o Cross-intolerance will be defined as the percentage of patients who permanently discontinued bosutinib because of an adverse event which resulted in discontinuation of a previous treatment (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib). Cross-intolerance will be estimated for all AEs, but also by type of adverse event.</description>
