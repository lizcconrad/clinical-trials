  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive disease characterized by the loss
      of endothelial cells, thickening of Descemet's membrane and deposition of extracellular
      matrix in the form of guttae. This result in failure of the endothelium to support corneal
      deturgescence leading to corneal edema. Affected patients complain about blurred vision at
      early stages of the disease which can progress to blindness. The pathophysiology of the
      disease is still unclear, but several studies point towards a genetic susceptibility.
      Additional risk factors that have been identified are female sex, smoking and older age.

      While for a long time penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was the only therapy available for
      affected patients, in the recent years less invasive methods such as descemet's membrane
      endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) have been developed. In DMEK, only the Descemet's membrane
      and the endothelium is removed and replaced with the corresponding parts from a donor's
      cornea. For FECD, this brings the advantage that only the diseased part of the cornea is
      replaced. Graft detachment has been identified as the main complication following DMEK.

      In the investigators' study, an ultra high resolution OCT system will be used to detect graft
      detachment in patients with FECD after DMEK. With this technique, even small detachments can
      be visualized. The area of graft detachment will be evaluated at predefined time points after
      surgery and correlated to visual acuity. A follow-up of one year will be performed in order
      to investigate the predictive value of graft adherence status at several time points for
      visual outcome.

    <description>The area of graft detachment will be measured by a customized ultra high-resolution OCT for the cornea.
A spectrometer based ultrahigh resolution Spectral Domain OCT (SDOCT) system operating at 800 nm for the anterior chamber will be employed in the present study. The spectrum of the Ti:Sapphire laser light source is centered at 800 nm. With a full width at half maximum bandwidth of 170 nm, the axial resolution is 1.3 μm in the cornea. The transverse resolution of the employed OCT system is 21 μm at the front surface of the cornea. For measurement, patients will place their head in a modified slit lamp head rest. During the measurement period, patients will be asked to look straight forward onto an internal fixation target and to avoid blinking. Different scattering patterns, e.g. raster, circular and spiral scans will be employed.</description>
