  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a highly aggressive and relatively rare disease.
      Supportive evidence for the value of systemic therapy does not exist for this disease and
      there are no agents currently approved by regulatory agencies. This study will evaluate the
      drug Gilotrif in patients with metastatic progressive PSCC following chemotherapy. Gilotrif
      has shown supportive evidence in non-small cell lung cancer by inhibiting certain proteins
      that are also found in PSCC. The drug has the potential for some patients to exhibit a
      response contributing to a greater quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized trial phase 2 trial in which the drug Gilotrif will be administered
      at an oral dosage of 40 mg daily. This will continue until there is disease progression or
      severe toxicities. Patients will undergo a clinical exam every 4 weeks as well as have blood
      collected. Radiographic scans will be done every 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed PSCC.

          2. Patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable PSCC.

          3. Progressive disease after ≥1 prior chemotherapy regimens.

          4. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          5. Prior regimen within 6 months

          6. ECOG performance status 0-2.

          7. Adequate organ function, defined as all of the following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500 /mm3. Platelet count &gt;100,000/ mm3.

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 45ml/min.

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt;1.5 times upper limit of institutional normal; Aspartate amino
                  transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &lt;2.5 times the upper limit
                  of institutional normal (ULN).
