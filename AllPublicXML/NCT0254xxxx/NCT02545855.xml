  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized crossover study for evaluation of the efficacy and safety
      of long-term nocturnal high-flow nasal cannula therapy with the myAIRVO2® in stable COPD
      patients with stage 2-4 of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
      and hypercapnia who require home oxygen therapy (HOT). The total duration of subject
      participation will be 52 weeks, consisting of 12-week treatment period and 40-week
      continuation period. Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms, Arm A (week 1-6: the myAIRVO2® therapy plus
      HOT, week 7-12: HOT only) or Arm B (week 1-6: HOT only, week 7-12: the myAIRVO2® therapy plus
      HOT). All subjects will receive nocturnal high-flow nasal cannula therapy with the myAIRVO2®,
      in addition to their current HOT. After treatment period, the willing subjects can continue
      the myAIRVO2® therapy plus HOT for week 13-52 regardless of treatment arm assignment. The end
      of the study is defined as the treatment period or continuation period end date of the last
      participant, whichever is later. Subjects will primarily be assessed by the St. George's
      Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C) at week 0, 6, 12, 24 and 52.

    <description>All subjects will receive nocturnal high-flow nasal cannula therapy with the myAIRVO2®, in addition to their current HOT. The myAIRVO2® is used for at least 4 hours per day with flow rates in the range 30-40 L/min. The investigator can adjust the nocturnal oxygen flow rates to keep SpO2 88-92% stably. If the subjects report discomfort, the investigator can adjust the flow rates in the range at least 20 L/min.</description>
