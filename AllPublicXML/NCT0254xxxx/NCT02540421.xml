      Objectives: To identify factors associated with disease recurrence in patients with
      high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) undergoing large loop excision of the
      transformation zone (LLETZ).

      Study Design: A case-control study that included 103 patients. Patients were included in the
      study if they had a history of surgery for conization by LLETZ for the histopathological
      diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades II and III (CIN II and CIN III).
      Follow-up exams were conducted every six months with Pap smear collection and colposcopic
      examination with biopsy, when necessary, for a minimum period of twelve months. Cure was
      defined as a normal follow-up examination within 24 months. During follow-up, relapse
      occurred when cytology and/or biopsy results showed that CIN had returned after 12 months, at
      which time a new cervical conization by LLETZ was performed.
