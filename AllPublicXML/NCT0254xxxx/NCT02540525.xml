      1. OBJECTIVE:

           To determine the efficacy and safety of a single-incision mini-sling compared with a
           transobturator midurethral sling for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treatment.

        2. METHODS:

      This prospective single-center randomized controlled trial will involve 100 women with a
      diagnosis of SUI. Primary outcomes were the objective and subjective cure rates, defined as
      negative cough stress and pad tests, and satisfaction rates. Quality of life assessed by the
      Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form,
      operation time, complications, and reoperation rates were also recorded. The efficacy was
      analyzed using a noninferiority test with a margin of 15%. For the noninferiority test, a P
      value &gt;.05 rejects the noninferiority hypothesis of the mini-sling.

    <description>Safyre T Plus ® system uses two helical needles for securing an average urethral sling mesh polypropylene soft tissue below the pubic bone by means of spinal anesthesia. Short form of the sling implantation is carried out as follows: a small longitudinal incision in the anterior vaginal wall approximately 2 cm is performed at 1 cm from the urethral meatus. Takes place below minimum dissection toward the lower branch of the ischium, and with the aid of the needle obturator and perforated membrane (outside-in maneuver). After that, the sling is attached to the needle carrying the same path. Subsequently, the passage of the needle is held in contraleral side. The procedure finishes performing the adjustment of the track with the aid of Kelly forceps type.</description>
