  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proportion of people aged 60 and over in the French population has increased from 18% in
      1970 to over 22% in 2010.

      One major problem in the elderly is falling. About half of these falls cause a minor injury
      and between 5% and 25% will cause a more serious injury such as a fracture or a sprain
      (Alexander et al., 1992; Nevitt et al., 1991).

      It therefore seems essential to study the locomotion of seniors to limit the maximum risk of
      falling into a public health measure.

      Two factors may be involved:

        1. The first corresponds to factors related to natural aging topics

        2. The second is the environment that is a real problem for seniors (Rolling showers,
           presence of works ....) And especially the port of inappropriate footwear.

      Indeed, most of the elderly, institutionalized or not, do not wear proper shoes. It is this
      parameter that will be highlighted in our study.

      The subjects will test different characteristics on the same shoe. A single parameter vary
      for each condition (Different insole, heel height, stem length ...) For each condition,
      analysis of locomotion on treadmill ADAL be performed as well as tests on postural balance
      platform. Kinematic measurements, accelerometer and postural will be performed for each
      subject.
