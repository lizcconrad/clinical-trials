  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I feasibility study to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated whole
      pelvis radiotherapy in 35 patients with biopsy-proven intermediate- to high-risk prostate
      cancer as defined by NCCN risk criteria. Patients will have &gt;15% risk of lymph node
      involvement as defined by the Roach equation 2/3(PSA)+10(Gleason Score-6). Day 0 of the study
      will be defined as the time of first LHRH/agonist/antagonist injection of hormone therapy.
      Radiation therapy should begin within 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) after the date of the first LHRH
      agonist/antagonist injection. Patients will be followed at 6 weeks and then every 3 months
      for the first 24 months after completion of radiotherapy in a similar schedule to usual
      standard of care. A history and physical, PSA, testosterone and EPIC-26 questionnaire will be
      collected at each visit. Any toxicity according to CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria will be documented.
      An interim analysis for evaluating acute toxicity (≤90 days) will be performed after the
      first follow-up visit of the20th patient enrolled on protocol. The trial will be terminated
      if &gt;30% acute grade 2 or &gt;5% grade 3 or greater toxicity is observed as a result of radiation
      treatment by CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria. Grade 2 toxicity is defined as a minimal, local or
      noninvasive intervention. Grade 3 toxicity is defined as a severe or medically significant
      but not immediately life-threatening event requiring hospitalization or prolongation of
      hospitalization. Previous studies have demonstrated approximately 30% and 5% incidence of
      Grade 2 and Grade 3 or greater toxicity, respectively, with conventionally fractionated
      radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy.
