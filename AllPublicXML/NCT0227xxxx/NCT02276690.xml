  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia is very frequent among critically ill patients, concerning more than 60 % of them at
      admission and more than 80% at intensive care unit discharge. Iron deficiency is also
      frequent at admission, with prevalence around 25 to 40%. During their stay in Intensive Care
      Unit, critically ill patients are exposed to repeated blood samples and to other blood losses
      (daily blood loss has been evaluated to be as high as 128 ml/day in median), this leads to
      direct iron loss. Prevalence of iron deficiency may thus be very important at Intensive Care
      Unit discharge. However, iron deficiency diagnosis is complicated in these patients, since
      inflammation induces an increase in plasma ferritin levels and a decrease in transferrin
      saturation, the two usual markers of iron deficiency. As a consequence, iron deficiency is
      usely under-diagnosed in these patients. Treatment of iron deficiency may be indicated to
      correct anaemia but also to improve patients fatigue and muscular weakness. The
      characterization of iron metabolism regulation by the hormone hepcidin opened new ways for
      the understanding and the follow-up of these complex clinical situations (combining
      inflammation and iron deficiency). Indeed, iron deficiency is associated with a decrease in
      hepcidin synthesis, while iron overload induces hepcidin synthesis. Furthermore, low hepcidin
      levels are required to mobilize iron from stores. Hepcidin has thus be proposed as a marker
      of iron deficiency in critically ill patients. To date, standard immunological methods of
      hepcidin quantitation are only proposed in the reasearch setting and could not be proposed in
      the clinical setting because it is too expensive. New approaches for hepcidin quantification,
      based on mass spectrometry are proposed and may be routinely implemented. We make the
      hypothesis that treating iron deficiency in critically ill anemic patients, diagnosed by
      hepcidin quantification, may improve the post-Intensive Care Unit rehabilitation, and may
      thus reduce post-Intensive Care Unit cost linked to hospital stay and anaemia treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the medical economic interest of a new diagnostic method
      for iron deficiency, based on a quantitative dosage of hepcidin by mass spectrometry in
      critically ill anaemic patients.
