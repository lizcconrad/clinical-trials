    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NER1006 versus MOVIPREP in
      adult patients requiring bowel cleansing prior to any procedure that requires a clean bowel,
      using a 2-Day evening/morning Split-Dosing and 1-Day morning only Split-Dosing regimens.
      Approximately 810 patients will be randomised with the aim of achieving a minimum of 245
      patients in each of the 3 groups.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Successful Bowel Cleansing (Overall Colon)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 days (from day of first dosing to day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). A final HCS grading of A, B, C or D was derived. Grades A and B are classified as successful (i.e. all mucosa could be visualized) and C and D are classified as unsuccessful. Comparison of overall success of cleansing with NER1006 2-Day and 1-Day versus MOVIPREP was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With 'Excellent Plus Good' (Highly Effective) Bowel Cleansing (Colon Ascendens)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 days (from day of first dosing to day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). Highly effective cleansing in the colon ascendens corresponded to scores 3 (Good) or 4 (Excellent) of the HCS. Adequate plus failure of cleansing corresponded to score 0-2. Comparison of 'Excellent plus good' cleansing of the colon ascendens using NER1006 2-Day and 1-Day versus MOVIPREP was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

    <measure>Adenoma Detection Rate (Colon Ascendens)</measure>

    <description>Comparison of the number of patients with at least one adenoma detected in the colon ascendens when NER1006 2-Day and 1-Day is used for bowel cleansing versus MOVIPREP. Adenoma detection rate (ADR) defined as the number of patients with at least one adenoma in the colon ascendens.</description>

      <population>The number of participants for analysis, 245 per arm, was based on assumed overall cleansing success rates of 90% for both MOVIPREP and NER1006, a non-inferiority margin of 10%, and at least 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority. The overall number of participants analyzed was based on the modified full analysis set (mFAS).</population>

        <title>Number of Patients With Successful Bowel Cleansing (Overall Colon)</title>
        <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). A final HCS grading of A, B, C or D was derived. Grades A and B are classified as successful (i.e. all mucosa could be visualized) and C and D are classified as unsuccessful. Comparison of overall success of cleansing with NER1006 2-Day and 1-Day versus MOVIPREP was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

            <groups_desc>Hypothesis was to demonstrate non-inferiority (NI) of NER1006 2-Day to MOVIPREP (10% margin). Success rate was no. of patients with successful overall bowel cleansing as proportion of no. of patients in each group. Treatment effect was NER1006 2-Day success rate - MOVIPREP success rate. Hochberg procedure used to control Type I error since there were 2 alternative primary endpoints. An alpha level of 1.25% 1-sided was used. A closed testing procedure used to evaluate superiority if NI was met.</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>The confidence limits (CL) were adjusted for multiple comparisons (two alternative primary endpoints): To be declared non-inferior, the primary endpoint must show a difference in success rates of no greater than 10% in favour of MOVIPREP using lower 1-sided 97.5% CL. Calculated using exact Clopper-Pearson CLs. To accommodate the comparison of 2 NER1006 regimens a hierarchical testing approach was used whereby NER1006 2-Day was assessed first and, if successful, then NER1006 1-Day was evaluated.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS).
