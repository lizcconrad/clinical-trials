      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Topiramate on the decrease of Body
      Mass Index compared to placebo at 9 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity remains through adulthood in main cases, and is associated with an early
      increase of cardiovascular risk and an excess mortality in young adults due to stroke and
      cancer.

      Bariatric surgery is very rare in France for children and can cause severe complications.
      Long term effects are still unknown.

      Topiramate is already use in thousands of children in neurology, its effects are already well
      known, and no lethal complication is reported.

      The hypothesis is that Topiramate associated with standard treatment of obesity is more
      effective than standard treatment alone.

      This will be a 4.5-years, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of
      topiramate (9 months) vs placebo (9months) for Body Mass Index reduction in 160 adolescents
      (ages 9-17 years old) with severe obesity.

      The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Topiramate on the decrease of Body Mass
      Index compared to placebo at 9 months.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

        -  the decrease of Body Mass Index Z-score

        -  the tolerance of Topiramate

        -  the effectiveness of Topiramate on weight decrease and decrease of Body Mass Index and
           Body Mass Index Z-score at 1, 3 ,4 and 6 months

        -  the effectiveness of Topiramate on eating behaviour, physical activity, calculated with
           validated questionnaires and scales at 6 and 9 months

        -  the pharmacokinetic of Topiramate in obese children and adolescents
