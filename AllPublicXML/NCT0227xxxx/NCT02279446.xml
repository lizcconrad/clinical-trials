      Development of a validated computer-based instrument (software program) for the assessment of
      intermediate visual acuity (IVA). It is known that no validated method for the evaluation of
      IVA exists.

      Primary objective of the study is to validate a specific computer-based chart (optotype) that
      will enable: a) comparative studies among different groups of presbyopic patients with
      refractive errors (ie. myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism), and, b) assessment of the
      efficacy of surgical refractive procedures (ie. LASIK) on presbyopic patients.

      Intermediate Visual acuity chart is similar to the prevalent Jaeger chart. It consists of
      short blocks of text in various type sizes.The computer screen is set at a specific reading
      distance (1 meter) and the patient is asked to read the passage with the smallest type he/she
      can see. According to the smallest text he/she can read, IVA is classified from IVA1 (which
      is considered the equivalent of 20/20 distance visual acuity) to IVA5

      Validation of the computer-based IVA chart will be done by correlating the results of the IVA
      chart to the corresponding ones from the validated 20/20 distant and Jaeger near visual
      acuity charts, in a random sample of study participants with different refractive errors and
      different near and distant visual acuities.
