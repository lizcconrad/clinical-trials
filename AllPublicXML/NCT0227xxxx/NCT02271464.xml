    <textblock>
      This study consist of 4-months induction first-line chemotherapy with the G.O.N.O. FOLFOXIRI
      regimen plus bevacizumab followed by maintenance with bevacizumab or bevacizumab plus
      metronomic chemotherapy (with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide) in mCRC patients.

      The main objective of this study is to preliminarily evaluate the potential effects of the
      combination of a metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide to
      maintenance bevacizumab on pharmacodynamic and clinical parameters among mCRC patients.

    <time_frame>up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive,on study and progression free at the time of the analysis.Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event endpoint censored on the date of randomization.Disease status will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>

introduction of a new agent not included in the study treatment according to randomization arm; OR
