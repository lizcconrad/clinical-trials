  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that staple line reinforcement will result in a higher leak
      pressure than a non-reinforced staple line closure in the resected gastric specimens from
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The primary endpoint of the study is leak pressure after
      various staple line treatments. The investigators will also analyze the most common site of
      specimen leak, association of stomach thickness to leak, association of stomach thickness to
      performance of the staple line techniques, and a cost analysis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mechanical strength of various staple line
      reinforcement techniques using the resected portion of stomach in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The specimen will be collected at the time of surgery, the
      previous staple line will be excised, and a new staple line with one of the investigatory
      reinforcement procedures will be applied. The staple line techniques to be used in this study
      include non-buttressed and non-imbricated oversewing, non-buttressed and imbricated suture
      line, buttressed stapling, and no reinforcement (see protocol for description of each). The
      specimen will then be taken to the morgue where the experimental procedure will be performed
      within 6 hours of specimen procurement. The specimen will be attached to a catheter with a
      pressure monitor and blue dye will be instilled into the specimen until leakage is seen. The
      presence of leakage indicates failure of the staple line. Detailed measurements of all
      specimens will be performed as will leak pressure and location in the specimen where leak
      occurred. The specimen will then be turned over to pathology to undergo routine pathologic
      examination.

      This experimental procedure has been used previously in published literature with animal
      samples, but never with human tissue. A possible reason for the lack of testing in the
      stomach staple line in patients after sleeve gastrectomy is that the technical aspects of
      bariatric surgery were developed using gastric bypass; a procedure where the stomach is
      divided but not excised.

      The investigators hypothesize that the specimens treated with staple line buttressing
      material will fail at a higher pressure than those without reinforcement. The investigators
      will also explore the location of the failure to determine if there is a consistent site of
      weakness. Should this study yield consistent results, it would help determine a standard
      approach for staple line reinforcement after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Additionally,
      should the location of the leak be consistent, this information may help drive technical
      changes that could decrease leak rate, an infrequent but potentially devastating risk of this
      and other weight loss surgeries.

    <description>A 1 cm gastrotomy will be made with a purse-string suture placed around the defect. A fluid-instillation catheter will be inserted into the specimen via the gastrotomy. The purse-string suture will then be secured around the catheter. The catheter will be fenestrated with a flange to prevent leakage from the gastrotomy site. The catheter will be attached to a Biopac pressure-monitoring device to monitor pressure within the lumen of the specimen. The specimen will then be suspended in a water bath and methylene blue saline solution will be injected into the specimen to a pressure reading of 0. This will be time zero for our experiment. Methylene blue saline solution will then be injected steadily in incremental levels. During this process, the study team will observe for any obvious blue dye leaks at the staple line or drop in pressure on the monitor.</description>
