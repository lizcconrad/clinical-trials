      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of fluorouracil when given together
      with radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy before and after surgery in
      treating patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue
      or lymph nodes. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than
      one drug (combination chemotherapy) before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving additional combination chemotherapy
      after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy and fluorouracil
      followed by combination chemotherapy before and after surgery may be a better treatment for
      rectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil.

      CHEMORADIATION: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD)
      over 5 days for a total of 5 fractions and concurrently receive fluorouracil intravenously
      (IV) continuously over 96 hours.

      PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 2 weeks of completing chemoradiation, patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV as a
      push followed by IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Within 4-8 weeks of completing preoperative chemotherapy, patients undergo total
      mesorectal excision.

      POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin,
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every
      14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year or until removal from the study or death, whichever occurs
      first.
