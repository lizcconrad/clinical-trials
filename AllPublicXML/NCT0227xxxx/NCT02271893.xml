  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if dextromethorphan administered during 4 weeks induces a
      decrease of pain intensity in breast cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neuropathy compared to placebo group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial
      comparing dextromethorphan and placebo for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy, assessed with a (0-10) numerical scale. Cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep and
      quality of life are also assessed.

      The influence of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and MDR1 polymorphism on the dextromethorphan analgesic
      efficacy will be measured.
