  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia worldwide with a prevalence of
      8% in the elderly. AF is responsible for frequent hospitalizations, stroke, heart failure and
      mortality. AF catheter ablation is an important treatment strategy for patients suffering
      from AF, but the success rate remains low after conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).
      The mechanism perpetuating AF is poorly understood. Focal electrical sources and triggers
      (FAST) may sustain AF in some patients, which makes them a potential therapeutic target for
      ablation. However, finding FAST is very challenging due to complex nature of AF electrical
      signals. In this study, the investigators will attempt to localize focal electrical sources
      and triggers (FAST mapping) in patients undergoing AF ablation using custom software that
      evaluates periodicity and waveform morphology. Patients will be randomized to one of two AF
      ablation strategies, namely FAST mapping/ablation + PVI vs. PVI alone. The investigators will
      determine which strategy leads to better clinical outcome postablation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must be over the age 18 and have a clinical indication for their first
             catheter ablation of AF because of symptomatic AF.

          -  This will include patients with either high burden paroxysmal (&gt;4 self-terminating
             episodes of AF within the last 6 months with two episodes lasting at least 6 hours
             within the last year) or persistent AF (lasting â‰¥7 days, but which can still be
             converted to sinus rhythm).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The major exclusion criteria will include:

               -  long-standing persistent AF (ie. AF which cannot be converted to sinus rhythm, or
                  where multiple attempts at restoring sinus rhythm have failed)

               -  rheumatic valvular disease

               -  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

               -  uncorrected cardiac shunts (eg. secundum ASD)

               -  severe mitral regurgitation or mechanical mitral valve

               -  left atrial size &gt;55 mm (echo derived parasternal long axis view).
