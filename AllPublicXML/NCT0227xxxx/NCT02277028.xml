    <textblock>
      This study will compare bilateral priming followed by task specific training to health care
      education followed by the same task specific training protocol. The intention is to
      understand the effects of priming on upper limb training post-stroke.

      Techniques to enhance use dependent plasticity have been examined in stroke rehabilitation
      research. The purpose of these techniques is to prime the cortex prior to training. The
      priming techniques previously described in the literature include medication (i.e.
      amphetamines), transcranial electric or magnetic stimulation, and manipulation of
      somatosensory input. Here, the investigators examine a priming technique which is
      non-invasive and free of side effects. The technique described in this study uses bilateral,
      symmetrical, rhythmic movement &quot;bilateral priming&quot; and its purpose is to ready the motor
      cortex for functional limb training. A &quot;rocker&quot; is used so that the less affected limb can
      drive the affected one in symmetrical wrist flexion and extension. In this project, the
      investigators intend to compare bilateral upper limb priming with task specfiic training to a
      health care education website program followed by the same task specific training as the
      experimental group.This active comparator (health care education) will receive stroke related
      health education via a website from the American Heart Association. Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation willl include measurement of transcallosal inhibition persistence from the
      affected hemisphere to the less affected hemisphere and vice versa ( less affected to
      affected). The investigators expect the bilateral priming group to have greater changes in
      transcranial magnetic stimulation measures and greater improvements in behavioral measures at
      all time points.

    <description>Bilateral priming a priming technique which is non-invasive and free of side effects. The technique described in this study uses bilateral, symmetrical, rhythmic movement &quot;bilateral priming&quot; and its purpose is to ready the motor cortex for functional limb training. A &quot;rocker&quot; is used so that the less affected limb can drive the affected one in symmetrical wrist flexion and extension. The priming (15 minutes) will be following by task specific training (45 minutes). Subjects will then have a break (betw. 30-60 minutes) and then repeat the above. Total priming for one day is 30 minutes. Total task specific training for one day is 90 minutes</description>

    <description>The group with no priming will receive stroke related health education via a website from the American Heart Association (15 minutes). They will use their affected hand (as they are able) This will be followed by 45 minutes of the same task specific arm training protocol described in the bilateral priming group. This group will follow the same schedule as above. The health education (15 minutes) will be following by task specific training (45 minutes). Subjects will then have a break (betw. 30-60 minutes) and then repeat the above. Total time on health education website for one day is 30 minutes. Total task specific training for one day is 90 minutes</description>
