      The purpose of this study to investigate joint angle and joint moment in flexion-extension,
      adduction-abduction and internal -external rotation of elastic therapeutic tape and elastic
      therapeutic tape are effective in ACL-injuries subjects during drop vertical jump.This study
      requires ACL-injuries participants age range between 18 and 45 years old. The 3D motion
      analysis system (BTS, ITALY) and force plate (Kistler, USA) will be used for measure joint
      angle and joint moment during drop vertical jump movement.

      #Participants ACL-injures subjects ACL-injury group will be recruit people with ACL-injuries
      with grade I-II at least 8 weeks by measuring joint laxity test by stress X-ray with Telos
      (side to side difference between 3 - 8 mm.) .

      Inclusion criteria of ACL-injuries group are: 1) no collateral ligaments and meniscus
      injuries , 2) no joint pain and knee joint effusion (less than 2 cm. from the opposite side
      measuring at joint line, 3) no history of previous injuries in other structure of lower
      extremities that resulted in ligamentous laxity at ankle and hip, 4) no current medical
      problems such as vestibular system, visual system or neurological condition that can impair
      their ability to perform a sidestep cutting task, 5) no joint and structural deformity such
      as flat feet, genu valgus and genu varus, 6) able to complete functional test (Single hop for
      distance and Triple hop for distance) which the distance is not less than 85% of unaffected
      side .

      Exclusion criteria included 1) knee joint swelling is greater than 2 cm. of unaffected side,
      2) joint laxity test by stress X-ray with Telos (side to side difference greater than 8 mm.)

        -  Subject preparation for participants with ACL-injuries Participants will be asked to
           fill in a questionnaire about age, height, weight and history of injury or
           musculoskeletal problems. Participants will be informed to make understanding of
           purposes, methods and advantages of the study. Also, all participants will be asked to
           sign a consent form. IKDC and KOOD interviews will be conducted.The test including hop
           test and drop vertical jump will be conducted at Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi,
           Mahidol University.

      Anthropometric data, navicular drop test, ROM and muscle strength at knee joint will be
      performed in each participant. Participants will be asked to perform single hop for distance
      and triple hop on both side of their legs.

      Stress X-ray by Telos® Participants will be screened joint laxity by stress x-ray with Telos.
      Lateral view x-ray will be performed in side lying position with knee flexion between 10 to
      20 degrees. Front cushion pad will be applied on distal femur and distal tibia. Pressure load
      will be applied on 6 cm below knee joint line at 15 daN.

      Participants with ACL injuries subjects will rest for 10 minute in the quiet room and elastic
      therapeutic tape will be applied on affected side. Drop vertical jump will be performed
      follow by running 30 minutes at speed 7 km/hr. Participants will be asked to perform drop
      vertical jump task again after running.

      Drop vertical jump Drop vertical jump landing trails was performed on 31 cm. box .
      Participants were informed to jump with two hands over head as high as possible and landing
      on force plate with each foot on separate force plate . Participants were asked to perform
      the task until reach three successful trials. Successful trial was defined as participants
      can land on force plate with each foot on separate force plate without further steps.

      #Parameters

      Knee joint angle and moment at initial contact and weight acceptance phase

        1. Flexion - Extension

        2. Adduction - Abduction

        3. Internal - External rotation

             -  Statistics All data will be presented in mean ± stand error of mean. All the
                statistical test will be performed by using the SPSS for window version 17 program.
                The level of significance for difference between groups will be set at p&lt; 0.05.

      Comparison of 3D joint angles and moments between affected leg and unaffected leg in
      ACL-injuries group during side step movement will be tested by Paired T test.

    <description>Taping method will be performed in supine position .The taping technique will be started at tibial tuberosity to medial and lateral epicondyles of the femur. The tape will be cut in I shape with 30 cm. The back paper of tape will be removed from the center of tape and both end of the back paper will be placed at each end of tape. Center of the tape will be placed on the tibial tuberosity with no tension. Participants' knee will be bend approximately 20 - 30 degrees. The tape will be pulled at 1/3 of each end with 75% of available tension along the medial and lateral collateral ligaments and the tibia will be pushed to the back. The end of the tape will be placed with no tension toward the medial and lateral aspects of the thigh .</description>

    <description>Elastic therapeutic tape is one type of elastic tape that is widely used for various treatment including rehabilitation and sports injuries . The elastic therapeutic tape has different characteristics from other kind of tape. It has ability to stretch around 130 - 140% from original length and recoil back to starting length after applying the tape. Tape produces pulling force on skin which lifts and folds layers of epidermis . Pulling force provides an appropriate alignment which can facilitate and inhibit muscle contraction.It has been claimed for several benefits such as supportingly injured muscles, increased proprioception, stimulated and inhibited muscle activity, relieved pain, increased range of motion, and improved blood and lymph flow.</description>
