  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) causes various toxic effects
      in many body tissues, organs and systems such as immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
      gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine and musculoskeletal systems, liver, kidneys and
      skin.Available limited numbers of studies showed that inspiratory muscle weakness in
      allo-HSCT candidates and recipients. Although meta-analysis, systematic reviews and studies
      demonstrated beneficial effects of inspiratory muscle training on several outcomes in
      different disease groups; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and heart
      failure, no published paper reported the effects of IMT in allo-HSC recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-eight allo-HSCT recipients (˃100 days past post-transplant status) were included.
      Before and after 6-week IMT, maximal and submaximal exercise capacity, respiratory and
      peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary functions, dyspnea and fatigue perception, depression
      and quality of life were evaluated. Primary outcome measurement was respiratory muscle
      strength, secondary outcomes were exercise capacity, dyspnea, peripheral muscle strength,
      quality of life, fatigue and depression.

    <description>Treatment group received inspiratory muscle training using threshold loading device (POWERbreathe Classic, IMT Technologies Ltd. Birmingham, England) at 40% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP).
The MIP was measured at supervised session each week, and 40% of measured MIP value was the new training workload.
The treatment group trained for 30 min-per/day, 7 days/week, for 6 weeks. Six sessions at home and 1 session were performed at department.</description>
