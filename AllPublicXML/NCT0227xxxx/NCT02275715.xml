  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the project is to develop and pilot a manualized, individually delivered
      Parent Training Program for Feeding Problems (PT-F) in children with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) to assess feasibility and parent acceptance of the program. The secondary aim of the
      project is to assess the success of the PT-F program in improving mealtime behavior problems
      when compared to the wait-list control.

      Exploratory aims include obtaining preliminary data on the impact of PT-F on child and parent
      functioning (reducing parent stress and improving parent sense of competency and parent-child
      interactions at mealtime), assessing the impact of treatment on interfering behaviors around
      mealtime/snack times, and measuring nutritional improvements after treatment.

    <textblock>
      Fifty well characterized children will be randomly assigned to either the 20 week PT-F or a
      waitlist control group. Study assessments evaluating feeding and mealtime behaviors,
      nutritional intake, daytime behaviors, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, parent
      stress and parent-child interactions will be completed at Baseline, Week 10, and Week 20
      timepoints. Treatment Fidelity forms will be completed by the therapist at the end of each
      treatment session to assess achievement of session goals and parent adherence during each
      session.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females &gt;=2 and &lt; 8 years of age.

          2. At least one participating parent resides with the child &gt;50% of time.

          3. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) diagnosis of Autism
             Spectrum Disorder as established by clinical assessment, corroborated by the Autism
             Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule -
             2nd Edition (ADOS2).

          4. A total score of &gt; 54 on the Brief Autism Mealtime Behavior Inventory. A score of 54
             is one standard deviation above the mean for the ASD group, as reported by the
             developers.

          5. A receptive language level of 12 months or greater. [Rationale: diagnostic uncertainty
             of ASD in children functioning below 12 months of age and the need for the child to
             understand simple instructions in PT-F].

          6. Medication free or stable medications and/or supplements (no changes in past 6 weeks
             and no planned changes during study period). [Rationale: Many children with ASD are on
             medications to target associated behaviors. These include stimulants and atypical
             antipsychotics. Excluding these children could result in a non-representative sample
             of children with ASD and feeding problems. We will require that the feeding problems
             pre-date the initiation of medications / supplements].

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) diagnosis of Rett's
             Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder.

          2. Presence of a known serious medical condition in the child influencing the management
             of diet and treatment impacting diet or appetite (e.g., current or past
             gastroesophageal reflux disease, significant food allergies, diabetes, cystic
             fibrosis, celiac disease, endocrine disorder, genetic disorders known to impact growth
             or appetite). [Rationale: these children may require different treatments than the
             behaviorally based parent training intervention].

          3. Significant oral motor dysfunction (i.e., unable to safely chew and swallow age
             appropriate textures).

          4. Presence of known psychiatric diagnosis in the child that would require a different
             treatment (e.g., psychotic disorder, major depression).

          5. Inpatient hospitalization.

          6. Being fed via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube in the past year.

          7. On medication or supplements specifically targeting appetite.

          8. Insufficient proficiency of English language prohibiting comprehension of PT-F.
             [Rationale: Parents will need sufficient command of English to benefit from the
             English materials].
