  <brief_title>Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Biological Effects and Preliminary Pharmacokinetics of Increasing Doses of BIIL 284 BS in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Biological Effects and Preliminary Pharmacokinetics of Increasing Repeated Oral Doses (9 Days Dosing) of BIIL 284 BS (Doses: 25 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg as WIF Tablets) in Healthy Male Volunteers</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to obtain information about the safety and tolerability
      of BIIL 284 BS after repeated dosing, to find the pharmacologically active dose range by
      determination of the surrogate marker CD 11b (= Mac-1) and to obtain preliminary
      pharmacokinetic data concerning steady state and accumulation factor
