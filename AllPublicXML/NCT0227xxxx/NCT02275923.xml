      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of subcutaneous impedance measured with
      an implanted Medtronic Reveal LINQ™ insertable cardiac monitor for use as a fluid status
      monitor in hemodialysis patients. The study will measure the changes in subject subcutaneous
      impedance and compare with the fluid status assessed by the volume removed from the
      hemodialysis subject during dialysis sessions. Subcutaneous impedance trends will also be
      evaluated between dialysis sessions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who currently undergo in-clinic hemodialysis treatment prescribed 2 or 3
             times per week

          -  Patients willing to be implanted with the Reveal LINQ™ device

          -  Patients greater than 21 years of age

          -  Patients willing and able to comply with the study procedures including giving
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has an active implanted cardiac medical device (e.g. IPG, ICD, CRT, etc)

          -  Patients who currently undergo home dialysis treatment

          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,
             without documented pre-approval from a Medtronic study manager.

          -  Patient with a recent infection defined as 1) bacteremia within 60 days OR 2)
             (nonbacteremic) infection within 14 days

          -  Patient not suitable for Reveal LINQ™ implantation (e.g., severe cachexia,
             dermatologic conditions of the skin, or major medical or social conditions expected to
             reduce survival to &lt; 6 months), in the opinion of the investigator
