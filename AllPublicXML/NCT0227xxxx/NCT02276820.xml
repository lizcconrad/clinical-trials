  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled on this study will have received a stem cell transplant. After a
      transplant, while the immune system grows back the patient is at risk for infection. Some
      viruses can stay in the body for life, and if the immune system is weakened (like after a
      transplant), they can cause life-threatening infections.

      Adenovirus (AdV) is a virus that just causes symptoms of a common cold normally, but which
      can cause serious life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems. It
      usually affects the lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can also affect the
      gut, the liver, the pancreas and the eyes.

      Investigators want to see if they can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells to treat
      adenovirus infections that occur after a transplant. Investigators have observed in other
      studies that treatment with specially trained T cells has been successful when the cells are
      made from the transplant donor. However as it takes 1-2 months to make the cells, that
      approach is not practical when a patient already has an infection.

      Investigators have now generated AdV-specific T cells from the blood of healthy donors and
      created a bank of these cells. Investigators have previously successfully used frozen
      virus-specific T cell lines generated from healthy donors to treat virus infections after
      bone marrow transplant, and have now improved the production method and customized the bank
      of lines to specifically and exclusively target AdV.

      In this study, investigators want to find out if the banked AdV-specific T cells derived from
      healthy donors are safe and can help to treat adenoviral infection.

      The AdV-specific T cells (Viralym-A) are an investigational product not approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make AdV-specific T cells (Viralym-A cells), small pieces of protein called peptides that
      come from AdV were mixed with blood cells from healthy donors. These peptides train a kind of
      white blood cell called T cells to recognize and kill cells that are infected with AdV. These
      T cells were then grown in special growth factors in special flasks in the lab. Once we made
      sufficient numbers of cells, we tested them to make sure they recognized cells infected by
      adenovirus, and then we froze them.

      When we think the subject needs them, Viralym-A cells will be thawed and injected into the
      intravenous line. To prevent an allergic reaction, prior to receiving Viralym-A cells the
      subject may be given diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen (Tylenol). The subject will
      remain in the clinic for at least one hour after the infusion. After the subject receives the
      cells, the transplant doctor will monitor the levels of adenovirus in the blood. We will also
      take blood to see how long the cells we gave the subject are lasting in the body.

      Subjects will continue to be followed by their transplant doctors after the injection. The
      subject will either be seen in the clinic or they will be contacted by a research nurse to
      follow up for this study every week for 6 weeks, then at 3, 6 and 12 months. The subject may
      have other visits for their standard care. Subjects will also have regular blood tests done
      to follow their counts and the viral infection as part of their standard care.

      To learn more about the way Viralym-A cells are working in the body, an extra 30-40 ml (6-8
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then at study follow-up visits at
      1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks, and 3 months after the infusion. Blood should come from the central
      intravenous line, and should not require extra needle sticks.

      All participants on this study will be infused with the same number (dose) of cells. If
      Viralym-A infusion has helped the subjects infection or if they have had a treatment, for
      example with steroid drugs that might have destroyed the T cells the subject was given, then
      they are allowed to receive up to 4 additional infusions of the Viralym-A cells at the same
      initial dose level from 28 days after their initial infusion. Following infusions should be
      at least 14 days apart. After each Viralym-A cells infusion, subjects will be monitored as
      described above.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
             using either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells or single or double cord blood
             within 24 months.

             standard therapy or failure of therapy as described below or if unable to tolerate
             standard therapy. Standard therapy is defined as antiviral therapy with cidofovir or
             an alternative antiviral agent if patient will not tolerate cidofovir therapy because
             of poor renal function.

             i. Adenovirus infection: defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as detected
             by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture from ONE site, such as stool or blood or
             urine or nasopharynx.

             ii. Adenovirus disease: defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as detected
             by PCR, Direct fluorescent assay (DFA) or culture from two or more sites such as stool
             or blood or urine or nasopharynx.

             iii. Failure of therapy: defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral load in
             peripheral blood or any site of disease as measured by PCR (or any other quantitative
             assay) after 7 days of antiviral therapy.

          3. Patients with multiple viral infections including AdV are eligible if their AdV
             infection is persistent despite standard therapy as defined above. Patients with
             multiple infections with one or more reactivation and one or more controlled infection
             are eligible to enroll.

          4. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids to equal or less than 0.5
             mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent).

          5. Received transplant care locally and will remain in the Houston area for at least 6
             weeks post Viralym-A infusion.

          6. Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 8.0 (may be transfused).

          7. Available Viralym-A T cell line.

          8. Negative pregnancy test in female patients if applicable (childbearing potential who
             have received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen).

          9. Informed consent explained to, understood by and signed by patient/guardian.
             Patient/guardian given copy of informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients receiving Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), Campath or other immunosuppressive T
             cell monoclonal antibodies within 28 days of treatment with Viralym-A.

          2. Patients with other uncontrolled/progressing infections defined as hemodynamic
             instability attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or
             radiographic findings attributable to infection. For bacterial infections, patients
             must be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72
             hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive
             systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week
             prior to enrollment. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be
             interpreted as progressing infection.

          3. Patients who have received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 28 days of Viralym-A
             infusion.
