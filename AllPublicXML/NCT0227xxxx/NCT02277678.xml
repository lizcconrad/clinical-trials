  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to compare the efficacy of pain relief between
      epidural oxycodone and epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia after elective caesarean
      section and to compare the incidence and severity of pruritus. Secondary objectives are to
      compare other side effects of epidural administered oxycodone and morphine (nausea and
      vomiting, sedation, respiratory depression) and to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      epidural oxycodone and epidural morphine after use for postoperative analgesia in caesarean
      sections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Undesirable side effects such as pruritus and nausea are common with epidural morphine and
      are thought to be due to mu-opioid receptor stimulation at the supra-spinal level. Recent
      studies of epidural oxycodone for abdominal and gynaecological surgery have shown that it is
      as effective as morphine with fewer side effects by this route. This has not been established
      in patients undergoing caesarean section. Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid derivative
      that resembles morphine structurally and has similar lipid solubility. It has been reported
      that the analgesic action of oxycodone is more rapid in onset when compared with morphine and
      is mediated by kappa-opioid receptors in the spinal cord. The significance of our study would
      be to establish that epidural oxycodone reduces the side effects of pruritus of epidural
      morphine whilst still maintaining similar analgesia.
