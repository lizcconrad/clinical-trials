    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, parallel assignment, double blind, placebo-controlled,
      safety/efficacy phase II study of two different dosages of subcutaneous F8IL10 in patients
      with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving MTX.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to formally demonstrate the superiority of F8IL10 vs placebo and to
      further evaluate safety and efficacy of two different dosages of F8IL10 when administered to
      patients receiving MTX.

      Patients will be enrolled and double-blind, parallel assigned (via automated randomization
      system) in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three different arms:

        -  Arm 1: placebo + MTX

        -  Arm 2: F8IL10 30 µg/kg + MTX

        -  Arm 3: F8IL10 160 µg/kg + MTX

      F8IL10 or placebo will be subcutaneously injected once a week for 8 weeks. Treatment will
      terminate at the earliest of the following: completion of the 8 weeks of therapy, withdrawal
      of informed consent, unacceptable toxicity/intolerability of the study drug or need to
      increase MTX, oral corticosteroids or NSAIDs dosages above baseline levels or need to
      introduce a new DMARD or biologic therapy to control rheumatoid arthritis activity. The study
      will be conducted in a double blind fashion.

             at the end of treatment visit.

         11. Male patients must agree to use simultaneously two acceptable methods of contraception
             (i.e. spermicidal gel plus condom) from the screening to three months following the
             last study drug administration.

         12. Signed and dated Ethics Committee-approved informed consent form indicating that the
             patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

         13. Willingness and ability to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

         14. Chest X rays performed (for other reasons than the present clinical trial) within a
             period of 3 months prior to the screening visit. However, in the case the patient
             performs the Quantiferon TB test during the screening visit, this period can be
             extended to 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients must not be enrolled into the study if, at the time of enrolment, they have any of
        the following:

          1. Presence of active infections or other severe concurrent disease, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would place the patient at undue risk or would interfere
             with the study objectives or conduct.

          2. Pregnancy, lactation or unwillingness to use adequate contraceptive methods.

          3. Diagnosis of any other inflammatory arthritis or active autoimmune diseases other than
