  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is now an accepted treatment of uterine fibroids. However
      the procedure is often very painful and, in many centres, patients are admitted overnight
      with PCA pumps for pain control and discharged the next day with heavy pain medications. The
      goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a superior hypogastric nerve block in
      controlling the pain post-UFE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded study in which the patients and the primary operators of the UFE as
      well as the post-procedural caregivers are blinded to whether the patients have received a
      sham procedure (injection of xylocaine in the skin in the peri-umbilical region) or the
      superior hypogastric nerve block.

      The superior hypogastric nerve block (SHGNB) consists of advancing a 21g Chiba needle via an
      anterior approach up to the superior hypogastric nerve plexus and injecting 20cc of 0.75%
      Ropivacaine which is a long lasting local anesthetic agent. The nerve plexus is positioned
      below the aortic bifurcation along the anterior surface of the vertebral body. By
      fluoroscopy, the location can be identified by having a catheter crossing the aortic
      bifurcation. That way, we are able to target, under fluoroscopy, the anterior surface of the
      vertebral body just below the catheter.

      Our UFE starts with a right CFA access. The catheter is crossed to the left side and the left
      uterine artery embolized with PVA 500-700 particles. The operator will then leave the room.
      Another operator will come and perform either the hypogastric nerve block or the sham
      procedure (injection of xylocaine in the periumbilical subcutaneous tissues). If the
      hypogastric nerve block is done, the needle is advanced into position via an anterior
      periumbilical approach under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the bony surface is contacted, 3 cc
      of xylocaine is injected to numb the area and then 3-6 cc of contrast is injected to ensure
      that it drapes the anterior vertebral body surface. If it spreads along both sides of the
      vertebral body and there is no vascular intravasation of contrast, the 20 cc of Ropivacaine
      is injected. If it only drapes one side, 10 cc is injected and the needle repositioned to the
      other side, the position verified with contrast, and the left over 10 cc of Ropivacaine
      injected.

      After the block or sham procedure is done, the primary operator enters the room again and the
      UFE completed with embolization of the right uterine artery.

      The patient is transferred to the recovery room and monitored. Pain medication including
      fentanyl and midazolam are offered at routine interval or on patient request. Pain scales are
      measured routinely and the patient is discharge home with a pain survey with visual analog
      pain scales to be performed routinely for 10 days.

      The patient is followed up in 4-6 months with a follow-up MRI and consultation to look at the
      results of the procedure.

      Comparison of the pain scale reports and use of pain medication will be evaluated between
      both groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference.
