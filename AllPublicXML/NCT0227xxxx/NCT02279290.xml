  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial uses a modularized cognitive behavioral resilience training
      (MCBRT) intervention to probe risk and resilience mechanisms linked to post-trauma
      psychopathology. Ninety participants with a history of interpersonal trauma during childhood
      or adolescence and mild to moderate distress will be randomized to MCBRT or a health
      education control condition. The primary aims of this proposal are to examine whether
      individuals who receive MCBRT demonstrate increases in psychological resilience, biological
      resilience, and extinction learning compared to those in the control group. This study will
      also explore associations between these psychobiobehavioral risk and resilience factors.
