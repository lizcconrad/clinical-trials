      The safety and performance of dCELL® Meniscus will be evaluated in 60 patients after partial
      replacement of the native medial or lateral meniscus with the investigational product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dCELL® Meniscus is a novel decellularised porcine xenograft which is processed using a
      patented variation of Tissue Regenix's platform dCELL® technology to render it biocompatible
      and free from cellular material, leaving behind an acellular biological scaffold that is safe
      for human implantation whilst preserving the biomechanical properties. It is indicated as a
      biological implant to replace parts of the native meniscus in the knee for patients who
      present with chronic pain following failed previous meniscus repair or partial meniscectomy.
