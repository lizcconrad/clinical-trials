  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled phase III study the investigators will evaluate whether TIL
      infusion preceded by non-myeloablative chemotherapy and followed by high dose bolus
      interleukin-2 can result in an improved progression free survival when randomly compared to
      ipilimumab in 168 stage IV melanoma patients. A health technology assessment (HTA) will be
      performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational
      processes and cost-effectivity.

      performed to evaluate the impact of the TIL treatment on patients and organizational
      processes and cost-effectivity. This will be done via questionnaires at baseline, just after
      treatment and during follow-up. Also healthcare providers will be interviewed after 6 months
      after starting the trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed unresectable AJCC stage III or stage IV melanoma

          -  Patients must have metastatic melanoma with a resectable metastatic lesion(s) of
             sufficient size (≥ 2-3 cm in total) and must be willing to undergo such a resection
             for experimental purposes.

          -  Patients should have received maximum one line of systemic therapy (except for
             ipilimumab) for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.[

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years of age and must have measurable disease by
             CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria (in addition to the resected lesion).

          -  Patients must have a clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.

          -  Patients of both genders must be willing to practice a highly effective method of
             birth control during treatment and for four months after receiving the preparative
             regimen.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of less than three months.

          -  Patients with metastatic ocular/ mucosal or other non-cutaneous melanoma.

          -  Adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab within 6 months prior to randomization.

          -  Requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day
             prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive drugs within the last 3 weeks
             prior to randomization.

          -  Patients who have a more than two CNS metastases.

          -  Patients who have any CNS lesion that is symptomatic, greater than 1 cm in diameter or
             show significant surrounding edema on MRI scan will not be eligible until they have
             been treated and demonstrated no clinical or radiologic CNS progression for at least 2
             months.

          -  All patients' toxicities due to prior non-systemic treatment must have recovered to a
             grade 1 or less. Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures or focal
             palliative radiotherapy (to non-target lesions) within the past 4 weeks, as long as
             all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, because of the potentially dangerous effects
             of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.

          -  Any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses.

          -  Any autoimmune disease
