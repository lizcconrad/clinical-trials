      This is an open label, three-arm, phase 1 dose escalation study and phase 2 study of BBI608
      in combination with sorafenib, or BBI503 in combination with sorafenib. The study population
      is adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received systemic
      chemotherapy.

      The phase 1 portion will involve dose-escalation of BBI608 administered in combination with a
      fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 1), and dose escalation of BBI503 administered in
      combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 2). The fixed starting dose-level of
      sorafenib for both arms will be 400 mg twice daily (800 mg total daily dose). Eligible
      patients will be randomized to either Arm 1 or Arm 2.

      The phase 2 portion will be an open-label, 3-arm, randomized trial of patients with advanced
      HCC who have not received prior systemic treatment. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either, Arm 1: sorafenib administered in combination with BBI608 (at the RP2D determined for
      BBI608 plus sorafenib during the phase 1 portion); Arm 2: sorafenib in combination with
      BBI503 (at the RP2D determined for BBI503 plus sorafenib during the phase 1 portion), or Arm
      3: sorafenib alone at a starting dose of 400 mg twice daily. The starting dose for sorafenib
      is the same for all study arms.

             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, significant
             pulmonary disease (shortness of breath at rest or mild exertion), or uncontrolled
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements (e.g. no reliable transportation).

         11. Subjects with a history of another primary cancer, with the exception of: a)
             curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma
             in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor with no known active disease present that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, will not affect patient outcome in the setting of
             current hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis.

         12. Abnormal ECGs which are clinically significant such as QT prolongation (QTc &gt; 480
             msec), clinically significant cardiac enlargement or hypertrophy, new bundle branch
             block, or signs of active ischemia. Patients with evidence of prior infarction who are
             New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II, III, or IV are excluded, as
             are patients with marked arrhythmias such as Wolff Parkinson White pattern or complete
