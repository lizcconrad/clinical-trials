  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the technique for the detection of left atrial
      fibrosis through segmentation of endocardial and epicardium landmarks of the images obtained
      with 3 Tgadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance with the software GIMIAS® in a cohort of
      healthy volunteers, without atrial fibrillation or known cardiovascular risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3D reconstructions obtained by GIMIAS® will be evaluated. Processing images will be carried
      out by two independent operators, and will calculate the kappa interobserver agreement .

      Subsequently, the processed images are compared with images previously obtained in 10
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation adjusted for sex and age. A qualitative visual
      comparison will be made.
