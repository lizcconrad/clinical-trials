        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended signs, symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug. SAE is any AE that resulted in death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, life-threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, up to 90 days after the end of treatment (EOT).</description>
