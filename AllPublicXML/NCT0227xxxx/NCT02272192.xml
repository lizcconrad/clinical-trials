      A multi-site randomized study of intensive treatment for toddlers with autism. This project
      proposes a three-site collaborative network plus a data coordinating center to evaluate the
      effects of intervention intensity and intervention style delivered for 12 months, on the
      developmental quotients (primary outcome) of very young children with ASD ages 12-30 months
      old and their families, and the effect of children's initial vocal skills, developmental
      rates and autism severity on their response to intervention. A second study will examine
      whether the effects of the Early Start Denver Model intervention are sustained over a three
      year period for 6-7 year old children who previously were enrolled in a two year study that
      compared ESDM treatment to usual community interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High quality, intensive early intervention is a powerful treatment for ASD, improving IQ and
      language markedly in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), though little long term
      follow-up data exists. Few core characteristics that affect child change have been tested.
      Two potential core characteristics that invoke considerable debate among parents,
      professionals, and administrators are the delivery style of intervention: play-based versus
      discrete trial teaching, and the intensity (dosage) of intervention. This ACE treatment
      network will conduct two RCTs to answer two main questions: study 1: what are the effects of
      intensity and delivery style on developmental progress of toddlers with ASD, and study 2: do
      toddlers from a previous RCT of a specific intervention approach, the Early Start Denver
      Model (ESDM), versus community treatment maintain and generalize treatment effects over 3
      years?

      A sample of 108 young children with ASD, ages 15-30 months who live within a specified radius
      near the university at each site will be enrolled in one of three national sites (Univ Cal
      Davis, Vanderbilt, Univ. Washington) and randomized into one of four cells varying on two
      dimensions: dosage - 15 or 25 hours per week of 1:1 treatment; and discrete trial teaching or
      play and routines- based teaching. Other aspects of intervention will be held constant: use
      of the principles of applied behavior analysis, intensity, parent coaching in the assigned
      treatment, and location. Developmental progress will be measured monthly allowing for growth
      curve analysis to examine fine-grained differences in groups as well as interactions among
      major child and family initial variables and these two experimental variables.

    <description>The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a comprehensive behavioral early intervention approach for children with autism, ages 12 to 48 months. The program encompasses a developmental curriculum that defines the skills to be taught at any given time and a set of teaching procedures used to deliver this content. The teaching format focuses on natural activities involving play or daily routines, though structure is added for children who need more structure to progress well. Progress data is collected throughout each session and used to make decisions about teaching approaches. Discrete Trial Teaching is not used in this group.</description>

    <description>Discrete trial training (DTT) is a one-to-one instructional approach used to teach skills in a planned, controlled, and systematic manner. Each trial or teaching opportunity has a definite beginning and end, thus the descriptor discrete trial. Within DTT, the use of antecedents and consequences is carefully planned and implemented. Positive praise and/or tangible rewards are used to reinforce desired skills or behaviors. Data collection is an important part of DTT and supports decision making by providing teachers/practitioners with information about beginning skill level, progress and challenges, skill acquisition and maintenance, and generalization of learned skills or behaviors.</description>
