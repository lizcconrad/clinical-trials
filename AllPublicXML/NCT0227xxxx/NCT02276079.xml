    <textblock>
      The study is a &quot;proof-of-principle&quot; project to examine the safety and feasibility of
      implementing a 1-week aerobic exercise program in the post-acute phase after mild traumatic
      brain injury (mTBI). The study will define the extent to which the exercise program improves
      recovery from mTBI in terms of relevant functional outcomes (cognition, mood, and physical
      status) and biomarkers (peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] concentration).

      This is a &quot;proof-of-principle&quot; project for human subjects to examine the safety and
      feasibility of implementing a 1-week aerobic exercise program in the post-acute phase after
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study will define the extent to which the exercise
      program improves recovery from mTBI in terms of relevant functional outcomes (cognition,
      mood, and physical status) and biomarkers (peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      [BDNF] concentration). This project will also lay the foundation for understanding the
      relationship between exercise and BDNF in the area of mTBI neurorecovery, thereby allowing
      future studies to develop best-practice methods for implementing exercise interventions as a
      treatment option for brain injuries.

    <measure>Change in Symptom Score on the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Obtained from the 22-item symptom evaluation included in the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3). The participant's present experience of each symptom is rated on a likert scale from 0 (none) to 6 (severe). The symptom score represents how many symptoms the participant endorses experiencing at a level greater than 0 (maximum 22 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptom Severity on the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom evaluation included in the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT3). The participant's present experience of each symptom is rated on a likert scale from 0 (none) to 6 (severe). The symptom severity represents the total summed severity ratings for all symptoms (maximum 132 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Obtained from the Medical Outcomes Sleep Scale (MOS). This measure has 12 items and asks the participant to rate different aspects of their sleep experiences and sleep quality. The first two questions inquire about sleep times and the remaining questions utilize a likert scale ranging from 1 (all of the time) to 6 (none of the time). Some items are reverse scored and the scale yields several subscale measures, so scoring rules depend on the specific subscale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in postural stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) will be used to measure postural stability, which is sensitive to deficits in balance following mild head injury. A modified version of (SCAT3) will be used. It includes three different stances, double leg, single leg, and tandem stance. A point is added for committing an error during the test interval and if the participant is unable to maintain his or her balance for more than 5 seconds, the trial is discontinued and maximum points are awarded. The total score ranges from 0 (better postural stability) to 30 (worse postural stability).</description>

The participant detects and marks through all occurrences of the two target digits: &quot;2&quot; and &quot;7.&quot; In the 10 Automatic Detection trials, the target digits are embedded among alphabetical letters that serve as distractors. In the 10 Controlled Search trials, the target digits are embedded among other numbers that serve as distractors. Correct hits and errors are counted for each trial and serve as the basis for scoring the test.</description>
