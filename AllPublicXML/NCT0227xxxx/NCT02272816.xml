  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic seminoma is a relatively uncommon disease. The most widely used treatment for this
      disease is chemotherapy with the drugs, cisplatin and etoposide with or without the addition
      of bleomycin. This treatment combination has shown good survival rates however it is toxic
      usually requires an inpatient visit with administration over three days and can cause
      significant nausea, malaise, alopecia, risk of kidney damage, hypertension and high tone
      hearing loss.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that carboplatin is also effective in treating this
      disease type. Progression free survival is less than that seen with the combination
      chemotherapy yet overall survival is the same between the two treatments because of the
      effectiveness of second line salvage chemotherapy. Single agent carboplatin is a less toxic
      treatment and more convenient as it is given as a day case.

      A recent study run by the Orchid Clinical Trials Group looked at whether carboplatin (AUC10)
      is not only associated with fewer side effects, but more convenient to give as an outpatient
      treatment and that it is comparable in terms of cure rate. 20 patients were recruited to the
      trial and the results were encouraging with only one relapsed patient. This patient went on
      to be cured by conventional treatment. The positive outcome of the AUC10 trial has led to the
      design of this new multi centre study.

      This open labeled, multi centre trial will recruit up to 50 patients with good prognosis
      metastatic seminoma. All patients will receive three cycles of carboplatin AUC 10. Patients
      will be followed up for survival and closely monitored for side effects during treatment.
      Patients will have a PET-CT scan before they start treatment and after the completion of
      their first cycle. We hope that this scan will help us to identify which patients have
      responded metabolically and therefore not requiring an extra cycle of chemotherapy.

    <description>Carboplatin will be administered as a day case and doses will be calculated using the Calvert formula as below:
Dose (mg) = (GFR + 25) x 10
Treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks for 3 or 4 cycles depending on the metabolic response after cycle 1 (assessed by PET-CT scan). Patients who display complete response after cycle 1 will have 3 cycles in total. Those who display partial response will have 4 cycles in total. Patients who display no response after cycle 1 but do display a response after cycle 2 will have 4 cycles in total. Those who display no response after cycle 2 will be withdrawn.</description>
