  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if infusions of a particular type of
      patients' own white blood cells called natural killer (NK) cells can reliably and safely be
      given to patients with brain tumors after the cells have been through a procedure to expand
      (increase) their numbers.

      Researchers also want to learn if NK cells infused through the ommaya reservoir can help to
      control the disease in patients with advanced brain tumors. The ommaya reservoir is a
      catheter system through which NK cells will be infused directly into areas of the brain
      called the fourth ventricle or the lateral.

      This is the first study of intraventricular NK cell infusions (infusions into the ventricle
      of the brain) in humans.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of NK cells based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of NK cells will be
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of NK cells is found.

      NK Cell Collection, Expansion, and Infusion:

      Blood (up to 10 tablespoons) will be drawn through your central venous catheter if you have
      one, or through a needle stick.

      Your NK cells will then be processed in The Cell Therapy Laboratory GMP facility at MD
      Anderson to make increased numbers of NK cells. Leftover blood from this process and/or extra
      NK cells beyond what is needed for the study will be used to study the appearance and
      function of your NK cells.

      Your NK cells will be destroyed if the cells show some form of abnormal cell growth during
      the process and are unsafe for infusion, if you are found to not be eligible to receive the
      infusions, or if you leave the study early.

      If you do not already have an Ommaya catheter that has been placed in the lateral or fourth
      ventricle of your brain, you will have one placed before receiving the NK cells. You will
      sign a separate surgical consent form that will describe the procedure in more detail.

      You will receive the NK cells 1 time a week (at least 3 days apart) for the first 3 weeks in
      each 4-week cycle. These infusions will be given to you over about 3 minutes through the
      ommaya reservoir catheter.

      On the days of the NK cell infusions, you will take the following drugs to lower the risk of
      side effects:

      -You will take Tylenol (acetaminophen) by mouth before the infusion. If the doctor thinks it
      is needed, you will take it again 4-6 hours later.

      Study Visits:

      The screening tests may be repeated if your NK cell infusion is delayed more than 30 days.

      If more than 4 weeks have passed since you had an MRI at screening, it will need to be
      repeated before receiving the NK cells in Cycle 1.

      Before receiving the first NK cell infusion in Cycles 1, 2, and 3:

      -You will have a physical exam.

      Within 7 days before receiving the first NK cell infusion in Cycles 1-3, blood (about 1
      tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On the days of the NK cell infusions in Cycles 1-3:

      - You will have a physical exam before the infusion, which may be done at bedside.

      Right before the NK cell infusion, CSF will be withdrawn from the ommaya reservoir and used
      for routine tests. The CSF will also be used to study any tumor cells or NK cells in the CSF.

      - You will have an MRI of the brain within 72 hours before the first NK cell infusion in
      Cycle 1. An MRI of the spine will be performed at the same time if the doctor thinks it is
      needed. If these scans show the disease has gotten worse since the time of screening, it will
      serve as the baseline scan. You will still move forward with NK cell infusions if the doctor
      thinks you are stable to receive infusions.

      After you finish Cycle 3 and within 7 days after the last dose of NK cells, you will have an
      MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease. You will also have an MRI of the spine
      if the doctor thinks it is needed. MRIs can be performed earlier if the doctor thinks it is
      needed.

      You will have a brain MRI with a CINE study (checking the proper flow of CSF that surrounds
      and flows in the brain and spine) to check the flow of CSF into the spine from the brain
      before the first infusion of NK cells. This has to be performed any time after the placement
      of the catheter and the first infusion of the NK cells.

      Length of NK Cell Dosing:

      You may receive up to 3 cycles of the NK cells. You will no longer be able to receive the NK
      cells if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      Within 30 days after completing Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Within 7 days after the last infusion of NK cells, you will have an MRI of the brain and
           spine to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a spinal tap to withdraw a small amount of CSF from around your spinal
           cord to check for tumor cells if your doctor thinks it is appropriate.
