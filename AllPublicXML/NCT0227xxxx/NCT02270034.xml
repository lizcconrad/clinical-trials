    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          2. Male or Female ≥18 years old and ≤ 70 years old

          3. Newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) confirmed by biopsy or resection 4-7 weeks before
             registration.

          4. Patients must have at least 15 unstained slides or 1 tissue block (frozen or paraffin
             embedded) available from a prior biopsy or surgery (archival tumor material).

          5. Patients must have sufficient time for recovery from prior surgery (at least 4 weeks).

          6. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 60%.

          7. Adequate hematologic function: Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL, absolute
             neutrophil count (UNL) ≥ 1,500 cells/ul, platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/ul.

          8. Adequate liver function: Bilirubin ≤ 2 X upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate
             aminotrasferase (AST) (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

          9. Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73
             m2l for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

         10. The effects of crizotinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or harrier method of birth control; abstinence; surgical sterilization)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for at least 3
             months thereafter. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the
             judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. All female patients with
             reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) within 2
             weeks prior to starting treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of extra-cranial metastatic disease.

          2. Any prior radiotherapy (RT) or chemotheraphy (QT) treatment.

          3. Patients must not have received prior Gliadel wafers.

          4. The use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs will not be allowed. Those patients
             taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs required a 7-day washout period before
             registration.

          5. Any surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy)
             within 2 weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side
             effects of previous procedures.

          6. Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, which may impair intake,
             transit or absorption of the study drug, such as the inability to take oral medication
             in tablet form.

          7. Any psychiatric or cognitive disorder that would limit the understanding or rendering
             of informed consent and/or compromise compliance with the requirements of this
             protocol.

          8. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:

               -  A myocardial infarction within 12 months;

               -  Uncontrolled angina within 6 months;

               -  Congestive heart failure within 6 months;

               -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome;

               -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as
                  ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes);

               -  Prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt;470 msec);

               -  Any history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if currently
                  have a pacemaker);

               -  Heart rate &lt;50/minute on pre-entry electrocardiogram;

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension.

          9. Any patient with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, even if currently
             controlled, or who has signs or symptoms suggesting impaired left ventricular function
             in the judgment of the investigator must have a screening left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) evaluation by ECHO or angyography (MUGA). Patients with LVEF
             measurements below local institutional lower limit of normal or less than 50% will not
             be eligible.

         10. Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients will not be
             eligible if they have evidence of other malignancy requiring therapy other than
             surgery within the last 3 years.
