    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg for the relief of vomiting due to
      inoperable malignant intestinal obstruction in patients without nasogastric tube (NGT) and to
      assess the efficacy of lanreotide Autogel 120 mg on removal of nasogastric tube without the
      recurrence of vomiting in patients with an inoperable malignant intestinal obstruction with a
      nasogastric tube.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of responding patients before or at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>A responder is defined as a patient experiencing ≤ 2 vomiting episodes/day during at least 3 consecutive days at any time point between the Day 0 and Day 7 (for patients without NGT at baseline) or as a patient in whom the NGT has been removed during at least 3 consecutive days at any time point between the Day 0 and Day 7 without vomiting recurrence (as recorded on diary cards).</description>

    <description>A responder is defined as a patient experiencing ≤ 2 vomiting episodes/day during at least 3 consecutive days at any time point between the Day 0 and Day 14 or as a patient in whom the NGT has been removed during at least 3 consecutive days at any time point between the Day 0 and Day 14 without vomiting recurrence (as recorded on diary cards).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of responding patients before or at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>A responder is defined as a patient experiencing ≤ 2 vomiting episodes/day during at least 3 consecutive days at any time point between the Day 0 and Day 28 or as a patient in whom the NGT has been removed during at least 3 consecutive days at any time point between the Day 0 and Day 28 without vomiting recurrence (as recorded on diary cards).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life assessed by both patient and caregiver based on Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). The ESAS scale is an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10 where zero [0] indicates no symptom and 10 indicates worst possible pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in General activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>General activity assessed by Karnofsky performance score. Karnofsky performance score is used to quantify participant's general well-being and activities of daily life and participants are classified based on their functional impairment. Karnofsky performance scores range from 0 (death) to 100 (no evidence of disease).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in abdominal pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal pain assessment using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a 100-mm (10-cm) scoring scale. Score range on VAS is from 0 to 100 where zero [0] indicates no pain and 100 indicates worst possible pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in average number of bowel movements per day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14 and 28</time_frame>
