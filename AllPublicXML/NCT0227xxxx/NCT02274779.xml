  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing number of reports describing the existence of a proportion of prostate
      cancer patients who present with a reduced number of metastases (&lt;5 lesions) at relapse. This
      oligometastatic status has also been recognized in other tumor types such as melanoma, soft
      tissue sarcoma, liver, lung, and breast cancer, and has influenced the management of these
      malignancies in that a more radical treatment such as surgical resection has been employed.
      Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) studies with tracers such as
      choline or acetate are reliable tools to help with the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease
      after biochemical treatment failure in prostate cancer. An aggressive treatment combining
      androgen depriving therapy (ADT) and and high-dose irradiation to the oligometastatic
      lesions, as detected by PET-CT, may be proposed for these oligometastatic patients. Such a
      treatment strategy may hypothetically succeed to prolong the failure-free interval between
      two consecutive ADT courses, or even cure selected patients with limited metastatic burden.
      In this study the investigators plan to assess biochemical or clinical relapse-free survival
      at 2 years of prostate cancer with 1-5 oligometastases treated concomitantly with high-dose
      conformal Radiation Therapy and LH-RH agonists.

      1. Hormonotherapy

           Hormone therapy is recommended Eligard 45 mg acting for 6 months. It will be ideally
           administered the day of start of radiation therapy or within 3 months before the first
           day of radiotherapy.

           Nevertheless, free prescription is left to investigators. When using other hormonal
           strategies (anti-androgen agonists, LHRH antagonists or LHRH), an administration for six
           months will be critical.

        2. Radiotherapy

      Conformational Radiotherapy techniques in Intensity-Modulated (IMRT)

      2.1) Doses prescribed

        -  PTV1 PTV5 to 66 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.2 Gy

        -  PTV Pelvis: 54 Gy in 30 fractions of 1.8 Gy

        -  PTV Loge 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy 6 Gy A complement of 3 in two additional
           fractions Gy may be delivered across the lodge PTV.

        -  PTV Relapse Lodge: In addition to treating the PTV Lodge, additional radiation of 6 Gy
           in 3 fractions of 2 Gy may be made to bring the total dose of 72 Gy in 36 fractions of 2
           Gy.

      2.2) Treatment

      Radiation Guided by a picture (IGRT) will be performed daily. This daily recalibration will
      be based at least on bone structures. It will be possible to readjust the nodal structures.

          3. PS 0-1

          4. Previous radical treatment to the prostate (radiotherapy or surgery)

          5. PSA increase of at least 3 assays in the same laboratory over the last 12 months.

         11. Other concomitant cancer or history of cancer (within 5 years prior to study entry),
             except basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

         12. Patient with a psychological, familial, sociological or geographical potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule
