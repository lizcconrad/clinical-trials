  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop recommendations to assist in improving the current
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) program in a Hospital in Chinandega, Nicaragua. This project will
      consist of a needs assessment, a review of aggregate quantitative patient data from hospital
      records, and a knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) assessment for medical providers,
      laboratory technicians, patients and primary caregivers. The final report will be used to
      obtain funding for the implementation of the recommendations.

    <description>This outcome will be measured by administering a questionnaire to the participants of 4 respective groups (healthcare providers, laboratory staff, patients, primary caregivers). The questionnaire will contain sections on (1) demographic information/professional affiliation with the program, (2) knowledge of PD, (3) attitudes towards PD, (4) practices regarding PD, and (5) perceived needs of the program. The levels of knowledge will be classified in four categories: 1) very good, 2) good, 3) regular, 4) poor. Attitudes will be classified as either positive or negative. Practices will be classified as either good or bad.</description>
