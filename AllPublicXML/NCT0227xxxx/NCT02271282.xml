    <textblock>
      Repletion of testosterone (Te) in older men drives GH secretion after its aromatization to
      estradiol (E2), which acts via the estrogen receptor (ER). Conversely, we postulate that
      estrogen deprivation in postmenopausal women attenuates growth hormone (GH) secretion and
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) production, thus favoring development of metabolic
      syndrome in men treated with toremifene, a new estrogen antagonist used adjunctively in
      prostatic cancer

      Systemic concentrations of Te, E2, GH, IGF-I and insulin growth factor binding protein 3
      (IGFBP-3) decline in healthy aging men and women. Relative sex-steroid deprivation
      accentuates GH and IGF-I depletion, since Te stimulates GH and IGF-I production in older men,
      hypogonadal males of all ages, and patients undergoing (genotypic female-to-male) gender
      reassignment. The estrogen-receptor antagonist, tamoxifen, blocks this effect of Te,
      suggesting involvement of E2 in GH's stimulation at least in young men. E2 alone stimulates
      GH secretion in young and older women. Because Te is converted to E2 by aromatization in the
      body, we postulate that E2 is the active moiety in both men and women. Moreover, we
      hypothesize that the decline of E2 in older men and women contributes to the fall in GH
      output. These basic concepts will be tested here.

    <description>Subjects will be given toremifene/placebo on Day 1 to take for 10 days. For one night between Days 8-12, from date of randomization, subjects will undergo a 12-h overnight (2200-1000h) fasting, every 10-min blood sampling. The primary analytical outcome is the summed mass of growth hormone (ie. mean/min/max) secreted in pulses over the first 10h of overnight blood samples. Pulsatile growth hormone is relevant, since sex-steroid hormones and regulatory peptides uniquely control growth hormone secretory-burst mass</description>
