      A prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded study at a single institution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain medicine literature and the principal investigator's anecdotal experience in posterior
      cervical and lumbar instrumented spine surgery suggest that pre-incisional IV ibuprofen
      significantly reduces postoperative pain without increasing surgical complications or fusion
      rate, which leads to earlier ambulation, less dependence on narcotic medications, shorter
      hospital stays, and earlier return to work. The purpose of this study is to assess if these
      anecdotal findings hold true in a randomized clinical trial of patients with cervical or
      lumbar spondylosis, who are undergoing decompression and instrumented fusion of the spine.
