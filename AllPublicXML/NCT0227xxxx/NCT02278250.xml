    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending
      doses of single-agent M4344 administered twice-weekly (BIW), twice daily (BID) or once daily
      dose schedule in participants with advanced solid tumors. This investigation is a three part
      study examining M4344 alone and in combination with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and cisplatin
      to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part A and A2: Participants with one histologically or cytologically confirmed
             malignant advanced solid tumor, for which no standard therapy is available which may
             convey clinical benefit

          -  Part B: Participants with one histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant
             advanced solid tumor, for which no standard therapy is available which may convey
             clinical benefit and/or participants must have progressed after at least 1 prior
             chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting, and for which carboplatin (for Part
             B1), gemcitabine (for Part B2), or cisplatin (for Part B3) would be considered
             standard of care.

          -  Part C: Participants with advanced (locally advanced incurable or metastatic)
             histologically or cytologically confirmed high-grade serous ovarian cancer (high
             nuclear Grades 2 or 3). Participants should have either platinum-refractory (disease
             progression during initial platinum therapy) or platinum-resistant (disease
             progression &lt;6 months after completion of platinum therapy) disease.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1)

          -  WHO performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;=12 weeks

          -  Hematological and biochemical indices within acceptable ranges at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiotherapy, unless brief course for palliative therapy, endocrine therapy,
             target-specific therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy during the 4 weeks (6 weeks
             for nitrosoureas and Mitomycin-C, and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products)
             or 4 drug half-lives before first dose of study drug, whichever is greater

          -  Part B: More than 6 cycles of prior therapy with carboplatin

          -  Parts B1, B3, and C: During prior platinum therapy, requirement for dose reduction or
             discontinuation of carboplatin or cisplatin for toxicity or lack of tolerability

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the investigator should not
             exclude the participant

             a. Any known history of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with any prior chemotherapy regimen

          -  Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, treated, stable, and
             not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug

          -  Female participants who are already pregnant or lactating, or plan to become pregnant
             within 6 months of the last dose of study drug are excluded. Female participants of
             childbearing potential must adhere to contraception guidelines. Female participants
             will be considered to be of nonchildbearing potential if they have undergone surgical
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or have been amenorrheic for over 2 years with
             a screening serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's
             reference range for postmenopausal females.

          -  Male participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to adhere to
             contraception guidelines. Men with pregnant or lactating partners or partners who plan
             to become pregnant during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study drug
             are excluded.

          -  Major surgery =&lt;4 weeks before first dose of study drug or incomplete recovery from a
             prior major surgical procedure

          -  Serious co-morbid medical conditions, including clinically-significant cardiac disease
