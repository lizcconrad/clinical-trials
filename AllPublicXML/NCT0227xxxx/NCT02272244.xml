  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test a standard mailed intervention (SI) versus a novel decision
      support and navigation intervention (DSNI). Working with patients and stakeholders, this
      randomized trial will include 400 Hispanic men and women who are 50 to 75 years of age,
      patients in community based primary care practices, and are eligible for CRC screening. We
      will consent, survey, and randomize participants either to the SI Group (n=200) or the DSNI
      Group (n=200). Study specific aims are to: (1) Assess intervention (DSNI versus SI) impact on
      overall CRC screening adherence; (2)Assess intervention (DNSI versus SI) impact on CRC
      screening decision stage; (3) Assess intervention (DNSI versus SI) impact on test-specific
      CRC screening adherence; and (4) Assess intervention (DNSI versus SI) impact on CRC and
      knowledge and perceptions.

    <description>The two study groups will be compared in terms of the fraction of participants who undergo CRC screening (through SBT, colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, etc.) within 12 months of the randomization date. Screening will be measured using data from the 6-month survey and the 12-month chart audit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Screening Decision Stage</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>CRC screening decision stage will be assessed in both the baseline and 6-month surveys. Forward change (between baseline and endpoint) will encompass any movement from a lower to a higher decision stage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test Specific Screening Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Test adherence (SBT or endoscopy) will be assessed using 6-month survey and 12-month medical records data. The two study groups will be compared in terms of the fraction of participants who have a screening test within 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Screening Knowledge and Perceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge and perceptions (PHM scales) about CRC and screening will be assessed in both baseline and 6-month surveys.</description>

    <description>SI Group participants will be mailed a set of standard materials. The materials will include a letter from the participant's primary care practice encouraging selection and performance of either (1) colonoscopy screening, or (2) stool blood test (SBT) screening. Accompanying the letter will be instructions for arranging a colonoscopy appointment and instructions for completing an enclosed immunochemical SBT kit. Print materials and contacts will be provided, in both English and Spanish, after the baseline survey. At 45 days following random assignment that encourages screening.</description>

    <description>DSNI Group will be mailed print materials, including a letter from the practice on CRC screening, an informational booklet, and instructions for arranging a colonoscopy appointment and for completing an enclosed immunochemical SBT kit. All materials will be provided in both English and Spanish. Within 7 days after this mailing, participants will receive a telephone call from a trained bilingual study navigator. Following the call, the navigator will enter the participant's screening plan into the participant's electronic medical record, send the participant a letter describing the screening plan, and send the participant's primary care provider a copy of that same letter. At 45 days following random assignment, research staff will send participants a reminder letter encouraging the participant's preferred test. At 6 months after randomization, the navigator will send the provider and their office manager a participant CRC screening status report.</description>
