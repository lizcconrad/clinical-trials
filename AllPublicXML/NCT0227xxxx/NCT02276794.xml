      This study aims to verify the effects of Thrust Versus Non-thrust Manipulation on Pain, Trunk
      Proprioception and Postural Stability in Subjects With Chronic Low Back Pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty individuals with chronic low back pain will be randomly assigned, by a researcher not
      involved in data collection, to two treatment groups: Thrust manipulation (side-lying
      rotational manipulation standardized to the L4-L5 level) or non-thrust manipulation
      (side-lying grade III rotational non-thrust manipulation). A single treatment session will be
      provided.

      Outcome measurement will be conducted immediately after the treatment session. Data will be
      collected by a blinded assessor. Between-group differences will be calculated by constructing
      mixed linear models following an intention-to-treat principle.

    <description>The patients allocated to the TM group will receive TM aimed at the L4-L5 intervertebral segments. All the patients will be positioned in a standardized position (right side-lying) and will receive a rotational TM technique. The treating therapist will have up to two attempts to perform the TM in each patient.
There is no need for cavitation in order to consider the TM successful; the occurence of cavitation, however, will be recorded.
A single treatment will be provided.</description>
