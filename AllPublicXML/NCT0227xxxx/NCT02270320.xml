  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Promotion of cognitive functions of middle aged and older adults and prevention
      of dementia are important issues in the aging society. In recent years, studies have shown
      that Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise can improve cognitive functions in healthy middle-aged and
      older adults, but not studies have investigated the neural mechanisms. Therefore, the
      purposes of this research project are: (1) to investigate the effects of TCC exercise
      intervention on improving cognitive functions and motor functions in healthy middle-aged and
      older adults; (2) to investigate the effects of TCC intervention on improving the integrity
      of frontostriatal fiber tracts, and areas and intensity of brain activation while performing
      a switching task in healthy middle-aged and older adults.

      Methods: This project used the assessor-blind and randomized control clinical trial design. A
      total of 60 healthy middle-aged and older adults will be recruited, randomly allocated to two
      groups: experimental and control groups. Experimental group will receive a 60-minute exercise
      program, three times per week for 12 weeks. Control group will receive a telephone
      consultation once every two weeks for 12 weeks. All participants will receive clinical
      neuropsychological tests, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery tests, motor
      function tests, diffusion spectrum MR imaging, and functional MRI experiments before
      intervention, and at the end of intervention to realize the changes of cognitive function,
      motor function, integrity of neural tracts, and intensity and regions of functional
      activation while doing switching task of executive function in order to understand the
      cognitive effects and the neural mechanisms of TCC.

    <description>Brain MR images were obtained with a 3T Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) whole-body MRI scanner. A Siemens 32-channel head array coil was used as a receiver. Functional MRI (fMRI) was acquired using a BOLD-weighted gradient-echo echoplanar image sequence (EPI) ( TR/TE=2000/24 ms, field of view= 192 mm, voxel dimensions 3 x 3 x 4 mm, matrix= 64 x 64, slice thickness= 4 mm, flip angle 90Â°), and 34 slices will be obtained with anterior-posterior phase encoding direction and covering the whole brain. The fMRI paradigm was the event-related designed switching task by E-prime 2.0. The fMRI imaging data processing and analysis were accomplished using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience). Statistical parametric maps of the t statistic, SPM{t}, were obtained with the threshold of p&lt; 0.001 uncorrected. The brain functional activation results will be presented by the p value and the magnitude of Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) intensity.</description>

    <measure>Brain structural integrity</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be assessed at baseline and up to 12 weeks exercise or control intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Structural MRI was measured by T1, T2, and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). DSI will be performed to reconstruct tractography of the neural tracts. The DSI data was acquired by using a pulsed-gradient spin-echo diffusion EPI. The maximum diffusion sensitivity b value=4000 s/mm2, TR/TE=9600/130 ms, FOV=200 mm, and thickness=2.5 mm. Approximately 56 transaxial slices will be acquired encompassing the whole brain. The general fractional anisotropy (GFA) values, a quantitative index derived from the orientation distribution function to indicate diffusion anisotropy, were calculated at each voxel, The reconstruction of the tracts tractography was performed by using DSI Studio software. The integrity of these neural tracts will be presented by GFA value.</description>
