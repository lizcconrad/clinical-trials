    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, randomized, 5 period, crossover, single-center trial. The
      purpose of this trial is to assess the relative bio-availability of L-praziquantel (L-PZQ
      [MSC2499550A]) oral dispersible tablet (ODT) formulation (150 milligram [mg]) versus the
      current marketed racemate praziquantel (PZQ) (CysticideÂ® 500 mg) formulation in healthy male
      volunteers under fed conditions.

    <description>The CL/f of L-PZQ was a measure of the rate at which it was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. The CL/F of L-PZQ from plasma was calculated using the formula: Dose divided by area under the concentration time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf).</description>

    <description>The Vz/f was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of L-PZQ required to uniformly distribute to produce the desired plasma concentration of L-PZQ. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) was influenced by the fraction absorbed. The Vz/f was calculated by dividing the dose with area under the concentration time curve from time zero to infinity multiplied with terminal elimination rate constant (lambda z) (Vz/f=Dose/( AUC0-inf* lambda z).</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were adverse events that occurred between the first dose of study drug and up to 3-10 days after the last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.

          <description>The CL/f of L-PZQ was a measure of the rate at which it was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. The CL/F of L-PZQ from plasma was calculated using the formula: Dose divided by area under the concentration time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf).</description>

Following parameters were analyzed for laboratory examination: hematology (haemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean cell hemoglobin [MCH], MCH concentration, mean cell volume, white cell count, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, Basophils); serum chemistry (sodium, potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphate, creatinine, total protein, albumin, urea, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT] gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, triglycerides cholesterol); urinalysis (protein, glucose, ketones, pH, blood, leukocytes, nitrite); The 12-lead ECGs were recorded after the subjects had rested for at least 5 minutes in supine position.</description>
