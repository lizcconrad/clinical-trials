  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a patient-navigated,
      anti-inflammatory, culinary-based intervention (reinforced by motivational interviewing [MI]
      and tailored newsletters) on obese (body mass index [BMI] 30+), early-stage (0-IIIA) breast
      cancer survivors compared to a control group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit English-speaking, early-stage breast cancer survivors (N=200)
      to a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving a 2 (group) by 3 (time) repeated
      measures design. The intervention will stimulate dietary behavior changes using
      individualized anti-inflammatory dietary prescriptions with six monthly workshops (culinary
      demonstrations, recipes and meal planning) and behavior change cures reinforced through
      evidence- and theory-based patient navigation, motivational interviewing, and tailored
      newsletters personalized to individual readiness for change. Control participants will
      receive minimal nutritional information at baseline, monthly American Cancer Society
      survivorship brochures, and two telephone calls prior to assessment appointments. Groups will
      be compared at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up. Dependent measures will include
      dietary behavior and levels of cancer-associated biomarkers.

    <measure>Achieve USDA-recommended dietary intake based on five major food groups</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The USDA has published dietary intake guidelines for 5 major food groups. We will create a composite score (&quot;yes&quot; vs. &quot;no&quot;) describing whether ss achieve designated levels of dietary intake for all five food groups. We will compare proportions of study and control women achieving this target at 12-month follow-up controlling for baseline values.</description>

    <measure>Intervention versus Control group comparison of circulating Adipose Stromal Cells (ASCs) at follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare participant (intervention) versus control levels of circulating Adipose Stromal Cells (ASCs) at 12-month follow-up. Participant levels of ASCs will be significantly lower than controls, controlling for baseline values.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Interleukin (IL) pro-inflammatory biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare participant versus control levels of Interleukins IL3, IL6, IL8 at 12-month follow-up. Participant levels of IL3, IL6, and IL8 will be significantly lower than controls, controlling for baseline values.</description>
