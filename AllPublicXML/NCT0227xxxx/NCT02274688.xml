  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nation's trauma care system, which includes trauma center hospitals &amp; emergency
      departments, is where over 30 million Americans receive care after traumatic injuries each
      year. Injury victims are diverse patients who suffer from complications of the initial injury
      as well as from multiple complex medical &amp; mental health conditions. Currently, high-quality
      patient-centered care is not the standard of care throughout US trauma care systems. Injured
      trauma survivors treated in trauma care systems frequently receive fragmented care that is
      not coordinated across hospital, emergency department, outpatient, &amp; community settings.
      Post-injury care is frequently not individualized to integrate the patient's most pressing
      post-traumatic concerns &amp; preferences into medical decision making. The investigators, as a
      group of front-line trauma center providers, patients, researchers &amp; policy makers, have been
      working together for over a decade to integrate patient-centered care into US trauma care
      systems. The investigators began this work by asking groups of injured patients the key
      patient-centered question: &quot;Of everything that has happened to you since your injury, what
      concerns you the most?&quot; The investigators developed scientifically sound assessment tools
      that allowed us to follow patient concerns after injury hospitalization. In May of 2011, the
      investigators convened an American College of Surgeons' policy summit that addressed mental
      health &amp; patient-centered care integration across US trauma care systems. As part of this
      policy summit, patient members of our team presented their experiences of traumatic injury &amp;
      recovery. While giving injured patients a &quot;voice&quot; at the summit, these narratives did not
      move surgical policy makers to develop mandates or guidelines for patient-centered care. In
      contrast, presentations that included information from randomized comparative effectiveness
      trials &amp; standardized outcome assessments convinced surgical policy makers to develop US
      trauma care system policy mandates &amp; best practice guidelines for post-traumatic stress
      disorder &amp; alcohol use problems. Our team now realizes that in order to optimally integrate
      patient-centered care into US trauma care systems, the investigators must use the best
      scientific methods that capture the highest-quality data. This PCORI proposal aims to
      demonstrate that a patient-centered care management treatment that addresses patient's
      post-injury concerns &amp; integrates patient concerns &amp; preferences into medical decision
      making, while also coordinating care, can improve outcomes of great importance to patients &amp;
      their caregivers, front-line providers &amp; policy makers. This proposal directly addresses two
      PCORI patient-centered research questions: &quot;After a traumatic injury, what can I do to
      improve the outcomes that are most important to me?&quot; &amp; &quot;How can front-line providers working
      in trauma care systems help me make the best decisions about my post-injury health &amp; health
      care?&quot;

    <measure>Change in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms Over the Course of the Six Months After Injury</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators assessed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators used the PTSD Checklist - Civilian (PCL-C) as a continuous measure. The scoring of the scale ranges from a minumum of 17 to a maximum of 85, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. No subscales were used.</description>
