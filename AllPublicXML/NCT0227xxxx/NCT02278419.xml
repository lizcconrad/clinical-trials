  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of simeprevir in combination with
      sofosbuvir for 8 or 12 weeks versus a historical control, with respect to the percentage of
      participants with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12) in
      the overall population.

      This is a partly randomized, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer
      and study staff), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) study. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks,
      an open-label treatment period of 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up period
      until 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Participants without cirrhosis will be assigned
      to Group A wherein half of the participants will receive 8 week treatment in Group A1 and
      remaining participants will receive 12 week treatment in Group A2. Participants with
      cirrhosis, will be assigned to Group B to receive simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir
      for 12 weeks. The duration of participation for each participant, including the screening
      period, will be approximately 36 or 40 weeks for 8 or 12 week treatment, respectively.
      Efficacy will be primarily assessed by percentage of participants with SVR12. Participants'
      safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

             gonadotropin at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first

          -  Females of childbearing potential or males with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must agree to use 2 highly effective contraceptive methods (one of which is

             not be heterosexually active, or be a vasectomized male subject or a female subject

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has evidence of clinical hepatic decompensation (history or current

             significant findings during screening of medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory testing or electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would compromise the participant's safety or could interfere with the
             participant participating in and completing the study
