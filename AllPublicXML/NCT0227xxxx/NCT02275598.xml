  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of two three-weekly 1.8 mg/kg Brentuximab
      vedotin administrations in untreated patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter pilot phase II trial assessing 2 administrations of Brentuximab vedotin
      followed by PET scan and subsequent standard treatment with ABVD ± Radiotherapy. 12 patients
      defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in one year. All subjects will
      be followed for disease evaluation every 3 months for one year after end of therapy until
      disease progression, death, initiation of alternative therapy, withdrawal of consent, or end
      of study. For all study procedures patient will be assigned a Unique Subject Identifier (SID)
      number that will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout
      study participation. A master log will be maintained of all consented subjects and will
      document all screening failures (i.e. subjects who are consented but do not meet study
      eligibility criteria). Study records such as case report forms (CRFs) may be maintained
      electronically and require the same security and confidentiality as paper. Clinical
      information will not be released without written permission of the subject/legal
      representative, except as specified in the informed consent form
