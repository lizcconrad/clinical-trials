      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mycobactericidal activity, safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of 6 doses of linezolid: 300 mg once per day, 300 mg twice per day, 600
      mg once per day, 600 mg twice per day and 1200 mg once per day administered orally for 14
      consecutive days or 1200 mg administered three times per week for two weeks in adult subjects
      with newly diagnosed drug‐sensitive, smear‐positive pulmonary tuberculosis.

        Any laboratory value which excludes the Subject may be repeated to confirm eligibility.

        All inclusion and no exclusion criteria must be met. If no single variable/value is outside
        of the ranges of acceptability, but when multiple values are close to the limits and/or
        whenever the Investigator has reason to suspect that there might be a health problem (other
        than TB), enrollment should only be considered after discussing the case with the sponsor
        medical monitor.
