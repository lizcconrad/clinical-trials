  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis and Periodontitis are multifactorial diseases which share common risk
      factors.The aim of the present study is to ellucidate polymorphisms in Calcitonin receptor
      gene? in patients with Osteoporosis and Periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease which includes various modifiable and
      nonmodifiable risk factors. The non modifiable risk factors include genetic polymorphisms
      like metabolism associated genetic polymorphisms ( Vitamin D and Calcitonin).

      Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and
      micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue with consequent increase in bone fragility
      and susceptibility to fractures.

      Bone loss is a common feature shared between periodontal disease and osteoporosis.

      Out of all genetic factors Calcitonin gene polymorphism contributes to the development of
      both osteoporosis and chronic periodontitis.

      2ml of blood sample from each subject was collected in EDTA containing vials and kept at -20
      degrees until DNA extraction. The genomic DNA was isolated and C/T polymorphism in CTR gene
      was identified by PCR followed by restriction digestion pattern by Alu 1 restriction enzyme.
