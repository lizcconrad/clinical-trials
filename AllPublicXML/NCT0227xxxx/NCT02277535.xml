      This is a quality improvement research project evaluating if a targeted feedback email to
      clinicians impacts their nutrition delivery in the ICU.

      This prospective study looks to determine if a targeted email to clinicians taking care of
      critically ill patients will allow reduce malnutrition in the Intensive Care Units (ICU).
      Four ICUs will be included: medical ICU (MICU), coronary care unit (CCU) and two surgical
      ICUs. The investigators will rotate a 2 month period intervention amongst the aforementioned
      participating ICUs and follow simultaneous cohorts to evaluate the effect of our intervention
      (email feedback to treating clinicians) on nutrition delivery in the ICU. After the
      completion of the intervention, there will be a six-month follow-up of nutritional adequacy
      to assess the durability of changes in behavior.

    <description>The ICU admission date and EN initiation date will be collected in a data base which will later be analyzed to assess the percentange of patients initiated on EN within 72 hours of admission to the ICU. This will be reported as rates and will be compared amongst intervention and no-intervention arms using Fisher's Exact test or Chi-sq Test</description>
