      Background: Curcumin in an active phytochemical substance, used as part of the human diet,
      that has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties which were demonstrated in multiple
      experimental models of colitis including a positive effect on maintenance of remission in
      adult ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Objectives: To examine the effect of curcumin as
      complementary medication in induction and maintenance therapy in pediatric patients with mild
      to moderate ulcerative colitis. Design: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
      Setting: Pediatric gastroenterology centers. Participants: Children 6 year to 18 years who
      are diagnosed with mild to moderate UC and are planned to receive either 5-ASA or
      corticosteroids induction treatment. Main outcome measures: Disease activity defined by the
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) at 2 weeks and 6 months. Secondary
      outcome measures: Effect of curcumin treatment on serum inflammatory markers, calprotectin
      and fecal microbiota. Data analysis: Data will be collected and analyzed using SPSS (version
      21.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Fisher's exact test will be used to explore univariate
      associations between primary outcomes and categorical variables. Associations of continues
      variables with primary outcome measures will be examined using ANOVA with repeated measures.
      P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

    <textblock>
      Clinical efficacy of induction and maintenance medications in pediatric UC is limited with a
      cumulative long-term risk of 20%-30% for colectomy. Remission rates following induction with
      corticosteroids and 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) range from 20% to 50%. 5-ASA is still
      regarded as first line induction and maintenance therapy for mild to moderate UC in both
      children and adults. 5-ASA is also indicated for maintenance therapy following successful
      induction with corticosteroids for moderate to severe disease. Still, steroid free clinical
      remission at 1 year under 5-ASA maintenance therapy is reported to range from 40% to 50%.
      Management of recurrent flares while taking 5-ASA medications involves repeated courses of
      corticosteroids and changing therapeutic regimes to include more potent medications such as
      thiopurines which carry an increased risk for significant adverse effects. Hence, improving
      efficacy of induction and maintenance treatment is of critical importance. Curcumin, an
      active phytochemical substance with anti-inflammatory properties was studied extensively
      in-vitro and in experimental models of colitis. In the only randomized controlled trial,
      performed in adults with quiescent disease, curcumin was shown to be an effective concomitant
      treatment (along with 5-ASA) for maintenance of remission. Therefore, our aim is to assess
      the efficacy of concomitant curcumin maintenance therapy for induction and maintenance
      therapy in pediatric UC patients with mild to moderate in a prospective randomized, placebo
      controlled trial. We hope that this study will further contribute to the understanding of the
      potential benefits of curcumin in pediatric UC patients.

    <description>Eligible patients will be randomized to either intervention of placebo groups. Randomization will be performed separately for patients receiving corticosteroids for induction in-order to ensure similar heterogeneity within groups. Induction: oral prednisone 1mg/kg up to 40 mg once daily for 2 weeks and then tapered down by 5 mg per week or 5-ASA 75 mg/kg/day divided to two doses. Maintenance: 5-ASA 75 mg/kg/day divided to two doses.
Patients receiving corticosteroids for induction, whose PUCAI is &gt;35 points at 2 weeks will be regarded as treatment failure. Patients receiving 5-ASA for induction with &quot;induction treatment failure&quot; will be re-randomized to receive oral corticosteroids induction with or without curcumin.</description>
