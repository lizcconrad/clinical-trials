  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DVC1-0101 is a gene therapy medicine to treat peripheral arterial disease (PAD) based on
      recombinant F-gene-deleted, non-transmissible Sendai virus (rSeV/dF) expressing human
      fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) gene. The previous Phase I/IIa study demonstrated no
      serious adverse event related to the administration, and suggested possible improvement of
      local blood flow and walking performance of PAD patients.

      The primary objective of the current Phase IIb study is to investigate the clinical efficacy
      of DVC1-0101 (1x10^9 ciu/leg, 5x10^9 ciu/leg) in patients with IC. We also aim to examine the
      dose-response relationship using the rate of improvement in walking function as an indicator.
