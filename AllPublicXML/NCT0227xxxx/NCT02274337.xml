      AC0010 Maleate Capsules is a new, irreversible, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
      mutation selective Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.Aim at local advanced or metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation or T790M drug-resistant mutation. The molecular
      mechanism: by irreversible combining the EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site of cell, selectively
      suppress the activities of EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, block the sigal signal
      transduction system of EGFR, and close the function of ras/raf/MAPK downstream. at last block
      the tumor cell growth by EGFR induction, and promotes apoptosis. AC0010 Maleate Capsules has
      three characters: 1. Irreversible combination with EGFR; 2.Efficient suppress the EGFR mutant
      tumor cell and has no suppression to EGFR wild-type cell; 3. Efficient suppress the EGFR
      T790M drug-resistant mutation tumor cell.

      This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have already received at least one
      course of specific anti-cancer treatment but the tumor has started to re-grow following that
      treatment. This is the first time that this drug is used or tested in patients, and so it
      will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment, it will
      measure the levels of drug in the body, it will also measure the anti-cancer activity. By
      using these pieces of information together the best dose of this drug to use in further
      clinical trials will be selected.

      This study is a multicenter, open-label, two-stage phase I clinical trial. Trial including
      single-dose and successive-dose tolerance research, single-dose and successive-dose
      pharmacokinetic research, food bioavailability study, exploration of different dosing methods
      and tentative evaluation for clinical efficacy. Stage one is a dose escalation study, using
      the modified Fibonacci methods. 7 dose level are set, respectively are 50mg/d 100mg/d 200mg/d
      350mg/d 550mg/d 850mg/d and 1100mg/d. Three patients are enrolled in each dose level, the
      observed indicator is dose-limited toxicity. No DLT occurred of all 3 patients, the dose
      escalate to next level. 1/3 DLT observed, 3 more patients are enrolled in the level, if no
      DLT is observed, the dose escalated to next level, if DLT occurs again, escalation stops. 2/3
      DLT are observed, escalation stops. A recommend phase II dose level will acquire by this
      method. Stage two is a multicenter, open label, one arm successive dose clinical trial, based
      on the dosing level and method acquired in stage one, for further safety evaluation and
      tentative evaluation of clinical efficacy.
