  <brief_title>Study to Compare the Effect of a Combination of Dipyridamole With Sustained Release and Acetyl Salicylic Acid (Aggrenox®) on the Performance Relevant to Safety and on the General Condition of Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
  <official_title>Placebo-controlled, Randomized, Double-blind Study Comparing the Effect of a Combination of 200 mg Dipyridamole With Sustained Release and 25 mg Acetyl Salicylic Acid (Aggrenox®) on the Performance Relevant to Safety and on the General Condition of Volunteers and 10 Days of Treatment Alone and in Combination With Alcohol (Study no. 591002)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to investigate whether psychomotor performance which is necessary for safety driving a
      car or operating machinery and safely participating in daily life is changed by Aggrenox®.
      Also to investigate whether Aggrenox® impairs performance in combination with alcohol more
      than alcohol alone. Derived from this: Statement on whether a warning for drivers is
      necessary
