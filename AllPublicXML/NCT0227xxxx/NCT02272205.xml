  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection is a serious complications after undergoing total hip replacement. It occurs in
      about 1% of cases. The optimal treatment of these infections is discussed. The team validated
      by international publications change strategy of the infected prosthesis at a time.

      Antibiotic prophylaxis has significantly reduced the infection intraoperative contamination
      in orthopedic surgery rates. It must be conventionally administered before the surgical
      incision. In response to infection, it is typically recommended to start this antibiotic
      after the completion of the deep bacteriological samples, so as not to negate the risk of
      these samples by the prior administration of antibiotics. This attitude, however, is not
      formally validated by the scientific literature. In contrast, two recent publications
      challenge this practice, and suggest the use of a conventional antibiotic prophylaxis even in
      septic interventions. Our multidisciplinary team opted for a few months for this new
      strategy. We wish to evaluate the influence of this new approach results in the treatment of
      infection in total hip or knee.
