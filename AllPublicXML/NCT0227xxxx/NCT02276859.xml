    <textblock>
      Patients receive a standardized high-protein test meal at breakfast time. Insulin is given as
      bolus (normal or dual-wave (normal plus square) and basal rate using an insulin pump. The 3h
      post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by self-blood glucose measurements (SMBG)
      (every 1 hour) and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The intervention is taking
      part under in-patient clinical conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dual-wave bolus delivers an immediate normal pre-meal insulin bolus followed by
      square-wave bolus that is evenly delivered over several hours as programmed by the patient.
      The aim of this study is to compare post-prandial glycaemic excursions following a
      high-protein meal after administration of insulin by normal vs dual-wave bolus. During this
      prospective, cross-over, repeated measures study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes,
      treated with insulin pump therapy will be evaluated using the self-blood glucose measurements
      following standardized high-protein meal and two types of boluses (normal or dual-wave). The
      required insulin dose will be calculated based on patient's insulin-exchange ratio. A
      high-protein meal will be given on two subsequent breakfasts and comparisons will be made
      between normal and dual-wave insulin bolus delivery. Prolonged post-prandial glycaemic
      excursions will be identified using the CGMS.

    <description>On the first study day, pre-breakfast insulin was given as a normal bolus 15 minutes before a standardized high-protein meal. On the second day, pre-breakfast insulin was given as a dual-wave bolus before the same high-protein meal.
The carbo-insulin and fat-protein-insulin ratio on both study days were identical to the patient's ratio when entering trial.
Kind of study bolus insulin will be a rapid-acting insulin analog same as previously used by the participant (before entering the trial) - insulin aspart, insulin lispro or insulin glulisine</description>
