      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of biomarkers,
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3), and
      des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), for surveillance program patients whose hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) development may be potentially missed by ultrasound (US). This study expects
      to demonstrate that addition of biomarkers will increase the detection rate by at least 10%.

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing surveillance for
      hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasound alone versus ultrasound and standard biomarkers. The
      study will be conducted initially at UHN (TGH and TWH). One arm will undergo surveillance for
      hepatocellular carcinoma using ultrasound (US) alone and the other will undergo HCC
      surveillance with US plus biomarkers (BM). The biomarkers to be used will be AFP, AFP-L3 and
      DCP). Subjects will undergo surveillance at 6 monthly intervals for a minimum of 2 years and
      up to 4 years. The endpoints will be the comparative effectiveness, defined as sensitivity
      and specificity of detection of HCC. The comparisons of sensitivity, specificity, and other
      parameters with respect to tumor characteristics will be made among US alone, biomarkers
      alone, and combined use of US and biomarkers. The target population is individuals who have
      liver cirrhosis and no HCC detectable at enrollment into the study. The factors contributing
      to the cause of the cirrhosis will be recorded but will not play a role into subject
      eligibility for the study

                  evaluation with cirrhosis confirmed by one of the following: (see below for
                  definition of cirrhosis). Etiology of cirrhosis will not be considered in
                  determining inclusion in the study.
