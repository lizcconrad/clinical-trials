  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI
      6727 therapy in terms of drug-related adverse events. Secondary objectives are the collection
      of overall safety and antitumour efficacy data and the determination of the pharmacokinetic
      profile of BI 6727.
