    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open, three-armed, multi-centre study designed to compare
      the effects of dual-release hydrocortisone preparations versus conventional glucocorticoid
      therapy on anthropometric parameters, metabolic syndrome, infectious, immunological profile,
      cardiovascular system, bone mass and quality of life in patients affected by primary or
      secondary adrenal insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypocortisolism is a disease with more than 80% 1-year mortality before the availability of
      synthetic glucocorticoids. Current replacement therapy has improved this dramatically, but
      recent data suggest that outcome is still compromised. Patient receiving conventional
      glucocorticoids therapy have compromised quality of life, reduced bone mass, increased risk
      factors for cardiovascular disease, infectious, tumors and premature mortality that is more
      than twice the mortality rate in the background population. Circulating cortisol levels
      follow a distinct diurnal pattern with high levels in the early morning and low trough values
      around midnight. Using available formulations for replacement therapy this circadian rhythm
      is had to mimic and also during the active time of the day high peaks and low troughs occur.

      In this trial a dual-release hydrocortisone preparations that has in healthy volunteers been
      able to mimic the circadian pattern of circulating cortisol was studied in patients with
      primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.
