  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic education of patients is a mandatory component of intensive insulin therapy of
      type 1 diabetes in order to reach optimal safety and efficacy. Used educational methods aim
      at facilitating patients' autonomy in their own management of diabetes. Therefore,
      self-management of patient with type 1 diabetes must be systematically assessed in order to
      evaluate the effectiveness of education programs .The main objective of this prospective
      controlled randomized monocentric study is to assess the impact of functional insulin therapy
      on the level of self-management of patients with type 1 diabetes via Confidence In Diabetes
      Self-care scale (CIDS) test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      170 patients with type 1 diabetes, volunteering for education to functional insulin therapy,
      will be recruited by the Department od Endocrinology, Diabetes, Nutrition of Montpellier
      University Hospital.

      After inclusion, the patients will be randomized in 2 groups: group 1 will be immediately
      trained to functional insulin therapy and group 2 will be trained at the end of the study.
      The patients will be met as outpatients 3 months after inclusion. The primary endpoint will
      be the global score for CIDS questionnaire.

      Secondary endpoints will include: HbA1c level at month 3, frequency of hypoglycemia from
      inclusion to month 3, scores for each of the 20 items of CIDS questionnaire.

      An ancillary study will assess: the acceptability of the new EAD questionnaire which
      specifically evaluates the self-management of diabetes, the concordance validity of EAD and
      CDIS questionnaires, the reproducibility test-retest, the internal consistency and the
      sensitivity to change of EAD questionnaire.
