  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile cancer is an uncommon disease, with devastating physical and psychological effects on
      patients. Penile carcinoma even in advanced stages is responsive to several chemotherapeutic
      agents. However, due to the low incidence of penile cancer, no large studies have been
      reported concerning chemotherapy.

      Various single agents were tested for activity en penile cancer in de 70s and 80s. Response
      rates ranged from 10 to 27% with cisplatin, 20 to 21% with bleomycin, and 0-62% with
      methotrexate. These agents in combination were tested in different studies. Other
      chemotherapy schemes have been studied, as combination of cisplatin with 5 fluorouracil with
      or without taxol, and cisplatin plus irinotecan. All of them in limited phase II studies,
      with described higher responses rates in some of them but without results confirmation in
      phase III studies.

      In conclusion, tested regimens so far have not been very successful in advanced stages of the
      disease.

      Antiangiogenic therapy has been demonstrated effective in the treatment of similar cancer
      types as lung and head and neck, so it can be postulated that antiangiogenic therapy can be
      effective in the treatment of penile carcinoma. Pazopanib is a new potent oral antiangiogenic
      therapy.

      Cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel, when administered at low doses and frequent intervals,
      may exert antiangiogenic effects, thereby enhancing anticancer activity. Recently,
      combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel administered in a metronomic schedule (80mg/m2 weekly
      3 weeks every 4 weeks cycle) obtained a 40% response rate and an 80% of disease control in
      the first-line treatment of melanoma patients. Treatment was well tolerated.

      As paclitaxel and antiangiogenic drugs seem a very active treatment, combination of pazopanib
      and paclitaxel seems a good combination to be tested in patients with penile carcinoma.
