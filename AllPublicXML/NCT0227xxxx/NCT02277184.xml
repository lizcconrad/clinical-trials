  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common cancer arising in the upper
      aerodigestive tract, and is the sixth leading incident cancer worldwide. Despite advances in
      multimodality therapy, 5-year overall survival (OS) is 40-60%, and has increased only
      incrementally in the past two decades. The current standard of care for primary nonsurgical
      management of locally advanced HNSCC is concurrent cisplatin-radiotheray, which significantly
      improved OS, progression-free survival, and locoregional control compared with radiotherapy
      alone in the landmark Intergroup trial 0126.

      The MET proto-oncogene encodes c-Met, a heterodimeric growth factor receptor bound
      exclusively by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In the laboratory, activation of
      the HGF/c-Met pathway is associated with resistance to cisplatin and radiotherapy in HNSCC.
      We hypothesize that the addition of an HGF/c-Met pathway inhibitor to cisplatin-radiotherapy
      may improve outcomes in HNSCC. Ficlatuzumab (AV-299) is a humanized HGF-inhibitory IgG1
      monoclonal antibody.

      The primary objective of this study is to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      the combination of ficlatuzumab, cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), in
      patients with locally advanced HNSCC. The dose-finding study design will follow a Narayana
      k-in-a-row design with k set to 3 to target a 33% DLT rate. In the dose-finding phase, a
      total of either 10 or 14 patients will be treated. If no DLTs are observed among 10 patients,
      the highest dose tier will be declared the RP2D. Otherwise the RP2D will be estimated from
      DLTs across all dose levels by isotonic regression. The secondary objective is to estimate
      biomarker association with preliminary clinical response. We will evaluate biomarkers of
      HGF/cMet pathway activation in tumor tissue, plasma, and immune cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase Ib trial where ficlatuzumab will be added to the standard of care for
      locally advanced HNSCC: cisplatin-IMRT. Biomarkers of HGF/cMet pathway activation that may
      associate with clinical response will be developed in an expansion cohort. Patients with high
      or intermediate risk, locally advanced HNSCC will be eligible.

      A diagnostic primary tumor block for biomarker correlatives is mandatory for inclusion to
      this study. A representative paraffin block of the original diagnosis and all repeat
      biopsies, if available, will be submitted.

      The starting dose of ficlatuzumab (dose tier 1) will be 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, beginning the
      week prior to cisplatin-IMRT (week -1). Ficlatuzumab will be administered as an IV infusion
      over 30-60 minutes, for a total of 4 doses.

      The starting dose of cisplatin (dose tier 1) will be 40 mg/m2 weekly, beginning concurrent
      with IMRT during week 1 of study treatment (and one week following the first dose of
      ficlatuzumab which is administered during week -1 of study treatment). Patients will receive
      cisplatin once weekly as an IV infusion over 60 minutes, for a total of 7 doses.

      Megavoltage energy photon beam irradiation is required. Any treatment planning and delivery
      system that has been credentialed for head and neck IMRT is acceptable. Immobilization should
      be performed with a thermoplastic mask to ensure daily reproducibility of setup. Treatment
      planning CT scans will be required to define tumor, clinical and planning target volumes.The
      treatment planning CT scan should be acquired with the patient in the same position and
      immobilization device as for treatment and performed with IV contrast so that major vessels
      of the neck are easily visualized.

      Four dose tiers will be considered for the phase I portion for ficlatuzumab and cisplatin.
      IMRT will remain consistent for all dose tiers. Under this schema, more than one patient can
      be enrolled at the same time. However de novo dose escalation cannot occur until 2 patients
      have completed study treatment without DLT. In the dose-finding phase, a total of 10 patients
      will be treated if no DLTs are observed or 14 patients if at least one DLT occurs. If no DLTs
      are observed among the first 10 patients the recommended for phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be set
      to dose tier 3. If a DLT is observed and 14 patients are treated and observed, the RP2D will
      be estimated from DLTs across all dose levels by isotonic regression. The observation period
      for identifying a DLT will be 10 weeks, or 2 weeks following completion of IMRT, whichever
      comes later. To be considered a DLT, the toxicity must be at least possibly related to
      ficlatuzumab. An expansion cohort will then proceed at RP2D until 12 patients have been
      treated at that dose level.

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one
      of the following criteria applies:

        -  Completion of treatment,

        -  Disease progression,

        -  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s),

        -  Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      After completing treatment, patients will be followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every
      6 months for 3 years, for a total of 5 years from completion of IMRT. Patients removed from
      study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of
      the adverse event.

               -  Cardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV.

               -  Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Study
                  Day 1.

               -  History of serious arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular
                  fibrillation).

               -  Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic medications.

          -  Significant thrombotic or embolic events within 3 months prior to Study Day 1.
             Significant thrombotic or embolic events include but are not limited to stroke or
             transient ischemic attack (TIA). Catheter-related thrombosis is not a cause for
             exclusion. Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is allowed if it
             occurred &gt; 3 months prior to Study Day 1 and the patient has completed or is on stable
             anti-coagulation therapy.

          -  Any other medical condition (eg, alcohol abuse) or psychiatric condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the subject's participation in the
             trial or interfere with the interpretation of trial results.

          -  History of second malignancy within 2 years prior to Study Day 1 (except for excised
             and cured non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of breast or cervix, superficial
             bladder cancer, or T1a or T1b prostate cancer comprising &lt; 5% of resected tissue with
             normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) since resection).

          -  Major surgery within 6 weeks prior to Study Day 1 (subjects must have completely
             recovered from any previous surgery prior to Study Day 1).

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotics or antifungals within 7 days prior to first
             dose of study drug.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible drug interactions with study drugs. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when
             indicated. Note: HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding because chemotherapy and/or ficlatuzumab
             may be harmful to the fetus or the nursing infant. Pregnant women are excluded from
             this study because chemotherapy and/or ficlatuzumab have the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects.
