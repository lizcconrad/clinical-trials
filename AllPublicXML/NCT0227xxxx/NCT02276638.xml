    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to collect clinical data to support an FDA
      510(k) submission for the Nidek CEM-530 Center point method and Corner point method. The
      secondary objective is to evaluate any adverse events found during the clinical study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-Pathologic: Male or female subjects from 18 to 80 years old who have full legal
             capacity to volunteer on the date the informed consent is signed. Subjects who can
             follow the instructions by the clinical staff at the clinical site,and can attend
             examinations on the scheduled examination date. Subjects who agree to participate in
             the study.

          -  Pathologic: Male and female subjects from 29 to 80 years old who have full legal
             capacity to volunteer on the date the informed consent is signed. Subjects who can
             follow the instructions by the clinical staff at the clinical site, and can attend
             examinations on the scheduled examination date. Subjects who agree to participate in
             the study. At least one eye with any of the following conditions:

               -  History of post-op surgical trauma including bullous keratopathy

               -  History of corneal transplant

               -  Physical injury or trauma to the cornea

               -  Long term Fuch's dystrophy, Guttata or other corneal endothelial dystrophies

               -  Keratoconus

               -  Long term PMMA contact lens use (greater than 3 years)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-Pathologic: Male and female subjects from 29 to 80 years old who have full legal
             capacity to volunteer on the date the informed consent is signed. Subjects who can
             follow the instructions by the clinical staff at the clinical site, and can attend
             examinations on the scheduled examination date. Subjects who agree to participate in
             the study. At least one eye with any of the following conditions:

               -  History of post-op surgical trauma including bullous keratopathy

               -  History of corneal transplant

               -  Physical injury or trauma to the cornea

               -  Long term PMMA contact lens use (greater than 3 years)

          -  Pathologic: History of cataract, refractive or ocular surgical procedures that render
             the cornea opaque or otherwise impact its ability to be imaged using the
             investigational device. Fixation problems which may prevent obtaining at least poor
             quality (refer to Figure 1) CEM-530 and KONAN CELLCHEK PLUS images in either eye.
