    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          2. The subject signs and dates a written, informed consent form prior to the initiation
             of any study procedures.

          3. The subject is a Japanese healthy adult male.

             kg/m2 at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has received any investigational compound within 16 weeks (112 days) prior
             to the start of study drug administration in Period 1.

          2. The subject has received SYR-322 or metformin hydrochloride in a previous clinical
             study or as a therapeutic agent.

          3. The subject is an immediate family member, study site employee, or is in a dependant
             relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study
             (eg, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress.

          4. The subject has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic, or endocrine disease
             or other abnormality, which may impact the ability of the subject to participate or

             administration on Day 1 in Period 1 laboratory values that suggest a clinically
             significant underlying disease or subject with the following lab abnormalities: ALT
             and/or AST &gt;1.5 the upper limits of normal.

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
