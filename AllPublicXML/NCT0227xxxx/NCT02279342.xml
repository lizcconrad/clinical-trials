  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of febuxostat on coronary plaque
      volume in patients with chronic stable angina and hyperuricemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stable angina and hyperuricemia who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) are enrolled. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups.

      Febuxostat group and A lifestyle modification group. At 8-12 months, routine follow up
      angiography and IVUS interrogation as well as endothelial function and several bio markers
      will be assessed.
