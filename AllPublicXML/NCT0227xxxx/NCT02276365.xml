  <official_title>Relative Bioavailability of Both BI 10773 50 mg and Pioglitazone 45 mg After Co-administration Compared to BI 10773 and Pioglitazone Alone in Healthy Male Volunteers (an Open-label, Randomised, Crossover, Clinical Phase I Study)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to investigate whether there is a drug-drug interaction
      between BI 10773 and pioglitazone when co-administered as multiple oral doses. Therefore, the
      relative bioavailabilities of BI 10773 and pioglitazone were determined when both drugs were
      given in combination compared with BI 10773 and pioglitazone given alone.
