  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop an effective, brief, family-based intervention targeting quality
      of life and school functioning for youth with sickle cell disease. Utilizing a randomized,
      delayed control group intervention methodology, the present study will systematically
      document the effectiveness of a family-based, one-day intervention plus booster phone calls
      to improve quality of life and increase school functioning for children with sickle cell
      disease transitioning to school and their families.

      Families Taking Control-School-age Intervention (FTC) will provide education and problem
      solving training for disease management and school functioning. In 4 sessions offered over
      the course of one day, families (patient, caregivers, and school-age siblings) will work
      together and individually to learn and apply the problem solving skills training model to
      relevant examples and family-specific problems, culminating in an outline of family goals to
      target after the intervention. The three booster phone calls will provide support to families
      in implementing the problem-solving model by addressing and refining goals and
      trouble-shooting barriers to implementation. Children and caregivers completed measures at
      baseline (prior to intervention participation) and 6 months later.

    <description>Families in the FTC group rated acceptability of participating in the intervention workshop. This measure was completed at the workshop (between baseline and 6 month assessments). This measure utilized a 5-point Likert-type scale (with the possible range of scores as 1-5), with higher scores indicating more positive feedback. Individual item scores are presented here. Participant results indicated a range of scores from from 2-5.</description>
