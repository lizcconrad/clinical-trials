      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter, parallel group, outpatient study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD using 2 doses of dasotraline (4
      mg/day or 6 mg/day) versus placebo over an 8 week treatment period (8 weeks of active
      treatment followed by a 2-week withdrawal phase).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female, 18 to 55 years old, inclusive, at the time of informed
             consent.

          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM 5) criteria
             for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive, or combined subtype)
             established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviews psychiatric
             criteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS). Note:
             The diagnosis of ADHD and appropriateness of inclusion in the trial will be
             independently confirmed by external expert review. Experts will review diagnostic and
             other screening instruments for each subject and approval is required before a subject
             can be randomized. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be
             administered to confirm the absence of any other comorbid psychiatric disorders.

          -  Subject has an ADHD RS IV with adult prompts total score of ≥ 26 at screening and at
             Baseline.

             baseline.

          -  Subject is male or a non pregnant, non lactating female.

             the pregnancy test.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of
             birth control, as defined in Section 10.4, throughout the study period. Note:
             Continued use of an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control is
             recommended for 30 days after study completion.

             baseline.

          -  Subject has a psychiatric disorder other than ADHD that has been the primary focus of
             treatment at any time during the 12 months before screening.

          -  Subject has a past history of, or current presentation consistent with, bipolar
             disorder (including bipolar I and bipolar II), schizophrenia, schizoaffective
             disorder, or any other psychotic disorder; a personality disorder per DSM 5 criteria.

             unexplained syncope or other unexplained blackouts (except single incident), or head
             trauma with loss of consciousness lasting more than 5 minutes, or a history of
             clinically significant multiple head traumas without loss of consciousness.

          -  Subject has an acute or chronic medical condition (other than ADHD) that in the
             opinion of the investigator could confound clinical assessments or interfere with the
             ability of the subject to participate in the study.

          -  Subject is currently taking or has taken within 6 weeks prior to screening an
             antidepressent medication; antipsychotic medication; or lithium (any lithium

             specific plan and intent) on the C SSRS assessment at screening (in the past month).
             Subjects who answer &quot;yes&quot; to this question must be referred to the Investigator for
             follow up evaluation.

          -  Subject has attempted suicide within 2 years before the screening period.

          -  Subject has history of positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C
             antibody and has liver function test results at screening above the upper limit of
             normal (ULN) for the reference laboratory.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant abnormality on screening evaluation including

          -  Subject has a history of allergic reaction or has a known or suspected sensitivity to
             any substance that is contained in the study medication formulation.

          -  Subject is currently participating or has participated in a clinical trial within the
