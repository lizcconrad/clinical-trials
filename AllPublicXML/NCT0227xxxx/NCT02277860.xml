  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and exercise have become an accepted and valued component of cystic
      fibrosis care. Regular physical activity and exercise can slow the rate of decline of
      pulmonary function, improve physical fitness, and enhance quality of life. However,
      motivating people to be more active is challenging. Supervised, facility-based exercise
      programs are expensive and labor intensive (since groups of patients with CF cannot exercise
      together in the same physical location). Home-based exercise using an interactive exergame
      device may be an effective way to improve adherence to an exercise program for patients with
      CF. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-week,
      home-based exergame exercise intervention on aerobic capacity (peak VO2). The secondary
      endpoint is nasal potential difference, an indicator of how well sodium and chloride flow
      across the mucous membranes in the nose. Other outcomes include patient-reported quality of
      life and habitual physical activity level. Following baseline assessments participants will
      be begin a 12 week, partially-supervised exercise program consisting of at least 90 minutes
      per week of aerobic and resistance exercise training using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus
      exergaming device. Participants will receive at least monthly follow-up phone calls to
      provide additional exercise counseling and motivation. After 12 weeks, they will continue
      with the exergame intervention for another 12 weeks, but without external supervision.
