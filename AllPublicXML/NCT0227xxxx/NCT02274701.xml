    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of holistic needs assessment (HNA) on patient/clinician
      communication in outpatient cancer care. Half of the participants will complete a HNA prior
      to their clinical consultation. They will then take it into the consultation and it will
      inform a discussion around any identified areas of need. Half of the participants will be in
      the control group meaning there will be no additional intervention they will receive care as
      normal. The consultations will be audio-recorded. The patient will complete two outcome
      measures following the consultation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Holistic needs assessment is a checklist completed by the patient prior to consultation. It
      signposts issues of emotional, practical, financial and clinical concern. The purpose of a
      HNA is to identify patient's individual needs in order to facilitate better collaboration.
      During consultation the HNA facilitates a dialogue that will have the patient's concerns at
      the centre. In conjunction with a subsequent care plan the process supports timely
      intervention based on a collaborative, person centred discussion. However, there is little
      evidence on how HNA impacts upon the dynamics of the clinical consultation. This study aims
      to establish a) how HNA affects the type of conversation that goes on during a clinical
      consultation and b) how these putative changes impact on shared decision-making and
      self-efficacy.

    <measure>Patient participation</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be collected during the patients first clinic appointment after treatment for their cancer. The consultation will last approximately 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through analysis of the audio-recordings from each recorded consultation between a clinician and patient. Specifically, through measuring dialogue ratio and preponderance of initiative. These two measures indicate who is speaking, when and for how long.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shared decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be collected following the patients first clinic appointment after treatment. The patient will return to the researcher and complete this measure. It is expected to take no more than 1 minute to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through patient self-report using the measure CollaboRATE. CollaboRATE is a survey-based validated tool designed to create a fast way to measure how much effort clinicians make to explain their patients' health issues; how much effort they make to listen to the issues that matter most to their patients and how much effort they make to integrate the patients' views and health beliefs.</description>

    <description>Participants (patients) complete a self-reported paper assessment that asks them to indicate whether they have any emotional, practical, financial and/or clinical concerns. The patient then takes this completed assessment into their consultation. It is then given to the clinician where it informs a discussion based on the patient's needs and concerns as identified by them. A care plan is then written based on this assessment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Holistic Needs Assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>An assessment completed by the patient in cancer care. It is recommended that this assessment is completed at key points in the care pathway, such as at diagnosis, post treatment and beginning of end of life care. The aim of this assessment is to allow the patient to discuss their most important needs as identified by them. The clinician will take any appropriate action. This may range from listening to the patient to referring to another member of the multi-disciplinary team.</description>
