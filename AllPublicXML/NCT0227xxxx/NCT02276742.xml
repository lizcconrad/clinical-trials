  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of 3 different
      technology-supported approaches to engaging 300 individuals with diabetes and concurrent
      chronic kidney disease in weight loss, dietary sodium restriction, and dietary restriction of
      inorganic phosphates when compared to usual care. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4
      groups, Usual Care (UC), Social Cognitive Theory-based Group Counseling (SCT), Mobile
      self-monitoring with tailored feedback and counseling (MONITORING), or a combination of SCT
      plus MONITORING conditions (COMBINED). Investigators will evaluate the intervention arms
      primarily in terms of weight reduction, urinary sodium excretion, and serum phosphorus and,
      secondarily in terms of physical activity, blood pressure, fasting lipids, medication
      requirements, and pulse wave velocity. Measurements will occur at baseline, 6, and 12 months.
      The statistical modeling of the baseline, 6 mos and 12 mos outcome variables will be based on
      logistic generalized linear mixed models (for binary outcomes) linear mixed models (for
      continuous outcomes), and random effects multinomial models (for outcomes with more than 2
      levels, such as changes in medication management). In separate analyses of the intervention
      arm only, investigators will model self-monitoring adherence and examine possible
      associations between self-monitoring adherence and outcomes. The mediating effect of
      self-efficacy on the primary outcomes will be evaluated using structural equation models.

      II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION

      1. Number of subjects. Investigators will recruit 300 participants to the study.
      Investigators will focus our study on those with diabetic CKD as this form of the disease
      progresses more rapidly than other forms of CKD. Focusing on diabetic CKD also allows us to
      expand logically upon Look AHEAD, and build upon our work in T2DM patients with the ENHANCE
      study. Investigators will recruit participants from 3 clinical sites in New York City:
      Nephrology Family Group Practice at NYU Langone Medical Center (NYULMC), the Bellevue
      Hospital Diabetes Clinic, and New York Harbor VA. Preliminary data from these 3 practice
      settings indicate that investigators will have access to 4,292 potentially eligible patients
      from which investigators must recruit only 7.0% to enroll 300. Our prior studies suggest that
      investigators will retain 80% resulting in a final sample of 240. Investigators are
      projecting 64 participant measurement visits in Year 1; 248 in Year 2; 288 in Year 3; 244 in
      Year 4; and 56 in Year 5.

      Unless otherwise noted, measurements occur at baseline, 6, and 12 mos. Data are collected
      with visits to NYU Clinical and Translational Resource Center (CTRC). Information to be
      obtained from participants at each visit includes height and weight, serum and urine samples;
      blood pressure; investigator administered instruments (sociodemographics, comorbid
      conditions, Mini Mental Status Exam, and self-efficacy instruments), medication inventories,
      and Pulse Wave Velocity. Eight blood tests will be performed: cystatin-C, lipids, phosphorus,
      calcium, PTH or parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, pre-albumin and albumin. These tests are
      estimated to require, in total, approximately 45 mls (of blood.

      One week before their scheduled measurement visit, a 24-hour urine specimen container and
      instructions for collection are mailed to the participant. Participants are contacted 2 days
      prior to their appointment to remind them of their measurement visit, collect their urine,
      fast, and abstain from caffeine for 12 hours prior to their appointment. Laboratory tests are
      collected, spun, refrigerated, batched and sent for processing in the CLIA-certified NYU CTSI
      Translational Research Laboratories by personnel blinded to group assignment. The PWV of the
      brachial-ankle (baPWV) and carotid-femoral (cfPWV) will be collected by trained research
      associates at the CTRC.

    <description>Participants randomized to UC will receive baseline advice about the value of losing weight, becoming more physically active, and limiting intake of sodium and inorganic phosphates followed by 12 mos of UC. We have elected not to use a control group in which we provide equivalent attention to both study arms. Behaviors are difficult to change and there is no reason to believe that simply giving participants attention would create behavioral changes sufficient to result in weight loss, reduce sodium excretion, or reduce serum phosphorus. Numerous weight loss studies, including Look AHEAD, have used attention control groups that did not demonstrate weight loss.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be exposed to a group behavioral intervention that is based on SCT, which focuses on the role played by self-referent thought in the maintenance of behavior change. Self- efficacy is derived from four major sources of information: mastery experiences, social modeling, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Mastery experiences will include emphasizing past successes; setting incremental, easily achievable goals; identifying modifiable barriers to healthy behavior; receiving positive feedback on goal achievement; and practicing problem solving skills around barriers to adherence.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Monitoring</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be taught how to use a lifestyle self-monitoring program to reduce information processing requirements, make readily available the information required to make good self-management decisions, deliver automated, real-time feedback about achievement of behavioral goals, and permit individualized guidance from an interventionist who uses the MyNetDiary® electronic log to provide targeted education and advice. The Monitoring intervention reduces information processing demands by making relevant nutritional information readily available. Technology-based self-monitoring also can be used by interventionists to reduce information processing burden by using it for targeted counseling</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to COMBINED will receive all aspects of the SCT and MONITORING intervention conditions. Social Cognitive Theory based behavioral intervention in complex patients is strengthened when technology is used to manage information complexity, and weakened in its absence. The Monitoring intervention reduces information processing demands by making relevant nutritional information readily available. Technology-based self-monitoring also can be used by interventionists to reduce information processing burden by using it for targeted counseling</description>

    <description>Technology-based self-monitoring reduces information processing demands by making relevant nutritional information readily available. Technology-based self-monitoring also can be used by interventionists to reduce information processing burden by using it for targeted counseling. For example, simultaneous consideration of all pertinent dietary recommendations would likely be overwhelming for an obese person with diabetes and CKD. By using an electronic log accessible to the interventionist, such a person could initially focus on calorie restrictions, with the interventionist stepping-in when problematic behaviors become evident.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to be eligible for the study, the individual must be 40 years of age or older

          -  Have a DRG Code of T2DM, GFR of 15-89 ml/min/1.73m2 and a BMI &gt;30 kg/m2.

          -  The participant's physician of record will have verified that his/her patient can
             safely participant in an intervention study that involves weight loss and a goal of
             150 minutes/week of moderate physical activity comparable to brisk walking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators will exclude from participation those with the following
             characteristics:

               1. unable or unwilling to provide informed consent

               2. unable to participate meaningfully in an intervention that involves group
                  sessions (e.g., due to uncorrected hearing impairment, non-English-speaking)

               3. unable to read or otherwise use an iPad to monitor dietary intake, physical
                  activity, and weight (e.g., blind, illiterate)

               4. unwilling to accept randomization assignment

               5. pregnant, or plans to become pregnant in the next 12 months, less than 3 months
                  postpartum, or nursing or within 6 weeks of having completed nursing

               6. weight loss of &gt; 10% in the past 6 months except for postpartum weight loss

               7. unable to walk 0.25 miles in 10 minutes

               8. a major psychiatric disorder

               9. planning gastric bypass surgery in the next 12 months

              10. individuals who are institutionalized (e.g., in a nursing home or personal care
                  facility, or those who are incarcerated and have no control over their diet).

          -  Investigators will exclude from the study those with underlying diseases that would
             increase the risk of participating in an intervention involving caloric restriction
             and physical activity.

          -  Such individuals would include those requiring treatment for cancer, exclusive of skin
             cancer other than melanoma, in the past 2 years; infectious diseases including
             untreated AIDS and active tuberculosis; uncontrolled hypertension of &gt;190 mmHg SBP or
             &gt;105 mmHg DBP despite treatment; stroke or TIA in the past 6 months; conditions
             requiring the use of home oxygen; or other chronic disease or condition likely to
             limit life span to &lt; 1 year.

          -  Because of the dietary requirements of a pregnant woman, and the nature of weight loss
             and gain with pregnancy, inclusion of pregnant women in the study would confound the
             study results. Those who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the
             study.
