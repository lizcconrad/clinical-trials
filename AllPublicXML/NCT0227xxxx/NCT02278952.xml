  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional cohort study to assess a novel assay to detect excessive or
      insufficient immunosuppression from the drug tacrolimus in lung transplant recipients. The
      assay measures mean residual expression (MRE) of genes downstream of NFAT, a transcription
      factor regulated by tacrolimus. The investigators will assess whether MRE levels identify
      subjects at risk for rejection (insufficient immunosuppression) or infection (excessive
      immunosuppression).

        Inclusion criteria:

        The study will include lung allograft recipients within 2 months of transplantation at
        UCSF.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded who are (a) unable to provide consent of (b) if treating
        clinicians do not anticipate subject will start on tacrolimus. Recruitment and enrollment
        in this study are targeted equally between women and minorities and the study will not
        exclude and gender or racial/ethnic group. This study does not involve vulnerable
