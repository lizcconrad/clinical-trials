      MIGAT will develop and transfer software tools to assist ablation therapy of cardiac
      arrhythmias. The scientific background and objectives of MIGAT differ between atrial and
      ventricular arrhythmias, because the knowledge on structure-function relationships and the
      definition of ablation targets are different.

      Hypothesis: The combination of body surface mapping and imaging will enable a comprehensive
      non-invasive assessment of cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms and localization, myocardial
      structural substrate, and cardiac anatomy, all of which should be of value to better define
      targets for ablation therapy. No software solution is currently available for multimodal data
      processing, fusion, and integration in 3-dimensional mapping systems to assist ablation.
      Because such a development requires a trans-disciplinary approach (cardiac electrophysiology,
      imaging, computer sciences), it is likely to emerge from an academic initiative.

      Objectives: MIGAT will gather resources from the Liryc Institute (L'Institut de Rythmologie
      et Modélisation Cardiaque), the Inria (Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en
      Automatique) and the University Hospital of Bordeaux to develop a computer-based solution
      with high expected impact on the daily management of cardiac electrical disorders. The
      research program will benefit from the MUSIC (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
      equipment recently funded as part of the &quot;Investissement d'Avenir&quot; program, and combining
      state-of-the-art electrophysiology and magnetic resonance imaging technology. MIGAT will
      involve software engineers, computer science researchers, cardiologists, radiologists and
      clinical research personnel with the following objectives:

        -  Development of a multimodal data processing software to assist cardiac ablation

        -  Optimization and Validation of the software in terms of user experience

        -  Optimization and Validation of the software in terms of clinical performance

        -  Optimization of software quality compatible with subsequent device certification and
           randomized-controlled evaluation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac electrical disorders are a major cause of human mortality and morbidity worldwide.
      Catheter ablation therapy has become part of international recommendations for the management
      of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Advanced catheter localization systems now enable
      3-dimensional mapping of cardiac electrical activity. The integration of 3-dimensional
      imaging data acquired prior to the procedure and its merging with the mapping geometry was
      shown feasible. Available non-invasive imaging modalities can provide critical complementary
      information to assist cardiac mapping and ablation. Multidetector computed tomography can
      provide valuable information on patient's anatomy (cardiac chambers, pulmonary veins,
      coronary arteries and veins, phrenic nerve or oesophagus location, epicardial fat thickness).
      Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography can provide valuable information
      on myocardial substrate (scar location), because most arrhythmias occur on structurally
      diseased hearts. In addition, a body surface mapping technology was recently developed,
      enabling non-invasive real-time whole-heart 3-dimensional electrophysiological mapping. The
      system computes unipolar epicardial electrograms from an array of body surface potentials
      acquired with a multi-electrode vest. Because of its real-time and whole-heart nature, body
      surface mapping gives access to the assessment of previously non-mappable arrhythmias such as
      cardiac fibrillation and non-sustained or poorly tolerated arrhythmias. This technology might
      be of value to preemptively identify ablation targets form epicardial activation (earliest
      epicardial exit of the circuit in cardiac reentrant tachycardias, location of rotor cores in
      cardiac fibrillation).
