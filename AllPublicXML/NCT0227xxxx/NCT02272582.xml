  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized, double-blinded, comparative within-person study to evaluate the use
      of SOMVC001 vs. heparin dosed saline in patients undergoing CABG.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Saphenous vein (SV) harvesting will be performed using an open or endoscopic vein harvesting
      technique. Once harvested, the SV will be divided into segments and these vein segments from
      each patient to be immersed in one of two blinded solutions: SOMVC001 or heparin dosed
      saline. The patients will then be randomized and SVG segment allocations will be defined and
      grafted to the assigned target regions. Imaging, using 64-slice or better MDCT, will be
      completed 4-6 weeks and 3 months post surgery (CABG) procedure.

    <description>Each patient will serve as his/her own control because each patient will have two graft segments with one segment immersed in SOMVC001 and the other in heparin dosed saline (Standard solution). Patients will be randomized using a simple random sample allocation scheme. At the time of randomization, patients will be assigned an allocation number. Each randomized patient will be implanted with two SVGs, alternating Target Region A (Circumflex or Diagonal) and Target Region B (Right Coronary System or Diagonal) and alternating (proximal vs. distal) segments of the harvested SV. A randomization schedule will be developed to ensure appropriate randomization allocation of the harvested vein segment being grafted to the targeted regions.</description>
