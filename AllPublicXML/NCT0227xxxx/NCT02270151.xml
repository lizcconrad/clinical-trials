  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and a common cause of stroke. AF can
      be asymptomatic and remain undiagnosed. Both the prevalence of AF and the proportion of
      strokes related to undetected AF increases with ageing. If AF is timely diagnosed and treated
      accordingly with anticoagulants, disabling strokes can be prevented. In order to help
      physicians in diagnosing atrial fibrillation, the MyDiagnostick was developed. It is a CE
      certified device that is safe, user friendly and easy to use. This device is capable of
      detecting or excluding AF within one minute by providing a registration of lead I of the ECG.

      The investigators aim to perform a 2-arm cluster randomized diagnostic trial among patients
      aged 65 years and over who visit the general practice. In total the investigators will
      include 42 general practices of which they randomly assign 21 to the MyDiagnostick arm and 21
      to the control arm. All persons aged 65 years and over who visit the general practice in the
      MyDiagnostick arm will be asked to hold the device every time they visit the surgery during
      one year.

      The number of newly detected cases of AF with the diagnostic screening strategy with
      MyDiagnostick (MyDiagnostick arm) will be compared to care as usual (control arm). Also, the
      number of patients treated with anticoagulants according CHA2DS2-VASc score will be compared
      between both arms. Finally, the investigators will assess the number of major adverse
      cardiovascular events (MACE), intracerebral hemorrhages and other major hemorrhages, and
      all-cause mortality between the arms. End points will be assessed blinded to allocation.

      The investigators hypothesise that the MyDiagnostick improves the diagnosis of atrial
      fibrillation in primary care and with accordingly treatment will reduce adverse outcomes.

    <textblock>
      In a recent validation study performed in 200 patients visiting a cardiology outpatient
      clinic, the sensitivity was 100%, and specificity 96.4% with the MyDiagnostics as compared to
      a 12-lead ECG. Adequate comparison of this device with accordingly treatment with care as
      usual is needed before large scale implementation in the primary care setting can be
      advocated.

    <description>Everyone aged 65 years or over, who visits the GP practice will be screened for AF with the MyDiagnostick. When the device indicates a positive result, the single lead ECG will be assessed to confirm/reject the diagnosis.
