      The purpose of this study is to document the pharmacological treatment strategies used in
      treatment na誰ve and previously treated relapsed/refractory iNHL/CLL patients in the Middle
      East and North African (MENA) region. This study will also record encountered tumor subtype
      and stage and the instituted pharmacological treatments, as well as assess the clinical
      outcomes of treatments.
