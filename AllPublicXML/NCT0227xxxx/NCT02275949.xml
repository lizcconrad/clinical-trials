  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate acupuncture's effect of preventing vasospasm after SAH.

      A total of 80 participants will be recruited and will be randomized to a study group or a
      control group. Acupuncture, electroacupuncture and intradermal acupuncture will be done at
      every session in a study group, while mock transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(mock
      TENS) and sham intradermal acupuncture will be carried out in a control group.

      Intervention starts within 96hours after SAH, after ruptured aneurysms have been secured by
      endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Intervention is applied once a day, 6 days a week
      for 2 weeks(total 12 sessions) in addition to standard treatment such as prophylactic HHH
      therapy and nimodipine. Sterile disposable, stainless steel acupuncture needles are used.

      Primary outcome measurement is the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit
      between the study group and the control group. Moreover, the incidence of angiographic
      vasospasm, TCD vasospasm, and vasospasm-related infarct on CT or MRI, the change of nitric
      oxide(NO) and endothelin-1 in plasma, mortality and participant's functional status using mRS
      will be compared.

    <description>The occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit between the study group and the control group will be compared. DIND is defined as an unaccountable new focal neurological deficit lasting more than 2hours. Any occurrence of DIND will be recorded by the physician and verified by the investigator every day.</description>
