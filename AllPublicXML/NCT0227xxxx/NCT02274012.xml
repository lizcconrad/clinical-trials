  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research program to find out if the investigational drug,
      afatinib which is a medication known to block the function of the ErbB2 protein might help
      standard chemotherapy, in particular paclitaxel, work better.

      Afatinib (GILOTRIF) is a highly potent, irreversible inhibitor of the EGFR and HER2. On July
      12, 2013 the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved afatinib for the
      first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors had
      specific EGFR gene mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 i.e. L858R substitution mutations)
      as detected by an FDA approved test.

      Paclitaxel is a standard, anti-cancer medicine that has been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of lung cancer.

      The combination of Afatinib and Paclitaxel are considered investigational when used in this
      research program. An investigational drug is a drug that is not approved by the FDA for its
      indication.

      Standard Procedures:

      Subjects are offered second line chemotherapy with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity.

      Experimental Procedures:

      In addition to the standard chemotherapy, afatinib 40 mg orally once daily will be
      administered starting on the first day of paclitaxel. Translational studies to assess
      circulating tumor cells at the start of therapy and then at several later time points,
      including at the time of progression. These studies will assess the correlation of
      circulating tumor cell numbers with radiographic response and pilot studies will also be
      conducted to assess HER2 expression, HER2 genomic amplification, HER2 pathway activation and
      secondary genetic changes in the HER2 coding sequence as well as other pathway components.
