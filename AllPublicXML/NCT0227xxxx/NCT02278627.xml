  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During fthe first postoperative days, physiotherapists supported patients with knee
      replacement in orthopaedics of Saint-Junien's and Limoges' hospitals. This support includes
      movements of the leg in active and non active motions, without any help and with an
      arthromotor, and involves walking rehabilitation.

      The investigators would like to complete the physiotherapist's support with manual lymphatic
      drainage (MLD) using a specific method based on pressure of finger splayed (PFS). This might
      have a positive impact on time recovery of joint range, on postoperative oedema resorbtion
      and on patient's pain during rehabilitation classes.

      French National Authority for Health specifies there is not a single study assessing massage
      effects on knee replacement, according to current bibliography.

      The investigators purpose is the establishment of a prospective, controlled, randomised trial
      referred as a &quot;superiority&quot; trial. A total of 98 patients divided in 2 parallel groups will
      be created.

      The study will be in an open-label manner for both patient and physiotherapist involved in
      walk rehabilitation but will be conducted as a blinded study for the investigating
      physiotherapist.

      Inclusion period will be 17 months and the following period will be 6 weeks.
