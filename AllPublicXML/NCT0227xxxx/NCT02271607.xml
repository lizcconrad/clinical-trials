  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic randomized controlled study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      moxibustion therapy on overactive bladder (OAB) patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who diagnosed as overactive bladder aged 20 to 75 years old will be divided into two
      groups, one is moxibustion-therapy and the other is waiting-list group.

      Patients who belong to moxibustion therapy group will be treated moxibustion for 12 times by
      a Korean Medicine doctor.

      Patients who belong to waiting-list group will be prohibited to get any treatment including
      moxibustion for relieve the symptoms of overactive bladder, and the same moxibustion therapy
      with moxbiustion-therapy group will be conducted after 4 weeks.

      Overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), overactive bladder-validated 8-question (OAB-V8)
      will be measured to evaluate the effectiveness.

      The number of side effect will be measured to evaluate the safety.

      The skin temperature of CV4, SP6 and LR3, and the tympanic temperature will be measured to
      study treatment mechanism.
