    <textblock>
      Nissle 1917 is an E. coli based probiotic used in the Europe for close to 100 years to treat
      gastrointestinal disorders and infections. The investigators will assess the safety and
      tolerability of this medication in Americans in a Phase 1 trial.

      Background: Nissle 1917 is an E. coli based probiotic that has been successfully used in
      Europe for close to 100 years to treat largely gastrointestinal disorders like inflammatory
      bowel disease, gastroenteritis, and irritable bowel syndrome. In addition to those disorders,
      we believe that Nissle 1917 is a promising alternative therapy for prevention of urinary
      tract infections in susceptible individuals.

      Purpose: The Phase 1 trial will use Nissle 1917 in healthy adult patient volunteers for the
      first time in the United States. The investigators will track the frequency and incidence of
      side effects and adverse events.

      Participants:

      20 adult (&gt;21 years of age) healthy volunteers

      Protocol:

        -  Participants will enroll in our trial after a review of medical history and physical.

        -  Participants will then take 30 day course of Nissle 1917 capsules

        -  Investigators will telephone participants 1-2 weeks after they have begun the trial to
           assess for any side effects or adverse events

        -  Subjects will also be provided with a diary to record any side effects or adverse events

        -  At the end of 30 days, participants will return to clinic for a follow up visit to
           discuss any side effects or adverse events experienced during the trial and to return
           any unused medication

        -  Investigators will again telephone all participants 28-35 days following completion of
           the study drug again to pose a questionnaire aimed at revealing any side effects or
           adverse events.

    <description>Participants will take the E. coli Nissle 1917 as an orally administered medication first while in clinic to be observed for 30 minutes for any hypersensitivity reaction. The dose of Nissle 1917 will be 100mg capsule (2.5-25x109 organism) once daily for a total of 4 days. Participants will then increase the dose to 2 capsules (200mg) once daily for the remaining 26 days of the study period.</description>
