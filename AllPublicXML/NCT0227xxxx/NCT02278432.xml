    <textblock>
      Introduction. The prevalence of the use of drugs that act on the gastric system has increased
      in the population. Omeprazole is an inhibitor of the protons pump and has a widespread use,
      mainly as a prophylactic to prevent reflux esophagitis, gastric pathological hypersecretory
      conditions, prevention of recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastric mucosal
      protection against damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and during
      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, omeprazole is associated with several adverse events due
      to abusive use or irrational prescribing, in disagreement with the indication, which may
      cause the ineffectiveness of the drug and decreased patient safety. Objectives. To assess the
      risk (occurrence of adverse events) and the benefit (effectiveness) of the prophylactic use
      of omeprazole in hospitalized patients and to know the reasons for the prophylactic use
      (indicated use or not approved). Patients and Methods. A observational and cross
      pharmacoepidemiological study will be performed from June to November 2014, in the General
      State tertiary referral Américo Brasiliense Hospital. Hospitalized patients will be separated
      into three groups: those who make indicated and approved prophylactic use of omeprazole
      (exposed group 1), those who make not indicated and not approved prophylactic use (exposed
      group 2), and those who do not use the omeprazole (non-exposed group). Patients who do not
      make prophylactic use of omeprazole will be excluded. Patients will have their
      pharmacotherapy monitored and data will be collected daily using an investigation guide of
      the first day of admission and will be included in group 1 or 2, from the first use of
      omeprazole to discontinuation (washout period of seven half-lives or higher). National
      Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCCMERP) algorithm will
      be used for causality analysis is used. Data will be tabulated according to the presence or
      absence of effectiveness and the presence or absence adverse events in the three groups. The
      odds ratio of adverse events and effectiveness of indicated and approve or not indicated and
      not approved prophylactic use of omeprazole will be calculated. Expected results. It is
      intended to know the odds ratio of adverse events in the prophylactic use of omeprazole with
      or without indication or use approval, and the potential indications, dosage and unapproved
      methods of prophylactic use in omeprazole label.
