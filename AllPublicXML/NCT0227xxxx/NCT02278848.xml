  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic chronic adult hydrocephalus (ICAH) is due to expansion of the fluid-filled
      cavities in the brain. The clinical symptoms are gait disturbance, mental decline and
      incontinence. Treatment involves installing a ventriculoperitoneal shunt which is known to be
      able to induce regression of the symptoms in many cases meaning that ICAH is a classic,
      curable cause of dementia. Diagnosis relies on comparing symptoms before and after depleting
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via a lumbar puncture (LP). In practice, the situation is
      complicated: improvement is often incomplete and there is no consensus on either how to
      assess the symptoms or how they change after CSF depletion. In consequence, the decision
      whether not to undertake surgery often depends on the neurosurgeon's clinical impression.

      Over recent years, the cognitive profile of patients with ICAH has become better
      characterised and reproducible, objective techniques have been developed to assess motor
      function and CSF flow in the brain.

      The investigators project aims to define the value of these new investigative techniques in
      the positive diagnosis of ICAH, in comparison to current decision-making tools.
