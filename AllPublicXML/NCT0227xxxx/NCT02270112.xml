  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can only be diagnosed during episodes when the arrhythmia is
      present.

      The investigators hypothesize that the activation of the atrial myocardium resulting in the
      p-wave of the ecg should display abnormalities in diseased atria which are vulnerable for AF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first part of this trial different diagnostic techniques to detect arrythmogenic
      substrates of atrial fibrillation will be tested. If suitable parameters can be identified, a
      follow up trial to identify patients at risk for AF will be conducted before a stroke
      happens.

      Parameters tested are

        1. Electrophysiological differences between patients with paroxysmal AF and no history of
           AF

        2. &quot;Vascular Stiffness&quot; detected by an iPhone app

      All patients will undergo a cardiogoniometrie and a pulse wave analysis with an iPhone. Each
      exam takes 5 minutes.
