  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses:

      Short-term - Targeted therapy with erlotinib or crizotinib plus PART (Personalized Adaptive
      Radiation Therapy) will be safe and will yield favorable outcomes in patients with stage III,
      EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) + or ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) + NSCLC
      (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer).

      Long-term - In patients with stage III NSCLC harboring driver mutations, treatment with
      relevant targeted agents plus PART will improve both local-regional and systemic tumor
      control resulting in improved survival relative to standard chemoradiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial is a pilot study that will accrue 30 patients with inoperable stage IIIA/B
      NSCLC harboring either an EGFR mutation (n=20) or an ALK rearrangement (n=10). Patients with
      EGFR+ tumors will be treated with erlotinib 150 mg orally QD; patients with ALK+ tumors will
      be treated with crizotinib 250 mg orally BID. Treatment consists of six weeks of concurrent
      PART plus erlotinib or crizotinib, followed by erlotinib or crizotinib for a total of 1 year.
      All patients will be treated with response-driven PART with dose intensified to the active
      (FDG-avid) region based on a mid-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan while maintaining dose limits for
      organs-at-risk. The primary endpoints will be PFS and OS. Primary analyses will be performed
      separately for ALK+ and EGFR+ patients. The secondary endpoint of treatment-related toxicity
      will focus on pneumonitis and esophagitis with a strict stopping rule in place.

      Current standard therapy affords suboptimal outcomes for patients with locally advanced NSCLC
      due to both locoregional and distant recurrences. Since targeted therapy is more effective
      than chemotherapy in patients with relevant driver mutations, the best way to significantly
      improve outcomes in this subgroup of patients is to optimize systemic therapy with targeted
      agents while improving local control with PET-adapted, high-dose RT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with FDG-avid (radioactive glucose) and pathologically proven stage IIA-IIB

             on Cancer] staging, 7th edition).

             rearrangement.

          -  Hypersensitivity to erlotinib, crizotinib, or to any of the excipients.
