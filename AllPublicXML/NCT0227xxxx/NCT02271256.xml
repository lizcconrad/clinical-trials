  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent chronic condition that gradually leads
      to the three dimensional deformity of the spine. Spine curvature increases in youths as
      puberty progresses. Generally, only observation is suggested for adolescents with early
      scoliosis (Cobb's angle ≤ 20°). Rigid brace treatment is too draconian for them due to the
      high corrective force which nearly constrains all movements. Flexible brace treatment is an
      alternative option; however, its efficacy is still controversial. Functional intimate apparel
      with a specialized design for teenagers with scoliosis is limited and most part of them can
      only provide some improvement for bad postures, such as hunchback. A scientific approach
      should be used to design and develop functional intimate apparel as a treatment option for
      adolescents with early scoliosis.

      This project aims to combine clinical experience with textiles and materials sciences to
      research and develop functional intimate apparel for adolescents with early scoliosis. As a
      result, this will reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      In this study, the eligible subjects will be given tailor-made functional intimate apparel to
      wear it 8 hours daily. Monitoring and observation will be provided during the 12-18 months
      wearing period. The effectiveness of the functional intimate apparel will be evaluated by
      pre- and post- treatment X-ray radiography.

      This project aims to combine clinical experience with textiles and materials sciences to
      research and develop functional intimate apparel for adolescents with early scoliosis. As a
      result, this will reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      The design of functional intimate apparel will incorporate different mechanisms, such as a)
      compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel, b) lumbar flexion
      by using a supporting belt, c) transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket
      lining by using the principle of the 3-point pressure system, d) axial rotation or coupled
      motion by using a system with uneven straps, and e) an active mechanism that aims to shift
      the trunk away from areas of pressure.
