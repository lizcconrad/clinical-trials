  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is both oncogene and prognostic biomarker in head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EGFR's functional importance in HNSCC resulted in
      development of the first molecularly targeted strategy, the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody
      cetuximab. Given the lack of therapeutic options for patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC
      after failure of cetuximab, there is strong scientific interest in understanding resistance
      in order to identify new therapies for this population. A possible resistance mechanism to
      anti-EGFR therapy in HNSCC is primary or compensatory activation of alternate growth factor
      receptors including c-Met. The MET oncogene encodes c-Met, an RTK bound exclusively by the
      ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway converges with the
      EGFR network at both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK nodes. Laboratory data suggest the ability for
      reciprocal compensation between EGFR and c-Met. We hypothesize that HGF/c-Met pathway
      inhibition may overcome resistance to cetuximab in patients with HNSCC, such as those with
      clinical cetuximab resistance.

      Ficlatuzumab (AV-299) is a humanized HGF-inhibitory immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal
      antibody. The primary objective of this phase 1b study is to find the recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) of the combination of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab in patients with
      recurrent/metastaticHNSCC. The dose-finding study design will follow a Narayana k-in-a-row
      design with k set to 2 to target a 33% rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In the
      dose-finding phase, a total of 8 patients will be treated if no DLTs are observed or 14
      patients if at least one DLT occurs. An expansion cohort will then proceed at RP2D until 12
      patients have been treated at that dose level with the combination of ficlatuzumab and
      cetuximab. We will evaluate biomarkers of HGF/cMet pathway activation in baseline tissue,
      plasma and immune cells for a preliminary relationship with clinical activity.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b, single arm, open-labeled study of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab in
      recurrent/metastatic HNSCC with biomarker correlatives. The primary objective of this study
      is to establish the recommended-for-phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of ficlatuzumab
      and Cetuximab. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may
      continue until disease progression or until one of the following criteria applies:

        -  Disease progression,

        -  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s),

        -  Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

        -  General or specific changes in the patients condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      After progressive disease, subjects will be followed for survival every 3 months for 2 years.

      Cetuximab and ficlatuzumab are administered every other week on day 1 and 15 of a 28-day
      cycle. Ficlatuzumab will be administered as an IV infusion, over 30-60 minutes,10 mg/kg every
      2 weeks, on the same day as the first dose of cetuximab. Ficlatuzumab will be administered
      30-60 minutes after the completion of the cetuximab infusion. Cetuximab will be administered
      prior to ficlatuzumab as an IV infusion. The first dose will be administered over 120 minutes
      (± 15 minutes). Subsequent doses may be infused over 60 minutes (± 15 minutes).The starting
      dose of cetuximab (dose tier 1) will be 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks.

      Subjects will be monitored for adverse events and toxicity during study treatment and for 30
      days after last dose of ficlatuzumab. Blood will be drawn for correlative studies at
      baseline, and at the end of every even cycle. Prior to initiation of protocol treatment,
      patients will undergo a mandatory research biopsy.

    <description>A dose escalation/de-escalation plan will be conducted according to an adaptive Narayana k-in-a-row design.45 We will select the dose of ficlatuzumab that is close to but does not exceed a 33% dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate when administered with a fixed q2week dose of cetuximab. The observation period for identifying a DLT will be the first cycle, which consists of two doses of ficlatuzumab, or 4 weeks.In the dose-finding phase, a total of 8 patients will be treated if no DLTs are observed or 14 patients if at least one DLT occurs. If no DLTs are observed among the first 8 patients, the recommended for phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be set to dose tier 2. If a DLT is observed and 14 patients are treated and observed, the RP2D will be estimated from DLTs across all dose levels by isotonic regression. More than one patient can be enrolled at the same time.</description>

    <description>Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used.
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from treatment initiation to disease progression or death from any cause or last follow up.
Survival will be measured from the date of entry on study. The preliminary clinical efficacy of the combination of cetuximab and ficlatuzumab will be described according to RR, median PFS, and median OS in: 1) the entire study population; 2) patients with prior cetuximab exposure treated at RP2D.</description>

    <description>HNSCC tumors overexpress both HGF and c-Met as compared to adjacent tissue. The relationship of percent change in baseline sum diameter of index lesions to baseline cMet and HGF will be characterized by a linear, or if necessary, generalized linear or nonlinear regression model with appropriate confidence intervals.This exploratory endpoint seeks an early indication that overexpression of cMet or its ligand, HGF, may predict benefit from ficlatuzumab. For purposes of this endpoint, both cMet and HGF expression levels will be reported as semi-quantitative H-scores.</description>

             indicated. Note: HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding because ficlatuzumab and/or cetuximab may
             be harmful to the fetus or the nursing infant. Pregnant women are excluded from this
             study because ficlatuzumab and/or cetuximab have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects.
