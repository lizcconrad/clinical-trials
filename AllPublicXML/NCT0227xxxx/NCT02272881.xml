  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the number of and degree of pressure ulcers healed,
      as measured by intact skin at the original ulcer site at 6 months of follow-up in patients
      randomized to immediate operative closure versus those who are maintained in a wound care
      program in patients with Stage 3 and 4 sacral and peri-sacral decubitus ulcers.

    <description>Patients randomized to surgical flap closure will undergo reconstructive plastic surgery to close an intended pressure ulcer at the earliest date after selection. Our group's co-investigator and staff plastic and reconstructive surgeon will decide on the optimal technical repair. Given the lack of retrospective evidence to support a superior surgical repair (myocutaneous, fasciocutaneous, local flap arrangement versus free microvascular tissue transfer) we will defer to our physician staff preference on a per patient basis. The time from enrollment to surgical intervention will be tracked, and no patient will be dropped from the study should this time exceed the two-week ideal.</description>

    <description>Patients selected to the supportive wound care arm will be managed by the Center for Wound Care at Cottage Health System, a certified wound care center. They will receive standard of care conservative wound care including: debridement, dressing changes, wound checks, physical therapy, occupational therapy, antibiotic treatment, nutritional support and close follow-up over the study period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years old;

          -  Stage III or IV pressure ulcers on or near trochanter, ischium, sacrum or buttocks;

          -  Receiving treatment at the Center for Wound Management - Goleta Valley Cottage
             Hospital; Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital or Santa Ynez Cottage Hospital, all part of
             Cottage Health System;

          -  Underlying etiology for immobility secondary to spinal cord injury (SCI) or other
             neuromuscular condition not expected to become progressive in next 12 months;

          -  No contraindications to undergo surgical intervention, including medical ability to
             tolerate surgical procedure with general anesthesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent;

          -  Patients requiring immediate surgical closure determined by physician judgment;

          -  Those deemed inappropriate to consider for surgery outside of study; potential reasons
             normally include medical comorbidities, inability to comply with post-operative care,
             and lack of funding source for elective procedure, peri-operative, and / or wound
             care.

          -  Patients who have already been receiving active, professionally supervised wound care
             for &gt; 2 week period prior to presentation
