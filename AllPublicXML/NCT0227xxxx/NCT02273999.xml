      This randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy of Pulsed
      electromagnetic field PEMF delivered with a wearable device in terms of postoperative pain
      and quality of healing after mandibular third molar extraction.

      The sample included 120 patients undergoing unilateral mandibular third molar extraction. The
      devices were positioned over the area corresponding to the extraction site and wearers were
      asked to keep them in place for 7 days. All patients were asked to record pain (on a visual
      analog scale [VAS]), hours of wearing the device (groups T and P), and any use of analgesics.
      At 7 days, healing complications (dehiscence, tumefaction, pus, local lymphadenopathy, pain
      on palpation, postoperative bleeding, alveolitis) were recorded blindly.

      Introduction: Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is a noninvasive method for
      delivering pulsed radiofrequency energy to tissues to treat postoperative pain and edema.
      This randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the clinical efficacy of PEMF delivered
      with a wearable device in terms of postoperative pain and quality of healing after mandibular
      third molar extraction.

      Materials and methods: The sample included 120 patients undergoing unilateral mandibular
      third molar extraction. At the end of the surgical procedure, patients were randomly assigned
      to a test (T) or placebo (P) group and fitted with enabled or disabled PEMF devices,
      respectively, or to a control (C) group not fitted with a PEMF device. The devices were
      positioned over the area corresponding to the extraction site and wearers were asked to keep
      them in place for 7 days. All patients were asked to record pain (on a visual analog scale
      [VAS]), hours of wearing the device (groups T and P), and any use of analgesics. At 7 days,
      healing complications (dehiscence, tumefaction, pus, local lymphadenopathy, pain on
      palpation, postoperative bleeding, alveolitis) were recorded blindly.
