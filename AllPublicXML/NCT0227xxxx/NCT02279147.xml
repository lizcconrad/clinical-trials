      RATIONALE:Anticholinesterase drugs and cholinergic M receptor antagonist are applied to
      patients who have obstructive jaundice after operation.

      PURPOSE:This clinical trial was designed to lower the incidence and mortality of operation
      complications in patients with obstructive jaundice .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES:

      Ⅰ.Judge whether it has the effect of inhibiting inflammation, anti oxidative stress and anti
      apoptosis when the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are activated .

      Ⅱ.Judge whether it has the effect of reducing the incidence and mortality of operation
      complication when using Cholinesterase inhibitors and M cholinergic receptor blocking agent
      in Patients with obstructive jaundice after operation。

      OUTLINE:Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to order of enrollment.

      Group 1:Patients receive neostigmine methylsulfate and raceanisodamine hydrochloride on days
      0,1,2 after operation.

      Group 2:Patients do not receive any special treatment after operation.

      All patients should be monitored the observed indexes on the day before the operation and one
      day, three days, five days after the operation.
