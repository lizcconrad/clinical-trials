  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among those patients experienced GERD symptoms, up to 89% report nocturnal symptoms,
      resulting in poor sleep quality. Sodium alginate oral suspension (Alginos) is a medication
      indicated for the relief of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. This multi-center, open-label,
      randomized trial intends to compare the addition of one dose Alginos (50mg/ml, 20ml) at bed
      time (Nexium plus Alginos), with no additional alginate treatment (Nexium alone), in erosive
      GERD patients taking Nexium (40mg/tablet) daily for 4 weeks. Efficacy endpoints include
      percentage of patients with relief or complete resolution of nighttime heartburn (or
      regurgitation), percentage of patients with relief or complete resolution of GERD-related
      sleep disturbance, the percentage of nights without nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation)
      over treatment period, change from baseline of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
      questionnaire total score, and change of the percentage of patients with relief of nighttime
      heartburn (or regurgitation) at post-treatment visit as compared to final visit in test group
      (Nexium plus Alginos). Safety endpoint is incidence of adverse events. The study hypothesis
      is that sodium alginate plus esomeprazole is superior to esomeprazole alone in relieving
      nighttime reflux symptoms and sleep disturbance in erosive GERD patients.

      This multi-center, open-label, randomized trial aims to compared the efficacy and safety
      profiles of sodium alginate oral suspension (50mg/ml) 20ml at bedtime with that of
      esomeprazole (40mg/tablet) 1 tablet once daily for the treatment of erosive GERD patients in
      Taiwan. Patients will be enrolled into study if they are diagnosed as GERD (grade A~D); with
      history of heartburn (or regurgitation) for ≥ 3 months before entering study; with history of
      GERD-related sleep disturbances for ≥ 1 month before entering study; with nighttime heartburn
      (or regurgitation) graded as moderate, or severe, on ≥ 3 nights in the last 7 days of
      screening period; with GERD-related sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights in the last 7 days of
      screening period; with the global PSQI score &gt;5; and have signed the informed consent.
      Patients will be excluded if they are diagnosed as non-erosive GERD, Barrett's esophagus or
      esophageal stricture; with any conditions other than GERD that could be the primary cause of
      sleep disturbance; with active esophageal, gastric or duodenal ulcers; with history of
      esophageal, gastric or duodenal surgery; with active cancers of any kind; female patients who
      are pregnant or lactating; who were allergy to any of the study drugs; taking a proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) within 7 days, or any prokinetic agent, H2-blocker, alginate preparations or
      antacid within 2 days before screening; with a history of drug addiction or alcohol abuse
      within the past 12 months; or with any other conditions or diseases that investigator
      considers it is not appropriate to enter the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is the
      percentage of patients with relief of nighttime heartburn (or acid regurgitation). The
      secondary efficacy endpoints are percentage of patients with complete resolution of nighttime
      heartburn (or regurgitation); percentage of patients with relief of GERD-related sleep
      disturbance; percentage of patients with complete resolution of GERD-related sleep
      disturbance; percentage of nights without nighttime heartburn (or regurgitation) over
      treatment period; change from baseline of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire
      total score (global PSQI score) at the end of study; and change of the percentage of patients
      with relief of nighttime heartburn (or acid regurgitation) at post-treatment visit (V4) as
      compared to final visit (V3) in test group (Nexium plus Alginos). The safety endpoint is
      incidence of adverse events. This study aims to prove that sodium alginate plus esomeprazole
      is superior to esomeprazole alone in relieving nighttime reflux symptoms and sleep
      disturbance in erosive GERD patients.
