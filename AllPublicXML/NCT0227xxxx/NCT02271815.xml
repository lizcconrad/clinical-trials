  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for toothpastes that more effectively remove oral biofilm, and inhibit
      biofilm re-formation. This is particularly important for patients with long-term orthodontic
      fixtures or prosthodontic appliances, and also for debilitated, diabetic and
      immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      toothpastes on plaque presence and removal, dental hard tissue mineralization, erosion,
      abrasion and microstructure as well as gingival and periodontal health and dry/sore mouth. In
      addition to clinical scoring and photographs, measurements of tooth and gum sensitivity,
      saliva volume, pH and buffering, variables may be evaluated using tooth samples worn on
      removable dental retainers. These samples will be examined outside of the mouth using
      advanced optical techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Fluorescence, various
      forms of microscopy and spectroscopy.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a novel dental gel, on de- and
      re-mineralization and the microstructure of the enamel surface in vivo of teeth and on the
      gingival soft tissue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      over-the-counter toothpaste Colgate product, Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste and Zendium
      Classic toothpaste and use imaging devices call Optical Coherence Tomography and Multiphoton
      Microscopy to measure the change in oral tissue.

      Imaging devices are:

        -  Optical Coherence Tomography, this imaging device can be used to identify the presence
           of the inflammation of the gum. The inflammation presence in the gingival pockets and
           compare to the effect of the toothpaste.

        -  Multiphoton Microscopy, this imaging device can be used to identify the presence of the
           bacterial. The results can determine effects of the toothpaste on the development and
           breakup of bacterial and any other changes.

      In the first part of this study, 15 subjects moderate gingival inflammation (Löe and Silness
      Gingival Index ≥2) and pocket depths &lt;4 will be randomly assigned to brush twice daily for 21
      days with the test or the control dental gel. On Days 0, 7, 14 and 21, plaque levels
      (Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Plaque Index), gingival inflammation (Löe and Silness
      Gingival Index) and gingival bleeding (modified Sulcus Bleeding Index) will be determined by
      one blinded, investigator (Dr. Wilder-Smith) using a pressure sensitive probe. In vivo
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) will be used for in situ
      imaging. The results from this study will help evaluate the effects of the test dentifrice
      formulation on plaque removal and maintaining gingival health.

      In the second part of this study, in 15 subjects, plaque formation and removal will be
      quantified using ex vivo Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM)
      imaging of small enamel chips mounted on a simple intra-oral retainer. In this cross over
      design study the subjects will attend the test site on 11 occasions over an 11 week period.
      Subjects will have an intra oral retainer manufactured which will be worn for a minimum of 22
      hours per day and will have up to 8 sterile human enamel inserts fitted.

      The second part of the study will be conducted in three legs with a maximum of 44h of
      retainer wear each, and each leg will follow the same procedure. 2 different over-the-counter
      toothpastes and a water control will be used for each leg of the study respectively. There
      will be a minimum of two weeks between each leg.

      The third part of this study will involve 5 subjects with no specific oral health issues. The
      protocol will involve 3 subjects wearing simple retainers for 3 periods of 2 weeks each with
      5 sterilized UCI IRB Approved: 07-22-2016 | MOD# 18976 | HS# 2013-9778 1 of 32 enamel chips
      attached in the palate area. The study will have 3 legs using a control and 2 active
      toothpastes. There will be washout of 1-2 weeks between each leg. (Section 3 has been
      completed as of July 11, 2016)

      The fourth part of this study will involve 5 subjects with xerostomia. Subjects will wear
      simple removable retainers for 2 periods of 1 week each, with 5 sterilized demineralized
      enamel chips attached in the palate area Fresh enamel chips will be used for each leg of the
      study. After study completion, chips will be used for Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) and
      microhardness measurement. We will provide custom retainers made from impressions of each
      subject. Upon conclusion of the study, we will analyze the effects of Livionex or Xylimelts
      use on surface enamel using SEM and microhardness data.
