  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-Operative Cognition Dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after surgery, POCD can
      lead to a reduced ability and seriously affect the quality of life of patients, increase
      personal and social burden, POCD may also increase mortality.POCD can occur at any age, but
      the long-term, affect the daily lives of POCD in elderly patients over 60 years of age are
      more prone. Age is a risk factor for advanced or long-term POCD. POCD determined by
      preoperative cognitive function and psychological scales postoperative assessment, the main
      recommendation of the agreed test methods include, Rey auditory verbal test, the connection
      test, digit span test. In this study, preoperative mini-mental state examination (MMSE)
      screening, comprehensive neurological function during hospitalization for memory, attention,
      executive function and exercise capacity test, and telephone follow-up after discharge Scale
      Revised (TICS-M) test.

      Few study showed that dexmedetomidine may improve cognitive function in young patients others
      show that dexmedetomidine did not reduce POCD incidence after 24 hours of surgery. These
      results conflict and it is necessary to carry out large-scale, multi-center, randomized,
      controlled clinical study to determine whether dexmedetomidine reduce the POCD incidence or
      not for elderly patients.

    <time_frame>1 day Before surgery,the 3rd,7th day after the surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropsychological tests performed at the day before the surgery, the 3rd and 7th day after the surgery respectively.
A test environment to keep quiet, well-lit, non-interference, all the test items should be completed within 30 min.
Normal population (65 to 90 years age-matched 400 non-surgery people) should perform neuropsychological tests in the same time interval, then calculate the score difference(ΔXc), and the standard deviation(SD) of the difference.
Calculate the difference(ΔX) between the score obtained before surgery and 3 or 7 days after the surgery (there are both positive and negative, we use the absolute value), with this difference( ΔX) divided by the standard deviation（SD）of the difference of the normal population, that is ΔX / SD and it is the Z score.
POCD Diagnosis: if a patient has two or more than two of the absolute value of Z scores ≥1.96, the POCD is exist.</description>
