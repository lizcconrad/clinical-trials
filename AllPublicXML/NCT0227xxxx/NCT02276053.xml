    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (Month 6 or end of Observation Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The actual change in seizure frequency from Baseline to Month 6 is calculated as the seizure frequency at Month 6 minus the seizure frequence at Baseline.
The seizure frequency at each time point is calculated as number of seizures per 28 days.</description>

             low-grade glioma (World Health Organization Grade 1 to 2 at time of enrollment)

          -  Patient has a retrospective Baseline seizure frequency of at least 1 partial-onset
             seizure in the 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (enrollment/ Baseline visit)

          -  Patient does not have a previous diagnosis of epilepsy before tumor onset

          -  Patient does not have brain metastases

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status scale index ≥ 60 %

          -  Patient is currently taking only 1-2 Baseline anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for
             epilepsy, other than LCM

          -  Patient has received a maximum of 4 different lifetime AEDs ever before entering the
             NIS
