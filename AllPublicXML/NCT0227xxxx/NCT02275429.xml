      Acute consequences of ultramarathon running are still unknown as very little research has
      been done on the matter. The investigators will assess the consequences on the metabolism of
      runners in the ultramarathon Madmen's Diagonal on Reunion Island. Data from the literature
      suggest that runners undergo loss of zinc, copper, iron, magnesium not unlike the loss of
      metabolites in systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the metabolic disorders (selenium, zinc, vitamins B9 and B12) in ultramarathon
      runners, during and up to 28 days after the Madmen's Diagonal which takes place on Reunion
      Island every year in October.

      Ultramarathons are races involving walking or running longer than the traditional marathon
      length of 42km and frequently take longer than 12 hours to complete. These races are
      increasingly frequent and racers attempt to push back the limits of what their body can
      accomplish. However, these races are not without certain risks.

      The Reunion Island Grand Raid (or Madmen's Diagonal) is one such race, crossing the island
      over 163 km (101 mi) with an altitude gain of 9,643 meters (31,637 ft). Temperatures vary
      from 0 et 30 degrees Celsius (32-86°F) and the race can take 27 to 67 hours to complete.
      About 40% of the racers do not cross the finish line. Each year, two or three racers are
      hospitalized each year in the intensive care unit (ICU) for tubular necrosis and treated with
      dialysis. Scientific literature shows that racers can present acute rhabdomyolysis, with
      elevated levels of CPK-MB. Nevertheless, there have been very few studies on the impact of
      these ultramarathon racers on other biological parameters. As the racers compete and lose
      about a liter of sweat every hour, they also lose ions and trace metals such as zinc, copper,
      iron, magnesium, which can have major repercussions during and after the race. These losses
      are akin to those observed in severe burn victims. In these patients, it has been shown that
      supplementation in trace elements can decrease mortality and hospitalization time.

      Moreover, a major inflammatory response has been observed in racers who compete in
      ultramarathons. This inflammatory response is similar to that of the systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome (SIRS). Patients in the ICU who are septic or who present a SIRS also have
      metabolic diseases, and it has been shown that selenium levels are a prognostic factor of
      SIRS and supplementation can increase survival rates.

      Investigators present the hypothesis that ultramarathon racers can have decreased levels of
      selenium and other ions and trace metals and that specific supplementation can limit risks
      and improve recovery. More specifically, investigators suggest that selenium levels will
      decrease by 25% after the race and remain so at least a week.

    <description>Each year, about 1,200 runners residing on Reunion Island take the start of the Madmen's Diagonal ultramarathon. Among those, 500 runners will be selected at random and will receive a letter informing them of the study and requesting their participation. Those who accept are to contact the study team. Among those volunteers, 100 runners will be selected randomly and included in the study. They will undergo a blood test the day before the race starts (day 0, when they retrieve their race number), upon completion of the race, and upon days 7 and 28.</description>
