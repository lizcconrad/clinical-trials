  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical trial investigating the use of single fraction re-irradiation
      following local progression of spine and cauda equina (L2 to sacrum) lesions that have
      previously received radiation therapy. Patients will be treated with single-fraction
      radiation therapy at 3 dose levels using image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery techniques.

    <measure>toxicities as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicities associated with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery to the spine may be classified as either early (occurring within 90 days of the treatment) or late toxicities (after 90 days to 1 year). These toxicities will be evaluated with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>local failure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>tumor control will be defined for this study as the absence of tumor progression at the treated site, where progression may consist of an increase in maximal dimension of the tumor by ≥20%, compromise of the spinal cord/cauda equina and/or exiting spinal nerves (assessed clinically or radiographically), or both.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>will be evaluated from the completion of treatment, and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method or cumulative incidence curves. For these outcomes, patients across all dose levels will be combined, and will only be evaluated for a maximum of 2 years on protocol.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled on this study will be registered into a dose tier and undergo 1 session of image-guided SRS using techniques previously. Three escalating SRS spinal cord/cauda maximum dose (Dmax) levels (14 Gy, 16 Gy, and 18 Gy) will be evaluated to determine the safety of this approach. A minimum of three patients will be treated per dose tier. Toxicity based on NCI CTCAE (v4). Post treatment followup at 2 and 4 months (+/- 2 weeks) post-treatment, at 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) and then every 3 months until 2 years (± 4 weeks). Followup schedule based on last day of treatment. No schedule adjustments based on early or delayed visits.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologic or cytologic proof of a non-hematologic malignancy
             confirmed by MSKCC pathologic review

          -  Patients must have radiographic evidence of malignancy in the spine or cauda equina
             region (L2 to sacrum) which is suitable for radiation therapy

          -  Patients must have received prior external beam radiation therapy to the region
             proposed for SRS re-irradiation at least 6 months prior to planned re-irradiation

          -  For patients who were previously treated at an outside institution, adequate records
             must be available to determine the true dose the cord/cauda received during prior RT.
             Sufficiency of the treatment records will be assessed and signed-off by the Medical
             Physics investigator.

          -  Patients must have demonstrated progression of disease on MRI or CT assessment of the
             spinal cord/cauda within the previous radiation field

             o progression may consist of an increase in maximal dimension of the tumor by ≥20%,
             compromise of the spinal cord/cauda equina and/or exiting spinal nerves (assessed
             clinically or radiographically), or both.

          -  Target lesion size for re-irradiation must be ≤ 2 vertebral bodies

          -  KPS ≥ 60%

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of &lt; 6 months as predicted by the Adult Comorbidity
             Index (ACE-27, see Appendix 1).

          -  Patients with intradural or intramedullary lesions, or lesions with &lt; 2mm distance
             from tumor to spinal cord

          -  Patients with circumferential epidural disease

          -  Systemic chemotherapy delivered or planned to be delivered within (+/-) 5 days of SRS
             re-irradiation

          -  Patients receiving bevacizumab within 12 weeks prior to protocol treatment.

          -  Unable to undergo either a myelogram or MRI of spinal cord/cauda equina and/or exiting
             spinal nerves

          -  Patients who may not receive therapeutically effective doses via an external beam
             approach to the lesion of interest as specified by the Dose Limit Guidelines
             Evaluation of doses previously delivered to spinal cord/cauda equina and other
             critical structures (bowel, esophagus, kidneys, rectum) will be taken into
             consideration

               -  If repeat irradiation would exceed any normal tissue constraint as noted in
                  Appendix 2, the patient will be ineligible

               -  If the total prior radiation dose to the spinal cord/cauda equina and/or sacrum
                  over all prior treatments exceeds 100 Gy BED (biologically effective dose), the
                  patient will be ineligible, where a total of 100 Gy BED is determined by the
                  calculation: BED = nd(1 + d/α/β), where n = number of fractions and d = dose per
                  fraction; α/β is the constant for spinal cord/cauda/sacrum late effect and equals
                  2 [Rades 2005, Nieder 2005, Sahgal 2012]

          -  Patients with paraspinal extension of disease with visceral involvement exclusive of
             patients with cauda equina and sacral disease extension.

          -  Abnormal complete blood count. Any of the following:

               -  Platelet count &lt; 75,K/mcL

               -  Hemoglobin level &lt; 9g/dl

               -  WBC &lt; 3.5K/mcL

          -  Abnormal coagulation profile: INR &gt; 2.5 and/or PTT &gt; 80

             o Patients who are on anticoagulation medication that may not be safely held for the
             procedure (≥ 5 days for antiplatelet agents and warfarin; ≥ 24 hours for low-molecular
             weight heparin formulations) will be excluded

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.
