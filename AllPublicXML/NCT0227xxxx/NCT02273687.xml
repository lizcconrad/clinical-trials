  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to show that &quot;diaphragmatic excursion measures upon
      emergency admission&quot; (CDA values) on patients with acute respiratory failure are predictive
      of the need to use mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-) in the first four hours.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A-determine a prognostic threshold for diaphragmatic excursion measures able to predict the
      use of mechanical ventilation (invasive or not) in the first four hours.

      B-to study the association between CDA values and persistence of respiratory distress during
      the first 4 hours of care among patients who, at 4 hours, are not mechanically ventilated.

      C-to study the association between CDA values and respiratory re-exacerbation or a continuing
      need for mechanical ventilation during the 24 first hours after admission to the emergency
      room D-to study the association between diaphragmatic excursion measures made after initial
      emergency care (at 4 hours; =CDH4), and the persistence of respiratory distress at 4 hours,
      in patients who at 4 hours are not mechanically ventilated.

      E-to study the association between CDH4 values and respiratory re-exacerbation during the 24
      first hours after admission to the emergency room among patients who, at 4 hours, are not
      mechanically ventilated F-to study the association between changes in values of diaphragmatic
      excursion measure before and after initial emergency care (CDA → CDH4) and respiratory
      re-exacerbation during the 24 first hours after admission to the emergency room among
      patients who, at 4 hours, are not mechanically ventilated.

      G-analyze patient outcomes by subgroup according to diagnosis (decompensated COPD, OAP, lung
      disease, asthma, pleural disease).

    <description>Diaphragmatic ultrasound will be performed by the physician supporting the patient on arrival and also at 4 hours later in the beginning of therapeutic management. The patient will be monitored for 24 hours following inclusion.
The exams will all be done with the same ultrasound system (Vivid S6 GE Ultrasound) and a phased array probe, also called a cardiac probe.</description>
