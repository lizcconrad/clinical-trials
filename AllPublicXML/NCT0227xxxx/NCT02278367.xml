      This study is designed to expand the database of 18F-AV-1451 safety and tau binding as
      measured by PET imaging and to provide standardized conditions for 18F-AV-1451 use, data
      collection and analysis to facilitate companion studies including, but not limited to,
      longitudinal studies of aging, depression, and traumatic brain injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or
             endocrine disturbances

          -  Have a history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) or are taking
             drugs known to cause QT-prolongation. Patients with a prolonged QTc interval in the
             setting of intraventricular conduction block may be enrolled with sponsor approval

          -  Have a history of drug or alcohol dependence within the last year, or prior prolonged
             history of dependence unless approved by the sponsor

          -  Are patients who have received an investigational medication under an FDA IND protocol
             within 30 days prior to the planned imaging session for this study

          -  Are patients with current clinically significant unstable medical comorbidities

          -  Are patients who have received a radiopharmaceutical for imaging or therapy within the
             past 24 hours prior to the imaging session for this study
