  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study to investigate the ability of a phosphodiesterase-V
      inhibitor (vardenafil) to increase the concentration of systemically delivered chemotherapy,
      carboplatin, in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas or metastatic brain cancer. This
      study will also determine the toxicity and tolerability of a phosphodiesterase-V inhibitor
      (vardenafil) in combination with intravenous carboplatin for patients with recurrent
      malignant gliomas or metastatic brain cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients (10 pts with recurrent malignant glioma and 10 pts with metastatic brain
      tumor) will be randomly assigned to receive either a phosphodiesterase-V inhibitor
      (vardenafil) followed by carboplatin or carboplatin alone. All patients will have tumor
      resection performed from 2 to 6 hours after administration of carboplatin. Using high
      performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) or ELISA methodology, carboplatin levels will be
      determined from both serum and resected tumor tissue. Patients will be followed for four
      weeks after craniotomy for toxicity associated with the administration of carboplatin and a
      phosphodiesterase-V inhibitor plus carboplatin.

      These data will provide quantitative measures of intratumoral carboplatin levels with and
      without alteration of blood/tumor barrier (BTB) permeability with vardenafil.
