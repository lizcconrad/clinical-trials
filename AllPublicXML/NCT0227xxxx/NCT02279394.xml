  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is aimed to determine the proportion of high risk smoldering multiple
      myeloma patients who are progression free at 2 years after receiving elotuzumab, lenalidomide
      and dexamethasone combination therapy.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of the
      investigational drugs elotuzumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in smoldering multiple
      myeloma. Recent research studies have shown that early treatment of smoldering multiple
      myeloma may delay or prevent the progression to active multiple myeloma. The purpose of this
      research study is to learn whether the combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone works in treating smoldering multiple myeloma.
