  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the anti-OX40 antibody, MEDI6469, given
      prior to surgery in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib clinical trial uses MEDI6469 at various dose intervals prior to definitive
      surgical resection of patients with stage III and IV Oral Head and Neck Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma (OHNSCC) with the primary objective of determining the safety and feasibility of
      preoperative MEDI6469 administration. In addition, tumor tissue and peripheral blood will be
      obtained for exploratory immunologic end points including measurements of tumor infiltrating
      immune cell populations based on flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry as well as
      circulating immunological parameters that may correlate with changes induced by MEDI6469
      administration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with treatment naive, resectable, stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of
             the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx who are candidates for definitive
             surgical resection followed by standard risk adapted adjuvant therapy.

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of a primary OHNSCC with no radiological evidence of
             metastatic disease is acceptable. Patients with bone or cartilage invasion and any T
             or N stage are acceptable.

          -  Patients with oral cavity primaries will be managed using conventional transoral or
             transcervical techniques; oropharynx or hypopharynx tumor will be managed with
             transoral robotic surgery; and larynx tumors (T3/T4 with thyroid cartilage invasion)
             will be managed by either total laryngectomy or larynx preservation surgery.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2

          -  Laboratory values (performed within 28 days prior to enrollment) within protocol
             defined range

          -  Ability to give informed consent and comply with the protocol. Patients with a history
             of psychiatric illness must be judged able to understand the investigational nature of
             the study and the risks associated with the therapy.

          -  No active gastrointestinal bleeding.

          -  Anticipated lifespan greater than 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Locoregionally unresectable or Metastatic disease (stage IVB)

          -  Active infection.

          -  Active autoimmune disease including patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease as
             determined by an autoimmune questionnaire.

          -  Previous treatment with mouse monoclonal antibodies

          -  Need for chronic maintenance oral steroids &gt; 5mg prednisone daily equivalent.

             preclude compliance with study procedures.
