      Background: The actual literature is consistent in considering potential negative effects of
      sub-gingival prosthetic margins on the periodontal health, but no research has focused the
      attention on the type of prosthetic margin designs. Hence, the aim of the present study is to
      evaluate if a horizontal finishing line (deep chamfer preparation) may have a different
      influence on periodontal soft tissue in comparison with a vertical finishing line (feather
      edge preparation).

      Methods: A prospective randomized controlled double blind clinical trial with one single
      operator and three experienced examiners was performed. One hundred and six crowns were
      prepared with horizontal tooth preparation while ninety-four with vertical tooth preparation.
      All the margins were positioned within the periodontal sulcus, at 0.5mm sub-gingivally and
      all the all-ceramic restorations were cemented with resin cement. Periodontal Probing Depth
      (PPD), Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI) and Gingival Bleeding on Probing (BOP) were
      recorded prior to tooth preparation and twelve month after crown cementation. Also, at 12
      months follow-up, the gingival margin position was related to the crown margin position.
