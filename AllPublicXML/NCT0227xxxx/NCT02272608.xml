  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence suggesting that OSA is associated with low level of systemic
      inflammation and oxidative stress. Low level systemic inflammation and subsequent vascular
      damage has been implicated as the underlying mechanism responsible for comorbidities.
      Detection of altered inflammatory markers in OSAS patients may predict the degree of
      nocturnal sleep disturbance and associated systemic inflammation and presence of
      comorbidities. Recently, novel inflammatory biomarkers, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte
      ratio (NLR) have been proposed as an indicator of systemic inflammation. To our knowledge,
      NLR has not been studied in OSAS. We conducted the present study to evaluate the association
      between OSAS and inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and NLR.

        Patients suffering from sleep apnea and were referred to perform polysomnoraphy constituted
        the study groups. There were grouped into 4 according to apnea- hypopnea scores: control,
        mild apnea, moderate apnea and severe apnea.
