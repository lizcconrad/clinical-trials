  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the potential effects of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation in the improvement of neuropsychological deficits and symptomatology in
      borderline personality disorder patients. Specially in cognitive flexibility, inhibition
      control and social cognition.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two protocols
      of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), the application will be over
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) right and left, in patients with borderline
      personality disorder. 40 ambulatory patients with a borderline personality disorder diagnosis
      from the National Institute of Psychiatry in México will be included. All Patients will be
      randomly assigned and will complete a total of 23 sessions rTMS, in any of two groups:

      5 Hz Group.- This group will receive rTMS sessions, 5 per week during three weeks (acute
      treatment phase), and after that, one session a week for the next eight weeks (follow up).
      The rTMS will be applied over the left DLPFC at 5 Hz, 1500 pulses per session in 100% of
      Motor threshold

      1 Hz Group.- This group will receive rTMS sessions, 5 per week during three weeks (acute
      treatment phase), and after that, one session a week for the next eight weeks (follow up).

      The rTMS will be applied over the right DLPFC at 1 Hz, 900 pulses per session in 100% of
      Motor threshold All sessions will be applied with a &quot;Dantec&quot; transcranial magnetic
      stimulator. The affective, borderline and anxiety symptoms will be evaluated at baseline, and
      every 5 TMS sessions during the acute treatment phase, and once at the end of the 8-weeks
      follow up. In same form for neuropsychological evaluations .

      Categorical variables will be described by percentages and frequencies. Continuous variables
      will be described by means and standard deviations. Treatment groups will be compared using
      Student's T test. Cognitive, anxiety, borderline and affective symptom scale scores between
      treatment groups will be compared using repeated measures ANOVA

    <time_frame>Inclusion, after 15 days of treatment and at 8 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton depression rating scale is a is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion, after 15 days of treatment and at 8 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>WCST is used primarily to assess perseveration and abstract thinking, the WCST is also considered a measure of executive function because of its reported sensitivity to frontal lobe dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Stop Signal Task (SST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion, after 15 days of treatment and at 8 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>SST measuring response inhibition (impulse control). The subject must respond to an arrow stimulus, by touching either of two choices depending on the direction in which the arrow points. If an audio tone is present, the subject must inhibit that response.</description>
