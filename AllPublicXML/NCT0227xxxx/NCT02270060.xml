      The purpose of this research study is to:

        1. Investigate the effects of a single 20-minute music therapy intervention with a music
           therapist on the pain intensity, pain relief, and mood of adult patients with sickle
           cell disease as compared to:

             1. Adult patients with SCD who listen to their preferred music for 20 minutes without
                the presence of a music therapist (music listening group)

             2. Adult patients with SCD who receive standard care alone (control group)

        2. Determine the feasibility (delivery, acceptability, and usefulness) of the music therapy
           intervention for pain management
