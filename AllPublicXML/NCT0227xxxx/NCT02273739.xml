  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1/2, multi-center study is to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-221 in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors, including glioma, and with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), with an
      IDH2 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of
      patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-221 to determine maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose. The second portion of the study is a planned dose
      expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive AG-221 to further evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and clinical activity. Anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
