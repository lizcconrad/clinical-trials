      Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum collection from HBV and HCV
      infected patients in a number of different immunological assays, the investigators hope to
      identify any changes in the number and function of these immune cells and to investigate how
      these changes contribute to viral persistence and disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C (HCV) are the leading causes of liver disease worldwide.
      Approximately 400 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV world wide and
      it is estimated that 3% of the entire world population is infected with HCV and yet there is
      still no vaccine available.

      Chronic viral hepatitis infection is primarily the result of a complex interaction between
      the virus and an impaired host immune response. The host immune response has a unique role in
      HBV and HCV infection because it contributes not only to viral control clinical recovery and
      protective immunity but also to the development of chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis.
      There is currently no cure for most patients who already have chronic HBV and HCV infection
      and a proportion of patients fail to respond to current antiviral regimens. Since these
      patient remain at risk for disease progression it is crucial to investigate host immune
      responses and to determine the precise role of these responses in disease outcome.

      Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum collection from HBV and HCV
      infected patients in a number of different immunological assays, we hope to identify any
      changes in the number and function of these immune cells and to investigate how these changes
      contribute to viral persistence and disease progression. This information can be utilised to
      develop more effective treatment regimens in order to reduce the current global burden of
      these diseases.
