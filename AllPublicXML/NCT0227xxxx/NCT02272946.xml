      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of IL-1β inhibition on safety, measures
      of systemic and vascular inflammation and endothelial function (all indicators of
      cardiovascular risk) in treated and suppressed HIV infected individuals This study will
      assess the safety and effects of canakinumab on endothelial function (assessed by
      flow-mediated vasodilation [FMD] of the brachial artery), vascular inflammation (assessed by
      FDG-PET/CT scanning), key inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
      (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble CD163 (sCD163),
      D-dimer, T-cell and monocyte activation in the blood, and size of the HIV reservoir. 20
      individuals will receive a single dose of 150mg canakinumab with follow-up for 18 weeks.
