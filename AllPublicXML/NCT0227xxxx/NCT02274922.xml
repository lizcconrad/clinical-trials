  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, culture was the only way to detect Campylobacter. It appears that rapid
      immunochromatographic tests (ICT) have detected more positive cases compared to culture,
      ELISA and molecular tests. The aim of our study is to evaluate the specificity of the ICT
      which are really interesting tools to use since they allow a diagnosis in about 15 min, in
      comparison to different methods of detection even serology.

      All of the patients coming to an emergency care unit and for whom a stool culture is
      prescribed will be included, corresponding to an estimate number of 1,000 patients for two
      years. Every stools will be tested for Campylobacter using two different ICT tests in
      addition to the standard culture. Then, in function of the ICT test result : 1) in case of
      negative result, no other Campylobacter detection will be performed except the standard
      culture, 2) in case of positive result, stools will be tested for Campylobacter by two ELISA
      tests, one PCR and a serology at two different times (D0 and D15) will be performed. Around
      70 patients should be detected positive with ICTs, according to precedent studies. The 70
      patients detected positive with at least one of the two ICT will have a serology control 15
      days after the ICT test. The reference test will be the combination of culture result,
      evolution of the serology between D0 and D15 and the PCR and ELISA results. We want to define
      a procedure to follow in order to detect as soon as possible and with the best results, the
      Campylobacters in the stool of patients. This has the aim of being able to manage patients
      who need appropriate antibiotic treatment, and also to reduce the time of hospitalization of
      patients quickly detected as suffering from a Campylobacter infection.
