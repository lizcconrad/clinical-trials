  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the safety and effectiveness of biosynthetic cornea, comprising
      interpenetrating networks of recombinant human collagen and phosphorylcholine, will be tested
      in patients with severe corneal pathology (corneal ulcers or corneal opacification from
      corneal injury, burn or infection) - diseases, where human donor cornea transplantation (the
      only widely accepted treatment) carries a high risk of rejection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collagen-phosphorylcholine corneal substitute will be implanted in patient's corneas with
      severe pathology (corneal ulcer, corneal leukoma after burn, trauma or infection) using
      anterior lamellar keratoplasty technique, i.e. when patient's diseased cornea is removed it
      will be substituted with proposed transparent implant. Usually these patients are grafted
      with human donor cornea, but the latter frequently fails due to graft-versus-host problems.
      We will test the safety (incidence of adverse events, biocompatability) and the effectiveness
      (ability to promote healing and increase vision) of developed biosynthetic corneas in 10
      patients with corneal pathology, where human donor cornea carries a high risk of rejection.
      The patients will be follow-uped for 12 months.

    <description>Implant safety and tolerability will be measured by absence/presence of its lysis as well as by degree of eye inflammation based on conjunctival injection, perifocal corneal haze, aqueous humor transparency, increased intraocular pressure and self reported postoperative pain. Each item is scored 0-4: 0 = no symptom, 4 = severe symptom.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo surgery using conventional anterior lamellar keratoplasty technique: diseased cornea will be trephined to approximately 50-90% of corneal thickness (depending on corneal ulcer or scar depth) and then a lamellar dissection will be created. Trephine diameter will depend on ulcer or leukoma maximal size. Alternatively a femtosecond laser may be used to create the dissection. A collagen-phosphorylcholine cornea 250-500 microns thick and equal or 0.25 mm larger diameter is placed and sutured. The sutures are superimposed and the implant and the sutures covered with a bandage contact lens. The sutures and bandage lens will be removed later after the initial healing period of 4 weeks or as determined by physician depending on the implant epithelial coverage.</description>
