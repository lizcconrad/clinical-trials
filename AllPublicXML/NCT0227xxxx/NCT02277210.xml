  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte aspiration under the guidance of transvaginal ultrasound is an integral part in IVF
      treatment. Follicular flushing has been advocated. However, subsequent data from randomized
      trials failed to demonstrate any benefits with routine follicular flushing in normally
      responding patients. Instead, it has been shown to prolong the operating time, increase the
      procedure-related pain and analgesics requirement. Most of the IVF centers no longer perform
      routine follicular flushing in normally responding patients.

      The potential role of follicular flushing in patients with a limited number of developing
      follicles is conflicting based on the recently published randomized trials. The aim of the
      present study is to determine the effect of follicular flushing on the ongoing pregnancy rate
      in patients who developed four or fewer follicles of 14mm following standard ovarian
      stimulation for IVF.
