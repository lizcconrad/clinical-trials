    <textblock>
      Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are the most common
      healthcare-associated infection in children and are associated with morbidity and mortality.
      This study will attempt to identify the source of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in children
      with CLABSI because we hypothesize that many of the BSIs that are currently classified as
      CLABSIs are actually laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infections (LCBI) that may be a result
      of mucosal barrier injury (MBI), also known as MBI-LCBI. In order to study this, we will
      isolate bacteria from multiple body sites of children that have BSI in order to compare these
      bacteria to the strain growing in their blood using whole-genome DNA sequencing. We will also
      evaluate biomarkers of MBI of the respiratory tract and GI tract.

      This is a prospective cohort pilot study at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) that will
      explore the source of presumed CLABSI, which we believe may actually have multiple possible
      sources including MBI. We plan to enroll all inpatient children at BCH who meet the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of MBI-LCBI as well as children who meet
      the criteria for CLABSI without MBI. For all enrolled patients, we will collect samples from
      the oral cavity, respiratory tract, skin, and stool. These samples will be cultured in order
      to see if the same microbial species and strain(s) growing from the blood also grow from
      these other sites. Cultures will then have isolated colonies selected for whole-genome DNA
      sequencing to allow assessment of genomic diversity between body sites. Stool and blood
      samples will be tested for markers of MBI. All patient enrollment and sample collection will
      be done at BCH.
