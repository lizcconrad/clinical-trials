    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the nasal strip (relative to the placebo
      strip) on the nasal passages using anatomical MRI scans and to demonstrate the effect of the
      strip on breathing correlated cortical activity, using interoceptive fMRI task and analysis
      techniques derived from physiological data collected during scanning.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 2.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>CBF was derived from Arterial-Spin Labelling (ASL) scans. ASL data were analysed using custom Matlab code, which fits a CBF model to the raw perfusion data, in order to derive quantitative estimates of CBF in units of ml/100g/minute. The computed CBF maps were co-registered to the subject's whole-brain T1-weighted anatomical scan (from the first scan session) in order to spatially divide the data into anatomical Regions of Interest (ROIs). The anatomical ROIs were themselves defined by nonlinear warping of a standard cytoarchitectonic atlas into the space of the subject's T1 anatomical scan, using the FMRIB Software Library tool FNIRT. CBF data were extracted for a subset of these anatomical ROIs.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breathing-related Cortical Activity (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent- Resting State)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 2.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Regional measures of breathing-related cortical activity were derived by determining Functional Connectivity and Event-related percentage signal change.
Functional connectivity analyzes of fMRI data where spontaneous (i.e. while the participant is at rest) signal changes in one brain region are regressed against other regions, to identify regions sharing similar functional properties.
Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (efMRI) detects changes in the BOLD hemodynamic response to neural activity associated with certain event. In this case, the events were pre-defined by collecting additional data during the scan; participant respiration was determined using a simple pressure-sensitive respiration belt. Events time-locked to peak inspiration and expiration were defined separately, and regressed against brain activity, showing brain regions that were more or less active during each event type.</description>

The placebo strip was applied for up to two hours for the first scanning sessions, and then removed and the marketed strip applied for the second scanning session. The strip was removed and participants applied the nasal spray (period 3) and then after approximately 30 minutes, applied the marketed nasal strip for the third scanning session (period 4).

        <description>CBF was derived from Arterial-Spin Labelling (ASL) scans. ASL data were analysed using custom Matlab code, which fits a CBF model to the raw perfusion data, in order to derive quantitative estimates of CBF in units of ml/100g/minute. The computed CBF maps were co-registered to the subject’s whole-brain T1-weighted anatomical scan (from the first scan session) in order to spatially divide the data into anatomical Regions of Interest (ROIs). The anatomical ROIs were themselves defined by nonlinear warping of a standard cytoarchitectonic atlas into the space of the subject’s T1 anatomical scan, using the FMRIB Software Library tool FNIRT. CBF data were extracted for a subset of these anatomical ROIs.</description>

        <title>Breathing-related Cortical Activity (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent- Resting State)</title>
        <description>Regional measures of breathing-related cortical activity were derived by determining Functional Connectivity and Event-related percentage signal change.
Functional connectivity analyzes of fMRI data where spontaneous (i.e. while the participant is at rest) signal changes in one brain region are regressed against other regions, to identify regions sharing similar functional properties.
Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (efMRI) detects changes in the BOLD hemodynamic response to neural activity associated with certain event. In this case, the events were pre-defined by collecting additional data during the scan; participant respiration was determined using a simple pressure-sensitive respiration belt. Events time-locked to peak inspiration and expiration were defined separately, and regressed against brain activity, showing brain regions that were more or less active during each event type.</description>
