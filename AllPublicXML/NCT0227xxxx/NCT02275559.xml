      Asthma is one of the four most common adult chronic disorders. Supporting asthma patients in
      improving their asthma control and symptoms as well as their quality of life are important
      goals in clinical management. This study will test the effect of a widely-available
      mindfulness training program in improving asthma control and symptoms and quality of life
      among patients with asthma, and explore the relationship between asthma control and a number
      of factors, including how well patients perceive their respiratory symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the four most common adult chronic disorders. It affects 7.3% (16.4 million)
      U.S. adults and costs $18 billion in direct healthcare costs and lost productivity. Control
      of symptoms and improving patient's quality of life (QOL) are the goals in asthma management
      and require patients to accurately identify their symptoms. But the low congruence between
      patients' symptom reports and their pulmonary function leads to disease management errors.
      The accuracy with which asthma patients recognize their symptoms is affected by emotional
      factors, and because high negative affectivity is related to low interoceptive accuracy and
      worse asthma symptoms and asthma physical health, the frequent mental distress prevalent
      among asthmatics is thought to result in difficulty in distinguishing symptoms of
      stress/distress from those of asthma. Mindfulness training teaches people to recognize and
      distinguish among the components of experience (thoughts, feelings, sensations/symptoms) and
      is associated with increased perceptual accuracy of respiratory resistance, and reduced
      affective negativity. It thus has the potential to improve patient's discrimination between
      asthma symptoms and stress/distress, resulting in improved asthma management, control and
      QOL. A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N=84) of a widely-available mindfulness
      training program (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)) to explore this hypothesis in
      adults with mild, moderate or severe persistent asthma. Intent to treat analyses comparing
      MBSR to an active control program showed clinically significant improvements in overall QOL
      (p=0.01), as well as important improvements in asthma symptoms (p=0.009), reduced use of
      asthma rescue medication (p=0.001), anxiety (p=0.05), perceived stress (p=0.01), and
      mindfulness (p=0.01). Promising improvements in the percentage of patients with
      well-controlled asthma also were found. All improvements were sustained 10 months
      post-intervention. Widespread adoption of this promising adjunct intervention will require
      sharper evidence regarding asthma control and symptoms. The primary aim is to test MBSR
      against an active control on the key clinical outcomes of asthma control and symptoms using
      gold standard measures with 256 adults with mild, moderate or severe asthma. And to evaluate
      the program's effect on asthma QOL, lung function, cost-effectiveness, and the mediating
      effect of respiratory interoceptive accuracy on asthma control, QOL, and medication use.
      Assessments are at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. MBSR is available nationwide
      and covered by many third-party payers. If sustained and credible improvements in asthma
      control and symptoms are found, MBSR could be a useful adjunct to traditional medical
      treatment and would have the potential for improving the lives of people with asthma. By
      examining the mediating effects of psychosocial variables on asthma control, the study also
      generates new knowledge on mechanisms of change and maintenance in mind-body and behavioral
      programs in medicine.

    <measure>Change from baseline in asthma control at 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma control will be assessed using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). The ACQ is a 7-item validated measure that assesses the 5 asthma symptoms considered most important and most used by clinicians for evaluating asthma control, along with use of short-acting beta-agonist and FEV1 percent predicted. Patients recall their symptoms and short-acting beta-agonist use during the previous week; FEV1 is obtained from spirometry. All seven questions are scored on a 7-point scale (0=good control, 6=poor control), and the overall score (range 0-6) is the mean of the seven responses. Changes of 0.5 or greater in the score are considered important differences.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in asthma-related quality of life at 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma-related quality of life will be assessed using the Asthma-related QoL (AQoL) measure.The AQoL has 30 items assessing impairment in 4 areas of function shown to be important to the QoL of adult patients with asthma (activity limitations, asthma symptoms, emotional function and environmental exposure). Overall QoL is computed by averaging scores on the 4 domains. Items assess the degree to which important activities have been limited by asthma during the last 2 weeks on a 7-point scale (1= maximal impairment, 7= no impairment). Shown to be valid, reliable and sufficiently sensitive to changes in asthma symptoms to capture the effects of an intervention in a clinical trial. Changes in scores of 0.5 or above represent clinically meaningful improvement in QoL.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in respiratory interoceptive accuracy at 6-, 12- and 18-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-months</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory interoceptive accuracy will be measured using the Breath Perception Discrimination Test (BPDT). The BPDT measures ability to detect small changes in resistive load. This test will be done in the Pulmonary Diagnostic Laboratory at each site. During the test period, the presentation of the resistor will be announced at the onset of a new inspiration for the duration of one full breath cycle. At the conclusion of the breath cycle, participants pause for 5 normal breaths, at which point the next resistor in the block is presented. The test will be divided into 6 blocks during which there is a random presentation of each resistor so that participants carry out 30 ratings (6 for each condition) over the course of the test. Time to complete: 30 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in lung function at 6-, 12- and 18-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-months</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function will be assessed via spirometry. Spirometry assesses the level of air flow limitation according to the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Measurement will be done in the site Pulmonary Diagnostic Laboratories according to American Thoracic Society guidelines before and after inhalation of bronchodilator. This includes instructing participants to not take a bronchodilator at least 4 hours prior to their spirometry, and assessing lung function both before, and then 30 minutes after bronchodilator to assess best lung function and responsiveness to bronchodilator therapy. The team pulmonologist at each site will interpret all spirometry tests.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>

    <description>Cost effectiveness will include collection of the following data. The number of moderate and severe exacerbations, asthma-related regularly scheduled office visits, unscheduled office visits (acute care visits), hospitalizations, emergency room visits, need for intubation or mechanical ventilation, and calls to their physician during the prior 6 months at baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-month follow-up and associated clinic and hospital costs will be determined by self-report and hospital records.</description>
