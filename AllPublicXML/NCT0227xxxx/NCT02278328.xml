  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, randomized, acute dose-response study to determine whether STX209
      produces a dose-dependent significant change in MEG target parameters compared to baseline as
      well as compared to placebo treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies in ASD have pointed to
      abnormalities (specifically, delays) in auditory evoked neuromagnetic responses (e.g. M100 -
      see Roberts et al., 2010, and mismatch field, MMF - see Roberts et al., 2011) as well as
      abnormalities in the oscillatory behavior of auditory cortex, especially in the gamma band
      (30-50Hz), at rest and in response to simple auditory stimuli (see Gandal et al., 2010 and
      Cornew et al., 2012; Edgar et al., 2013). The local circuitry underlying such evoked activity
      and oscillations, and synaptic transmission in general, requires an appropriate balance of
      excitation and inhibition, mediated by glutamate and GABA, respectively. One model of the
      neural oscillatory deficits in ASD suggests that impaired regulatory control by inhibitory
      interneurons onto pyramidal cells underlies abnormal auditory latency and oscillatory
      electrophysiological measures. As such, electrophysiological deficits are interpreted in
      terms of local circuitry abnormalities, with inferences at the molecular level of imbalances
      in the activity of glutamate and GABA.

      A candidate therapeutic for ASD has been developed - STX209, a GABA-B agonist. Since this
      pharmaceutical targets synaptic activity that has clear electrophysiological correlates, one
      goal of this proposal is to assess the responsiveness (sensitivity to change) of MEG measures
      to acute administration of STX209 at various doses in adolescents on the autism spectrum. The
      study also aims to establish the nature of the putative relationship between such
      electrophysiologic markers and GABA and glutamate levels using MEGAPRESS spectrally-edited
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

    <description>A randomized acute dose-response design will be employed with a total study duration of 3 weeks. At each visit, baseline MEG will be obtained followed by acute single-dose drug/placebo administration, followed 60 minutes later by repeat MEG. Each participant will receive a single dose of placebo in random order and a single dose of STX209 from smallest to largest (15mg, and 30mg). MRI and MRS will be performed immediately following MEG to provide an anatomic basis for source localization as well as to assess acute effects of STX209 administration on MRS estimates of GABA and glutamate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Right- handed males aged 14 to 17.75 years.

          2. Diagnosis of ASD with the last 12 months according to the DSM-IV criteria, including
             Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified
             (PDD-NOS), and Asperger's Syndrome but excluding Childhood Dis-integrative Disorder
             and Rett Syndrome.

          3. Current pharmacological treatment regimen has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior
             to Screening.

          4. If the subject is already receiving stable non-pharmacological educational,
             behavioral, and/or dietary interventions, participation in these programs must have
             been continuous during the 2 months prior to Screening and subjects or their
             parent/caregiver may not electively initiate new or modify ongoing interventions for
             the duration of the study. Typical school vacations are not considered modifications
             of stable programming.

          5. Prior to the conduct of any study-specific procedures, the subject must provide verbal
             assent to participate in the study (if developmentally appropriate), and the
             parent/caregiver must provide written informed consent. If the caregiver attending the
             clinic visits is not the parent, written consent must be obtained from the parent for
             the caregiver's participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             tiagabine, or riluzole.

          6. Subjects who have taken another investigational drug within the last 30 days.

          7. Subjects who are not able to take oral medications.

          8. Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to racemic baclofen.
