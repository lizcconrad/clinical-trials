    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of AEB071
      and BYL719. Secondary objectives are to define the safety and tolerability of AEB071 and
      BYL719.

    <textblock>
      Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults and is thought to
      be particularly resistant to systemic treatment, and no systemic therapy has yet been
      demonstrated to improve survival. Drugs commonly used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma
      rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal melanoma. Because of the lack of
      effective systemic treatment options, outcomes are poor once metastatic disease occurs, and
      the median survival from the time of the development of distant metastatic disease is 6 to 12
      months. Although it is clear that novel effective therapies are desperately needed for this
      disease, the development of such therapies has been hampered by the rarity of uveal melanoma.

          -  Measurable disease. Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic disease that do not meet
             criteria for measurable disease may be eligible at the discretion of the principal
             investigator.

          -  Prior cytotoxic therapy and immunotherapy are allowed. For the dose escalation, prior
             targeted therapy with a MEK inhibitor, Protein Kinase C inhibitor, Akt, or mechanistic
             target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor are allowed. For the dose expansion cohort, no
             prior PKC, Akt, or mTOR inhibitors are allowed. Local therapies such as radiofrequency
             ablation or cryotherapy for metastatic disease are permitted but must have been
             performed at least 21 days prior to initiation of study therapy.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Willingness to undergo core biopsies at baseline, mid-Cycle 1, and/or at progression

          -  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) less than 140 mg/dL / 7.8 mmol/L.

          -  All prior treatment-related toxicities must be grade less than or equal to 1 (except
             alopecia).

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function within 14 days of starting Cycle
             1, Day 1 of therapy

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection and psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with

          -  Patients with impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that
             could interfere with the absorption of AEB071 or BYL719 (e.g. ulcerative disease,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel
             resection).

          -  Patients who have received prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, such as cyclical
             chemotherapy or biological therapy within a period of time that is shorter than the
