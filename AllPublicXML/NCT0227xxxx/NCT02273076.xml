  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current surgical procedure for breast diseases places an emphasis on the conservation of
      breast skin in order to provide more optimal reconstruction.

      The purpose of this study is to use portable, non-contact optical imaging device developed at
      the Beckman Laser Institute called Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging to detect the changes in
      a skin during reconstructive surgery procedure and healing process.

      The researchers can use Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging instrument to measure the
      concentration of blood flow in the skin tissue and can determine of the changes that observed
      in the properties of the mastectomy flap that may be delay in healing process.

      The imaging device can determine the change from baseline measurement to the development of
      skin necrosis, wound infection, or implant extrusion.

        Study Population will be recruited from UCI Anesthetic and Plastic Surgery Institute
        clinics, seen by the Plastic Surgery Service. Subjects requiring breast reconstructive
        surgery using either implant based or autologous reconstruction will be identified.
