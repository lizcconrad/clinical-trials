      This phase I trial studies the side effects and recommended dose of the combination of p53MVA
      vaccine (modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing tumor protein p53 [p53]) and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer that has come
      back. Vaccines made from inserting a laboratory-treated gene into a person's tumor cells may
      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express p53. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with ovarian
      epithelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a recommended dose for the combination of a p53MVA vaccine and gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and if it is well-tolerated in patients with platinum resistant,
      p53 over expressing ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate T cell immunity changes and clinical response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) on
      day 15 and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then continue to receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8 every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

             12 months after completion of platinum based chemotherapy; patients must have
             measurable disease or detectable disease:

               -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
                  measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each
                  lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computerized

          -  Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 0-6 months following
             platinum-based chemotherapy have platinum resistant disease; such patients are
             eligible for this trial

          -  Patients with documented disease recurrence/progression within 6-12 months of
             completing platinum-based therapy, are considered to have 'borderline' platinum
             sensitivity; these patients are eligible for this trial if agreed by the patient and
             the treating physician

          -  Patients who relapse more than 12 months after completion of platinum-based treatment
             are considered 'platinum sensitive' and will not be eligible for this trial

             2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ul

             level, if there is evidence of liver metastasis)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for six months
             following duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Patients with confirmed p53 mutation by molecular analysis and/or evidence of p53
             overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (&gt;= 10% of cells within the tumor
             staining positive) will be eligible; this will be assessed semi-quantitatively by a
             Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved pathology core pathologist,
             using CLIA approved mutational analysis or immunohistochemistry techniques on
             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue; in the case of equivocal IHC results, p53
             involvement may be confirmed by detection of p53 molecular analysis on tumor
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); patients on whom molecular analysis of p53 mutations is
             already available, will not require IHC analysis; molecular analysis may be performed
             as an additional research procedure at the end of the study (distinct from eligibility
             determination) if the principal investigator (PI) deems it of scientific value and
             research funding is available to cover the cost

          -  Taxol will not be counted as a &quot;prior chemotherapy regimen&quot; for the purpose of this
             study; treatment with targeted agents or hormones would not be considered as a
             systemic chemotherapy regimen; previous treatment with gemcitabine is not allowable

          -  Eligible patients are those with documented disease recurrence/progression within 0-12
             months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  No other malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma, superficial bladder cancer, any carcinoma in situ or any

          -  Patients with a history of immunodeficiency, including organ grafts and human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV), will not be eligible

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study
