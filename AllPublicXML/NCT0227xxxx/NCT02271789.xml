      The purpose of this research study is to find a new way of using light to measure the blood
      flow within the tooth.

      The researcher develop dental Laser Speckle imaging system tool that can use for exam
      condition of the tooth. This device is reliable method to provide information to dentists and
      endodontists during oral examination.

      In additional to routine oral exam the researcher can use the Laser Speckle imaging system
      probe with low-level light shine to the problematic tooth to collect blood flow information.
