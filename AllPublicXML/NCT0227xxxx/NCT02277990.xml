    <textblock>
      Medtronic , Inc. is sponsoring the World-wide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection
      Prevention Trial (WRAP-IT), a randomized, prospective, multi-center, single blinded,
      post-market, interventional clinical study. This study will evaluate the ability of the TYRX
      envelope to reduce major CIED infections through 12-months post-procedure following CIED
      generator replacement, upgrade, revision, or de novo CRT-D implant. Additionally, this large
      device study provides the unique opportunity to prospectively characterize the performance of
      Medtronic's lead monitoring features in subjects whose CIED system includes a transvenous RV
      defibrillation lead. Finally, the WRAP-IT study will serve as a post-approval study for those
      geographies requiring a post-approval study of the TYRX envelope.

    <description>CIED infections are defined as (1) superficial cellulitis in the region of the CIED pocket with wound dehiscence, erosion, or purulent drainage, (2) deep incisional or organ/space (generator pocket) surgical site infection that meets the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, independent from time of surgery, (3) persistent bacteremia, or (4) endocarditis.
Major CIED infections are defined as a CIED infection resulting in one or more of the following:
CIED system removal
Any invasive procedure (e.g. pocket opened) without system removal
Treatment with antibiotic therapy if the subject is not a candidate for system removal and infection recurrence after completion of antibiotic therapy or evidence of deep infection with wound dehiscence, erosion, or purulent drainage
Death</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The first occurrence of a major or minor CIED infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Implant to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Major CIED infections are defined above. Minor CIED infections are defined as CIED infections that do not meet the definition of a major CIED infection</description>

    <measure>The first occurrence of a CIED procedure related or system related complication</measure>
    <time_frame>Implant to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A CIED system related event is defined as an adverse event related to the CIED system which includes the device, leads, implant tool(s), programmer, or TYRX envelope (if applicable)
A CIED procedure related event is defined as an adverse event that occurs due to any procedure related to the implantation or surgical modification of the system including the TYRX envelope (if applicable)
A procedure or system related complication is defined as an adverse event related to a CIED procedure or the CIED system that results in at least one of the following:

          -  Patient is planned to undergo at least one of the following:

             a. Patient has existing CIED and is undergoing IPG (including CRT-P), ICD or CRT-D
             replacement or upgrade with a new Medtronic generator

             i. Subjects planned to have leads added, or extracted and added for upgrades can be
             enrolled OR

             indications

        OR

        c. Patient has existing study eligible Medtronic CIED in which the pocket was not accessed
