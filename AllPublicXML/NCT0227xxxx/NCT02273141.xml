    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NER1006 versus a sodium
      picosulfate and magnesium salt solution (SP + MS) in adult patients requiring bowel cleansing
      prior to any procedure that requires a clean bowel, using a Day Before Only Dosing regimen.
      Approximately 484 patients will be randomised with the aim of achieving a minimum of 220
      patients in each of the 2 groups.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Successful Bowel Cleansing (Overall Colon)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day (day before colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). A final HCS grading of A, B, C or D was derived. Grades A and B are classified as successful (i.e. all mucosa could be visualized) and C and D are classified as unsuccessful. Comparison of overall success of cleansing with NER1006 versus SP+MS was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With 'Excellent Plus Good' (Highly Effective) Bowel Cleansing (Colon Ascendens)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day (day before colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of bowel cleansing was assessed by a blinded central reader (an experienced and trained colonoscopist) using the segmental scores of the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). Highly effective cleansing in the colon ascendens corresponded to scores 3 (Good) or 4 (Excellent) of the HCS. Adequate plus failure of cleansing corresponded to score 0-2. Comparison of 'Excellent plus good' cleansing of the colon ascendens using NER1006 versus SP+MS was evaluated using a non-inferiority study design.</description>

      <desc>Safety analyses were based on the safety population which included all randomized patients for whom it could not be ruled out (from their patient diary) that they received study drug at least once (n=476). The analyses are based on treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). There were no deaths and the serious TEAE was not related to treatment.</desc>
