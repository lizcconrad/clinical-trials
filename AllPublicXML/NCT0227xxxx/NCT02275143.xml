  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently patients with certain cancer usually have routine follow up (Computed Tomography of
      Thorax, Abdomen and Pelvis) CT TAP scans to see response to treatment or relapse. The study
      proposal allows the evaluation of the coronary arteries by modifying the current CT TAP
      technique without significant additional procedures, intravenous contrast or radiation - i.e.
      an opportunistic Computed Tomography Coronary Angiogram (CTCA) without any penalty. The
      question is does performing Computed Tomography (CT) of the thorax in such a way confer
      important additional information about cardiac risk? At the same time the investigators need
      to ensure that doing scan as per CTCA protocol produces equivalent image quality to evaluate
      other structures in the chest. A recent small retrospective study has using a similar
      technique suggests that it may in fact improve image quality due to less cardiac related
      motion artefact.

      The study is a non-inferiority observational study to primarily ensure that the Computed
      Tomography of Thorax, Abdomen and Pelvis (CT TAP) technique produces equivalent image quality
      of the lungs (hence the need to scan with both conventional technique and the
      Electrocardiograph [ECG] gated technique) and secondarily to evaluate the effectiveness of
      demonstrating the coronary arteries in this cohort of patients who have not received heart
      rate control.

    <description>All image data sets will be presented in blinded and randomized manner to two experienced consultant radiologists. Subjective image quality will be assessed in terms of subjective image noise, subjective image contrast, lesion conspicuity, diagnostic confidence and artefacts. The image quality attributes are taken from the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Computerized Tomography document and have been proven to be robust in comparing subjective image quality.</description>

    <description>The total exam dose-length product (DLP) displayed by the CT scanner at the end of each CTPA is recorded. The effective dose in mSv is calculated by multiplying the total DLP for each exam by the conversion coefficient for the chest of 0.014 (as taken from National Radiological Protection Board Document).</description>
