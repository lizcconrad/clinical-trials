      This is a study to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety of
      188Re-BMEDA-liposome in patient with primary solid tumor in advanced or metastatic stage.

    <textblock>
      Rhenium-188 is an ideal radionuclide for therapeutic use due to its maximum beta emission of
      2.12MeV, short physical half-life of 16.9 hours, and its 155-keV gamma emission for imaging
      purposes. 188Re-BMEDA-liposome consists of 2 separate components (Rhenium-188 and liposome)
      and BMEDA as a linker. This study aims to find the MTD, evaluate the safety, efficacy
      profiles and investigate the biodistribution, radioactivity and radiation dosimetry of
      188Re-BMEDA-liposome on primary solid tumor in metastatic stage patient by a single
      intravenous injection course.
