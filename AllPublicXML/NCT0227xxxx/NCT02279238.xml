  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of assessing the uphill walking capacity and to provide a functional stress test with
      better sensitivity the investigators need a short term functional stress test over the gold
      standard six minute walk test....

      To demonstrate the significance of 3 minutes ramp walk test over 6 minutes walk test as a
      functional stress test.

      The investigators hypothesize that the investigators three minutes ramp walk test (3MRWT)
      will be superior to the existing six minutes level walk test (6MWT) in the measurement of
      functional capacity of post valve replacement patients.

    <textblock>
      The patients who have undergone valve replacement surgeries face difficulty in their
      functional activities especially during climbing stairs, walking uphill.

      The six minute level walk test has been a gold standard in the assessment of functional
      capacity in cardio respiratory conditions like, coronary heart diseases , valvular heart
      diseases, chronic respiratory illness.

      Moreover, six minute walk test has been framed to assess the functional capacity in level
      walking.so far, no test have been developed to assess the functional capacity of the patients
      during uphill walking and stair climbing.

      Though ramp walking ( uphill walking) can be trained using treadmill, it is not feasible for
      the indian patients as they are not familiar in the treadmill and their fear may also show
      variation in the functional assessment.

      Hence this study has been proposed..

    <description>It is a cross over study in which the participants are assigned for two test simultaneously with washout time of 6 hrs . 5th POD patients are randomly assigned to either 6 minute walk test or 3 minute ramp walk test as first test with 6 hours of rest [Washout time] in between the two test.
6 MWT : The patient is instructed to walk for a period of 6 minute on a 30 meters Hallway with its extent being demarcated by the placement of 2 cones at the extremes of the Hall.
3 MRWT : The patient is instructed to walk for a period of 3 minute on a Ramp with an elevation of 30 degree and length of 20 meters with its extent being demarcated by the placement of 2 cones at the extremes of the ramp.
The data of [HR, SPO2, PSG RPE scale, Distance walked, BP] the participants are collected before, during and after the completion of each lap [according to American Thoracic Society [ATS] protocol].</description>
