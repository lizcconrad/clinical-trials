  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, four-arm lead-in safety and efficacy study in which AZD1775 will be
      combined in four separate treatment arms as follows: AZD1775 plus gemcitabine (Arm A);
      AZD1775 plus weekly paclitaxel (Arm B); AZD1775 plus carboplatin (Arm C); and AZD1775 plus
      PLD (Arm D). A subset of patients will be evaluated for the safety assessment of each
      treatment arm.

      The AZD1775 plus paclitaxel arm (Arm B) will enrol approximately 30 additional patients at
      selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that suggests
      clinical activity.

      In addition, the AZD1775 plus carboplatin arm (Arm C) will enrol approximately 23 patients
      overall at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data
      that suggests clinical activity.

      To further optimise the dosing schedule of AZD1775 in Arm C, a safety expansion arm (referred
      to as Arm C2) of approximately 12 additional patients will be enrolled at selected sites to
      explore emerging pre-clinical and clinical data that suggest that prolonged AZD1775 exposure
      may increase the clinical activity.
