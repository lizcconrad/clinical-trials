  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants experiencing recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms in this double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trial will receive either a commercially-available probiotic dietary
      supplement or placebo. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the probiotic
      dietary supplement group will experience greater improvement in their gastrointestinal
      symptoms than participants in the placebo group.

    <description>Trenev Trio® (healthcare professional line)/Healthy Trinity® (consumer line) is a dietary supplement that contains probiotics microenrobed in an oil matrix in a two-piece hard gel capsule. One capsule will be taken twice per day (am &amp; pm) offering a total daily serving of:
Lactobacillus acidophilus NAS super strain (10 billion Colony Forming Units [CFU])
Bifidobacterium bifidum Malyoth super strain (40 billion CFU)
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus LB-51 super strain (10 billion CFU)</description>

    <description>The placebo capsules utilized in this study will be indistinguishable from the probiotic dietary supplement capsules as they will be identical in appearance, odor, weight, and taste. Furthermore, the same sunflower oil matrix will be in both the probiotic dietary supplement and placebo. The only difference between the dietary supplement and placebo capsules will be the probiotic bacteria.</description>

             at least 2 of the following gastrointestinal symptoms: gas, indigestion, bloating,
             abdominal pain, or defecation irregularity as expressed on Likert scale (1=very minor
             or no discomfort, 2=minor discomfort, 3=moderate discomfort, 4=high discomfort, 5=very
             high discomfort) over the previous 3 weeks

          2. Agree to continue with typical diet and exercise habits during study

             ulcerative colitis), Celiac disease, active peptic ulcer, active diverticulitis, and
             other active cases of gastrointestinal diseases that, in the investigators' opinions,
             may affect participant safety.

          2. Current and documented diagnosis of any other non-gastrointestinal disease that, in

             malignancy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled autoimmune disease (lupus,
             rheumatoid arthritis, eczema), eating disorders, and any other active health condition

             participants in good health.

          3. Daily consumption of another probiotic supplement or new consumption of fermented
             dairy products (yogurt, kefir, etc.)
