  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the normal hemoglobin curve during cesarean
      delivery and for the first 24 hours after surgery to aid in the creation of an algorithm to
      detect life-threatening bleeding earlier.

    <textblock>
      Acute and life threatening blood loss is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality for
      pregnancy women in the US. To date, the only means we have of monitoring the amount of blood
      loss during a delivery is by the physician estimating the amount. This has been shown to not
      be very accurate and leads to confusion on when and how much a women should be transfused
      during a hemorrhage. New devices have been developed over the last few years to monitor blood
      levels in a accurate and non-invasive fashion. We aim here to use a non-invasive blood
      monitoring system to evaluate normal blood loss in women undergoing scheduled cesarean
      delivery. We hope that this will allow us to create a baseline that can be used in subsequent
      studies to identify women who are losing more blood than normal so that we may intervene
      faster and avoid unnecessary morbidity.
