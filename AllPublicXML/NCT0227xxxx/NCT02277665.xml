  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of persons seeking treatment for cannabis-use disorders (CUDs) regularly
      smoke tobacco. Combining tobacco with cannabis has become a common method of smoking
      cannabis. Similarities of use, and using together, can make quitting difficult. Stopping
      tobacco simultaneously with cannabis may be beneficial. Little scientific information
      currently addresses how to best target tobacco smoking during treatment for CUDs. Our
      long-term goal is to develop an effective protocol for intervening in tobacco smoking without
      changing cannabis outcomes.

      This protocol reflects the planned Stage 1, proof-of-concept study that will compare a
      combined cannabis and tobacco intervention to one that targets CUD only. Hypotheses assert
      that the intervention (1) will be accepted by the majority of eligible participants (2) will
      result in more tobacco quit attempts and rates than the CUD-only treatment; and (3) will not
      adversely affect cannabis outcomes. Last, the project will evaluate the potential of specific
      moderators of outcomes to predict outcomes and inform subsequent treatment development
      efforts. If the hypotheses were confirmed, dissemination of this protocol would reduce
      adverse psychosocial and health consequences of tobacco or cannabis dependence. Findings will
      inform future development of prevention and intervention strategies.
