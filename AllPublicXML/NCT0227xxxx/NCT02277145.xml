  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is one of the main means for treating malignant tumor, during which
      radioactive lung injury is inevitable. Currently there is nearly no effective clinical
      treatment for late post-radiotherapy pulmonary fibrosis. This study intends to carry out an
      open, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial. During the treatment, the local
      lesions will be fully lavaged, and then clinical grade umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. After six-month
      observation, the investigators will initially evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      treatment by measuring two key indicators-the CT density histogram and the patients'
      self-evaluation, and one secondary indicator—the changes of TGF-β1 contents, both before and
      after the treatment. Meanwhile, the investigators will make a preliminary discuss about the
      possible immunomodulatory effects of the umbilical cord MSCs.

    <description>Different proportions will be assigned to the three indicators. The overall curative effect can be judged with scores ranging from 0 to100. Specific proportions are as follows: full scores of 50 points for image changes, 25 for self-efficacy evaluation and 25 for TGF-β1 content changes. The image changes can be classified into four levels: significant control, improved, stable, and progressive; the self-efficacy evaluation can also be classified into four levels: effective, improved, stable and invalid; the changes of TGF-β1 content will be classified into three levels: improved, stable, and progressive. The four levels will be scored on the ratio of 5:4:3:1, the three levels will be scored on the ratio of 5:3:1.</description>
