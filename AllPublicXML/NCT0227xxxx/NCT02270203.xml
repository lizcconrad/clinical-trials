      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of SI joint
      fusion using the iFuse Implant System in patients with degenerative sacroiliitis (DS) and/or
      sacroiliac joint disruptions (SD).

      Study Design: This study is extended follow-up from two ongoing multicenter prospective US
      clinical trials. All participants have already undergone the surgical procedure of interest
      (SI joint fusion with iFuse Implant System). The two ongoing trials are:

        -  SIFI:( Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with iFuse Implant System) a single-arm trial of patients
           with degenerative sacroiliitis or sacroiliac joint disruption who underwent iFuse
           placement, and

        -  INSITE(Investigation of Sacroiliac Fusion Treatment): a randomized clinical trial of the
           same patient population who underwent either non-surgical treatment or iFuse placement
