    <textblock>
      The study aims to test the effectiveness of a nurse-led psycho-education program based on
      motivational interviewing technique for Chinese patients with first-onset mental illness over
      a 12-month follow-up. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 180 Chinese
      patients with schizophrenia newly referred to one outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. They will
      be randomly assigned to either the eight-session nurse-led psycho-education program or usual
      psychiatric outpatient care (both n=90). The patients' general and mental health, illness
      insight, self-efficacy, services utilization, and hospitalization rates were measured at
      recruitment and one week, six months and 12 months post-intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of APNs in Hong Kong is in line with nursing development internationally.
      Since 2001, the Hospital Authority has appointed about 530 nurses as APNs, in whom about 50
      are in mental health practice. Five of these psychiatric APNs function independently and
      interdependently with other health care team members to excel to health educators and care
      coordinators with fulfilments in health assessment, education and care coordination for
      clients with noticeable mental health problems, being referred to psychiatric outpatient
      service. A structured one-to-one psycho-education program has been developed and trial run to
      provide early psychiatric and psychosocial intervention and support to the clients who have
      been triaged by the psychiatric nurses in two outpatient clinics in the Kowloon East Cluster
      as categorised as those who present noticeable mental symptoms but low risks of self-harm or
      violence. These clients are arranged to have their first psychiatrist consultation in the
      clinic within two to eight weeks following triage. Prior to the consultation appointment,
      they are referred to the psychiatric APN in the nurse-led clinic for providing further
      psychosocial health assessment and early intervention and psychological support. As estimated
      by the clinic staff, there are 60% of the clients (i.e. 60 cases per month) triaged and
      classified as such category in the two outpatient clinics.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the one-to-one, nurse-led psycho-education
      program provided by the psychiatric APN for those newly referred clients with mental health
      problems on improving their mental and emotional conditions, quality of life, and
      satisfaction with service, and on reducing their rates of hospitalization and default
      follow-up in two psychiatric outpatient clinics (OPD) in Kowloon East region of Hong Kong.

      Objectives of the study

        1. To investigate the effects of the nurse-led psycho-education program for newly referred
           clients with mental health problems triaged as Category 2 on improving their mental
           state, anxiety state, insight and treatment attitude, self-efficacy in life situations,
           general health, and utilisation of and satisfaction with mental health care services
           provided over a period of 12 months follow-up; and

        2. To investigate the effects of the nurse-led psycho-education program on reducing the
           clients' rate of hospitalization and default follow-up in the psychiatric OPD over the
           12-month follow-up.

    <description>The 11-item Insight and Treatment Attitudes Questionnaire was designed to measure patients' awareness of illness and insight into their needs for treatment for schizophrenia (McEvoy et al., 1989). Its items are rated on a 3-point scale (0=no insight; 1=partial insight; 2=good insight). The higher the score, the better is the patient's awareness of and insight into mental health problems, possibility of future illness, and willingness to receive treatments.</description>

    <description>The 10-item Perceived Self-efficacy Scale developed by Jerusalem and Schwarzer in 1992 was translated into Chinese by Zhang and Schwarzer (1995). It is a unidimensional, generic measure of one's competence in the management of challenging and stressful encounters in life situations. ). The items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1=absolutely correct to 4=absolutely incorrect), with a total score ranging from 10-40.</description>

Items are structured in four domains, including physical health, psychological, social relationship, and environment (i.e., 7 items for each subscale). They are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with a high score indicating a better quality of life (total score range 28-140).</description>
