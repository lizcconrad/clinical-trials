  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although numerous studies have demonstrated that a high percentage of primary care providers
      (PCPs) are knowledgeable about the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for managing
      ADHD, many fail to implement these guidelines correctly. The goal of this project is to
      increase the use of evidence-based practices (EBP) for assessing and treating children with
      ADHD between 5 and 12 years in the context of primary care practice. This randomized
      controlled trial will evaluate the whether a 3-part intervention (education about ADHD
      management and communication training, collaborative consultation, and performance feedback
      regarding use of EBPs) is effective in improving EBP use among primary care providers.

    <description>The SPA intervention will last for 8 months for each study arm (first 8 months of the study for the intervention group, last 8 months for the control group). The intervention includes 3 components: 1) a series of web-based educational presentations to provide education to providers about evidence-based practice for managing ADHD and strategies for promoting effective communication with families 2) Collaborative consultation designed to address clinical issues arising in practice will be provided by members of the study team.
3) Providers will be given systematic performance feedback with regard to their use of evidence-based practices for ADHD every 2 months during the 8-month intervention period.</description>
