  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of hunger is a source of comfort for patients after general anesthesia. Moreover,
      this aspect of post-operative period is often required for discharging patients from hospital
      after ambulatory surgery. Indeed, this item is part of a multi-parameter score (Chung score)
      whose validation evaluates patient's ability to return home.

      The impact of anesthetics on hunger is largely unknown but few studies suggest an orexigenic
      effect of propofol compared to halogenated gases. These studies had neither the power nor the
      methodology to answer the question. The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of
      propofol versus sevoflurane on early recovery of hunger after ambulatory surgery.
