    <textblock>
      This is an interventional phase I clinical study to investigate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of HER2-derived peptide vaccination. HLA-A2+ patients with stage IV metastasized
      breast or gastric cancer with HER2 expression (IHC Score 2+) without gene amplification
      proved by FISH analysis, with documented stable disease or objective response after at least
      first line systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy for advanced disease who have not been treated
      for the underlying malignant disease for 4 weeks with chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy will be
      included into the study. The aim of the study is to show safety and tolerability of this
      immunotherapeutic approach and to investigate efficacy of the immunotherapy.
