    <textblock>
      A 4 week double blinded parallel design with an intervention condition and a control
      condition will be employed. After having completed screening procedure and a baseline test
      day, participants will be randomized to either intervention or control condition. In the
      following 4 weeks, the participants will have to consume the distributed food product daily
      before completing another test day.
