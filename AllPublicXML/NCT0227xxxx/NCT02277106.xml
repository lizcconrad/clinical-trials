  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 is a double-blind, proof-of-concept study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and efficacy of SAGE-547 Injection in male and female patients with
      essential tremor in the upper limb.

      Stage 2 is an open-label arm designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and
      effeciveness of SAGE-547 Injection at a higher dose than in Stage 1. Subjects who completed
      Stage 1 will be invited to participate in Stage 2.
