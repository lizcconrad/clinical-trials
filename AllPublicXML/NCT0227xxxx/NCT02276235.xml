    <textblock>
      The aim of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the
      therapeutic effects of acupoint stimulation by catgut embedding on complexion, quality of
      life, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, and obesity-related hormone peptide of obese
      women.

    <textblock>
      We will recruit 90 females aged from 16 year-old to 65 year-old with body mass index(BMI)
      27㎞/㎡ and waist circumference≧80cm. After inform consent, they will be randomly assigned into
      two groups. In group A, catgut embedding will be applied to six acupuncture points on the
      abdomen including Qihai (Ren-6), Shuifen (REN-9), bilateral shuidao (ST-28) and Siman
      (ST-26), which have been proved to be effective on obesity in our previous study, once each
      week for six times. In group B, sham catgut embedding will be applied on the same acupoints
      once each week for six weeks. This trial will go on for six weeks with six course of
      treatment.

      Our primary outcome measurements is complexion which included body mass index(BMI),waist
      circumstances, and waist-hip ratio. In our second outcome measurments, we will evaluate the
      life quality of these patients using 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) which developed
      for the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) and also using questionnaire of quality of life that was
      designated by World Health Organization. We will also classify the patients by questionnaire
      designed for TCM syndrome of obesity. We will check blood test included lipid profile (TG,
      Chol, HDL-C, LDL-C), inflammatory markers, and hormone peptide related to obesity such as
      insulin,leptin,ghrelin,adiponectin. Each enrolling patients will be evaluated at the baseline
      before treatment and after 6 times treatments completed by above parameters to find out the
      therapeutic effects and mechanism of catgut embedding in acupoints in obese women.

    <description>An extensive form of acupuncture that involves weekly infixing self-absorptive chromic catgut sutures into acupoints with a specialised needle under antiseptic precautions. The catgut then stimulate those points over a long period. The stainless-steel acupuncture needles (3.8cm long) was inserted into 23 gouge needle as plunger with chromic catgut in front of the syringe needle. Catgut will be embedding in acupoints as below.
