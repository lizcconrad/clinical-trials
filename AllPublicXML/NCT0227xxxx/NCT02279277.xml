      In this study, the investigators are investigating the effects of physical therapy (PT) for
      treating high grade knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients that are candidates for total knee
      replacement. Through the examination of patient outcomes, such as pain, stiffness, and
      physical function, the investigators will determine if PT prior to total knee replacement is
      an effective treatment in a patient with high grade OA.
