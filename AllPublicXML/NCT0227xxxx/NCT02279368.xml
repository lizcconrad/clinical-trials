  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Northern India, skewed sex ratios, female feticide and higher child mortality rates for
      girls have become serious concern. The female child mortality as a result of son preference
      have increased during the last several decades. Since families cannot know the sex of the
      fetus due to Indian government policies, they now 'neglect' girl child to ensure there are
      few survivors. Survival chances of second and third daughters are plunging neglecting
      healthcare and nutrition has become tool for death as 'good riddance'.
