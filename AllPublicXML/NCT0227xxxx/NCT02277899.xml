  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine communication content and strategies in primary
      care that predict improvement in weight status among overweight school-age children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test whether 1) pediatrician-patient communication regarding overweight status,
      behavior/risk-factor counseling, and the frequency and time to next follow-up visit, compared
      with either no communication or incomplete communication (communicating only high weight
      status without behavior/risk-factor counseling or a follow-up visit) will predict improvement
      in weight status at one year follow-up, and 2) during pediatrician-patient communication
      regarding weight and weight management, higher patient-centeredness will predict improvement
      in weight status at one year follow-up. The communication content identified will generate
      new information about the most effective content and style of pediatrician-patient
      communication that predict weight-status improvement. Because we prospectively will examine
      clinical practice elements in the one-year interval between well-child visits, acknowledging
      that communication regarding high weight status may initiate assessment of risk factors for
      heart disease (such as high cholesterol and blood sugar), more frequent follow-up visits, or
      prompt a nutrition referral, we will generate novel information about the most effective
      clinical practices and follow-up interval and frequency that predict weight-status
      improvement in overweight children. We also will examine if the content and style of
      communication are related to improvements in diet and lifestyle behaviors at one-year
      follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent overweight</measure>
    <time_frame>From recorded well-child visit to next well-child visit, approximately 12 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The percent over the median BMI percentile for age and gender. This measure changes comparably for similar weight changes in overweight and severely-obese children. In contrast, an overweight child would have to lose substantially less weight than a severely-obese child for the same change in BMI z-score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BMI z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>From recorded well-child visit to next well-child visit, approximately 12 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Change in BMI z-score of 0.25-0.5 has been associated with reductions in cardiovascular-disease risk factors. Using both percent overweight and BMI z-score measures will allow examination of the relationship between relative weight changes and cardiovascular-disease risk-factor improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the number of &quot;5-2-1-0&quot; behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>From recorded well-child visit to next well-child visit, approximately 12 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;5-2-1-0&quot; behaviors are: eat five fruits and vegetables, watch &quot;screens&quot; (TV, computer, tablets, video games, cell phones, etc…) two hours per day or less, be physically active for one hour per day or more, and drink zero calorie-containing beverages per day.</description>

    <description>Overweight 6-12 year-old children. Weight status will be measured and parents complete surveys at baseline and one year later. Pediatricians will complete surveys at baseline, and after index visit. Visits will be directly video-recorded.
The impact of pediatrician clinical practices and communication strategies on child's weight status will be evaluated at one year. Clinical practices (such as risk-factor screening) that occur during the 1-year interval between well-child visits also will be assessed. Specific clinical practice elements and communication strategies that will be examined include:
Communication regarding child's high weight status
Counseling regarding cardiovascular risk factor screening and assessment
Behavioral counseling
Interval follow-up to readdress weight, and
Patient-centeredness, scored as the ratio of patient to doctor-centered communication regarding weight topics.</description>

    <intervention_name>Patient-centered communication</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient-centered communication will be scored as the ratio of patient to doctor-centered communication regarding weight topics. Means will be calculated for total and weight-communication-specific pediatrician, child, and parent-talk time, and patient, doctor, and the ratio of patient/doctor-centered communication scores. For the primary hypothesis, biomedical information-giving (for example, risk-factor communication) will be treated as patient-centered because the principal investigator's focus groups suggest that parents want this information, and prior research suggests that including biomedical-information giving improves the correlation of Roter's patient-centeredness measure with patient health status and satisfaction scores.</description>

        We will recruit pediatricians (from academic, community, and private practices), children,
        and a consenting parent. Pediatricians and children will be selected to reflect the
        proportions of minority pediatricians and children in the practices. Pediatricians at the
        community and private practices will be eligible to participate if they provide outpatient
        pediatric care ≥20 hours/week. At the academic clinic, only second and third-year residents
        will be eligible. Eighty-five children and a consenting parent will be recruited.
