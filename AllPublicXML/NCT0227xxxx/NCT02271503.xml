  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, rater-blinded, multicenter, 3-treatment, 3 period,
      single-dose crossover study. Approximately 51 qualified immediate-release (IR)
      CD-LD-experienced advanced Parkinson's disease patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 dosing
      sequences.

      Objectives:

        -  Assess the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IPX203 (carbidopa and levodopa)
           in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease.

        -  Characterize the safety of IPX203 in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPX203 contains two different drugs called levodopa and carbidopa in one capsule.

        -  levodopa turns into a material called 'dopamine' in your brain. The dopamine helps to
           improve the symptoms of your Parkinson's disease.

        -  carbidopa belongs to a group of medicines called 'aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
           inhibitors'. It helps levodopa work more effectively by slowing the speed at which
           levodopa is broken down in your body.
