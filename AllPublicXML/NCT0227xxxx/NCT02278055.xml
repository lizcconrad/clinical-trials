  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if Radium-223 is effective in reducing cancer pain
      within 12 weeks of treatment. In order to see if Radium-223 is effective, the patient's level
      of pain will be followed throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males aged 18 years of age and above

          -  Castrate serum testosterone level: ≤50 ng/dL (≤1.7 nmol/L)

          -  Patients who have experienced disease progression despite initial hormonal therapy,
             either by orchiectomy or by using a GnRH agonist in combination with an anti-androgen,
             must first progress through anti- androgen withdrawal prior to being eligible. The
             minimum time frame to document failure of anti-androgen withdrawal will be four weeks.
             Patients on second-line (or beyond) hormonal maneuvers, and patients who had no PSA
             decline on combined androgen blockade as first line therapy, need not progress through
             AAW in order to be eligible.

          -  Known progressive castration-resistant disease, defined as:

               -  Serum PSA progression defined as two consecutive increases in PSA over a previous
                  reference value within 6 months of first treatment, each measurement at least one
                  week apart. Serum PSA at screening ≥ 2 ng/mL or

               -  Documented appearance of new lesions by bone scintigraphy

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2 2 or more bone metastases demonstrated on bone
             scintigraphy

          -  Pain at baseline as measured by a BPI worst pain score average of ≥ 3. The BPI worst
             pain score average will be based on the worst pain scores completed by the patient in
             the 7 consecutive pretreatment days. A minimum of 4 days of pain scores must be
             completed by the patient in the 7 day window in order to calculate the average worst
             pain score. The investigator will optimize the subject's pain regimen prior to study
             entry.

          -  Normal organ function with acceptable initial laboratory values:

               -  WBC ≥ 3 x 109 /L

             [Note: Ongoing grade 2 neuropathy as a result of treatment with a cytotoxic
             chemotherapy regimen is permitted]

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the
             release of personal health information NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be either
             included in the informed consent or obtained separately

          -  Willing and able to comply with the protocol, including follow-up visits, examinations
