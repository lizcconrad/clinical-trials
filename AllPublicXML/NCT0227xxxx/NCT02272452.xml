  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main ambition of this project is to develop, and provide the medical community, an
      innovative method to analyze extemporaneously, during a neurosurgery operation, excised
      tissues. This method is based on the analysis of the metabolic profile of excised tissues by
      the technique of High-Resolution Magic-Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
      (NMR) spectroscopy. Indeed HRMAS NMR method can provide in a sufficiently short time lapse
      (currently about 30 minutes but within our project a time lapse of 15 min or even less is
      ultimately intended), medical information that can complement those obtained by classic
      histological examination.

      Primary purpose:

      The main objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity of HRMAS NMR spectroscopy in
      detecting residual tumor infiltration at the brain resection cavity. The investigators aim to
      determine the relevance of the metabolic analysis compared to histological analysis during a
      neurosurgery operation. This involves analyzing excised tissue samples, obtained from the
      operating rooms of Strasbourg University Hospitals, and Colmar Hospital Center, with no
      return to neurosurgeon for surgery.

      Secondary purposes:

      The secondary objectives of the protocol are to investigate the metabolome of different types
      of brain tumors, in order to find prognostic and diagnostic markers. It consists in detecting
      metabolomic factors of bad prognosis, and potential marker of good prognosis such as the IDH
      mutation.

        Under the &quot; ExtempoRMN &quot;project, we propose to focus on primary brain tumors mainly gliomas
        that include: Glioblastomas, the low-grade oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade II) and high grade
        (WHO grade III), Astrocytomas. Normality will be obtained by analysis of control brain
        tissues from epilepsy surgery. Study population for this project is all the patients of
        department of neurosurgery of Strasbourg University Hospitals and Colmar Hospital center,
        for whom a neurosurgical operation is programmed before inclusion in this study, and who
        meets inclusion criteria.
