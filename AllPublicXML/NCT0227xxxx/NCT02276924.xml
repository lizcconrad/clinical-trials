  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper Urinary Tract Tumors have an incidence of 1 to 2 cases for 100 000 persons per year.
      The standard treatment for these tumors is the ablation of the kidney, ureter and a part of
      the bladder surrounding the ureteral orifice. The development of new diagnosis and treatment
      techniques through natural routes opens the possibility to use conservative treatments. The
      investigators hypothesis is that during a reno-ureteroscopy, laser confocal microscopy will
      allow the discrimination between normal and pathologic urothelium by microscopic analysis.
      This will prevent the systematic use of biopsies which are often difficult and iatrogenic.

      The objective of the present study is to assess contribution of laser confocal microscopy in
      diagnosing of upper urinary tract tumors during a reno-uteroscopy compared to analysing of
      architectural elements (vascular characteristics, organization) and cellular (morphology,
      cohesion, border).

    <description>According to Chang's reference criteria, we will define the urothelial microarchitecture (normal, papillary, inflammatory, low grade lesion, high grade lesion, in situ carcinoma). The diagnostic relevance of the MCL (absence or presence of the lesion) will be compare to the reference tests calculating sensibility, specificity and predictive values</description>
