  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) mutations are exquisitely sensitive to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) which is widely used in advanced patients. Whether treatment
      with EGFR-TKIs improves outcomes in patients with resected NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations is
      still under investigated. This study aims to observe and compare the efficacy and safety of
      intercalated combination of chemotherapy plus icotinib in patients undergoing resection of
      EGRF mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer stagingⅠB (with high risk factor) to ⅢA.
