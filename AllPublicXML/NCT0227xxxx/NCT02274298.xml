  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial will test the impact of feedback and a
      toolkit aimed at improving the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the primary care
      setting. This trial will use family physicians in Ontario participating in the Electronic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will use family physicians in Ontario participating in the Electronic Medical
      Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD) and receiving the System for Audit and
      Feedback to Improve caRE (SAFIRE) along with other decision support tools. Performance on CKD
      quality indicators for family physicians receiving the CKD feedback and tools will be
      compared to physicians not receiving the CKD feedback or tools.
