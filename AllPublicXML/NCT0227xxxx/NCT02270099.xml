    <textblock>
      This clinical performance study is being conducted to evaluate the performance of the Aptima
      Herpes Simplex Viruses 1 &amp; 2 assay for detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1)
      and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) in swab samples prospectively collected from suspected HSV lesions.
      Specimens collected using swabs from viral transport medium (VTM)collection kits and Aptima
      swab collection kits will be evaluated.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima HSV 1 &amp; 2 assay will be determined by comparing assay results to results from a reference method representing the true infected status of the subjects. Sensitivity will be reported as the percentage of subjects with an HSV infection who test positive by the Aptima HSV 1 &amp; 2 assay. Specificity will be reported as the percentage of subjects without an HSV infection who test negative by the Aptima HSV 1 &amp; 2 assay.</description>

        Male and female subjects attending participating US collection sites and presenting with
        suspected HSV lesion(s) will be eligible for the study. Sites may include family planning,
        general practice, dermatology, research, sexually transmitted infection, adolescent, and
        public health clinics. There are no age restrictions for this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has at least 1 active lesion (lesion with exudates and cellular material;
             eg, vesicle, ulcer) that is suspected to be caused by HSV (as determined by the
             clinician)

          -  The subject and/or legally authorized representative is willing and able to provide
             consent prior to study participation (a minor will need the documented consent of
             his/her parent or legal guardian, unless the site has an institutional review
             board-approved waiver for parental consent for minors)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has only HSV lesions without exudates and cellular material

          -  The subject used a topical or oral antiviral medication used to treat HSV within 21
             days of enrollment

          -  Subject already participated in this study

          -  Subject has a history of illness that the principal investigator (PI) or designee
             considers could interfere with or affect the conduct, results, and/or completion of
             the study

          -  Subject has a history of illness that the PI or designee considers could create an
             unacceptable risk to the subject if enrolled in the study
