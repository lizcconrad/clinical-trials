      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a PU prevention programme for for-profit
      private nursing homes

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, which will
      compare the efficacy of a PU prevention programme versus usual PU prevention for older people
      in eight for-profit private nursing homes in Hong Kong. For-profit private NHs recruited will
      be randomly assigned as experimental or control groups. The nursing homes in the experimental
      group will be implemented a PU prevention programme. The programme includes a training course
      which was tailor-made for health workers(HWs) and persona care workers (PCWs) and also a
      16-week PU prevention protocol. The outcome measures are incidence and prevalence rate of PUs
      as well as level of PU knowledge and skill among care staff in the nursing homes. In data
      analysis, survival analysis will be adopted for identifying PU incidence and prevalence rate.
      GEE will be used to analyze the time and effect differences of PU knowledge and skills among
      the care staff between two groups.

    <description>The two RAs will inspect the skin of each residents three times a week to detect the first PUs ( those detected on residents without PUs) and the new PUs (those detected on residents already suffering from PUs), starting from one day before the staff training to the end of the protocol implementation (. The numbers, locations, and stages of the PUs detected will be recorded in the PU incidence form. The PU incidence will be then summed up for three periods of time as following. T0 to T1: one day before the commencement of the training course (T0) to the day immediately before the commencement of the protocol implementation (T1) .T1 to T2: the day immediately before the commencement of the protocol implementation (T1) to the eighth week after the commencement of the protocol implementation (T2).T2 to T3: the eighth week after the commencement of the protocol implementation (T2) to the sixteenth week of protocol implementation (T3).</description>
