    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of E7090 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This study will be
      conducted in 2 parts:

        1. Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of this study to determine the maximum
           tolerated dose in subjects with solid tumors, and

        2. Part 2 will comprise cohort expansions to further characterize the safety and
           tolerability of E7090 and to assess preliminary efficacy of E7090 in subjects with solid
           tumors characterized by genetic abnormalities in FGF/FGFR pathway.

    <description>Tumor assessment (target lesion, non-target lesion, and presence or absence of new lesion) will be performed based on RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors). Tumor marker will also be measured. FDG-PET CT (fluorodeoxyglucose- Positron emission tomography computed tomography) will also be evaluated. Best overall response are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progression of disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE), where SD have to be achieved at &gt;= 7 weeks after first dose.</description>

    <description>Oral, starting dose 1 mg once a day, dose escalation in part 1. Cycle 0 is for 7 days. For Cycle 1 and onward, each cycle is 28 days long. The Cycle 0 is set up for PK analysis of a single dose of E7090. In the following Cycle 1, subjects will be administered E7090 QD, and the PK and safety will be assessed for 28 days. One or two doses may be selected from part 1 for Part 2. E7090 will be administered continuously once a daily. Subjects can continue treatment unless they meet discontinuation criteria.</description>
