    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients who receive an email reinforcing their
      discharge instructions after being discharged from the emergency department will have an
      affect on follow-up care with their primary physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is treated in the emergency department (ED), they experience a whirlwind of
      care involving multiple diagnostics and treatments. They are often discharged home with
      instructions to follow up with their primary care physician. This follow up care is crucial
      to ensuring optimal patient outcomes and re-establishing continuity of care. Despite efforts
      to communicate clearly and effectively, ED patients often have difficulty understanding their
      follow-up care instructions. Several different methods have been employed to attempt to
      improve the follow-up rates after emergency department care, including providing patients
      with an easily read, printed copy of discharge instructions, having a nurse or mid-level
      provider call patients days after discharge from the ED to ensure that they understood
      discharge instructions. One medium for communication that has become increasingly relevant in
      recent years is electronic mail (email). Because of its pervasiveness and relative ease of
      use, email offers a potentially valuable resource for augmenting and improving communication
      between physicians and patients. This study will assess whether an email reminder with follow
      up instructions one day after ED visit occurs will increase follow up rates and timely follow
      up rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients triaged to category 2, 3, and 4 and placed in a room for care at St.
             Joseph Mercy Hospital-Ann Arbor Emergency Department 2. Primarily English speaking. 3.
             &gt;18 years of age 4. Have a primary physician who is part of Integrated Health
             Associates 5. Have access to an email account

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients triaged to category 1 or 5 placed in a room at Stl Joseph Mercy
             Hospital-Ann Arbor (category 1 patients are not typically discharged home from the
             hospital. Category 5 patients could potentially be interfered with if attempting
             implementation of the communication instrument. Category 5 patients are typically very
             straightforward visits with minimal requirement for follow-up appointments) 2.
             Patients &lt; age 18 3. Prisoners or institutionalized persons 4. Patients with a
             mental-health related chief complaint 5. Not primarily English speaking (the potential
             language barriers could interfere with ability to communicate via email which will be
             written in English) 6. Under temporary or permanent custodianship (used as a surrogate
             for ongoing lack of mental competence or consciousness) 7. Prior participation in this
             study. (A patient may only participate once).
