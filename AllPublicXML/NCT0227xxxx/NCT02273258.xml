      The total study duration for a screened subject will be about 3 - 8 weeks (min-max duration,
      excl. screening)

        -  Screening: 2 to 28 days (D -28 to D -2)

        -  Treatment period 1 - 3: 2 days (1 overnight stay)

        -  Washout: 5 - 18 days (preferentially 7 days between consecutive dosing)

        -  End-of-study visit: 1 day between D 5 and D14 after last administration of
           investigational product.
