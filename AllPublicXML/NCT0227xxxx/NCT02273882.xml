      Purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical, humanistic and health economic burden of
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in infants born 29 to 35 Weeks Gestational Age (wGA)
      hospitalized for RSV at up to 12 months of age.

      This surveillance study will enroll approximately 500 eligible infants from approximately 40
      study sites in the US, hospitalized for laboratory-confirmed, nosocomial or
      community-acquired RSV disease during the study eligibility period of 1 October 2014 through
      30 April 2015 (Season 1) and 1 October 2015 through 30 April 2016 (Season 2). During these
      eligibility periods, infants may be enrolled:

        -  Prospectively at the time of their index Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization
           (RSVH) admission or any time prior to their index RSVH discharge, or

        -  Retrospectively on the basis of electronic medical record (EMR) review following
           discharge from the index RSVH.

      Regardless of the timing of study enrollment (i.e., in relation to the date of discharge from
      the index RSVH), sites will identify all infants eligible for study participation, including
      those treated in the inpatient ward and intensive care unit (ICU). Identification of all
      potentially eligible infants will be ensured through the review of the EMR, or other local
      healthcare database deemed appropriate for study purposes by the Study Coordinating Center
      (SCC).

      The clinical, humanistic and health economic outcomes associated with the RSV disease will be
      characterized in the outpatient and inpatient settings, from the onset of symptoms of RSV
      disease pre index RSVH to up to 4 months post index RSVH discharge date (additionally to 12
      months post index RSVH discharge date in Season 1 only), on the basis of medical records and
      Parent/Guardian self-report. Information regarding any sequelae associated with the index
      RSVH, medically-attended wheezing episodes, loss of work productivity and healthcare resource
      utilization (HRU) related to the management of RSV-related disease will also be collected
      from the medical records and Parent/Guardian by telephone interview at approximately 1 month
      and 4 months following discharge from the index RSVH (additionally at 12 months in Season 1
      only).
