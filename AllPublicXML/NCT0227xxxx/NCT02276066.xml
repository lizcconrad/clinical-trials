  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the mechanism by which kidney dysfunction perpetuates inflammation,
      immunosuppression, and catabolism (PICS) in chronic critical illness. The investigators will
      test the hypothesis that persistent kidney dysfunction in sepsis associated by chronic
      critical illness contributes to decreased survival through the development of PICS. In
      chronic critical illness, the persistence of the inflammatory state may lead to capillary
      rarefication in the kidney causing accelerated chronic kidney disease. Progression of chronic
      kidney disease during chronic critical illness can drive PICS. Indeed, many of the features
      of chronic critical illness are consistent with the protein-energy malnutrition and muscle
      wasting associated with chronic kidney disease. Thus, the kidney can play a contributory role
      in chronic critical illness and PICS.

      The main goal of this project is to measure kidney filtration function at day 14 or the day
      of discharge from hospital (whichever occurs first), in order to determine the presence and
      magnitude of persistent kidney dysfunction after sepsis episode and to longitudinally assess
      further decline of kidney function at one year follow-up. The measure of the glomerular
      filtration rate (GRF) in patients with chronic critical illness and controls (sepsis patients
      discharged from ICU before day 14) will be used to determine to what degree of kidney
      dysfunction contributes to decreased survival and increase in chronic kidney disease at year
      one after sepsis onset.

      One and/or all of the three ways for GFR assessment will be used, both at approximately day
      14 or approximately at the day of discharge from the ICU and at the one year follow up :

        1. Determine clearance of Iohexol from blood after Iohexol injection and/or

        2. Determine apperance of Iohexol in urine after Iohexol injection (this would be the same
           injection as in one, and would not require two injections) and/or

        3. A timed urine collection to determine clearance of urea and creatinine and/or

        4. Estimated GFR using calculations with serum creatinine and cystatin C,

      This will provide an opportunity to validate the different measurements.
