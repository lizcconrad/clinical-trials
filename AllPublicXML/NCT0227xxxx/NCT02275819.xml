  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study being conducted to better understand the impact of exercise training
      on changes on the structure and function of the heart. Exercise training in patients with
      heart failure has been shown to be beneficial at decreasing symptoms of heart failure and
      improving overall functional capacity or capacity to exercise. However the mechanisms
      responsible for this are still unclear. This study will look specifically at how exercise
      creates changes within the hearts filling ability, the hearts pumping strength as well as the
      hearts ability to rebuild.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of systolic heart failure (HF) is high among the growing population of older
      adults. Progressive cardiac remodeling and deteriorating cardiac output have been implicated
      as key factors underlying HF-related exercise intolerance and quality of life. Even after
      implementing medical and device therapies that moderate remodeling, exercise tolerance
      remains impaired. While exercise training has been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity,
      mechanisms facilitating this benefit remain unclear. Peripheral adaptations in the skeletal
      muscle and vasculature provide at least some benefit, however reverse cardiac remodeling
      (beyond effects of pharmacological and device therapies) may be additive. The investigators
      propose to study the impact of 2 different types of exercise on cardiac morphology as well as
      systolic and diastolic performance and related functional gains. The investigators will
      compare traditional aerobic training to a novel regimen of inspiratory muscle training (IMT).
      IMT is a specific type of exercise training that may be particularly useful for frail,
      infirmed HF patients who are unlikely to tolerate aerobic training. Effects of IMT on
      remodeling have not been previously studied.

      The proposed echocardiography pilot study builds on a funded VA Merit F0834-R &quot;Exercise
      Therapy to Reduce Heart Failure Symptoms; Sorting Mechanisms of Benefit&quot; (Exercise therapy)
      PI, Forman that compares different modes of exercise training in older (age 50yrs) systolic
      (EF 45%) HF patients. The original study assesses peripheral mechanisms affected by exercise
      training, but was not designed to assess cardiac remodeling. The proposed pilot study
      provides a vital complementary analysis, i.e., it adds assessments of cardiac remodeling as
      well as related changes in systolic and diastolic performance.

        75 male and female HFrEF patients with mild-moderate symptoms while on optimal medical
        therapy will be enrolled. The data collected from this pilot study will be used for
        building future research. HF diagnosis will be contingent on a previous hospitalization for
        HF or physician assessment of HF associated with systolic dysfunction (left ventricular
        ejection fraction [LVEF] =40%).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III for the previous three months
             despite a minimum of 6 weeks of optimal treatment.

          -  Age &gt;50 years.

          -  LVEF&lt;45% (by echocardiogram or radionucleotide imaging study within 6 months of
             enrollment). If a patient has initiated or received any therapy that might improve the

             dose of these therapies. Additionally the LVEF of &lt;45% will be confirmed with a brief
             echocardiogram prior to randomization. If LVEF is not 45%, the patient will not be
             enrolled in to the study.

          -  Optimal therapy according to the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of
             Cardiology (ACC) and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Heart Failure (HF)
             guidelines, including treatment with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor
             (or an angiotensin receptor blocker) and beta-blocker therapy (for at least 6 weeks),
             or have documented reason for variation, including medication intolerance,
             contraindication, patient preference, or personal physician's judgment.
