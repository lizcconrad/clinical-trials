  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone and muscle losses occur during ageing leading to increased risk of osteoporosis (there
      are more than 200 million people affected by osteoporosis worldwide), sarcopenia, loss of
      functionality and mobility. From around 45-50 years onwards, there is a progressive loss of
      muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). This is partially due to an impairment of muscle
      protein synthesis in response to dietary proteins. Insufficient dietary protein may
      contribute to age-related loss of lean body mass (LBM) and strength which ultimately affects
      body movement.

      Key ingredients in selected investigational product are:Milk proteins, Calcium, Vitamin D,
      Vitamin C, Glucosamine Sulfate, Zinc. They have effects to improve physical mobility and
      functionality. The investigators expect improved effects of a nutritional intervention
      combined with a physical activity program on mobility in healthy aging subjects with joint
      discomfort.
