  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg
      doses of mifepristone against a placebo in women with laparoscopic diagnostic of
      endometriosis.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the 5 mg mifepristone dose is safe and effective and
      should be used in future studies on medical treatment of endometriosis.

      This is double-blind randomized clinical trial.

      Examinations undertaken Thorough gynecological examination, pelvic ultrasound examination,
      diagnostic laparoscopy before starting treatment in order to determine the localization,
      extent and degree of severity of the endometrial lesions and a score was assigned in
      accordance with the revised American Fertility Society (AFS) classification.19 Blood samples
      were taken for hematological tests and hepatic function. Endometrial biopsy was performed if
      endometrial thickness as calibrated by ultrasound was &gt;8 mm or if there had been abnormal
      bleeding in the past 3 months. After 90 and 180 days of treatment an ultrasound examination
      of the pelvis was carried out and then followed by diagnostic-therapeutic laparoscopy and
      endometrial biopsy.

      Subjects Women with laparoscopic confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis who volunteered to take
      part in the study. Inclusion criteria: a) age between 18 and 45, b) certain diagnosis of
      endometriosis of any degree corresponding to the American Fertility Society (AFS); c)
      patients with symptoms of endometriosis: dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain not attributable to
      other gynecological illness and d) acceptance of the use of barrier contraceptive methods
      during the study. Exclusion criteria: a) breastfeeding, b) hormonal or surgical treatment for
      the endometriosis less than 4 months previous to study, c) diabetes, d) severe arterial
      hypertension, e) hepatopathy, f) renal malfunction, g) endocrinopathy, and f) any other
      contraindication regarding the use of antiprogestins.
