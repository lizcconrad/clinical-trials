  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor genotyping has become an essential biomarker for the care of advanced lung cancer and
      melanoma, and is currently used to identify patients for treatment with targeted kinase
      inhibitors like erlotinib and vemurafenib. However, tumor genotyping can be slow and
      cumbersome, and is limited by availability of tumor biopsy tissue for testing. The aim of
      this study is to prospectively evaluate a blood-based genotyping tool that can quantify the
      presence of oncogenic mutations (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF) in patients with lung cancer and melanoma.
      This assay is being studied both as a diagnostic tool for classifying patient genotype, and a
      serial measurement tool for quantification of response and progression on therapy.
