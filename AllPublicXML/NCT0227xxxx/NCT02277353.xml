  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NICOM® is a recently developed noninvasive cardiac output monitoring device, and indices
      derived from NICOM® such as SVV has been reported to predict fluid responsiveness in the
      previous studies. However, its usefulness in prone positioning has not been investigated.
      Thus, the aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the usefulness of stroke
      volume variation (SVV) derived from NICOM® to predict fluid responsiveness in prone patients
      undergoing spine surgery.
