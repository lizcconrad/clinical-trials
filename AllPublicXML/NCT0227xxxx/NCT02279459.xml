  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to investigate
      changes in tumor iodine concentration in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
      (HNSCC). Dual-energy computerized tomography could easily replace a standard CT neck with the
      added benefit of providing functional information that would only be possible with advanced
      computerized tomography perfusion, magnetic resonance diffusion (MRI) or positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging techniques.

    <textblock>
      Patients with head and/or neck tumors routinely have head and neck imaging completed with a
      computerized tomography scan, commonly called a CT scan. A CT scan combines a series of x-ray
      views that are taken from many different angles and uses computer processing to create
      cross-sectional images inside your body. These cross-sectional images are very thin slices,
      often less than 1 mm thick and allow the radiologist to examine parts of your tissue very
      closely.

      Dual energy computed tomography (DECT) is a fairly new technology that uses both the normal
      x-ray and also a second less powerful x-ray to make the images. The Ottawa Hospital has
      scanners in use that are able to take the images that oncologists typically order for
      patients and can also be set to obtain DECT images at the same time.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether DECT images can provide helpful
      information to better predict how the tumor will respond to treatment and the likely course
      of head and neck tumors.

    <description>Patients head and neck CT scans performed as standard of care done prior to radiation treatment and approximately 12 weeks following treatment, will be acquired in the dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) mode. Participants will have one additional scan, also in the DECT mode, 2 to 3 weeks after the start of their radiation treatment.</description>
