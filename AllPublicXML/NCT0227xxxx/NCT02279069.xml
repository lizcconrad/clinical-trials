  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients frequently necessitate walking aids such as 4-point canne. However, the
      4-point canne has to be lifted by the patient which limited gait speed. The adjunction of
      small wheel below the 4 point of the canne (4-roll) gives the possibility to the patient to
      walk without having to lift the canne as it will roll over the ground.

      The aim of our study is to compare gait parameters (gait speed and energy cost) with a
      classical 4-point canne and with 4-roll canne.

      Stroke patients frequently need walking aids such as 4-point canne. However, the 4-point
      canne has to be lifted by the patient which limited gait speed. The adjunction of small wheel
      below the 4 point of the canne (4-roll) gives the possibility to the patient to walk without
      having to lift the canne as it will roll over the ground.

      OBJECTIVE To compare the gait parameters with a 4-point canne and with a 4-roll canne METHODS
      The investigators will recruited stroke patients who necessitate 4 point-canne as walking
      aids. A 10 meters walking test, a 6 minutes walking test, an estimated energy cost and a
      patient's satisfaction will be monitored with a 4-point canne (day 1) and with a 4-roll canne
      (day 2) in a cross-over study. The first tested device will be randomized.

      PERSPECTIVE The investigators hope to demonstrate that a 4-roll canne makes possible to walk
      faster in a safe way after stroke
