      This research study is comparing Dual-Energy Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) to
      MRI as a screening tool for breast cancer.

      This research study is being done to test how well a contrast enhanced mammogram compares to
      MRI in screening for breast cancer in people who are at higher risk for developing breast
      cancer.

      Standard screening mammograms can miss breast cancers due to its inability to &quot;see through&quot;
      dense breast tissue. For this reason, women at increased risk for the development of breast
      cancer often undergo additional screening beyond conventional mammography with magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Although screening MRI is very sensitive for finding breast cancer,
      it also finds many areas that are benign (not cancer). The only way to know which is the
      cancer is to perform a biopsy, which contributes to patient anxiety and leads to many
      unnecessary biopsies.

      In the preliminary studies performed in women already diagnosed with breast cancer, contrast
      enhanced mammography was shown to have a similar sensitivity for finding primary breast
      cancer but detected fewer of the benign findings which would result in fewer unnecessary
      biopsies. It is also a faster and less expensive exam compared to MRI. Contrast mammography
      was FDA approved in 2011 and is used now as a tool to help work-up abnormalities seen on
      standard mammography and ultrasound.

      We are now studying to see if contrast enhanced mammography will also be a beneficial tool in
      the screening setting to screen high risk patients for breast cancer.

    <description>All CESM and MRI cases will be evaluated for the presence or absence of malignancy and will be coded to reflect this interpretation. Breast imaging-reporting and data system (BIRADS) scores of 1-3 represent the absence of malignancy and BIRADS code of 4-5 represent the presence of malignancy. These cases will be compared to the truth of whether malignancy developed in the patient based on biopsy results and long term clinical follow-up (2 years).</description>

    <description>After the MRI is complete, the patient will be brought to the mammography department for the contrast enhanced mammogram. The contrast enhanced mammogram will be independently interpreted by two study radiologists (randomly assigned) who are blinded to the MRI. They will then compare to the MRI to determine clinical follow-up. Any finding seen on MRI will be followed according to the MR protocol. Any finding seen on CESM only, will have a diagnostic work-up with mammography and ultrasound. If this work-up is negative, then follow-up CESM exams will be performed. Each patient will be followed for 2 years to determine sensitivity and specificity for both modalities.</description>
