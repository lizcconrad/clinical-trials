      Phase I-II trial that combines trabectedin plus radiotherapy for tumor reduction response
      measure in two cohorts of patients:

      Cohort A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or unresectable or not oncologically
      recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases soft tissue sarcoma.

      Cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma. Phase I: escalating
      dose of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2. Radiotherapy for cohort A: 30Gy in 10 fractions (3Gy/fraction)
      Radiotherapy for cohort B: 45Gy in 25 fractions (1.8Gy/fraction) A translational substudy is
      developed to analyse different biomarkers predictive value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators plan to measure tumor response (RECIST and Choi criteria) when
      administering trabectedin standard dose or inferior with simultaneous radiotherapy treatment.
      The hypothesis states that administering trabectedin at 1.3mg/m2 or ≤1.5mg/m2 plus
      Radiotherapy 30-45Gy shows synergic activity that turns into tumor shrinkage.

      A phase I trial (dose escalation level of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2) will provide the proper dose
      level to perform a phase II trial to measure RECIST and Choi response, progression free
      survival, overall survival and register safety and quality of life details.

      To cohorts are indicated for this trial, A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or
      unresectable or not oncologically recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases
      soft tissue sarcoma and cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid
      Liposarcoma. Unlimited cycles of chemotherapy are considered to be beneficial for cohort A
      patients, whereas cohort B only 3 cycles are indicated. About radiotherapy treatment, 30Gy
      will be given to cohort A patients, whereas cohort B will receive 45Gy. TCs and MRI are
      selected for imaging purposes.

      Several biomarkers are selected to perform FFPE tumor assays in relation to prediction
