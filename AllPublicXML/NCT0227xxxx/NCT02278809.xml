      1. Development of a method for parents of primary schoolchildren to teach parents parenting
           skills to obtain health gain in the family through videos and online feedback.

        2. Effect- and procesevaluation of this methodology.

        3. Development of an implementation guide together with VIGEZ as primary partner and in
           association with partner organisations on the field.

      The current project aims to develop, test and implement online videos to teach effective
      parenting skills to parents of primary schoolchildren. This way we want to achieve health
      profit by stimulating PA en healthy diet, and reducing SB in children. The online videos,
      based on existing literature and focus group research, show parents via modeling how they can
      react in difficult parenting situations related to PA, SB and healthy diet. In the current
      study, these videos will first be tested in an effect and process evaluation study. 300
      families with at least one primary schoolchild will be recruited and randomized into an
      intervention/control group. By using a survey at the pre-, post- and follow-up test, we will
      examine if parenting practices become more effective, if related parental self-efficacy
      enhances and if children perform more healthy behaviors after their parents watched the
      videos.

    <description>The intervention group got acces to a private website for 4 weeks on which the online videos were placed (Week 1: fruit + water, week 2: vegetables + breakfast + supermarket, week 3: PA, week 4: SB)
After each week, parents received a link for an online process evaluation questionnaire in which we asked how many times they watched each video, if they discussed the videos with other people, if they found them interesting, boringâ€¦</description>
