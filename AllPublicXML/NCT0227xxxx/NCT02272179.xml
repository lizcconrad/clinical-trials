  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in this age group. There are no
      validated treatments to decrease the risk of adolescent suicidal behavior, and there are
      especially no interventions to target the highest risk period for adolescent suicide and
      suicidal behavior, namely during the time of transition from inpatient to outpatient care.
      This purpose of this project was to develop a novel, brief intervention that can be delivered
      on an inpatient unit prior to the transition to outpatient care, and augment known factors to
      protect adolescents from suicidal behavior, and extend the impact of treatment by liaison
      with the outpatient therapist and the development of a personalized safety plan phone
      application. This treatment, ASAP, focuses on augmenting adherence to the components of ASAP
      and outpatient aftercare, development of a personalized Safety Plan, and Affect Protection,
      through helping the teen and family promote a positive mood, tolerate distress, engage in
      healthy emotion regulation and access social support.

    <textblock>
      This 2-site R34 project developed a brief, flexible, manualized intervention with supporting
      phone app with the purpose of reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents with high
      suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt, during the transition from inpatient to
      outpatient care. This transition period is the highest risk period for attempted and
      completed suicide. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of adolescent mortality, and there are
      currently no established interventions for suicidal teens. By developing a treatment that can
      be delivered on an inpatient unit prior to the transition to outpatient treatment, we
      anticipated being able to lower suicidal risk and increase the likelihood that participants
      will attend subsequent outpatient treatment. In keeping with the priorities of NIMH, this
      intervention aimed at reducing the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior was
      trans-diagnostic. We term the intervention ASAP, with anticipated components: (1)
      Adherence—promoting engagement and adherence to treatment through motivational interviewing;
      (2) Safety planning; and (3) Affect Protection- selecting from a menu of techniques for
      maintaining positive affect (e.g. savoring and switching strategies, mobilizing social
      support, engaging in emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills). Each of these
      components was delivered within a Motivational Interviewing framework for enhancing intrinsic
      motivation for change. Treatment was brief (3-5 hours), and flexibly delivered on inpatient
      units prior to initiation of outpatient treatment.

      ASAP included the family in the treatment, and a safety plan phone app to extend the impact
      of treatment was also developed. Innovative features included: (1) delivery of an
      intervention at a time and place when suicidal risk is highest; (2) augmentation of
      protective factors against recurrent suicidal behavior, specifically by promoting development
      of positive affect, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and social support; (3) a Safety
      plan phone app to extend the impact of treatment; and (4) liaison with the outpatient
      therapist to ensure continuity of care.

      This project conducted an RCT of ASAP followed by Aftercare (AC) vs. AC alone to determine
      ASAP's feasibility, acceptability, impact on proximal targets (e.g., adherence to outpatient
      care, sleep, positive affect, substance use), suicidal ideation and behavior. In total 68
      suicidal adolescents were enrolled, 2 of whom were withdrawn following baseline assessment
      and were excluded from analyses, resulting in the final study sample size of 66. ASAP,
      developed with and intended for community clinicians, has the potential to be a sustainable
      intervention to reduce the burden of adolescent suicidality. Data analyses have been
      completed and results are being finalized.

    <description>Suicidal attempts were the major outcome and secondarily, suicidal ideation. Information about past and current suicidal behavior was obtained using the Columbia Suicide History Form, with ideation and behavior classified using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). Self-reported ideation was assessed using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire - Junior (SIQ-Jr). The two main outcomes, assessing recurrent suicidal behavior and change in suicidal ideation, was assessed at weeks 4, 12, and 24.</description>

    <description>Client Satisfaction about ASAP was obtained from the patient and a caretaking parent using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8), which has been used in other adolescent treatment studies and has high internal consistency (coefficient α = .93). We also adapted the Computer System Usability Scale (CSUQ) to assess satisfaction with the phone app. The CSUQ was completed by the participant, and is based on earlier measures designed to predict the adoption of technology, based on two main factors: ease of use (easy to learn, access, flexibility, quality of sound, quality of visual display) and usefulness (able to access when needed, helpful when used), scored along 7-point Likert Scales.</description>

    <measure>Qualitative Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>With Dr. Lee's guidance, we conducted brief semi-structured exit interviews following the intervention with both the parent and teen, which were developed and coded on the basis of our original qualitative interviews, to assess the acceptability of treatment. In these interviews, we obtained feedback about perceived effectiveness of the components of treatment, the appropriateness of treatment targets, identification of other targets or approaches that would have been more helpful, barriers to participation, and utility of the phone apps. The phone app was designed to track how often the participant used the apps and what components were accessed. We obtained similar feedback from the ASAP clinicians and from the outpatient aftercare therapists. Based on exit interviews, participant satisfaction, and outcome data from the open trial, we modified the manual and app.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child participants will be adolescents (aged 12-17.11 years) admitted to an inpatient
             unit for a recent suicide attempt or significant suicidal ideation with a plan or
             intent. We define a suicide attempt, as per the Columbia Clinical Algorithm for
             Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), as &quot;self-destructive behavior with inferred or stated
             intent to die.&quot;

          -  Participants must be English-speaking.

          -  Participants can have unipolar or bipolar disorder, conduct or oppositional disorder,
             eating disorder, or alcohol or substance use or abuse or dependence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child participants to be excluded will be those with current psychosis, mania, &lt;90% of
             ideal body weight, or IQ&lt;70 (based on the age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale
             if concerns about intellectual capabilities are evident at assessment), as these
             conditions may require more intensive interventions or limit comprehension of the
             intervention components.
