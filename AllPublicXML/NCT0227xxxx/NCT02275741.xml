      The aim of this study is to determine whether prophylactic vaccines recommended are effective
      and safe in patients with multiple sclerosis(MS) under MS-specific therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protective vaccines against communicable diseases are of major importance in patients with
      autoimmune diseases or impaired immune response. In patients with multiple sclerosis
      bacterial or viral infections may lead to disease progression and vaccines can protect from
      these infections and prevent disease progression. Fear of possible side effects of vaccines
      have led to a general restraint regarding vaccination of patients with MS. However, previous
      studies have not shown an increased risk of disease progression following Hepatitis B
      vaccination and even a reduced progression rate in relapsing-remitting MS after
      tetanus/diphtheria vaccination.

      Various disease modifying treatments (DMT) are available for MS, most of these therapies lead
      to an impairment of the immune system affecting the immune response to vaccination.
      Additionally, live attenuated vaccines may lead to severe side-effects if used in patients
      under DMT treatment. Testing immune response after vaccination may be prudent in subjects
      undergoing DMT to assure vaccination success since only a limited number of studies have
      investigated immune response after vaccination in patients with MS undergoing DMT.
