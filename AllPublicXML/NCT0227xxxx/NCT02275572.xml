      Objective: To evaluate the clinical and economic impact of the application of an algorithm to
      improve the adequacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in elderly polymedicated (receiving 8 or
      more medications), not institutionalized.

      Design: randomized, open, multicenter and two branches of parallel intervention clinical
      trial.

      Intervention Study: primary care pharmacist apply the GP-GP algorithm to each drug with the
      support of STOPP criteria, Beers and / or recommendations CatSalut. The pharmacist submit to
      doctor his findings and reach a consensus and decide which recommendations will be presented
      to patient. Control intervention: usual procedure.

      Main outcome measures: a) Discontinued medications, changed or changing doses, b) GP
      consultations, hospital emergency department and hospital admissions for acute illness, c)
      pharmaceutical expenditure, d) restart medication e) complications underlying diseases.
      Follow-up control at 1 month (security) and at 3, 6 and 12 months.
