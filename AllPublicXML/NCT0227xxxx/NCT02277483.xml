      Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of SLIT with LAIS® Mites Sublingual tablets compared to
      standard drug treatment in patients aged over 60 years suffering from house dust mite (HDM)
      induced allergic rhino-conjunctivitis with/without asthma.

      The Total combined score (TCS), taking into account the rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom
      score (RTSS) and the total rescue medication score (RTMS), in the maximum expected mites
      exposition period (V4-V5) For the RTSS and the RTMS, the daily values as determined by the
      patients in their diary card are collected during the observation period over 30 days. Then,
      the mean daily scores during that period are calculated for both parameters.
