  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a new treatment option for treatment-naïve participants with HIV-1, the efficacy
      and safety of doravirine will be determined relative to a protease inhibitor (PI).
      Participants will receive double-blind treatment during the 96-week Base Study. Eligible
      participants in either of the Base Study groups will continue to receive the
      doravirine-containing regimen open label for an additional 96 weeks in the Study Extension 1.
      Eligible participants who are deriving benefit will continue in Study Extension 2 to receive
      the doravirine-containing regimen open label until doravirine becomes locally available or
      for an additional 96 weeks, whichever comes first. The primary hypothesis is that doravirine
      100 mg once a day (q.d.) is non-inferior to darunavir/ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d., each in
      combination with TRUVADA™ or EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™, as assessed by the proportion of participants
      with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 48. If non-inferiority is
      established, then the superiority of doravirine 100 mg q.d. compared to darunavir/ ritonavir
      (800 mg/100 mg) q.d. will be assessed.
