  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The link between precarious situations and health conditions are more described in previous
      study. Precarious situations are more frequent and complex especially in rural areas. There
      are recognized like a risk factor of complications during pregnancy and delivery. It's
      necessary to describe antenatal cares for rural women in precarious situations to prevent
      those situations, to understand their difficulties in order to reduce inequalities and health
      spending.

      The aim of the PRUGNANCY study is to understand the difficulties of rural parturient women
      and the strategies developed to overcome them. Recognized earlier precarious situations and
      valorized General Practitioners and restore them to the follow-up or parturient women.

      It's a multicenter prospective observational study with a quali-quantitative method. This
      study involved three maternities in Auvergne region (Issoire, Thiers, Saint-Flour).
      Precarious women living in rural areas are included. They will be followed during a period of
      two months after childbirth. The main assessment criterion is the adequation rate between
      antenatal care for those women and the HAS recommendation's.

      The amount necessary to highlight a significant difference is 190 patients (IC 95% [0.429 -
      0.571] ; risk = 5 % ; Adequation rate = 50 % ; lost to follow-up rate = 10 % ; deprivation
      rate = 27 %).

      The secondary criteria of judgment are the reasons for not realized antenatal and postnatal
      cares, the difficulties of realized antenatal and postnatal cares, the strategies developed
      to overcome them, the term and health status of the child birth (Apgar score, birth weight),
      the health status of the child birth and his mother during the two post-partum months (HAS
      recommendation's).
