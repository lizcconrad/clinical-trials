  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is becoming a new paradigm for breast cancer radiation.[1]
      No type I or II evidence is currently available to demonstrate equivalence to standard whole
      breast radiotherapy, and a prospective randomized trial jointly sponsored by NSABP and RTOG
      (NSABP B-39 and RTOG 0413) is currently accruing patients, comparing whole breast
      radiotherapy to PBI, either by brachytherapy or external beam techniques (EB). Until the
      results of this or similar trials are available, PBI remains a research domain, and it should
      be offered to patients only in the context of a clinical experimental protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that less extensive experience than that of brachytherapy is available, PBI
      delivery through an external-beam has many advantages. First of all, it is likely to be more
      acceptable to the patient since it is non-invasive and it does not require a surgical
      procedure or anesthesia. Moreover, since it is delivered after surgery, the pathological
      analysis of the segmental mastectomy specimen is available to inform the selection of the
      best candidates. In addition, EB-PBI is likely to become more widely reproducible, since it
      does not rely on the experience and skills of the radiation oncologist performing the
      brachytherapy implant. Besides, once the technique is established, it can be widely applied
      at any facility provided with a linear accelerator, without the risk presented by some
      brachytherapy approaches that can not be completed because of the unfavorable interplay of
      patient's anatomy with the technical limitations of the applicator. Finally, in terms of
      health care economics, an external beam approach spares the costs of an extra surgical
      procedure and that of several days of hospitalization (in the case of LDR brachytherapy).

    <description>IGRT for prone partial breast irradiation (PBI): All patients will be treated prone with 6 Gy/fraction delivered in 5 fractions over a 1-week period for a total dose of 30 Gy. Simulation and treatment will be started within 50 days from surgery in order to maximize the chances of optimal lumpectomy cavity visualization on the planning and cone beam CT scans. All patients will be followed monthly for the first 90 days then q3 months for the first year, then yearly for the next 10 years.</description>
