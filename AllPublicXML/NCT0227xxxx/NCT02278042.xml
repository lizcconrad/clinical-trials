      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute and chronic effects of consumption
      fructose containing sugars and glucose in a real word setting when consumed in a manner and
      amount typical in the American diet.

    <textblock>
      Detailed description (Why and How?) Fructose is known to be metabolized differently than the
      other common monosaccharides. In addition to the well know lipogenic effects, more recent
      evidence has shown that the acute changes in hormones and metabolic parameters that control
      appetite and energy regulation when with fructose consumption may promote caloric
      overconsumption and, in the long-term, weight gain and deteriorations in insulin sensitivity.
      However, fructose is rarely consumed in isolation, but instead is consumed in combination
      with other sugars (with glucose in the case of the two most common sources of fructose: high
      fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose, or as part of a mixed macronutrient meal. As such,
      the practical significance of these short-term findings of isolated monosaccharide
      consumption is limited.

      AIM 1: investigate the response to ten weeks of daily consumption of typical levels of
      different fructose containing sugars and glucose on measures of glucose and insulin
      metabolism.

      AIM 2: To investigate whether ten weeks of daily consumption changes the fat content of the
      liver, skeletal muscles or abdomen.
