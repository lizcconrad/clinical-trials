      Thrombosis occurring in the small intrahepatic, as well as in the large vessels is involved
      in the progression of cirrhosis. Anticoagulation could reduce morbidity and mortality in
      cirrhotic patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is the end-stage of all chronic liver diseases. Cirrhosis is a critical step in the
      natural history of liver disease, as it is associated with the occurrence of complications
      (so-called decompensation) and death. Life expectancy varies from 12-14 years in patients
      with compensated cirrhosis, to 2-4 years after decompensation.

      Cirrhosis is associated with thrombosis of the intrahepatic portal and hepatic venous systems
      leading to parenchymal extinction (atrophy), liver dysfunction and portal hypertension.
      Regeneration in the areas without microthrombosis, and inflammation are powerful factors
      inducing liver cancer. Portal and hepatic venous thrombosis have been shown to participate in
      remodeling the liver architecture and are associated with a worsening outcome. Thrombosis in
      cirrhosis is thought to result from a procoagulant state due to an imbalance between pro and
      anticoagulant factor plasma levels, inflammation in and around blood vessels, and a marked
      slowing down of venous blood flow. Heparin administration, in animal models of liver
      fibrosis, decreases extra cellular matrix protein synthesis and fibrous tissue deposition.
      Recently, a reduction in liver decompensation and mortality has been shown in Child-Pugh
      B7-C10 cirrhotic patients assigned to receive a low dose of enoxaparin (4000IU/d), a low
      molecular weight heparin, for 48 weeks, compared to patients receiving no anticoagulation
      therapy.

      These results are in line with the hypothesis of a protective role of anticoagulation in
      liver disease progression and a strong association between thrombosis and liver fibrosis.

      So the main objective of the study is to compare the effect of a 2-year low dosing of
      Enoxaparin (4000 IU/day) versus no treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients with
      Child B7-C10 cirrhosis.
