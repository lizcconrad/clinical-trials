  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Prehospital Resuscitation On Helicopter Study (PROHS) is a pragmatic, multicenter,
      prospective observational study of air ambulance-based prehospital resuscitation regimens
      currently utilized at the participating sites. Patients will be enrolled at participating
      sites that currently have blood products available on air ambulances and other sites that do
      not. This study will not change the current prehospital standard of care for resuscitation.
      The primary outcome will be in-hospital mortality and the primary unit of analysis will be
      the patient. Other outcomes of interest will include time to hemostasis, hospital
      length-of-stay, number of ventilator-free and ICU-free days, incidence of major surgical
      procedures, complications (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI], acute kidney injury
      [AKI], multiple organ failure [MOF], acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], sepsis,
      intra-abdominal complications, thromboembolic complications, compartment syndromes),
      lifesaving interventions, the amount and type of blood products and concentrates transfused
      (including prehospital), wastage of prehospital blood products and concentrates, use of
      external and internal hemostatic devices, and functional status at discharge/discharge
      destination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients arriving to the participating center's trauma emergency department via
      helicopter directly from the scene will be screened and initial data collected. Of that
      group, all patients who meet the &quot;highest risk&quot; category (based on vital signs, type of
      injury, use of tourniquet, and/or intubation) or received blood during transport will be
      followed through &quot;direct observation&quot; through the initial resuscitation period and then
      indirectly through medical chart review until hospital discharge or 30 days after admission
      (whichever occurs first).
