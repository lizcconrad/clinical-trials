    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), Day 15, 29, 43, 55</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), Day 15, 29, 43, 55</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea at baseline (Day -1) will be assessed with the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). This instrument has 3 domains (functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort) with the values added for a combined focal score. Functional impairment determines the impact of breathlessness on the ability to carry out activities; magnitude of task determines the type of task that causes breathlessness, magnitude of effort establishes the level of effort that results in breathlessness. The BDI scores range from 0 (very severe impairment) to 4 (no impairment) for each domain with the baseline focal score consisting of the sum of each domain (0 to 12). Dyspnea throughout the study will be performed at the time points. The change from baseline is measured by the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) score which ranges from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement) for each domain with the TDI focal score consisting in the sum of each domain (-9 to +9).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), Day 15, 29, 43, 55</time_frame>
    <description>The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test (CAT) is a short and simple questionnaire of 8 items completed by patients to be performed at the time points. Scores for each of the 8 items are summed to give a single, final score ranging from 0 (no impact on daily activities) to 40 (very high impact on daily activity).</description>
