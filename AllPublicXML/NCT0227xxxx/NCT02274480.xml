  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to see if a special type of heart scan called a diffusion weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) that uses extra measurements, can be used to find early
      signs of heart damage from chemotherapy.

      This prospective single institutional pilot study will enroll breast cancer patients who
      develop cardiotoxicity while on anthracycline and anti-HER2 therapy . The control group will
      be composed of patients on similar anthracycline therapy and dose but without a decline in
      LVEF on Cardiac MRI (CMR). Clinic visits with monitoring for cardiotoxicity occur as part of
      standard of care after therapy initiation. The study and control group will be composed of 15
      patients each. At the discretion of the treating physician, patients will be recruited from
      the Breast Medical Oncology Service.

    <description>Each patient will undergo a cardiac MRI with DWI. The standard of care in patients with declining LVEF is a cardiac MRI. For this study, those patients will also have the added DWI sequence. For patients who are not already scheduled for a cardiac MRI by their referring physician, and therefore do not have an upcoming standard of care cardiac MRI, a research cardiac MRI with DWI will be added. They will not be charged for the DW-MRI of the heart or any additional images taken as part of that scan. Patients unable to tolerate lying flat for this length of time or to tolerate the scan for any reason will be withdrawn and replaced in the study. After their cardiac MRI, their participation in the study is complete.</description>

        Patients who meet the selection criteria will be recruited from the breast medical oncology

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥18 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of HER2+ breast cancer

               -  History of anthracycline therapy and antiHER2 treatment

          -  For subjects with decrease in LVEF: Recent (within 12 weeks) drop in LVEF ≥10% on
             echocardiogram from baseline and confirmed by cardiac MRI for the study population. If
             the drop in EF is not confirmed on MRI, the subject will be removed and placed into
             the control group.

        For control group: Less than a 10% change in EF from baseline for the control population
        confirmed on echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. If no change in EF is not confirmed on MRI,
        the subject will be removed and placed into the study group if the change in EF is equal to
        or greater than 10%. Note: Male breast cancer patients are uncommon and are not expected to
        be included in this study, however if they meet the above criteria, they will not be
        excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior myocardial infarction

          -  Prior surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularization

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients

          -  Patients who because of general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic
             status unrelated to the presence of breast cancer cannot give valid informed consent

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo MRI including patients with
             contraindications to MRI such as the presence of cardiac pacemakers or non-compatible
             intracranial vascular clips, claustrophobia, inability to lie flat for the duration of
             the study etc. MRI eligibility will be determined on the day of consent with the MRI
             questionnaire.

          -  Patients with metallic implants or device in the chest that might distort local
             magnetic field and compromise quality of MRI
