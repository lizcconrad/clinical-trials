  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate consequences of frailty in critically ill
      patients. We hypothesize that a higher frailty index (based on published questionnaires)
      predicts a longer surgical intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, less
      ventilator-free days and a higher likelihood of an adverse discharge disposition.

      Our secondary aim is to identify muscle-size derived variables that can be used to predict
      frailty. We hypothesize that a low skeletal muscle mass measured by ultrasound can be used to
      quantify frailty, and to also predict the outcome of SICU patients, expressed as longer stay
      in the surgical intensive care unit and longer stay in the hospital, less ventilator-free
      days and a higher likelihood of an adverse discharge disposition.

      Our third aim is to examine potential triggers of muscle wasting in critically ill patients.
      Muscle wasting will be assessed by repetitive ultrasound measurements of muscle mass. We
      hypothesize that a significant decrease in skeletal muscle mass predicts longer stay at the
      surgical intensive care unit and longer hospital length of stay, less ventilator-free days
      and adverse discharge disposition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is defined as status of decreased physiological reserve which leads to a higher
      vulnerability to stressors. It is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.
      Within the geriatric population, frailty is common and a known predictor of adverse outcomes.
      The usefulness of a frailty assessment as an outcome measure in critically ill patients of
      all ages needs to be evaluated. This study evaluates whether frailty has an effect on outcome
      of critically ill patients.

      Muscle weakness predicts outcome of ICU patients but is hard to determine in the ICU since
      the measurement is volition dependent. Muscle mass correlates with muscle weakness and can be
      assessed objectively. This study evaluates the consequences of reduced muscle mass or
      sarcopenia on the outcome of critically ill patients.

      In addition, muscle wasting in the ICU may predict persistent functional disability. This
      study aims to examine muscle wasting of critically ill patients on the surgical ICU.

    <description>Frailty Index Questionnaire is a clinical tool to assess frailty in patients. We will ask patients to answer the questionnaire, including clarification that the questionnaire assesses the patient's pre-admission condition. The presence of a frail characteristic will be scored as 1 point. Most variables will be dichotomized (e.g. 1 point when a frail characteristic will be present and 0 points when frail characteristic will be not present).The Frailty Index will be calculated as the total number of frail characteristics of the patient divided by the total number of variables (n=50).</description>
