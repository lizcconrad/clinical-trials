    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study of oral
      treprostinil in pediatric subjects with stable PAH aged 7 to 17 years who are, (1)
      transitioning from parenteral Remodulin therapy; (2) transitioning from inhaled prostacyclin
      therapy; or (3) not currently receiving prostacyclin therapy.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will transition in the hospital from Remodulin to oral treprostinil within 5 days of the start of the transition. A cross titration will occur so that doses of parenteral Remodulin will be decreased as oral treprostinil is increased. Oral treprostinil will be dosed three times daily (TID; every 6-8 hours) or four times daily (QID; every 4-6 hours) at the discretion of the investigator. Once subjects have been transitioned from Remodulin, the dose of oral treprostinil will continue to be modified / titrated to the appropriate optimal dose for that subject throughout the rest of the study.</description>

Oral treprostinil will be dosed three times daily (TID; every 6-8 hours) or four times daily (QID; every 4-6 hours). Oral treprostinil will be initiated at 0.125 mg TID or QID and dose escalations may occur in either 0.125 mg or 0.25 mg increments every 24 hours, as tolerated.</description>
