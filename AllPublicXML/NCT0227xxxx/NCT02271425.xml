    <textblock>
      Evacetrapib (study drug) is an investigational drug being developed with the aim to help
      people at high risk of heart problems in the future.

      In this study we will be comparing how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream when
      it is given as a single dose (in tablet form) compared to an intravenous injection (given
      directly into a vein via a small needle).

      The study is expected to last at least 15 days for each participant, not including screening.
      Screening will occur up to 28 days before the study drug is given.
