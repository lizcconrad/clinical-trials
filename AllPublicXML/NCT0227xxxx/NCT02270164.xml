  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pycrinil® is a purified extract of the artichoke leaf. Artichoke leaf extract (ALE) has some
      clinical trial data suggesting benefit in the treatment of cholesterol disorders in several
      countries, but this effect has not been studied in a U.S. population. The investigators will
      give ALE or a placebo to overweight men and women with low &quot;good&quot; cholesterol to see if ALE
      increases their good cholesterol. The investigators will also make sure that ALE is safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be divided into one of two groups: (1) Pycrinil®/flaxseed oil or (2)
      Placebo/flaxseed oil twice daily with food. The two formulations will be identical in
      appearance and standardized by Indena, S.p.A. Patients will be enrolled for a total of 3
      months (± 1 week to allow for scheduling flexibility) with a 1 month (± 1 week to allow for
      scheduling flexibility) first follow-up visit in between enrollment and final visits. At all
      visits, patients will be asked to monitor for any symptomatic ADE. The first follow-up visit
      will focus on medication compliance (via pill count) and safety assessment (including
      laboratories). The final study visit will consist of brief clinical assessment (including
      anthropometrics), completed lifestyle and physical activity assessments, subjective ADE
      reporting, and donated blood and urine for clinical laboratory tests. Medication changes are
      not prohibited during the study period, but must be recorded. Medication bottles will be
      collected at the first follow-up and final visits; pill counts will be performed to assess
      compliance.
