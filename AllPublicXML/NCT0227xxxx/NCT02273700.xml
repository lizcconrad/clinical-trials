  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to investigate the protein / peptide plasma
      profiles before and after treatment with a direct anti-Xa (activated Factor 10) in patients
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to better understand the mechanisms of action of these
      molecules and perform exploratory analyses concerning proteins whose concentrations change
      after starting treatment.

    <description>The study population consists of patients in the cardiology department at the Nîmes University Hospital with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and who are candidates for treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®). Patients will be selected according to criteria designed to result in a homogeneous population (associated anticoagulants, etc., see below). For this study, patients must not have had a direct oral anti-Xa (activated Factor 10) in the 6 months preceding enrollment.
