    <textblock>
      Move for your mind is a single blind, 3-arm randomized controlled clinical pilot trial. The
      study aims to test the effect of a weekly Dalcroze eurhythmics program (arm 1) and a home
      strength exercise program (arm 2) against control (no exercise) on the rate of falling,
      quality of life, gait performance and cognitive function. All groups receive vitamin D. In
      addition the study shall test the feasibility of the recruitment and the interventions in
      this target population.

      The study includes 60 seniors, age 65 and older, with mild cognitive impairment or mild
      dementia. Participants are recruited by the memory clinic of City Hospital Waid.

      During the 12 months follow-up, participants will have 3 clinical visits (baseline, 6 and 12
      month). Despite major efforts the target population is very difficult to recruit and
      adherence to treatment is low. We therefore decided to stop recruitment and to use this trial
      as a pilot trial for future clinical trials of the same topic.

      Primary objective To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for
      12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) will
      decrease rate of falls in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.

      Secondary objectives Objective 1: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1
      hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12
      months) decreases 12-month risk of falling at least once in seniors with MCI or mild dementia
      compared with the control group.

      Objective 2: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12
      months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) improves
      cognitive func-tion and alertness in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the
      control group.

      Objective 3: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12
      months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) decreases
      gait variability in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.

      Objective 4: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12
      months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) improves
      quality of life in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.

    <description>A fall is defined as unintentional coming to rest on the ground, floor, or other lower level (coming to rest against furniture or a wall is not considered a fall). All reported incident falls will be ascertained every 2 month (phone calls at 2, 4, 8 and 10 months and clinical visits at 6 and 12 months after baseline) with a questionnaire evaluating the circumstances of each fall and injuries associated with it. Participants will also receive a diary to record any new health event including a fall. The diary will serve as a supplementary tool to falls evaluation minimizing potential recall bias.</description>

    <description>The Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics method includes different courses of motion (multi-task exercises) that are conducted to the rhythm of improvised piano music. A session starts with a short warm-up that includes simple exercises to get body and mind prepared for the rest of the exercise session. The complexity of the exercises increases gradually during the session: starting with single tasks and then combining them into a multi-task exercise gradually increasing complexity.</description>
