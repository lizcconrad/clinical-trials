  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of human immunoglobulin
      SCIg in the form of Hizentra (Immune globulin Subcutaneous) in patients with Dermatomyositis.
      Hizentra provides effective protection against infection by maintaining a steady and normal
      level of immunoglobulin in the body) in patients with primary immunodeficiency. At present,
      patients with steroid resistant dermatomyositis can only be treated with IVIg (The healthy
      antibodies in IVIG can block the damaging antibodies that attack muscle and skin in
      dermatomyositis) treatment. An evaluation can then be made to see if SCIg is a suitable
      replacement and exerts immunomodulatory effect on complement antibodies.

    <description>Secondary outcome measures will be a) patient preference, based on the number of participants who prefer SCIg to IVIg (a home-made questionnaire will be utilized to capture preference in the most unbiased way; b) average change in Quality of life scores between week 12 and 28; c) effect on the complement consumption in serum; d) Immunological parameters on the repeated skin biopsies; and e) adverse events as reported at each visit. Accordingly, information will be obtained on the superiority of SCIg vs. IVIg</description>

    <description>Patients na√Øve to IVIg who have active disease responding to corticosteroids or are corticosteroid-dependent, will be also included.

          4. Established response to IVIg or dependence on IVIg to maintain status established
             either by symptomatic worsening of condition at the end of the inter-dose interval for
             both groups or by worsening after reduction of the dose within the previous 12 months
