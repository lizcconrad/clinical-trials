    <textblock>
      This study presents 23 sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease cases treated with endoscopic
      cleaning and fulguration of pilonidal sinus inner surfaca followed by application of
      crystallized phenol into the sinus.

      Endoscopic treatment and crytallized phenol application are two sovereign treatments
      described for pilonidal disease. The curative rate may be as low as 65 % and the recurrence
      rate is at least 10 % after crystallized phenol alone application for pilonidal disease. The
      experience with endoscopic treatment of pilonidal sinus is only limited but at least 4 %
      recurrence rate was reported.

      In this study a preliminary group of 23 patients were treated with combination of these two
      modalities between February to May 2014 and at the end of 6-9 months follow up, there was no
      recurrence after excellent cosmetic results. Patients were all operated and mild sedation and
      local anesthesia. There was no serious complication but only some skin irritation was noticed
      secondary to phenol burn. Some patients felt mild pain and the pain was self limited in most
      cases where only a few needed oral pain killers. Some patients were observed to have mild
      drainage from the sinus but only two of them needed further application of phenol crystals.

    <description>The abbrevition EAPA is used to describe the study. The cohort of pilonidal disease patients treated who do not have an acute abscess or other problems like hydradenitis suppurativa, has been treated by endoscopy assisted fulguration of the inner surface and additional crystallized phenol application for further clean up of the remaining tissue as well as preventing bacterial growth.</description>

    <description>Under sedation and local anesthesia, a pit of pilonidal disease is widened, hair and debris removed and cavity first ablated by endoscopy assisted diathermy the filled with crystallized phenol. The remaining pits were also fulgurated.</description>
