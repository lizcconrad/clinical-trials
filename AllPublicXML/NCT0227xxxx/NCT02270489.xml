  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled parallel Group phase I study to investigate the safety and
      immunological/ therapeutic activity of two new vaccines, AFFITOPE® PD01A and AFFITOPE® PD03A,
      given to patients with early Multiple System Atrophy (MSA).

      In total 30 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study: 12 patients in each treatment
      arm who will receive either 75µg AFFITOPE® PD01A (with adjuvant) or 75µg AFFITOPE® PD03A
      (with adjuvant) and 6 patients in the control group who will receive the reference substance
      (Placebo). Over a study duration of 52 weeks, the study participants will receive 4
      injections as basic immunization in a 4-weekly interval and 1 boost immunization 36 weeks
      after the first injection. Male and female patients aged 30 to 75 years can participate in
      the trial. 2 study sites in France (Bordeaux and Toulouse) will be involved.

      AFF009 is part of the project SYMPATH funded by the European Commission
      (FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1 project; N° HEALTH-F4-2013-602999).
