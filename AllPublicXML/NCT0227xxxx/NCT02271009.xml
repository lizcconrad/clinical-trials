    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the optimal dose of AllerT that should be used to treat
      moderate to severe allergies due to birch tree pollen.

      There are 4 treatment groups in this study; 3 treatment groups will receive AllerT at
      different doses and 1 treatment group will receive placebo.

      This study will also assess the effectiveness and safety of AllerT compared to placebo in
      relieving allergy symptoms.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the dose-response trend of three doses of adjuvanted AllerT
      and of placebo in reducing symptoms of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis in subjects exposed to
      birch tree pollen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate three dose regimens of AllerT , versus a placebo in reducing symptoms of
           allergic rhino-conjunctivitis in subjects exposed to birch tree pollen in an EEC.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a two month treatment with three dose regiments
           of AllerT (10 µg, 25 µg and 50 µg with Al(OH)3).

        -  To explore the immunological response to AllerT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Minimum two-year history of moderate to severe rhino-conjunctivitis on exposure to
             birch pollen with a need to take symptomatic medications (antihistamine, steroid)
             during pollen season, prior to study enrollment.

          -  Sensitivity to birch tree pollen confirmed at Screening by both of the following
             criteria:

          -  Positive Skin Prick Test (SPT) to birch pollen extract (wheal ≥ 3 mm than the negative
             control). Negative control must be ≤ 2 mm.

          -  Positive specific IgE CAP test for Bet v 1 (≥ 0.7 kU/L).

          -  A qualifying score in at least one of the two Baseline EEC Challenges: at least one

             Subjects who require the occasional use of inhaled broncho-dilator can be included.

          -  History of birch pollen induced asthma. Note: A diagnosis of isolated exercise induced
             bronchospasm or controlled asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] Step 1) not
             triggered by birch pollen does not constitute an exclusion criterion.

          -  History of documented severe anaphylactic reaction (Grade 4 of World Allergy
             Organization [WAO]).

          -  History of sinus disease including:

               -  History of chronic sinusitis, defined as sinus symptoms lasting greater than 12
                  weeks that includes two or more major factors or one major factor and two minor
                  factors. Major factors are defined as facial pain or pressure, nasal obstruction
                  or blockage, nasal discharge or purulence or discolored postnasal discharge,
                  purulence in nasal cavity, or impaired or loss of smell. Minor factors are
                  defined as headache, fever, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain, cough, and ear pain,
                  pressure, or fullness.

          -  Subjects who cannot tolerate the Baseline EEC Challenge or do not meet the Baseline
             EEC Challenge inclusion criteria.

          -  Subjects with a history of immunodeficiency or any other conditions that might affect
             the subject's safety or interpretation of study results.

          -  Received immunosuppressive medication (including oral corticosteroids) within four
             weeks prior to Screening, or planned to be used during the trial period.

          -  Received systemic or local antihistamines, oral or inhaled corticosteroids or under
             antidepressant medication with antihistamine effects within two weeks prior to
             Screening.

          -  Subjects for whom administration of epinephrine is contraindicated (eg, subjects with
             acute or chronic symptomatic coronary heart disease or severe hypertension).

          -  Subjects being treated with beta-blockers in any form including topical ocular
             beta-blocker type medication.
