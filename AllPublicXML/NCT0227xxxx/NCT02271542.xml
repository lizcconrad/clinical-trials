      Identification of Polymorphisms Involved in the Metabolism of Propofol

    <textblock>
      Propofol inside and outside the operating room during anesthesia is a drug widely used. In
      terms of efficacy and side effect profile of propofol knows if properties are insufficient
      data on the metabolism. Propofol typically undergoes biotransformation by microsomal enzymes
      in the liver. For most of the administered dose, takes place glucuronidation by UGT1A9
      enzyme, while the remaining portion is oxidized with CYP2B6 hydroxylation reactions. However,
      these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of propofol are enzymes highly polymorphic.
      Polymorphisms occurring in these enzymes; the effects of propofol, side effects and drug
      needs to show individual differences in terms of causes. Determination of the genetic
      background of individuals and personal anesthetic regimen improved. Thus, useful person drug
      resistance, increased incidence of side effects can be reduced. In particular, be aware of
      some mutations, such as propofol infusion syndrome mortal side effects can be prevented. The
      main purpose of this study, these individual differences are thought to be the cause of
      polymorphic variation in UGT1A9 and CYP2B6 gene to determine. Especially in the UGT1A9 gene
      mutations that may be associated with ethnic structure can be observed. In Caucasian,
      African-American communities and polymorphisms of this gene has been shown in Japanese. So
      all of them as a result of the genetic structure of any society can be considered as its own.
      Therefore, this study aimed to determine the genetic polymorphism of Turkish society
      has.Physiological factors such as age and sex between persons of different answers to the
      causes of propofol. Another object of this study was the identification of these factors can
      lead to different answers which is to present the relationship between polymorphisms.

    <description>EDTA blood samples from patients for the study of polymorphisms, DNA will be obtained with the help of DNA isolation kit. DNA isolation from blood samples taken after the sample is stored at -80 Â° C until the operating phase.
Research priorities included in the appropriate primers for each polymorphism will be created.
Using appropriate PCR program, will be determined the genotype of each polymorphism.</description>
