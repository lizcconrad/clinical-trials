    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if researchers can successfully and
      safely give patients who have had a stem cell transplant an infusion of white blood cells
      (called T-cells) that have been collected from an unrelated person, and that have been
      genetically changed. The process of changing the DNA (genetic material) of these T-cells is
      called &quot;gene transfer.&quot; The gene transfer involves drawing blood from an unrelated donor,
      separating out T cells using a machine, changing the cells' DNA in the laboratory, and
      returning the genetically changed cells back to the body. T-cells are a type of white blood
      cell that fight infection. The type of gene transfer being used in this study is designed to
      help your T-cells to better fight cancer by targeting a chemical marker that is found on
      certain cancer cells.

      Researchers want to learn if these genetically-changed T-cells can help to control B-cell
      leukemia or lymphoma after a stem cell transplant.

      Researchers want to find out the highest tolerable dose of these T-cells that can be given to
      patients with relapsed leukemia or lymphoma.

      Study Plan:

      This study has 2 steps: chemotherapy and gene transfer.

      The chemotherapy combination in this study (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) is given to try
      to help the T-cells work better.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of T-cells based on when you joined this study. The first group of 3 participants will
      receive the lowest dose of T-cells. Each new group will receive a higher dose of T-cells than
      the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 6 dose levels of T-cells
      will be tested.

      Chemotherapy and Gene Transfer:

        -  On Day -8 (8 days before the T-cell infusion) and Day -7, you will receive
           cyclophosphamide by vein over about 4 hours. You will receive mesna by vein over 30
           minutes every 4 hours to lower the risk of bleeding in the bladder.

        -  On Day -6 through Day -2, you will receive fludarabine 1 time a day by vein over about
           30 minutes.

      Sometime between 2-7 days after chemotherapy ends, you will receive the T cell infusion by
      vein over 15-30 minutes. The infusion will be divided into 2 parts at least 24 hours apart.
      During and after the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed based on the status of the disease, you may receive up to 2
      more courses of this study therapy given at least 6 weeks apart.

      Study Tests:

      You will be in the hospital from Day -8 through 2 days after the stem cell transplant. Every
      day while you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 1 week before the T-cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed. These tests will not be repeated again if the T-cell infusion is repeated.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw
           will include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant.

        -  Part of the blood drawn for routine tests will also be used to test for antibodies you
           may develop against the mouse antibodies that are used in the gene transfer process.
           These antibodies are called human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). If your body becomes
           immune to these proteins, you may develop HAMA. The results of this HAMA test will be
           used to compare against a sample of your blood collected after the transplant is
           complete, to make sure you have not developed an immune system reaction against these
           mouse protein antibodies.

        -  You will have a chest x-ray to check for pneumonia.

        -  You will have an ECG to check your heart function.

      Before the T-cell infusion and up to 2 times within 24 hours after the T-cell infusion, blood
      (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your body's response to the T cell infusion.

      Follow-Up:

      Within about 12 hours, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the T-cell infusion, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed. These tests will be repeated again if the T-cell
      infusion is repeated.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  During the physical exam, you will be checked for possible reactions to the study
           therapy, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when the donor cells
           attack the cells of the recipient's body.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for research to look for
           the genetically changed T-cells and to count the number of B-cells (other white blood
           cells) and other non-changed T-cells.

      Up to 3 times during the first 7 days after the T-cell infusion, blood (about 4 tablespoons)
      will be drawn to measure your body's response to the T cell infusion.

      Every 2 weeks during the first month, then 1 time a month until 1 year after the T-cell
      infusion, blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for tests of your immune system.

      At about 6 weeks, and then 1, 2, and 3 months after the T-cell infusion:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to the study therapy, such as GVHD.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

      At about 3 months after the T-cell infusion, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check
      for HAMA, and you will have breathing tests to check your lung function.

      At least 1 time during the 3 months after the T-cell infusion:

        -  You will have a PET-CT scan and/or a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have other tests and procedures to check
           your health, such as a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

      If the disease comes back or a side effect occurs during the 12 months after the T-cell
      infusion, you may be asked to return for additional follow-up visits if the doctor thinks it
      is needed.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 3 courses of study therapy. You will no longer be able to receive the
      study therapy if the disease gets worse, if infections or intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions. You may withdraw from the study at any time,
      but the infusion of the T cells is not necessarily reversible and these types of products
      have the potential for long-term survival in the body. If you withdraw from the study it will
      only include withdrawal from any procedures specifically preformed for this protocol and
      long-term follow-up. Please note, long-term follow-up is important for your safety.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      For safety reasons, the FDA requires patients receiving gene transfer to have long-term
      follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. You will be asked to sign
      a separate consent form (Protocol 2006-0676) for long-term follow up that begins 1 year after
      this study ends.

      This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy drugs in this study are commercially
      available and FDA approved for the treatment of B-cell leukemia or lymphoma. The gene
      transfer (infusion with genetically modified T-cells) is not commercially available or FDA
      approved. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 42 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
