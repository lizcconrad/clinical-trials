  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Botulinum toxin injections (BoNT-A) has become a standard therapy for children and
      youth who suffer from stiffness of their muscles due to a neurological problem. These
      injections are given into each muscles which require treatment, which often means receiving
      multiple injections in one session. Intramuscular injections are typically painful. Treatment
      can be provided unsedated and then should incorporate distraction and relaxation techniques,
      or can be alternatively be provided with the use of sedation.

      To improve the pain experience the investigators want to assess the feasibility and impact on
      the pain perception when using a vibration device called the Buzzy during BoNT-A injections.
      The Buzzy creates a vibration that is applied over the injection site for 30 seconds before
      the injection and will be continued just above the injection site during the injection. The
      Buzzy has been shown to help reduce pain in procedures such as i.v. insertions and
      immunizations, but has not been tested in children and youth receiving multiple BoNT-A
      injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and youth who receive hypertonia treatment with non-sedated BoNT-A injection will be
      invited to participate in this clinical trial. The patients will be randomized to receiving
      the injection with the Buzzy versus the control group without the Buzzy. Both groups will
      still receive their typical supports that will include their choice of local anesthetic
      cream, relaxation and distraction techniques. Randomization will be stratified for the
      ability to self report.

      Measures to capture the pain will include self report of pain, by using the Face Pain Scale
      revised (FPSr) in all participants who are able to self report. In addition all participants
      will be evaluated by the use of the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability scale (FLACC
      scale), an observational tool validated to capture pain responses. The investigators will
      also include measurement of heart rate at rest, during and after the intervention.
