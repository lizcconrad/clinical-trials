  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer surgery is associated with presurgical psychological distress and clinically
      significant side effects including postsurgical pain, nausea and fatigue. A few studies have
      examined how to intervene to assist women undergoing breast cancer surgery. For example
      presurgical hypnosis has been proven to decrease side effects and even intraoperative
      anesthesia use. Besides the more psychologically based interventions there are a few studies
      suggesting positive effects of acupuncture on pain, anxiety and nausea in surgery
      patients.This study aims to investigate whether a presurgical relaxation training,
      acupuncture treatment or a combination of both therapies is able to reduce presurgical
      psychological distress an postsurgical side effects in breast cancer patients in comparison
      to usual care.
