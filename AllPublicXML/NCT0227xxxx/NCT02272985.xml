      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the hemodialysis procedure on cerebral
      blood flow (CBF) in elderly maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that HD induced blood pressure changes are associated with a fall in global
      and/or regional CBF during HD. Second, the investigators hypothesize that near infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) will correlate with CBF measured by[15O]H2O PET.

      The investigators aim to include 14 participants. Each participant will undergo a single HD
      study session in the PET center of the UMCG. During this study session, each participant will
      undergo three gated [15O]H2O PET-CT scans before, during (after 20 minutes) and at the end of
      the HD session. NIRS will be used to measure cerebral tissue regional oxygen saturation
      (rSO2) during the HD study session. INVOS (In Vivo Optical Spectroscopy), a monitoring
      device, will be used to measure rSO2, with sensors placed bilaterally on the patient
      forehead. Participants will further undergo a MRI scan of the brain, bilateral carotid artery
      duplex echosonography, cognitive testing, blood pressure and heart rate measurements during
      the HD study session, and laboratory measurements during the HD study session.
