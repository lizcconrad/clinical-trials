        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a healthy adult male or female volunteer between the ages of 18 and 45
             years, inclusive, at Screening.

          -  Subject has a body mass index of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening.

          -  Subject has hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis test results within the
             reference ranges or is showing no clinically relevant deviations, as judged by the
             investigator at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has clinically relevant abnormalities in the screening or check in
             assessments.

          -  Subject has a blood pressure (as measured at Screening during the collection of vital
             signs) after resting supine for at least 5 minutes that is higher than 140 mm Hg
             systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic, or lower than 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic
             (for males) and 50 mm Hg diastolic (for females).

          -  Subject has a supine pulse rate (as measured at Screening during collection of vital
             signs) after resting for 5 minutes that is outside the range of 40 to 90 beats per
             minute.
