        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male based upon a complete medical history, including the physical
             examination, regarding vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG measurement, and clinical
             laboratory tests. There is no finding deviating from normal and of clinical relevance.
             There is no evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease.

          -  Age ≥21 and ≤50 years

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG measurements)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

             randomisation

          -  Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day)

             the trial)

          -  Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre

        The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class side
        effect profile of ß2-mimetics:

          -  Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity

          -  Hyperthyrosis

          -  Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment
