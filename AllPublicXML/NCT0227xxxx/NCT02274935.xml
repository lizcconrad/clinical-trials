      This study examines the effect of balance and walking exercise on cognition and mobility in
      people with Multiple Sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking and cognitive impairments are common in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Approximately 85% of persons with MS report walking as a major limitation, whereas 65%
      experience cognitive dysfunction. Traditionally, walking and cognition have been viewed as
      unrelated, but there is evidence of cognitive-motor interference (CMI). CMI is believed to
      stem from damage to common neural tracts. Recent evidence supports cognitive-motor
      interference in persons with MS. For example, there is evidence that walking performance
      declines when performed in conjunction with a simultaneous cognitive task (i.e., dual task
      cost [DTC] of walking) and this decline in walking performance is greater in persons with MS
      compared to healthy controls. This elevated cognitive-motor interference during walking is
      mainly associated with walking performance in persons with MS although cognitive function
      does play a role. Cognitive-motor interference during mobility tasks is of practical and
      clinical importance because it has been linked to decreased community mobility and a greater
      risk of falls in other clinical populations. Despite the adverse consequences of elevated CMI
      there is ambiguity concerning prevention and rehabilitation strategies for cognitive-motor
      interference in individuals with MS.

      This study seeks to examine whether single and/or targeted dual task rehabilitation has a
      beneficial effect on CMI in individuals with MS. The results of this investigation will
      provide the foundation for future rehabilitation-based randomized control trials seeking to
      improve walking and cognitive function in persons with MS.

    <description>This will be operationalized as the percent change in walking velocity from single (walking only) to dual task (walking while thinking). Participants will complete a total of 8 walking trials over a 20' pressure sensitive (Zenoâ„¢) walkway. Four at a comfortable walking speed and four as fast as possible. Half of the trials at each speed will be conducted while reciting every other letter of the alphabet (i.e. N, P, R, etc).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:Physician diagnosed MS, relapse free for 30 days, self reporting
        problems with multitasking -

        Exclusion Criteria:We will exclude all individuals with risk factors contra-indicative for
        undertaking strenuous exercise. Participants will verbally respond to a health history
        questionnaire. Those individuals who are asymptomatic and meet no more than one risk factor
        threshold including family history of coronary heart disease, cigarette smoking,
        hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle will be
        considered at low risk and included for participation.
