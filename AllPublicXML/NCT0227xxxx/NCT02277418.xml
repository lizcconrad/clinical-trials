      The purpose of this study was to compare the Venner a.p. advance video laryngoscope to Miller
      laryngoscope during resuscitation with and without chest compressions.

      Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a life-saving procedure performed daily in emergency
      medicine. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) 2010 cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
      guidelines suggest that intubators should be able to secure the airway without interrupting
      chest compression. However, ETI with uninterrupted chest compression in patients can be a
      very difficult skill to acquire.
