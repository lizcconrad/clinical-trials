    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in eliminating any remaining
      cancer cells and preventing cancer from returning in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      that had a decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer after receiving
      chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block cancer growth in different
      ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare the progression free survival rate after randomization in the two
      treatment arms (nivolumab versus [vs.] observation).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine and compare the overall survival rates in the two arms. II. To determine and
      compare the incidence of non-relapse mortality in the two arms.

      III. To evaluate the toxicities of nivolumab as maintenance.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze programmed cell death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression on acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) cells from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples at diagnosis if available and at
      the time of study enrollment.

      II. To monitor AML minimal residual disease (MRD) by Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) at enrollment and at subsequent defined time points in the nivolumab-treated
      and control groups.

      III. To perform an exploratory analysis on the frequencies, absolute numbers and subsets of T
      cells (including regulatory T cells) in the nivolumab-treated and control groups with an
      emphasis on activation markers.

      IV. To perform deep sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha and TCR-beta chains on
      polyclonal T cells at baseline and at subsequent time points in the nivolumab and control
      groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 46 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care clinical observation for up to 2 years. Upon
      disease relapse, patients may cross-over to Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years, every
      6 months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter.

    <description>Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to estimate PFS in each arm and a stratified log rank test will be performed to compare the two groups. In addition, Cox proportional hazards models will be fit to provide estimates of the hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% confidence interval (CIs), both unadjusted and adjusted for baseline covariates. Descriptive, subset analysis of PFS will be performed for minimal residual disease (MRD) positive patients.</description>

    <description>For overall survival, Kaplan-Meier plots will be generated for each treatment arm and the curves will be compared using a log rank test. Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% CI will be summarized every 6 months using Greenwood's formula for the standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. In addition to the Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models will be fit to estimate HRs and to assess and adjust for the effects of covariates. Descriptive, subset analysis of OS will be performed for MRD negative patients.</description>

    <description>NRM will be analyzed using competing risks models with deaths due to relapse as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence curves will be generated and treatment effects summarized using the sub-distribution hazard ratio with and without adjustment for covariates</description>

    <description>Summary tables for adverse events (AEs) will include only AEs that started or worsened after randomization. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (new or worsening from baseline after randomization) will be summarized by system organ class and/ or preferred term, severity (based on CTCAE grades), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment by treatment group. Toxicity rates will be compared between the two treatment arms via chi-squares or Fisher's exact tests.</description>
