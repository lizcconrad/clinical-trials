  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that an intervention, within an established patient-centered
      medical home, aimed at reducing modifiable risks for hospitalization, can decrease hospital
      utilization among medically complex children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will pilot test an intervention that includes contingency planning and care
      transitions within an established medical home program caring for children with medical
      complexity. Children with medical complexity receiving care within the UCLA Medical Home
      Program will be randomized to the pilot intervention or usual medical home care. The primary
      goal will be to reduce admissions and readmissions in the intervention group.
