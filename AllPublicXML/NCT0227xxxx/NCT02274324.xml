  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the role of dietary modifications of 3 different diets on clinical outcomes in
      patients with PD treated with Duodopa®. This is in search for an optimal diet that will
      accompany Duodopa® treatment and will optimize effect on fluctuations and dyskinesias and
      thus improve motor function and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective single-blind-crossover study in patients with PD regularly treated with
      Duodopa® (LICG) in which three different diets will be given. Diet A: Low fat western diet -
      traditional low-fat Western diet; a normal diet according to the recommendations of health
      organizations in which proteins consumed throughout the day, high-protein meal at noon and in
      the evening.

      Diet B: Equal protein redistribution diet (EPRD) - proteins consumption is controlled and
      equally distributed over six meals throughout the day to minimize motor fluctuations.

      Diet C: Protein redistribution diet (PRD) in which proteins are consumed in the morning prior
      to connection to the pump and in the evening after disconnecting from the . Carbohydrates and
      fats will be consumed during the day.

      Following recruitment and study initiation patients will consume diet A for 3 weeks. Patients
      will then be randomized into either diet B or diet C for 3 additional weeks. At completion of
      this period patients will consume diet A for 2 weeks (&quot;wash-out&quot; period) and will then be
      &quot;crosseovered&quot; to get the third diet (B or C).
