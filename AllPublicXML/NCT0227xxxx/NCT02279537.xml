  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect real-life data on patients with wet age related
      macular degeneration (AMD) for whom treatment with Eylea was initiated
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is both retrospective and prospective to collect local real life data on patients
      under routine treatment. The observation period starts on January 2014. Patients who have
      received the 1st injection with Eylea from January 2014 will be enrolled.

      Patients will be followed up for a period of 48 months or until it is no longer possible
