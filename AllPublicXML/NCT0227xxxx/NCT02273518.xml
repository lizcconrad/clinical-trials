        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants in the study should be healthy males or females, range from 21 to 50
             years of age and be within ± 20 % of their normal weight (Broca-Index)

             good clinical practice (GCP) and the local legislation, their written informed consent

          -  Subsequently each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a
             complete medical examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as
             well as a 12-lead ECG

          -  Hematopoietic, hepatic and renal function tests will be carried out in the laboratory

          -  The subjects will fast for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory
             evaluations

          -  Volunteers are excluded from the study if the results of the medical examination or
             laboratory tests are judged by the clinical investigator to differ significantly from
             normal clinical values
