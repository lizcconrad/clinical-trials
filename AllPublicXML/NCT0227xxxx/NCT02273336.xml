    <textblock>
      This research trial studies genomic analysis in tissue and blood samples from young patients
      with lung cancer. Identifying specific gene mutations (changes in deoxyribonucleic acid
      [DNA]) may help doctors tailor treatment to target the specific mutations and help plan
      effective treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform comprehensive genomic analysis of young lung cancer patients' samples to
      facilitate delivery of targeted therapies and clinical trial enrollment.

      II. To characterize the impact of young age at lung cancer diagnosis on the genomic landscape
      of primary lung cancer.

      III. To establish a prospective registry of young lung cancer patients for both tumor and
      germline next generation sequencing.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue and blood samples are analyzed via next generation sequencing and whole exome
      sequencing.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  COHORT 1: LUNG CANCER PATIENTS

          -  Pathologically confirmed bronchogenic lung carcinoma (small cell lung cancer [SCLC] or
             non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] of any stage) at any treatment time point

          -  For individuals diagnosed with advanced disease (stage IV or recurrent) enrollment
             must occur within 2 years of diagnosis

          -  For appropriate patients (stage IV non-squamous NSCLC) epidermal growth factor
             receptor (EGFR ) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genotyping performed by a
             Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory is recommended
             prior to participation

          -  Provision of written informed consent

          -  Willingness to undergo a single blood draw

          -  Individuals who are under 18 are eligible for study if they meet the defined criteria
             for cohort 1; in addition, consent for participation must be given by a legal guardian
             or parent

               -  NOTE: to be eligible for genomics, availability of 10 unstained slides (plus
