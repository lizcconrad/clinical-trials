Omnaris™ nasal spray: 50 μg per actuation, two actuations in each nostril once daily (200 μg per day) for 14 days.
Placebo nasal spray: 0 μg per actuation, two actuations in each nostril once daily for 14 days.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Signs or symptoms of nasal polyps, deviated septum, or any other condition which, in
