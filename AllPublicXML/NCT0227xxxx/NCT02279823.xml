    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's evaluation of treatment benefit via the HGI and HGSS questionnaires at Month 6.
HGI: Hair growth is compared from baseline by three questions on a health outcome questionnaire, which are scored using the following 7-point scale: much less (-3), moderately less (-2), slightly less (-1), the same amount (0), slightly more (1), moderately more (2), much more (3).
HGSS: Hair appearance/growth is compared from baseline by five questions, which are scored using the following 7-point scale: very dissatisfied (-3), dissatisfied (-2), somewhat dissatisfied (-1), neutral/neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (0), somewhat satisfied (1), satisfied (2), very satisfied (3).</description>
