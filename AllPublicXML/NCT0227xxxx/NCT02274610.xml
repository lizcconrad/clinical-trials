          -  Patient should voluntarily sign a written informed consent before study entry

          -  Patient historically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor and
             patient with measurable disease or evaluable disease by RECIST criteria

          -  Progressive disease with development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting
             lesions or standard therapy in order to provide clinical benefit does not exist or is
             no longer effective

          -  Previous anti-cancer therapies must be completed before 21days of first study dose and
             Patient must have recovered from any previous therapy

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1

          -  Patient has a life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Baseline studies for determining eligibility must be completed within 14 days of first
             study dose and patient has a adequate organ function including the following:

               -  Hb ≥ 10g/dl

               -  ANC ≥ 1.5 X 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 X 109/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has had a major surgery except tumor ablation within 2 weeks before screening
             visit

          -  Patient has a brain metastasis with neurologic symptom

          -  Patient has a sensory neuropathy or motor neuropathy ≥ grade 2 by NCI-CTCAE

          -  Patient has any serious concurrent disease such as:

        Any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
        prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent Severe cardiovascular disease
        (e.g. ischemic heart disease requiring medication or myocardial infraction within the past
        six months, grade 3-4 congestive heart failure defined by the New York Heart Association
        criteria) Active un controlled infection.

             method of birth control or do not agree to continue use of this method throughout the
             trial (screening, treatment period, and 3 weeks from the last done). A negative
             pregnancy test (urine or serum) should be documented within 14 days prior to
             initiation of trial medication for women of childbearing potential who have not been
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months prior to registration into the trial or surgically
             sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). Medically
