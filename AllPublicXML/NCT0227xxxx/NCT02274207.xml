    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test therapeutic benefits of silver dressing compared with
      non-silver dressing in NPWT(Negative pressure wound therapy). Silver dressing may
      antibacterial effect on infected diabetes mellitus foot.

      Investigator will recruit sixty patients. Participant will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. One is using silver dressing group in NPWT, another is using non-silver dressing
      group in NPWT. Participant will visit in screening day, NPWT apply day and F/u day for 4
      months. Investigators will conduct to check the wound base, Lab, wound culture.
