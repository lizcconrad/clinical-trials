      Aim/hypothesis: Subcutaneous insulin absorption is one of the factors which strongly
      influence blood sugar control in patients with diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy. In
      response, a regular absorption is influenced by lipo-hypertrophy in subcutaneous tissue on
      injection sites. So far lipo-hypertrophy diagnosis has only been clinical since there are no
      imaging studies that have characterized precisely morphometry of lipo-hypertrophic tissue.
      Methods: In two groups of 20 type 1 diabetes patients on insulin therapy, lipo-hypertrophy is
      characterized and defined by clinical tapping or by ultrasound with multi frequency linear
      probe (6-18 Mhz). Patients are therefore advised to avoid insulin injections on those areas
      so defined. Patients are reevaluated 3 and 12 months later

      An observational study has been carried out, checked with parallel arms in which type 1
      diabetes patients are recruited with clinical evidence of lypo-hypertrophy in insulin
      injected areas. Patients attend to the Diabetes Unit of Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital. Obese
      patients with a thickening fat subcutaneous tissue that could have interfered with the
      interpreting and analyzing of the data are left out of this first study. In the control group
      the investigators manage to define the lypo-hypertrophic area by tapping and body inspection.
      In the study group the investigators can define and mark out the area/areas with
      lipo-hypertrophy by ultrasound scan test. All the tested patients both the control group and
      the study group, are discouraged from use insulin in areas where lypo-hypertrophy is present.
      Patients are reassessed after 3 months with a clinical assessment of glucose control by
      HbA1c. After 12 months subcutaneous tissue scan is repeated in 10 patients within the
      experimental group and a new assessment of HbA1c is performed. Ultrasound assessment. The
      scan used is Esaote My Lab70 linear probe multi-frequency [6-18 Mhz)
