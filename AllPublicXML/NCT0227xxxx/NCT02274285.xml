      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates (Hib antigen (PRP),
           Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis antigens (PT and FHA), and polio types 1, 2 and 3
           antigens) of investigational arm (Group A: DTaP-IPV/Hib) versus control arm (Group B:
           DTaP-IPV and Hib vaccines administered at separate sites), one month after the primary
           vaccination (all antigens).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe immune responses against all vaccine antigens with no pre-specified
           hypothesis, and at all time points (pre-dose 1, post-dose 3, pre-dose 4 and post-dose 4)
           in the two study groups (Group A and Group B).

        -  To describe the safety after each dose of each vaccine in the two study groups (Group A
           and Group B).

        -  To describe immune responses against all vaccine antigens with no pre-specified
           hypothesis, and at all time points (pre-dose 1, post-dose 3, pre-dose 4 and post-dose 4
           (Group C)

      Participants will be enrolled in two steps (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Step one will enroll
      Cohort 1 made of 40 participants randomized in two groups with a 1:1 ratio.

      After review of the local and systemic adverse events occurring during the 7 Days following
      the first dose administered in these subjects, 2nd vaccination of Cohort 1 participants will
      resume and enrollment of the participants of Cohort number 2 will start. Step two will enroll
      Cohort 2 made of subjects randomized in two groups with a 1:1 ratio.

      A sub-study Group C will be enrolled and will receive the vaccine by intramuscular route.
