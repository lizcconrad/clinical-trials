      The extension study follows the core study CAMN107ECN02, which is an open-label, two armed
      study. All patients enrolled in this extension study should be able to benefit from the
      treatment given in CAMN107ECN02 per investigator's evaluation. Therefore, in this extension
      study patient will continue treatment of the drug (imatinib or nilotinib) which they are
      taking at the end of CAMN107ECN02. Treatment arms in CAMN107ECN02 will be retained. As long
      as we get EC approval and agreement from investigators, the selected sites for CAMN107ECN02
      will be applied in this extension study.

      Patients will be enrolled after eligibility evaluation. During the study, follow-up visits at
      a frequency of 6 months are required referring to the core study and recommendation in
      Chinese CML guideline. No data collection plan is included in this extension study except
      safety data. Investigator will be asked to report AE, SAE and pregnancy in order to ensure
      compliance with pharmacovigilance requirement. AE&amp;SAE information will be recorded in CRF and
      included in clinical database. In addition, SAE and pregnancy will be reported to Novartis
      safety database.

      The extension study will start from first patient last dose date in CAMN107ECN02 and end at
      the time of nilotinib first line treatment commercially available in China.

      The patients who can continue to derive benefit from the study treatment that he/she takes in
      CAMN107ECN02, in the opinion of the investigator, at the end of the core study can be
      enrolled in this extension study. The investigator or designee must ensure that only patients
      who meet all the following inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are offered treatment
      in the study.

      Up to 230 patients will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria：

      Patients eligible for inclusion in this extension phase have to meet all of the following
      criteria:

        1. Patient is currently on treatment in the core study CAMN107ECN02

        2. Patient who continues to derive benefit more than risk from the study treatment he/she
           takes in CAMN107ECN02, in the opinion of the investigator at the end of the study

        3. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to enrolling in the extension study
           Exclusion criteria：

      Patients eligible for this extension phase must not meet any of the following criteria:

        1. Progression to CML-AP or BC

        2. Patient whose treatment assigned in CAMN107ECN02 is not appropriate any longer, per
           investigator's assessment.

        3. History of non-compliance to medical regimens, or patients who are considered
           potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative.

        4. Women who are (a) pregnant and(b) women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women
           physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective
           methods of contraception during dosing and at least 14 days after last dose of study
           medication. Highly effective contraception methods include:

             -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

             -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

             -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on

             -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                  1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                     forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate
                     &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

                  2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                  3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                     cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository
                     In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                     pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

      Investigational and reference therapy：Nilotinib (300mg BID，400mg QD) and imatinib（recommended
      on 600mg QD，400mg QD and 300mg QD）
