      The purpose of this study is to determine how appropriate and practically is the EQ-5D
      questionnaire in use on patients with carpal tunnel syndrome undergoing surgery along the
      change of quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is one of the most indications in hand surgery. To rate
      surgery's outcome, hand-specific instruments like the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ) are
      used as well as questionnaires which refers to the quality of life (QOL). In clinical daily
      grind, the SF-12 or the EQ-5D are common instruments to gain information about the patient's
      QOL. At the time, there is no current evidence available while using standardized
      questionnaires like the EQ-5D to capture the change in QOL in patients with CTS undergoing
      surgery. It would be interesting to assert that the investigation offers results about the
      patient's QOL and its change. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the
      psychometric properties of the EQ-5D on patients with CTS undergoing surgery.
