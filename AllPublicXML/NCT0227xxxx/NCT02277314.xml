  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to determine the visual outcomes and cost to perform Manual Small
      Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS) in a small cohort at an academic medical center in the
      United States. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of the study group
      achieving a post operative visual acuity 20/40 Snellen. This percentage will be compared to
      historical cohorts reported for phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS), when performed in
      academic centers. A secondary outcome will be to determine the actual institutional cost of
      providing MSICS in the setting of an academic medical center. The hypothesis is that MSICS is
      appropriate for a teaching environment (as evidenced by a comparable rate of 20/40 acuity or
      better at 90 days post op, as compared to PCS), and can be provided at a cost that makes
      visual rehabilitation affordable to the uninsured and underinsured.

      The investigator will perform a study of a pilot implementation of portions of the Aravind
      method of promoting access to care and provision of surgical services in the setting of an
      academic medical center teaching program. Target enrollment is 100 subjects having cataracts.
      Potential subjects will be identified through vision screening programs and if cataracts are
      found they will be offered MSICS at a price deemed to be affordable by individuals without
      insurance.

      A survey of Pima County providers found that $3500 was the lowest price offered to a self-pay
      patient for one-stage cataract extraction (CPT 66984) for PCS facility fee, surgeon fee, and
      anesthesia fee. The expectation is that MSICS can be delivered in a teaching environment at a
      cost of $500. The investigator wishes to determine if this price point is sustainable and if
      a continuing model of cataract visual rehabilitation service delivery can be safely,
      affordably, and ethically delivered to those who cannot afford to pay, while integrating
      resident education and autonomy into the delivery model.

      The proposed outcome measure is the proportion of eyes that see 20/40 or better while wearing
      glasses for those participants that do not have comorbid conditions.

    <description>This cost-effective solution for removing cataracts, also known as Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS), is a positive alternative when Phaco is not an option due to costs. The procedure takes approximately 30 minutes and involves a mid-size incision and an intraocular lens (IOL), or artificial lens, replacing the natural lens. Following the procedure, patients may need glasses, and most will need bifocals, but overall vision will be significantly improved.</description>
