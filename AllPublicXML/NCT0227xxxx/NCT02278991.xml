        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects will be included if all of the following inclusion criteria
        apply:

          1. Age ≥18 years;

             agrees to participation and the study's provisions, and has duly signed the Informed
             Consent Form (ICF);

          3. Rutherford Category 2-4;

          4. Target de novo lesion(s) or non-stented restenotic lesion(s) has angiographic evidence
             of ≥50% stenosis or occlusion (by visual estimate) and is amenable to treatment with
             LifeStent® and Lutonix DCB;

          5. Patients must be able to be treated with Lutonix DCB and LifeStent®;

          6. Total Lutonix DCB treated segment(s) of 10-24 cm in length;

          8. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle free from significant lesion
             (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography (treatment of outflow disease is NOT
             permitted; treatment of in-flow disease is permitted prior to treatment with
             LifeStent®).

          9. No other prior vascular interventions (including contralateral limb) within 2 weeks
             before and/or planned 30 days after the protocol treatment, with the exception of
             remote common femoral patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the target
             lesion;

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test within 7 days prior to index procedure;

         11. Lesion location starts ≥1 cm below the common femoral bifurcation and terminates
             distally ≤2 cm below the tibial plateau AND ≥1 cm above the origin of the
             tibioperoneal trunk.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant, lactating, or planning on becoming pregnant or men intending to father
             children;

          3. Life expectancy of &lt;1 year;

          4. Inability to take required antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications per the LifeStent®
             and Lutonix DCB IFU, or known contraindication (including allergic reaction) or
             sensitivity to contrast media, nickel, titanium or tantalum that cannot be adequately
             managed with pre- and post-procedure medication;

          5. Intended treatment of outflow disease during the index procedure;

          6. Intended use of laser, atherectomy or cryoplasty during index procedure;

          7. Sudden symptom onset, acute vessel occlusion, or acute or subacute thrombus in target
             vessel;

          8. History of stroke within 3 months;

          9. History of myocardial infarction, thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of enrollment;

         10. Participation in an investigational drug or another investigational device study until
             this study's (Lutonix LifeStent® Study) primary endpoint is reached or previous
             enrollment in this study;

         11. Another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may cause the
             patient to be noncompliant with the CIP or confound data interpretation;

         12. Target vessel and/or lesion involves a previously placed stent.
