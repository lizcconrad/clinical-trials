      The purpose of this exploratory study is to compare the combination of a wrist orthosis with
      either ultrasound therapy or paraffin bath therapy in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome
      patients. We hypothesized that ultrasound therapy might be more effective than paraffin
      therapy because it provides both thermal and nonthermal effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients to have subjective symptoms (such as pain and/or numbness in the median nerve
             distribution of the digits or nocturnal pain). Furthermore, patients were required to
             have either a positive Phalen's sign or a positive Tinel's sign along with
             electrophysiological evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) age younger than 18 years old; (2) underlying medical disorders, such as diabetes
             mellitus, renal failure, autoimmune disease or hypothyroidism; and (3) pregnancy,
             previous wrist trauma or surgery.
