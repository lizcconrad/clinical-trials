      The purpose of the Improving Mood in Veterans in Primary Care (IIR 14-047) is to evaluate a
      brief educational individual workshop that is meant to help Veterans better understand
      feelings of sadness and ways to improve their mood. This study is intended to evaluate and
      establish the workshop's effectiveness for use with Veterans in primary care settings.

      The study involves up to 6 in-person meetings and 6 telephone interviews across a 6-month
      period of time. Approximately 144 Veterans will participate in the study. Using a procedure
      like the flip of a coin, the participants will have a one in two chance of receiving the
      brief educational workshop or treatment as usual condition.

      Background:

      Depressive symptoms are the most common referral problem to integrated mental health
      providers within Veteran primary care clinics. Although there exist several empirically-based
      brief psychotherapies for depression in primary care, the most significant barrier to
      providing those psychotherapies is treatment duration (e.g., the treatments range from 6-8
      sessions of 30-50 minutes) as it does not match typical treatment formats delivered by mental
      health providers working in primary care (i.e., 1-4 15-30 minute sessions). Therefore, this
      HSR&amp;D study titled, RCT of Behavioral Activation for Depression and Suicidality in Primary
      Care, will examine the effectiveness of a brief version of an existing efficacious longer
      treatment for depression, called behavioral activation.

      Objectives:

      The overarching objectives of this study are to: 1) examine whether a 4-session manualized
      behavioral activation intervention (BA-PC) compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) is effective
      in reducing self-reported depressive symptoms and subjective secondary outcomes such as sleep
      impairment and quality of life; 2) examine patient satisfaction, engagement, and receptivity
      to a 4-session BA-PC; and 3) explore the impact of BA-PC on suicidal ideation.

      Methods:

      The study will achieve these objectives using a randomized, controlled trial study design
      that has two conditions (4-session BA-PC and Treatment as Usual). Veterans will be recruited
      from three VA primary care settings in the Western portion of VISN 2 (Syracuse, Rochester,
      and Buffalo). The primary inclusion criteria for the study will be a report of depressive
      symptoms by primary care patients, who are not currently engaged in psychological treatment
      for depression. A total of 136 Veterans will be targeted for randomization. All Veterans will
      be assessed every 2 weeks for changes in mood and more comprehensive assessments will be
      completed at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

      Status:

      Recruitment has ended as of 2/26/18 with 140 participants being randomized. Follow-up will
      continue for another 24 weeks. We are preparing the data for analysis.
