  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A digital rectal exam proficiency tool, titled the 'DiRECT' was developed based on the
      consensus of 10 experts. The purpose of this study is to validate this tool for use in both
      undergraduate and graduate medical education .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, it will be validated on 120 anesthetized patients undergoing prostate surgery,
      comparing responses on the digital rectal exam clinical tool (DiRECT) from both expert and
      novice clinicians, with surgical pathology reports. The second phase of validation will
      involve the participation of standardized patients, medical students and MUTA (medical
      urology teaching associate). During a standardized patient exercise focusing on digital
      rectal exam in the University of Virginia School of Medicine curriculum, 160 second-year
      medical students will be given the DiRECT to document their examination. An attending
      physician will also attend the standardized patient exercise and document their examination
      for comparison with the medical students.

      The third phase includes 8 residents and up to10 attendings in the Urology clinic, who will
      independently complete the DiRECT documenting their DRE in the course of usual care.

      Comparison of faculty and student/trainee responses in all phases will be used for validation
      of the clinical tool for further use in medical education.

    <description>The DRE digital rectal exam is an essential component of physical examination, but physicians enter their residency having neither been appropriately exposed nor trained in performing DREs. , the attending physician, resident physician(s), and medical student(s) will each perform a digital rectal exam on the subject, and independently document their examination on the DiRECT instrument.</description>
