    <textblock>
      Although EGDT goals appeared to have been achieved, severe derangements of organ perfusion
      were detected by SDF technique.An abnormal microvascular flow index was present in 17% of
      patients in ICU . Microcirculatory alterations are stronger predictors of outcome than global
      hemodynamic variables.Improvement of microcirculatory dysfunction is a big challenge to
      clinician. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist for sedation of
      adult critically ill patients which exhibits sedative and analgesic effects. Recent studies
      suggest that dexmedetomidine to restore adrenergic vasoconstrictor responsiveness in septic
      shock, and prevents alterations of pain rat model intestinal microcirculation Induced by
      surgical stress，even it can reduce the mortality of endotoxemic rats and patients with severe
      sepsis. The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to investigate the effect of
      dexmedetomidine on microcirculatory dysfunction in early septic shock patients with relative
      stable hemodynamics.

      thirty patients with septic shock will be enrolled . After sufficient fluid resuscitation and
      hemodynamic stabilization for 24 hours, these patients who required sedation will receive
      continuous infusion of two dose of dexmedetomidine (infusion rate 0.3 and 0.6 mcg/kg/h) for 1
      hours as needed. The sublingual microcirculation and serum level of catecholamine will be
      examined at preset time points. The vital signs, hemodynamic parameters will be recorded and
      analyzed.

      The enrolled thirty patients with septic shock will be treated according to the SSC
      guideline. After sufficient fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization for 24 hours,
      the initial sublingual microcirculation ,serum level of catecholamine and hemodynamic
      variables will be examined as beseline,then these patients will receive continuous infusion
      of dexmedetomidine (infusion rate 0.3 mcg/kg/h) for one hour, above parameters will be
      examined again. Dose escalation to 0.6 mcg/kg/h,above examination is repeated.At last,stop
      continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine for two hours, above parameters will be recorded
      again. Systemic or pulmonary hemodynamic variables, microcirculatory flow variables, blood
      gases, and vasoactive agent requirements were determined at baseline and after
      dexmedetomidine administration
