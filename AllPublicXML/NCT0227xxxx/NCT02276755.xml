      The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the preventive role of vitamin D
      supplementation in school age children in a high transmission setting. The investigators
      hypothesis is that (1) vitamin D supplementation will reduce rate of acquisition of LTBI, (2)
      vitamin D supplementation will lead to greater reductions in active TB incidence, and (3)
      children with the lowest vitamin D status at baseline will gain most from the intervention.
