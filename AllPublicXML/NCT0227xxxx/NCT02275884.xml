      This study evaluates plasma concentrations of pharmacologically active constituents of
      chocolate and their effects on motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Following
      one week of abstinence from cocoa-containing products, patients with Parkinson's disease will
      be randomized to receive either dark or white chocolate. After one week of chocolate
      consumption, patients will then cross over to white or dark chocolate, respectively, and take
      the corresponding chocolate product for another week. Blood samples will be taken at
      baseline, week 1 and week 2 to examine plasma concentrations of pharmacologically active
      constituents of chocolate at all three timepoints. Moreover, patients will be clinically
      examined for motor and non-motor symptoms at all visits.
