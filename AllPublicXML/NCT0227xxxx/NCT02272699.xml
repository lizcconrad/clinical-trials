  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of common malignant tumors in China and esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma (ESCC) is the dominant pathological type, accounting for more than 95% of all
      cases. One of our phase Ⅱ study introduced a combination treatment of an anti epithelial
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) agent, nimotuzumab, with paclitaxel and cisplatin as first-line
      treatment in unresectable or metastatic ESCC. The results showed that the overall response
      rate was 51.8% (29/56) and disease control rate was 92.9% (52/56). As a median follow-up of
      24 months, the median progression-free survival for patients with metastatic disease and
      local advanced disease were 8.2 months and more than 23 months respectively. The overall
      survival for patients with metastatic disease was 13.9 months. It implied that as first-line
      chemotherapy, an addition of nimotuzumab to chemotherapy was a more active treatment option
      compared to other regimens published in previous studies. Investigations by Liang, J. and
      Ling, Y. also suggested that nimotuzumab in combining with radiotherapy or chemotherapy also
      showed anti-tumor activities and limited toxicities.

      Therefore, we initiated this phase Ⅱ to Ⅲ clinical trial in which combining neoadjuvant
      treatments of nimotuzumab with chemotherapy or nimotuzumab with radiotherapy are compared
      with surgery alone for resectable stage Ⅱa to Ⅲ middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma patients. We hope to explore if these neoadjuvant combination treatments could
      bring survival benefit for ESCC patients.
