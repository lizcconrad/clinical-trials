  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular schwannoma (VS) is a benign tumour from Schwann cells surrounding the vestibular
      nerve, which slowly grows within the internal auditory canal and then into the
      cerebellopontine angle, leading to a gradual vestibular dysfunction. The slowly progressive
      alteration of vestibular function allows the gradual implementation of central adaptive
      mechanisms called vestibular compensation. The total unilateral vestibular deafferentation
      induced by the surgical tumour removal suddenly leads to a decompensation of this previously
      compensated situation, which explains why most patients report severe vertigo immediately
      after surgery and which is responsible for perturbations of the postural control
      (Parietti-Winkler et al., 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011). Recently, Gauchard et al. (2013) suggested
      that preoperative and regular physical activity would limit the adverse effects of surgical
      removal on balance control. Also, patients benefited faster and better from the postoperative
      vestibular rehabilitation.

      Thus, preoperative vestibular rehabilitation, including physical and balance exercises, could
      help to limit postoperative balance disorders and promote postoperative balance compensation.
      This could lead to a decrease in the duration and cost of the postoperative management and
      faster improvement of quality of life.

      To test this hypothesis, the measured and perceived balance control of the patient and the
      quality of life will be assessed into two groups: one of two groups will receive preoperative
      vestibular rehabilitation, carried out by a physiotherapist, and the other not. The
      assessments will be conducted 45 days and 3 days before surgery, and then 8 days, 30 days, 90
      days and 365 days after surgery.
