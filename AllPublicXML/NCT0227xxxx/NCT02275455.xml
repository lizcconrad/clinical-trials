  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide prevalence of autism is constantly increasing. People with autisms have
      difficulties in communication and social interaction resulting from atypical perceptual and
      information processing, leading to the accumulation of anxiety. Extreme overloading
      experienced internally may not be visible externally. Identifying stressful situations at an
      early stage may avoid socially problematic behavior from occurring, such as self-injurious
      behavior. Activation of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) is involved in the response to
      anxiety, which can be measured through heart rate variability and skin conductance with the
      use of a portable device, non-intrusively and pain-free. Thus, developing innovative analysis
      of signal perception and reaction is necessary, mainly for the non-communicative individuals
      with autism.

      The protocol will take place in real life (home and social environments). We aim to associate
      modifications of ANS with external events which will all be recorded in a synchrony manner
      through a specific design (spy glasses with video/audio recording). Four phases will be
      carried out on autism participants and aged-marched controls: 1) 24-hour baseline
      pre-experiment (physical activity, sleep), 2) 2-hour in real life situation, 3) 30-minute in
      a quiet environment, interrupted by a few seconds stressful sound, 4) an interview to get
      comments and feelings about events that triggered anxiety. Autism and control participants
      will be together for phases 2 and 3, revealing different physiological responses to the same
      situations, and thus identifying potentially problematic events. We will apply the
      statistical analyses developed by our team on continuous ANS data. Detection of abrupt
      changes will allow segmenting the data in shorter time series of few minutes with a constant
      mean, and estimating their persistency or antipersistency through a piecewise constant
      fractal index. We will disentangle classes characterizing different behaviors such as
      anxiety, rest and physical activity.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clear autism spectrum disorder, based on the autism diagnostic interview - revised
             (ADI-R), the autism diagnostic observation schedule - generic (ADOS-G), and the
             Vineland adaptive behavior scales (VABS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  change in medical prescription in the previous 3 months and during the experiment.

        The same inclusion criteria will apply for the paired age and sex matched individuals with
        the exception of autism spectrum. The paired control will be chosen within the friends of
        individuals with autism. In case of difficulty to recruit controls, the psychologist
        referent may be served as control.
