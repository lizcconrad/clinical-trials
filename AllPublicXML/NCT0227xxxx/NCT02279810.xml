      medical students and medical staff.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, almost every second a transplanted kidney comes from a living donor (LDTx); in
      Europe it is 18.1%, but in Poland it is only 2% (0.6 for 1 million from living donors). The
      number of patients awaiting on kidney transplantation (KTx) is increasing, and the number of
      deceased donors is constantly at a low level. This disturbing situation should motivate the
      entire interdisciplinary health team to seek new solutions.

      In the study the investigators are examining how medical students and medical staff feel
      about the issues of organ transplantation, especially: organ shortage, cost of organ
      transplantation, definition of brain death.

      The investigators are planning to focus on the following specific questions:

      What is the level of knowledge about organ donation among participants? What are the
      sociodemographic, sociocultural and socioeconomic characteristics of listed as an Organ Donor
      and non-listed as an Organ Donor among medical staff and medical students? Evidence on the
      role of financial and other incentives in eliciting organ donation.
