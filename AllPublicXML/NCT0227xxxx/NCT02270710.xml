    <textblock>
      It is well known that the deregulation of immune responses plays a major role in many
      autoimmune diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The main objective of this
      protocol is to determine whether the expression and/or function of specific molecules are
      deregulated in the immune cells of patients with SLE. By examining IRF4, IRF5, IBP/Def6,
      SWAP-70, Rock1, Rock2, and specific signaling molecules involved in the responsiveness to sex
      hormones, the investigators hypothesize that the deregulation in the expression and function
      of these molecules will result in abnormalities in the functioning of the immune cells, which
      is a key factor in autoimmunity.

      Peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy controls and patients with SLE will be collected
      and compared in order to determine if specific immune cells (IL-17 and IL-21) are deregulated
      in patients with SLE and if this deregulation affects their functioning. Specifically, immune
      cells will be isolated from the blood and then subject to scientific testing (QPCR, Western
      blotting, immunofluorescence assays, ELISA and FACS analysis) to see if the expression and
      function of these cells is related to the mechanism behind SLE. This will be a case control
      study, where cases of SLE will be compared to controls of healthy volunteers to assess risk
      factors. As these healthy volunteers are providing samples solely for research purposes,
      there is no standard of care for these volunteers, with the exception of a positive HIV
      result during screening. The Department of Genetic Medicine will enroll healthy controls and
      the Hospital for Special Surgery will enroll subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
      for a comparative analysis of the two cohorts. Laboratory testing on all blood samples will
      be done at the Hospital for Special Surgery.
