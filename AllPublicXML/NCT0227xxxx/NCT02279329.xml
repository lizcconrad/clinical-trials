  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects male and female aged 50-85 with a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) or Bronchiectasis, or those with ≥ 10 pack/years smoking history
      will be imaged with CT and MRI for the development of tools to quantify and validate
      longitudinal in vivo magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes of COPD and Bronchiectasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD patients will be stratified into four groups: Gold Stage 0, Gold Stage I, Gold Stage II,
      and Gold Stage III. During a single 2-2 ½ hour visit, patient subjects will perform some or
      all of: 1) spirometry pre-and-post salbutamol and plethysmography, Lung Clearance Index,
      Airway Oscillometry (Airwave Oscillometry measures the mechanics of the respiratory system by
      superimposing a gentle multi-frequency airwave onto the patient's respiratory airflow.
      Measurements take no longer than 16 seconds and the patient simply breathes normally into a
      disposable mouthpiece for the duration of the test.) 2) 6MWT (including Borg questionnaire
      pre-and post-walk), 3) health status evaluation using a self-administered SGRQ and MMRC
      (Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale) 4) CT, and, 5) 3He MRI.

      Subjects will first provide written informed consent and then be screened for MRI
      compatibility and will complete: 1) Spirometry pre-salbutamol, SGRQ after inhaling 2-4 puffs
      (200-400μg) of the short-acting bronchodilator (eg. Salbutamol), 2) MRI, 3) CT. (Subjects
      will be taken by wheelchair to and from University Hospital, LHSC to decrease the potential
      for dynamic hyperinflation), 4) plethysmography and spirometry within 1 ½ hours of
      salbutamol. Vital signs will be performed. Because it is impossible to schedule imaging at
      the same time-point post-bronchodilator, subjects will be randomized to MR or CT 30 minutes
      post-salbutamol (1:1 ratio), to minimize bias.

    <intervention_name>Hyperpolarized Helium MRI</intervention_name>
    <description>Hyperpolarized helium-3 (3He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as another research approach for the non-invasive measurement of lung structure and function, including conduction of gas through airways and into airspaces. Preliminary studies suggest that 3He MRI may be ideally suited for longitudinal COPD research, which is a likely target application of this novel technology. 3He MRI provides a complementary and alternative method for evaluating COPD and may be superior to CT because it allows simultaneous visualization of both airway and airspace structure and function.</description>
