  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oesophagogastric cancer is a major cause of cancer related mortality, with an overall 5-year
      survival rate of 10% worldwide and patients are often diagnosed with locally advanced or
      metastasized disease at first presentation. For advanced oesophagogastric cancer
      fluoropyrimidines are the backbone of palliative chemotherapy and is commonly used in 2- or
      3-drug combinations .

      However, in clinical practice after progression on first line therapy, a substantial number
      of oesophagogastric cancer patients may not be able to start second line chemotherapy due to
      rapid clinical deterioration. Therefore, new triplets with high anti-tumor activity and low
      toxicity are urgently needed.

      Given the activity of capecitabine and oxaliplatin containing regimens and the potential of
      taxanes in oesophagogastric cancer, the investigators propose a phase I study combining
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin with Nab-paclitaxel.

      Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) can cause severe toxicities not only by the
      active agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) is a
      solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require
      premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated
      hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher
      dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration. It has
      proven activity in breast cancer, non small lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, as well as in
      gastric cancer models.

      Phase 1: To assess the safety and tolerability of Nab-paclitaxel added to oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine at their currently optimal doses.

      Phase 2: To determine the anti-tumor activity of Nab-paclitaxel when co-administered with
      oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with irresectable or metastasized oesophagogastric
      cancer in terms of progression free survival.

      Study design This is a single-center, open label, dose finding, phase I/II study.

      Intervention In the phase I part of the study, the dose of nab-paclitaxel in combination of
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin will be escalated in fixed increments according to the dose
      escalation scheme outlined below

      Dose level Nab-paclitaxel Capecitabine Oxaliplatin Minimum Day 1 and 8 14 days Day 1 and 8
      number of patients -1 40 mg/m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 -

        1. (starting) 60 mg/m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

        2. 80 mg/ m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

        3. 100 mg/ m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

        4. 120 mg/ m2 1000 mg/m2 65 mg/m2 3

      In the phase II part of the study the maximum tolerated dose from the phase I part of the
      study will be used in combination with fixed dosages of capecitabine and oxaliplatin;
      nab-paclitaxel day 1 and 8 according to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the phase 1 part
      of the study combined with capecitabine for 14 days at 1000mg/m2 twice daily and oxaliplatin
      day 1 and 8 65mg/m2.
