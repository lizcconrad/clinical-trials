  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traffic related air pollution is a well-recognised and much studied contributor to smog and
      is linked to a number of adverse health outcomes. Although traffic pollutants can travel long
      distances, exposure to the highest levels of the raw emissions can occur closest to the
      source; e.g. in a car in dense traffic conditions. Time spent in-vehicle may contribute up to
      half of commuters' daily exposure to certain air pollutants. Most new cars now have or allow
      for a cabin air filter, but it is not known how well cabin air filtration can reduce exposure
      to traffic-related air pollution.

      This intervention study will measure commuters' exposure to air pollutants in rush hour
      traffic. It will evaluate the impact of this exposure on stress hormones in saliva, and short
      term cardiopulmonary health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate variability and
      respiratory inflammation. It will also look at effects on cognition (mental processing and
      judgement) in this real world environment where any deficit could be important to safety. In
      addition, the study will examine whether cabin air filtration can reduce the exposure to
      traffic related air pollutants and result in improvements in short term cardiopulmonary and
      cognitive function. This research will contribute to our understanding of how this
      environment contributes to Canadians' overall air pollution exposure as well as the potential
      health impacts. It will also test a potentially valuable and economical means of reducing
      exposure to traffic related air pollution in a commuting environment. The study may also
      guide the future implementation of the use of cabin filters as an exposure reduction
      intervention.

      Overall Project Objectives:

      Can cabin air filtration effectively reduce exposure to traffic related air pollution? Does
      commuter exposure to air pollution affect short term stress, and cardiopulmonary and
      cognitive function? Can cabin air filtration mitigate the health effects of commuters'
      exposure to air pollution?

    <description>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) will be measured from continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings collected during the study protocol. ECG will be worn for the duration of the study day period (approximately 5 hours), including a period prior to exposure and following exposure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in neuropsychological Function</measure>
    <time_frame>5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of neuropsychological function can be achieved using a battery of mood and cognitive tests. The study will use a battery of tests that are comercially available through CANTAB, the mini-mental state exam designed by University of Cambridge. Battery will be administered before and after exposure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in endothelial function</measure>
    <time_frame>5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function will be assessed using the non-invasive, FDA approved Endo-Pat2000 instrument. Test administration involves continuous measurement of blood flow and vascular tone in the fingertips of both index fingers, before, during and after an occlusion of blood flow to the non-dominant hand. Blood flow is occluded using a standard blood pressure cuff positioned on the upper arm. Measures will be carried out before and after exposure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in levels of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis</measure>
    <time_frame>5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>In the present study, salivary cortisol will be assessed as a non-invasive measure of HPA axis activation. Saliva sample collection will be done with Salivette swabs twice before exposure, once during exposure and twice following exposure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxyde</measure>
    <time_frame>5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Lung inflammation will be assessed as the fraction of nitric oxide (NO) exhaled in the participants' breath using a portable, FDA approved, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurement device, the NIOX Mino. Measures will be carried out before and after exposure.</description>
