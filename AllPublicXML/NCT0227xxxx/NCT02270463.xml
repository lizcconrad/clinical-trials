    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open label multi-center study. Patients who are in their first
      complete remission (CR) following induction therapy will be treated with SL-401, which will
      be administered as a brief intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 28 days for 6 or
      more cycles. Stage 1 will consist of a period in which approximately 6-9 patients will be
      treated with SL-401 at 3 dose levels. During Stage 2, up to approximately 20 patients with
      minimal residual disease (MRD) in their bone marrow will be treated at a maximum tolerated
      dose or maximum tested dose in which multiple dose-limiting toxicities are not observed
      (identified in Stage 1).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a diagnosis of AML according to World Health Organization (WHO)
             criteria.

          2. The patient received any induction chemotherapy regimen and may have received
             post-remission consolidation therapy prior to screening.

          3. The patient has achieved a first or second CR or CRi. For patients without evidence of
             MRD in CR/CRi, CR (or CRi) must have been initially identified within 12 months prior
             to screening.

             OR The patient has achieved first or second CR or CRi with evidence of MRD as
             determined locally at least 6 months post stem cell transplant without evidence of
             acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease post-transplant and has not received
             immunosuppressant therapy for at least 14 days prior to SL-401 therapy.

          4. The patient has adverse risk disease or AML for which there is otherwise a substantial
             risk of relapse, which includes but is not limited to: adverse karyotype, FLT3
             internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, history of antecedent hematologic disorder
             (AHD), therapy-related AML, history of requiring more than 1 cycle of intensive
             induction chemotherapy to achieve first remission, and/or presence of persistent MRD
             (detected by cytogenetics, molecular markers, or flow cytometry) at any point after
             the initial induction cycle.

          5. For patients enrolling in Stage 2, the bone marrow evaluation determined locally
             within the previous 6 months indicates the presence of MRD.

          6. The patient is not considered to be an immediate candidate for allogeneic stem cell
             transplant as determined by the investigator.

          7. The patient is ≥18 years old.

          8. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (PS) of
             0-2.

          9. The patient has adequate organ function, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic
             function:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥institutional lower limit of normal as
                  measured by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or 2-dimensional (2-D)
                  echocardiography (ECHO) within 28 days prior to start of therapy and no
                  clinically significant abnormalities on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL

               -  Serum albumin ≥3.2 g/dL in the absence of receipt of (IV) albumin within the
                  previous 72 hours.

               -  Bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 × the upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) ≤2.5 × the ULN.

         10. The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve:

             • Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 0.5 × 10^9/L

         11. The patient is a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP) who has had a negative serum
             or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to SL-401 treatment (intervals shorter
             than 1 week are acceptable if required by institutional guidelines).

         12. A written and voluntarily signed informed consent must be obtained from the patient or
             legally authorized representative, in accordance with local regulations, before the
             initiation of any study related procedures. The patient or legally authorized
             representative must be able to read and understand the informed consent form (ICF).

         13. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements, including follow-up for survival assessment.

         14. The patient (male and female) agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the
             duration of time on the study, and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods
             for 2 months after the last infusion of SL-401.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a diagnosis of AML associated with karyotype t(15;17).

          2. The patient has persistent and clinically significant Grade ≥2 toxicities from
             induction or consolidation therapy (excluding alopecia, nausea, fatigue, and liver
             function tests [as mandated in the inclusion criteria]) not readily managed with
             supportive measures.

          3. The patient received treatment with another investigational agent within 14 days of
             screening.

          4. The patient previously received treatment with SL-401.

          5. The patient has an active malignancy and/or cancer history (excluding AML or
             antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) that may confound the assessment of the
             study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history (within 2 years of entry) with
             substantial potential for recurrence and/or ongoing active malignancy must be
             discussed with the Sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following neoplastic
             diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ (including
             superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder), cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia, organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease.

          6. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or
             any New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure,
             uncontrolled angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke
             within 6 months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically
             significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication).

          7. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications
             during the study.

          8. The patient has known active or suspected central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. If
             suspected, CNS leukemia should be ruled out with relevant imaging and/or examination
             of cerebrospinal fluid.

          9. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         10. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

         11. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active
             or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

         12. The patient is oxygen-dependent.

         13. The patient has any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.
