  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to determine whether Inferior Vena Cava analyzed by trans-thoracic
      echocardiography is an effective method to guide titrated fluid repletion in non critical
      patients, in order both to decrease post procedural significant hypotension rate and to avoid
      unnecessary fluid overload in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective surgical
      procedures

    <textblock>
      The setting is standard spinal anesthesia and corresponds to our first arm of the study, used
      as the control sample and statistical reference. During the induction phase, the patient is
      fitted with non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, three-lead ECG, pulse-oximetry and
      peripheral intravenous device. Data and vital signs are recorded and an infusion of
      crystalloid (NaCl 0.9% or Ringer's acetate) is given during the procedure until the beginning
      of the operation. Total amount of fluid is also recorded before and after the spinal
      anesthesia.

      In addition to the current clinical standard, for the second arm of the study, a
      trans-thoracic echocardiography is performed before spinal anesthesia, with the aim of
      assessing the patient's volume status; the exam is performed to assess size and collapsing of
      the Inferior Vena Cava during breathing cycle. According to different pre-established
      parameters, the patient is defined as fluid-responsive or unresponsive. If the patient is not
      responsive, investigators proceed to spinal anesthesia; otherwise they proceed to
      administration of crystalloid bolus (500 ml of NaCl 0.9% or Hartmann's solution). The patient
      may receive another bolus so as to reach a non-responsive pattern for echocardiographic
      evaluation.

If the patient is not responsive, investigators proceed to spinal anesthesia; otherwise they proceed to administration of crystalloid bolus (500 ml of NaCl 0.9% or Hartmann's solution). The patient may receive another bolus so as to reach a non-responsive pattern for echocardiographic evaluation. After echocardiography analysis of Inferior Vena Cava, patient is repleted with a pre-established bolus of fluid (500 ml of crystalloid).</description>

            <description>In addition to the current clinical standard, a Trans-Thoracic Echocardiography is performed before spinal anesthesia, with the aim of assessing the patient's volume status; the exam is performed to assess size and collapsing of the Inferior Vena Cava during breathing cycle. According to different pre-established parameters13, the patient is defined as fluid-responsive or unresponsive. If the patient is not responsive, investigators proceed to spinal anesthesia; otherwise they proceed to administration of crystalloid bolus (500 ml of NaCl 0.9% or Hartmann's solution). The patient may receive another bolus so as to reach a non-responsive pattern for echocardiographic evaluation. After echocardiography analysis of Inferior Vena Cava, patient is repleted with a pre-established bolus of fluid (500 ml of crystalloid).</description>
