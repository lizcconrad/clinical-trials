    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well voxel based diffusion tensor imaging in predicting
      response in patients with brain metastases undergoing whole-brain radiation therapy or
      stereotactic radiosurgery. Voxel based diffusion tensor imaging (VB-DTI) may allow doctors to
      measure response to whole brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery earlier than
      is possible with a standard magnetic resonance imaging. The earlier ability to measure
      response may allow for consideration of alternative therapies at an earlier stage.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if voxel based diffusion tensor imaging will provide an early predictive
      assessment of therapy response, as compared to radiographic volumetric response criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergoing whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for a total of 10 fractions also
      undergo VB-DTI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 1 week after WBRT initiation,
      and 7-11 days after completion of WBRT. Patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
      without WBRT also undergo VB-DTI MRI at baseline and 7-11 days after completion of SRS.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months and then
      every 6 months until death.
