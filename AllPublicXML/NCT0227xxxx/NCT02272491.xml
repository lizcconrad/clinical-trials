  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to test whether or not the use of translucent monolithic
      zirconia crowns bonded to a titanium base abutment perform similar to
      porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns on single implants in the posterior region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the majority of studies on implant-supported restorations, a considerable rate of
      fractures of the veneering ceramic was reported. The clinical data is restricted to
      full-ceramic implant-supported reconstructions in the anterior region. No clinical data is
      available on the performance of full-ceramic restorations in the molar region.

      The use of translucent monolithic zirconia for implant-supported crowns (without veneering
      ceramic) may reduce the technical complication rate and allow for sufficient aesthetic
      results in the molar region. To date, no clinical trial investigating monolithic zirconia
      crowns for single molar implants is available.

      The primary outcome of the study is the technical complication rate. This outcome represents
      an indicator for the prosthetic success of the implant-supported crown. The main biological
      secondary outcomes are marginal bone level, histological signs of inflammation, and presence
      of pathogenic bacteria. Further outcomes are crown survival, wear of the crown and of the
      antagonist.
