  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A human factors and home use study to assess whether subjects with diabetes and their
      caregivers can understand feedback received from the Vigilant Diabetes Management Application
      about their blood glucose patterns and whether the decisions made in response to device
      feedback are made in accordance with the intended use.
