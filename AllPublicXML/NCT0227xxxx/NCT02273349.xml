      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the RePneu Lung
      Volume Reduction Coil (LVRC) in patients with Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) caused
      emphysema. The hypothesis is that emphysema in AATD patients shows similar tissue destruction
      profile was well as symptoms and thus will respond favorably to LVRC treatment, demonstrating
      improvement in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life relative to their
      baseline status.
