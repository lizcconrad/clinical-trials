      This study, with 20 patients participating, will examine the safety and tolerability for the
      ipilimumab/UV1 combination in patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/IIa, national, open label, single arm, interventional study examining
      safety and tolerability for the ipilimumab/UV1 combination in patients with unresectable or
      metastatic malignant melanoma. Patients that have signed the informed consent form will be
      asked to take part in the study. All patients will receive ipilimumab together with the UV1
      vaccine and rranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Ipilimumab will be
      given every 3rd week for a total of 4 doses. The UV1 vaccine and GM-CSF will be given before
      and between treatments of ipilimumab. The maximum number of UV1/GM-CSF will be 10 doses.

      Immunoresponders maybe followed up every third months for 5 years after the first UV1
      treatment. Follow-up is onging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic
             malignant melanoma, including cutaneous, ocular, mucosal and unknown primary tumour.

             participate.

         12. Known serious reactions or hypersensitivity to any components of the UV1 vaccine or
             similar peptide based vaccines

         13. Known hypersensitivity to GM-CSF

         14. Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of the investigational products
