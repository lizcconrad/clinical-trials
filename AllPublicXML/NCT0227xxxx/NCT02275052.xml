    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, complete block
      design cross-over study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 microgram (mcg) on EET
      as measured by the Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT) compared to placebo. Additionally, the
      effect of UMEC/VI compared to placebo on lung function and lung volumes in COPD patients will
      be characterized.

      Approximately 298 participants will be screened and, assuming 35% of these will not be
      eligible for randomization; approximately 194 participants will be randomized.

      Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of 2 treatment sequences. In sequence 1
      participants will receive UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg in Treatment Period 1 and placebo in Treatment
      Period 2. In sequence 2 participants will receive placebo in Treatment Period 1 and UMEC/VI
      62.5/25 mcg in Treatment Period 2. Treatments will be delivered once-daily via a dry powder
      inhaler (DPI). Each treatment period will be for 12 weeks and will be separated by a wash out
      period of 12-17 days. The total duration of patient participation, including the Follow-Up
      will be approximately 30 weeks. All participants will be provided with albuterol for use on
      an &quot;as needed (prn)&quot; basis throughout the run-in, washout and study treatment periods while
      on investigational product.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Exercise Endurance Time (EET) Post-dose at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and at Week (W) 12 of each treatment (trt) period (up to Week 30)</time_frame>
    <description>EET post-dose at W12 is defined as the EET obtained 3 hours after dosing at W12. EET was measured using the externally paced field walking test called endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). Change from BL in EET at W12 was analyzed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period walking speed, mean walking speed, period, trt, visit (Day 2, W6 and W12), smoking status, visit by period walking speed, visit by mean walking speed and visit by trt interactions. BL was the EET assessment obtained prior to dosing on Day 1 of each period. The mean walking speed for each par. is the mean of the levels used for the ESWT in each of the two trt periods. Period walking speed for each par. and trt period is the difference between the level for that par. and period and the mean walking speed for that par. Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population: all randomized par., excluding those who were randomized in error, and par. who discontinued trt (off-trt).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 12 of each treatment period (up to Week 30)</time_frame>
    <description>Trough FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the mean of FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on the previous day. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Day 2, Week 6 and Week 12. Baseline was the assessment recorded before dosing on Day 1 of each period. Mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant. Period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model and the following covariates were included: period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) 3 Hours Post-dose at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 12 of each treatment period (up to Week 30)</time_frame>
    <description>FRC is defined as the amount of air still left in the lungs after breathing out normally. Standard body plethysmography techniques were used for lung volumes. Baseline is the assessment recorded before dosing on Day 1 of each period. Mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant. Period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each participant. FRC 3 hours post-dose was measured from the value obtained 3 hours after dosing on Day 2 and Week 12. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model and the following covariates were included: period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit, smoking status, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Inspiratory Capacity (IC) 3 Hours Post-dose at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 12 of each treatment period (up to Week 30)</time_frame>
    <description>IC is defined as the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. Standard body plethysmography techniques were used for lung volumes. Baseline is the IC value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period. Mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each par. Period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each par. IC 3-hours post-dose was measured from the value obtained 3 hours after dosing on Day 2 and Week 12. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit (Day 2 or Week 12), smoking status, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions.</description>

             conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of
             participant eligibility. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of
             each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the participant's medical history and exclude
             participants who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Participants

        <title>Change From Baseline in Exercise Endurance Time (EET) Post-dose at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>EET post-dose at W12 is defined as the EET obtained 3 hours after dosing at W12. EET was measured using the externally paced field walking test called endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). Change from BL in EET at W12 was analyzed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period walking speed, mean walking speed, period, trt, visit (Day 2, W6 and W12), smoking status, visit by period walking speed, visit by mean walking speed and visit by trt interactions. BL was the EET assessment obtained prior to dosing on Day 1 of each period. The mean walking speed for each par. is the mean of the levels used for the ESWT in each of the two trt periods. Period walking speed for each par. and trt period is the difference between the level for that par. and period and the mean walking speed for that par.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Inspiratory Capacity (IC) 3 Hours Post-dose at Week 12 of Each Treatment Period</title>
          <description>IC is defined as the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. Standard body plethysmography techniques were used for lung volumes. Baseline is the IC value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period. Mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each par. Period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each par. IC 3-hours post-dose was measured from the value obtained 3 hours after dosing on Day 2 and Week 12. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of period Baseline, mean Baseline, period, treatment, visit (Day 2 or Week 12), smoking status, visit by period Baseline, visit by mean Baseline and visit by treatment interactions.</description>
