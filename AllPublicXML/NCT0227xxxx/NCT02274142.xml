    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to evaluate the cost-efficacy of different glass ionomer cements
      in Atraumatic Restorative Treatment restorations, with different handling characteristics:
      powder-liquid versus encapsulated.

      This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the School of Dentistry
      (University of São Paulo, Brazil) and a written informed consent will be obtained from the
      parents or legal guardians of the participating children. The sample size was calculated
      based on the minimum difference of 10% in the success rate between the control and treatment
      groups after 1 year of follow-up, with and α of 5% and power (strength) of 80% using paired
      test. As more then one tooth might be enrolled in treatment, we must add a 20% for
      clustering, and also 20% for possible losses.

      To be included in this study the following criteria must be followed: healthy, cooperative
      children with at least one occlusal carious lesion in a primary molar extending to the dentin
      with dimensions not greater than 2 mm occlusal-cervical and with an intact edge list. Also,
      to be included the tooth cannot present ulcer, abscess, fistula, or pathological mobility.

      Implementation:

      All the occlusal and proximal-ART restorations will be performed by two operators on dental
      chair. The operators will be assisted by a local dentist and a dentist assistant, who will be
      previously trained to mix the GIC according to the manufacturers' protocol. The children will
      be randomly assigned into two groups: Hand mixed and encapsulated materials.

      Treatment procedure:

      The ART technique will be performed according to the ART guidelines proposed by Frencken
      (2014). No local anaesthesia will be used during treatment. Infected carious dentin will be
      removed with hand instruments. The use of hand instruments on the dentin surface results in a
      smear layer and need to be removed by the use of dentine conditioner. The liquid component of
      the hand-mixed powder-liquid GIC, containing the acid component, will be used and saliva
      isolation will be done with cotton wool rolls. The cavities will be restored with one of the
      two GIC brands: Fuji IX (GC Europe, Leuven, BE) and EQUIA (GC Europe, Leuven, BE). A thin
      layer of petroleum jelly will be rubbed over the index finger and the restoration will be
      pressed for 20 seconds. The material will include sealing pits and the fissure. After
      preparing for a balanced occlusion, a new layer of petroleum jelly will be applied to the GIC
      restoration. The amount of GIC used, element number, cavity dimension and dmft will be
      recorded. The duration of the restorative procedure will be recorded with a stop watch. The
      participating children will be instructed not to eat for one hour after the restoration is
      placed.

      Estimation of cost-effectiveness:

      Effectiveness will be measured in terms of the retention rate. This study will report only
      the preliminary results after 6 months, but the other follow-ups will be done every 6 months
      up to 2 years. The average cost per restoration will be estimated. Costs of equipment,
      autoclave and hand instruments, disposables (hand gloves, face masks, cotton wool rolls),
      articulating paper and petroleum jelly used for the restorations are equal for all the three
      GIC groups and will be excluded. There will be no labour costs for the operators. The
      material cost (powder-liquid GICs) will be estimated per restoration.

      Evaluation:

      The retention rate of the restorations will be evaluated after 6 months according to the
      Frencken and Holmgren criteria for occlusal surfaces, and modified version of Roeleveld et
      al. (2006) criteria for occlusal-proximal surfaces; A restoration will be considered as
      'failure' when there is a defect in the filling, when secondary caries are observed, when the
      restoration is not present or when the pulp is inflamed. When the restoration is still
      present or a slight defect is observed, it will be considered as 'success'. When the tooth is
      unavailable for evaluation, it will be censored. All evaluations will be carried out by one
      independent evaluator, who did not restore the cavities, trained and calibrated by a
      benchmark.

      The cost effectiveness will be evaluated. The total price of each GIC brand, used to insert
      into the cavities will be compared to the retention rate of the restorations.
