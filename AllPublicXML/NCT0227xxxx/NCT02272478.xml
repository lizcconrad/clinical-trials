    <textblock>
      AML 18 is the replacement trial for AML16 intensive. This 1600 patient trial is primarily
      designed for patients over the age of 60 who are considered fit enough for an intensive
      chemotherapy approach and will aim to test the effects of adding 1 of 2 new treatment agents
      to commonly used chemotherapy combinations in order to improve patient survival and treatment
      regimes.

      The AML18 Trial is available to any patient who has primary or secondary AML as defined by
      the WHO Classification (excluding Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia), or high risk
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (i.e. &gt;10% marrow blasts) over the age of 60.

      AML18 is a randomised controlled Phase III trial using a factorial design for maximum
      efficiency to evaluate two induction options followed by treatment with a small molecule post
      course 1 and dose intensification for suitable patients.

      There are four randomisation comparisons within the trial:

      The first randomisation will compare standard the chemotherapy schedule Daunorubicin/AraC
      (DA) combined with 1 or 2 doses of Mylotarg in course 1. Patients not suitable to receive
      Mylotarg may have DA alone. Following recovery from course 1 patients who fail to achieve CR
      or are MRD positive by centralised flow cytometry will be randomised to one of three options,
      either DA chemotherapy, DA chemotherapy plus Cladribine or Flag Ida for up to 2 courses of
      therapy.

      Patients who achieve CR after course 1 will be randomised to 1 or 2 further courses of DA
      chemotherapy.

      At course 2 all patients will also enter a randomisation to receive AC220 versus no AC220
      with or without maintenance, or Ganetespib verses no Ganetespib for a maximum of 3 cycles.
      Patients will be eligible for a non-intensive allogeneic stem cell transplant if a suitable
      HLA matched donor is available.

             limit of normal value)

          -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome. Any history of clinically
             significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
             fibrillation, or torsades de pointes [TdP]); any history of arrhythmia will be
             discussed with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor prior to patient's entry into the study

          -  Prolonged QTcF interval on pre-entry ECG (≥450 ms) - this will be the average of 3
             readings within a 2 hour period

          -  Any history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if the patient
             currently has a pacemaker)

          -  Heart rate &lt; 50/minute on pre-entry ECG

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Obligate need for a cardiac pacemaker

          -  Complete left bundle branch block

          -  Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation

          -  Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels should be at least within institutional
             normal limits, and every effort should be made to keep potassium at institutional
             normal limits, and every effort should be made to keep magnesium concentrations above
             4.0 mEq/dL, and serum calcium at normal concentration.
