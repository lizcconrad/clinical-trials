    <textblock>
      Participants will be assigned to complete computerized estimation tasks for which there is a
      component of accuracy, such as estimating the duration of sounds. Participants will be told
      that the task is used as an early diagnostic tool to detect those at risk for a medical
      condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease). Instructions will be given to
      participants telling them that accuracy on the task is associated with the disease, whereas
      those who are not at risk of the disease tend to either overestimate or underestimate the
      duration of the sounds. The investigators examine whether such instructions about the purpose
      and diagnosticity of the tasks biases participants' responses to the tasks, leading them to
      purposefully be more inaccurate in their estimates.

      Participants will be assigned to complete computerized tasks for which there is a component
      of accuracy, such as estimating the length, in time, of sounds. Participants will be told
      that the task is used as an early diagnostic tool to detect those at risk for a medical
      condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease). Instructions will be given to
      participants telling them that accuracy on the task is associated with the disease in
      question, whereas those who are not at risk of the disease tend to either overestimate or
      underestimate the duration of the sounds. The investigators examine whether such instructions
      about the purpose and diagnosticity of the tasks biases participants' responses to the tasks.
      The investigators collect additional survey measures as statistical controls and potential
      explanatory variables for variation in the performance on the tasks, and also test whether
      financial incentives for accuracy on these tasks improve the accuracy of responses to these
      tasks.

      Following the task, all participants will be told that the tasks used are actually NOT
      diagnostic of the diseases in question, and that deception was used to learn how people
      respond to instructions about how a task can be used for diagnostic purposes.
