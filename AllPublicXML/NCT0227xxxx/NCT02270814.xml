  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effect of a treatment regimen called
      CACTUX on head and neck cancer. The CACTUX regimen is a combination of three drugs called
      cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and cetuximab (although carboplatin may be given in place of
      cisplatin if participants have previously had problems receiving cisplatin). The use of
      nab-paclitaxel in this combination is different from routine care, in which a drug called 5FU
      is often given instead, but the investigators group has conducted previous research where the
      investigators incorporated nab-paclitaxel into routine treatment with cisplatin, 5FU, and
      cetuximab. The investigators are looking at the incidence of side effects with the CACTUX
      regimen as well as response of the disease and health status.

    <description>Up to 6 cycles of CACTUX may be given. The CACTUX regimen consists of:
nab-paclitaxel given intravenously over 30 minutes on an outpatient basis on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle followed by
cisplatin given intravenously over 60 minutes on an outpatient basis OR carboplatin AUC5 given intravenously over 30 minutes on an outpatient basis on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle followed by
cetuximab given intravenously on an outpatient basis of Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle
Cisplatin is preferred but carboplatin may be given if the patient has a prior intolerance to cisplatin or at the discretion of the treating physician.
After the completion of 6 cycles of CACTUX, maintenance therapy will be given and consists of:
nab-paclitaxel given intravenously over 30 minutes on an outpatient basis on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle
cetuximab given intravenously on an outpatient basis on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle</description>

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl

          -  Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy at screening.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 2 years previous; exceptions are malignancies with a
             negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., expected 5-year OS &gt; 90%) that were
             treated with an expected curative outcome, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri, non-melanomatous skin cancer, carcinoma
             in situ of the breast, incidental finding of prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or
             T1b), or synchronous H&amp;N primaries

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, or other agents used in the study.
             Previous grade 1 or 2 allergic reaction to cetuximab is permissible.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 72
             hours of start of study treatment.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study drugs. In addition, these patients are
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
