    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a prospective randomized trial to be performed at Bridgeport
      Hospital. Patients planning to undergo a laparoscopic or robotically assisted total
      laparoscopic hysterectomy with or without removal of adnexal structures will be recruited by
      the Bridgeport Hospital Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery fellows during their
      preoperative office visit at the Bridgeport Hospital Gynecologic Oncology office. If
      enrolled, they will be assigned a sequential study identification number. During their
      preoperative exam, a baseline POP-Q will be performed. Demographic information will be
      recorded from the electronic medical record.
