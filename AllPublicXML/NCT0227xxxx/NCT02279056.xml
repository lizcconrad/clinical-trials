  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder treated with continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP). Some OSA patients also suffer from co-morbid insomnia. CPAP treatment
      may be complicated in patients with co-morbid insomnia. This project evaluates the effects of
      a self-help book for insomnia in patients being treated with CPAP for OSA.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of a self-help book for
      insomnia in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and co-morbid insomnia. 180 patients
      are randomized to either receive the self-help book (90 patients) or sleep hygiene advice (90
      patients). Patients fill out questionnaires about sleep and health both at baseline and after
      three months. Furthermore, CPAP compliance and OSA severity will be evaluated after three
      months of CPAP use. The aim is to evaluate whether the self-help book will improve sleep
      parameters and CPAP compliance.
