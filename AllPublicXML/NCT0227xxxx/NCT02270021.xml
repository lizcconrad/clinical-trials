  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to prevent over screening and over treatment of young women for
      cervical precancers, which can result in psychological distress and has been associated with
      future risk of premature deliveries. Current national guidelines recommend that routine
      screening be performed at less-frequent intervals and that excisional cervical therapies are
      discouraged in young women. The objectives of this study are to examine physician- and
      patient-based interventions designed to decrease over screening and over treatment by
      increasing adherence to US guidelines for women under 30 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we compare two different intervention arms that are designed to prevent over
      screening and over treatment by increasing adherence to the new US cervical cancer screening
      guidelines and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines
      for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.
      Specifically, the interventions will focus on the newly recommended cervical cancer screening
      intervals and decreasing the number of colposcopy procedures and cervical procedures for
      abnormal cytology.

      This is a cluster randomized trial with individual clinics serving as the clusters. Clinics
      from the California Family PACT provider network who serve at least 200 female clients per
      year under 30 years of age will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) mobile application
      (APP)-based intervention for providers, or 2) patient-centered approach (PCA) intervention
      plus APP-based intervention for providers. These groups will be compared to a comparison
      group of 26 clinics chosen using propensity score matching based on clinic characteristics
      such as county and private versus public from the Family PACT claims data. The APP
      intervention is for clinicians' mobile phones and will help them maneuver through current
      guidelines based on patient age and condition. An existing application from the ASCCP will be
      updated to include screening guidelines and to be more user-friendly. The PCA intervention
      will be patients' education and self-assessment using a tablet at the time of check-in to
      assist in asking questions and evaluating treatment options. The tablet program will be
      developed with input from women age 21-29 as well as other stakeholders including Latinas
      Contra Cancer and the National Cervical Cancer Coalition. It is hypothesized that the PCA+APP
      approach will be most successful; all interventions will be more successful than no
      intervention.

      Family PACT serves predominantly uninsured women and 40% of clients are Latina. We plan to
      enroll 6 sites (APP) and 7 sites (PCA+APP) into the other intervention arm with an average of
      2,800 women to 3,500 women aged 21-29 years per arm (14 sites) with a similar number of sites
      and women randomly chosen for the comparison arm (26 sites) resulting in a total of 39 sites
      and 8,400-10,500 women. We will use Family PACT claims data to examine, by age, the number of
      and average interval between cytology specimens, colposcopy examinations, and the number of
      excisional procedures.

    <description>Patient-Centered Approach (PCA): A patient educational tool (mobile tablet) will educate women on cervical cancer screening and treatment. Patients' self-assessment using a tablet at the time of clinic check-in will help them to understand current guidelines and their choices for treatment if they have abnormal cytology. It will allow them to assess the risks and benefits of screening intervals and of treatment choices.
