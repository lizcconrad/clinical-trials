  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess reasonable safety and performance of the
      HeartMate PHP to provide hemodynamic support for up to 72 hours in patients with cardiogenic
      shock requiring stabilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HeartMate PHP is a catheter-based axial flow pump designed to provide partial left
      ventricular circulatory support. This prospective, nonrandomized, controlled, single-arm,
      multi-center, open-label trial will evaluate the safety and performance of the device in
      patients with cardiogenic shock.

             pump, etc.

          6. Documented acute myocarditis

          7. Active major cardiac rhythm disturbances (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
             fibrillation).

          8. Hypertrophic disease or any left ventricular outflow tract obstruction

          9. Active sepsis defined as bacteremia, fever ≥ 101.5 degrees F

         24. Any active disease (e.g., active cancer) which could affect the patient's
             participation in the study, or if life expectancy is less than 1 year.

         25. Any active disease in which the investigator determines would make the patient an
             inappropriate candidate for the study.

         26. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational drug or device that has
             not met its primary endpoint
