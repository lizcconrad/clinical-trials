  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects between 10% to 25% of the adults. Continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first choice of treatment in severe OSA. However, the
      adherence to CPAP varies, and the interface between patient and the CPAP may interfere with
      adherence, comfort and efficiency as well as in sleep variables. Objectives: (1) to determine
      if self-reported airflow route (nasal or oronasal airflow) is the same as the route
      determined in a laboratory analysis in controls (healthy subjects) and severe OSA patients
      with nasal free airflow of obstruction during asleep and awake, (2) to compare the effects of
      nasal and oronasal CPAP titration (randomized order of masks, 14 days apart) on
      apnoea-hypopnoea index, CPAP level, PSG variables - including analysis for body positioning,
      the airway defense mechanisms (nasal mucociliary clearance, mucus properties, citology and
      inflammation in nasal lavage fluid) and systemic effects (serum miRNA expression and
      cytokines), (3) CPAP adherence after 1 month and 12 months.

    <textblock>
      After agreement with the written informed consent, 30 volunteers (10 healthy volunteers and
      20 patients with severe OSA), male and female, aged &gt; 21 years were recruited in the Sleep
      Laboratory of Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina (FMUSP). The volunteers were
      evaluated at the Sleep Laboratory (Incor) in two phases. First Phase: volunteers were
      assessed for breathing route awake and asleep (including respiratory events in OSA patients)
      and were indicated as nasal breathing and oronasal breathing. Second phase for OSA patients:
      two manual full-night CPAP titration with nasal and oronasal masks in a randomized order, 14
      days apart. Data and fluids were analyzed before and after both titration studies comparing
      both masks including supine and lateral position during asleep and CPAP titration. Third
      phase for OSA patiens: patients were treated with the best interface found in CPAP titration
      study during 30 days and patients were assessed for sleep quality, excessive sonolence during
      the day, airway symptoms, airway defense mechanisms biomarkers (mucociliary clearance, mucus
      properties, citology, inflammation cytokines and adhesion molecules and others) and serum
      cytokines and miRNA.

    <description>A full-night diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) was performed in each subject to determine the stages of sleep, an electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram and electromyogram of the submentalis muscle were obtained. Peripheric blood oxygenation was recorded with the use of a finger pulse oximeter. Thoracoabdominal excursions were measured qualitatively using respiratory effort sensors placed over the ribcage and abdomen. Snoring was detected with a vibration snore sensor and body posture with a body position sensor. Subjects used a molded single-piece translucent silicone rubber mask. During titration, a mask with CPAP was added and the procedure was performed according to AASM guidelines.</description>

    <description>The EBC sample was collected over 15 min of quiet and normal breathings (regular tidal volumes and respiratory rate) through a mouthpiece that was connected to a collector device. Participants were asked to avoid to eat green vegetables and canned or embebbed food the 24 hours before measurements. Ph measurements were performed after dearation with ultrapure argon gas (99.9%).</description>

    <time_frame>Participants were assessed at at baseline (Time 0), nasal CPAP, oronasal CPAP and after 30-day CPAP treatment (30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>We evaluate the nasal MCC by measuring nasal saccharine transport time (STT). The subject was asked to avoid alcohol, tea and coffee for 6 hours and to eat or drink nothing for 2 hours before the measurements. The STT assessment is performed in a quiet room at a temperature of 21-22ºC and relative humidity of 63-71%. Subjects sat in a chair and are asked to maintain regular breathing, to avoid deep breathing, coughing, sneezing, sniffing or talking during STT measurements. Twenty-five µg saccharin particles are deposited 2 cm from the anterior end of the non-obstructed nostril and the timer is stopped at the first perception of sweet taste. The maximum delay between the deposition and perception is set at 60 minutes for non-detection.</description>
