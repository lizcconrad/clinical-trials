  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a cluster randomized trial in a sample of 63 internal
      medicine (IM) training programs that are randomly assigned to either the current duty hour
      standards or less restricted flexible duty hour standards.

      The trial includes a main protocol in which all randomized IM programs participate and two
      substudies. &quot;Time and Motion&quot; and &quot;Sleep and Alertness&quot;, each conducted at a subset of IM
      programs and focusing on more detailed data collection at the intern level.

      The main protocol will examine patient safety and costs as well as quality of education. The
      &quot;Time and Motion&quot; substudy examines additional educational outcomes. The &quot;Sleep and
      Alertness&quot; substudy examines intern sleep time and alertness.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current internal medicine program in the United States Continued Accreditation status
             with the ACGME - Program director agrees to:

               1. Randomization to one of the two study arms.

               2. Develop, and share with the study team, institutional duty hour schedules and
                  regulatory policies/procedures that will ensure adherence to, and enforcement of,
                  the duty hour regulations that apply to their study arm

               3. Allow access and analysis of de-identified resident duty hour adherence
                  data/logs, call schedules, and rotation schedules to the Study Team.

               4. Participate, and encourage trainee participation at your institution, in
                  beginning and end of year iCOMPARE surveys.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators excluded 119 programs that comprise the bottom 50% in
             resident-to-bed ratio and the bottom 25% in patient volume related to the diagnoses by
             which the patient population will be selected for evaluation of safety outcomes.

          -  Within the 260 programs that remain, the investigators excluded the 65 in the lowest
             quartile of program size to ensure we can feasibly obtain sufficient trainee
             measurements.

          -  The 195 remaining programs are eligible for inclusion.

          -  The investigators have also excluded children and VA hospitals.
