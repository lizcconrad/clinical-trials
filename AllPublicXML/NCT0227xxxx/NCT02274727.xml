  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The three-year cumulative risk of a recurrent stroke, dependent on aetiology, is up to 25 per
      cent. At present, preventing recurrence relies on a broad approach to reduce risk factors
      associated with atherosclerosis, heart disease and metabolic disorders. However, more
      specific interventions, such as anticoagulation and surgery or stenting, need aetiologic
      information. BIOSIGNAL aims to determine where the most promising biomarkers can help
      identify stroke aetiology and also predict recurrent stroke. In addition, the insights gained
      into the processes underlying different stroke subtypes may lead to more targeted diagnostic
      tools.

      Objectives and specific aims:

      The investigators propose to prospectively evaluate the predictive value of the most
      promising blood biomarkers to identify treatable stroke etiologies on admission and risk of
      recurrence in 3000 consecutive ischemic stroke patients enrolled by 10 centers in Europe and
      the US.

      The clinical endpoints of the study are 1) recurrent stroke within one year, 2) all types of
      atrial fibrillation (AF) detected on admission or by prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm
      monitors, 3) presence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis detected by ultrasound
      investigations and 4) new silent ischemic brain lesions and progression of chronic cerebral
      ischemic lesion volume detected by repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI and MRA) and
      (i.e. on admission and after 12 months).

      Aim 1: To determine whether the proposed biomarkers independently predict recurrent stroke
      among all patients. Hypothesis 1: Elevated levels of one or more of the proposed biomarkers
      will independently predict recurrent strokes during trial follow-up, assessed by structured
      interviews, as well as chart reviews 90 days and 1 year after the index stroke.

      Aim 2: To determine whether cardioembolic (CE) biomarkers are associated with atrial
      fibrillation among all patients. Hypothesis 2: Baseline values of one or more of the proposed
      CE biomarkers will be independently associated with AF, including history of AF, AF detection
      at baseline, or AF detected during the follow up period by prolonged ambulatory cardiac
      rhythm monitors and structured interviews as well as chart reviews 90 days and 1 year after
      the index stroke.

      Aim 3: To determine whether large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) biomarkers are associated with
      a) the presence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis among all patients. Hypothesis 3: Baseline
      values of one or more of the proposed LAA biomarkers will be independently associated with
      the presence of extra and intracranial atherosclerosis among patients with ischemic stroke,
      assessed by duplex sonography.

      Exploratory Aim 4: To determine whether the proposed biomarkers will predict b) new silent
      strokes and c) progression of chronic cerebral ischemic lesion (white matter hyper-intensity)
      volume (WMHV) among cryptogenic stroke patients. Hypothesis 4: Baseline values of one or more
      of the proposed biomarkers will independently predict a) silent stroke b) progression of
      WMHV, during study follow-up, assessed by repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (on
      admission, and 1 year after the index stroke).

      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the
      Declaration of Helsinki, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines as well as all national
      legal and regulatory requirements.

    <description>The clinical endpoint regarding aim 1 will be recurrent stroke (including fatal stroke). A research assistant will evaluate stroke recurrence through a structured interview at 3 month and at one year after the index stroke. In the case of recurrence or suspected recurrence for each patient all medical records from enrolling and other hospitals as well as primary care physicians will be reviewed and diagnosis will be confirmed by stroke physicians. The process for definition of recurrent stroke as well as the aetiological classification will be the same as for incident strokes. In order to avoid biases, the endpoint evaluators will be blinded to the biomarker levels.</description>

        The BIOSIGNAL study will be a prospective observational multicenter cohort study to
        evaluate selected CE and LAA blood biomarkers in patients with incident ischemic stroke. We
        will consecutively recruit at least 300 patients per center (i.e. 10 centers, thus totally
        3000 patients) over a time period of two years. All participants will be followed for 1
        year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All consecutive patients (above the age of 18) who are admitted with a suspected ischemic
        stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset are eligible.

        Ischemic stroke is defined as an acute localized ischemic lesion in the brain not
        attributable to central nervous system infection, tumor, demyelinating, or degenerative
        neurologic diseases due to an occlusive vascular disorder.

        Detailed Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Rapid onset of a focal neurologic deficit, with signs or symptoms persisting beyond 24
             hours &amp; NOT associated with:

               -  infection

               -  trauma

               -  tumor of the brain

               -  severe metabolic disorders

               -  chronic degenerative neurologic disease

          2. The development of an acute focal neurologic deficit persisting &gt;24 hours in
             conjunction with brain imaging consistent with acute ischemic stroke.

        The CT or MRI may either show a new infarct or no change from the study performed at entry,
        i.e. the diagnosis is clinical and does not require CT/MRI confirmation. Secondary
        hemorrhagic infarction is permissible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hemorrhagic stroke

          2. All patients discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis different from ischemic
             stroke (i.e. stroke mimics)
