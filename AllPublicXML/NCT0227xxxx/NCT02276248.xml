      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with GDP
      (gemcitabine, cisplatin, dexamethasone) chemotherapy in stage I/II extranodal natural
      killer/T-cell lymphoma patients with unfavorable prognostic factors.

    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy has been recognized as the definitive treatment of choice for stages I and II
      extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. The progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate
      of radiotherapy plus anthracycline-containing chemotherapy were comparable to that of
      radiotherapy alone. Our previous studies demonstrated the high responsiveness and safety of
      GDP (gemcitabine, cisplatin, dexamethasone) regimen in patients with extranodal NK/T cell
      lymphoma. Therefore, we design this study to evaluate the safety and benefit of radiotherapy
      plus GDP regimen in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
