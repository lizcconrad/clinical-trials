      This study evaluates the action of the pelvic floor muscle training with and without EMG
      Biofeddback in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in menopausal, peri and post
      menopausal women and their quality of life before and after the interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pelvic floor muscle training has been the first line of choice in the treatment of Stress
      Urinary Incontinence. The goal of this technique is increasing the strength and function of
      the pelvic floor which aims to support the pelvic viscera, as well as part of their duties,
      such as locks sphincter muscles.

      Risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, multiple pregnancy, can cause a woman to present
      urinary incontinence (SUI), where the main cause is the dysfunction of the pelvic floor
      muscles and the lack of awareness of these muscles as well as biomechanical problems.

      Some studies describe the use of EMG biofeedback to assess and improve the function of the
      pelvic floor muscles, however, the studies are not yet conclusive about the action of adding
      this equipment in the treatment of SUI.

      In this regard, the EMG Biofeedback has the ability to physiologically evaluate these
      disorders and perform a faster treatment for these patients, improving their quality of life.
      The EMG has the ability to monitor and measure the progression of activation of the pelvic
      floor muscles, giving feedback to the patient and therapist about the actual condition of
      muscle function.

    <measure>Evaluation of pelvic floor muscle strength with &quot;Oxford Scale&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation consists in bidigital intravaginal test which evaluates the pelvic floor muscle strength using the following 0-5 scale, where 0 = no contraction and 5 = maximal contraction with support against gravity The graduates range from 0 - 5 = 0 has no muscle contraction, 1 = outline of muscle contraction, 2 = contracts without support against gravity, 3 = contracts and holds little against gravity, 4 = contracts and holds up to 6 seconds against gravity and 5 = contracts and holds more than 6 seconds against gravity ntravaginal bidigital test that evaluates scale of pelvic floor muscle strength.
The graduates range from 0 - 5 = 0 has no muscle contraction, 1 = outline of muscle contraction, 2 = contracts without support against gravity, 3 = contracts and holds little against gravity, 4 = contracts and holds up to 6 seconds against gravity and 5 = contracts and holds more than 6 seconds against gravity</description>

    <measure>Measuring quality of life throughInternational Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Is a brief instrument, translated into Portuguese, presents its psychometric properties such as validity, reliability and responsiveness previously tested, consists of three questions related to frequency, severity of urinary loss and its impact on QoL. Presents a range of eight items assess the possible causes or situations of urinary loss. The ICIQ score (ICIQ E) is the sum of scores for questions three, four and five and ranges from 0 to 21 The impact on QoL is defined according to the score of question 5: (0)</description>

    <description>The conducted training by two groups, consisting of phasic contractions (3 sets of 10 repetitions of maximal contraction for two seconds to double or triple rest), endurance (two sets of six repetitions of sustained contractions of 6-10 seconds with the same rest time) and training effort, requesting the anticipated contraction of the abdominal pelvic floor coughing effort. We used the same protocol in the supine position, sitting and standing, as evolution of the patient. Both were treated 2 times per week, 20 minutes, totaling 8 sessions.</description>
