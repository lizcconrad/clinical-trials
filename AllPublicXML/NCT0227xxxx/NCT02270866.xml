    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with a single active treatment arm. The study is designed to assess the
      efficacy of a portable, non-invasive neuromodulation system for the treatment of post-stroke
      aphasia. Both language and movement assessments will be made.

    <time_frame>after completing 84 days of device use</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the 84 day period of device use, the patient's gait and posture will be compared with the baseline levels to assess any improvement. This is a blended measure employing Timed Up &amp; Go and a 10-meter walk.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &gt;6 months post-stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

          -  receptive or expressive aphasia

          -  little or no improvement in language ability in the preceding 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  persons under the age of 18 or over the age of 75

          -  patients with pure receptive aphasia

          -  co-morbid CNS disease

          -  primary motor/oral apraxia

          -  pregnant or nursing women

          -  have a history of unstable mood disorder or unstable anxiety disorder or psychosis

          -  use of a hearing aid

          -  have a cochlear implant

          -  have a diagnosed vestibular dysfunction

          -  abuse alcohol or other drugs

          -  have had eye surgery within the previous three months or ear surgery within the
             previous six months

          -  have active ear infections or a perforated tympanic membrane

          -  have participated in another clinical trial within the last 30 days or are currently
             enrolled in another clinical trial

          -  Though not excluded, patients taking anti-histamines or anti-nausea drugs will be
             encouraged not to take such medications within four hours prior to a CVS treatment.
             The Investigator should review other medications taken by the patient with properties
             that mimic anti-nausea or anti-dizziness drugs as these may reduce responsiveness of
             the vestibular system to caloric stimulation.
