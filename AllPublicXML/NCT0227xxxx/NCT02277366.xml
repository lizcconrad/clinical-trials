      The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic yield of early lung cancer in high
      risk population, who smokes or has other risk factors, by different bronchoscopy,.
      Furthermore, another purpose is to determine whether the different bronchoscopy are
      significant different in diagnosing early lung cancer.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    We have recruited some patients, but we haven't found any significant result by bronchoscopy in
    the high risk population.
