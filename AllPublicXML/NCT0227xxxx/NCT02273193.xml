      A prospective cohort research study is being conducted in the Mike O'Callaghan Federal
      Medical Center (MOFMC), Department of Family Medicine, Obstetrics Clinic to determine if
      early screening with hemoglobin A1C, a blood test for blood glucose, can be used to identify
      women with hyperglycemia or Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in the first semester of
      pregnancy in place of a fasting blood glucose blood test. This study will also determine how
      hemoglobin A1C compares with the oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) done as a standard of care
      with the standard of care second trimester prenatal care testing. Subjects recruited and
      consented during the Obstetrics Orientation Class will have two (2) additional blood tests
      drawn with their standard of care prenatal tests in the first trimester (&lt;13 weeks) of
      pregnancy and at the second trimester (24-28 weeks) of pregnancy. Subjects identified as
      having GDM by blood HbA1C, fasting glucose or the 2 hr OGTT will be treated for GDM with
      standard of care by their primary care provider. The correlation of blood HbA1C with the
      fasting glucose in the first trimester of pregnancy and with the 2 hr OGTT will be determined
      for early detection and diagnosis of GDM. This study will contribute to understanding the
      role of HbA1C in pregnancy and the development of GDM.

      This is a prospective cohort research study conducted in the Mike O'Callaghan Federal Medical
      Center (MOFMC), Department of Family Medicine Residency and Obstetrics Clinics. Subjects will
      be pregnant female active duty or DoD beneficiaries 18 years or older recruited from the
      MOFMC, Department of Family Medicine Residency Clinic, and Obstetrics Orientation Class at
      Nellis AFB. At the screening, the Research Assistant discusses the study, answers all
      questions, obtains Informed Consent, and schedules appointments for routine OB care. The
      research design includes a screening visit to obtain written consent and two (2) additional
      laboratory blood tests obtained during the standard of care prenatal screen testing during
      the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Each laboratory blood test will be done via 1
      venipuncture for 5-10 ml (1-2 teaspoons) of blood. The OB nurse orders all labs upon
      completion of the Obstetrics Orientation Class.

      Screening Visit: Initial Standard of Care Obstetrics Appointment

        -  Obtain subject signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization

        -  Demographic data: age, race, weight, height, estimated week of gestation

        -  Review past medical history

      First Trimester Prenatal Visit (&lt;13 weeks) Screen Testing

        -  Subjects will have routine prenatal labs drawn to include the HbA1C blood test which is
           standard of care

        -  Subjects will have fasting (10 hour) glucose blood test will be ordered along with these
           labs (research driven)

      Second Trimester Prenatal Visit (24-28 weeks)

        -  Subjects will have routine prenatal labs drawn to include the 2 hr glucose tolerance
           test (2 hr OGTT) which is standard of care

        -  Subjects will have will be the HbA1C blood test ordered along with these labs (research
           driven)

      Delivery and Neonatal Data Collection

      -Select data regarding delivery and neonatal health will be tracked. All of this data is
      already routinely collected as standard of care and will be found in the patient record. This
      will require no interaction with the patient or the neonate
