      To assess the feasibility to translate an automated weight loss message intervention to a
      weight loss clinic population.

      Aim 1: To assess feasibility of translating the intervention in a clinic for patients who
      recently completed a structured weight loss program.

      Aim 2: To assess the ability to capture a trajectory of self-reported weight over 6 months
      through an automated intervention.

      The investigators will recruit 100 participants who are clients at the Duke Diet and Fitness
      Center. At baseline the investigators will collect demographic information such as, their
      age, weight, education. When participants complete their respective program at the DFC they
      will receive a daily weight loss sustaining text message at 8:00 A.M. for 60 days.
      Participants will also receive weekly messages for 6 months asking them to self-report their
      weight. Thereafter, they will receive an automated message monthly for 18 months asking them
      to self-report their weight.
