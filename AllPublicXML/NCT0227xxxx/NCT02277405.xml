  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare time and success rates of four intubation devices in a
      cardiopulmonary scenario with and without chest compressions with a standardized pediatric
      manikin model.

      Emergency airway management during resuscitation is a critical skill in emergency medicine.
      According to the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines for resuscitation 2010 ,
      endotracheal intubation (ETI) is considered the gold standard during resuscitation.
