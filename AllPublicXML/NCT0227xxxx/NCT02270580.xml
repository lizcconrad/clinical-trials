    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2 patient navigator conditions: PN+ and usual PN in
      which (condition 1) we will evaluate the efficacy of a culturally tailored PN program (&quot;PN+&quot;)
      on improving quality of life (QoL), screening practices and treatment follow-up compliance
      among breast HL survivors. In usual PN, participants will receive information brochures on
      breast cancer survivorship and have a minimum of 1 contact with the patient navigator.

      This RCT involves a 2 (group) by 2 (time) repeated measures design with experimental
      condition (specialized PN+cancer survivorship program over 6 months versus PN only (control
      condition) as the between-groups factor, and time-point (baseline pre-randomization and
      post-PN at 6 months follow-up) as the within-groups factor. This RCT involves 2 patient
      navigator conditions: PN+ and usual PN in which (condition 1) we will evaluate the efficacy
      of a culturally tailored PN program (&quot;PN+&quot;) on improving quality of life (QoL), screening
      practices and treatment follow-up compliance among breast HL survivors. In usual PN,
      participants will receive information brochures on breast cancer survivorship and have a
      minimum of 1 contact with the patient navigator.

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) will be administered to evaluate general domains of QOL. The FACT-G, now in its fourth revision, is one of the most widely used instruments to assess overall adjustment to cancer treatment and survivorship. It is a 27-item self-report questionnaire that takes less than 15 minutes to administer. The FACT-G assesses QOL in four domains of well-being: physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being. Patients are asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements such as &quot;I have pain,&quot; &quot;I feel ill,&quot; &quot;I get emotional support from my family,&quot; &quot;I get support from my friends,&quot; &quot;I feel sad,&quot; &quot;I feel nervous,&quot; &quot;I am sleeping well,&quot; and &quot;I am content with the quality of my life right now.&quot; The scale is validated for use in many settings with many age groups. We will calculate a composite score for general QOL as well as subscale scores for specific domains of QOL.</description>

    <measure>Disease-specific quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer a cancer-specific FACT version, the FACT-B (breast cancer survivors). It addresses QOL issues that are common sequelae of that certain cancer.</description>

    <measure>Treatment follow-up compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Because all of our HL cancer survivors will be recruited within 12-months post-treatment completion for a primary tumor, we will follow ACS guidelines for follow-up care for one- to two-years post-treatment. We will assess via self-report whether the participant missed a scheduled follow-up appointment during the study period. A compliance categorical outcome measure (compliant vs. non-compliant) will be calculated for each participant. Compliance will be defined as attending all scheduled follow-up appointments specific to cancer treatment follow-up during the study period.</description>
