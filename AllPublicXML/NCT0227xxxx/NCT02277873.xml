      The purpose of this study is to establish the relationship between moon and births through
      two analytic models.

    <textblock>
      Retrospective, descriptive and observational study. Classical model performs comparisons of
      births among lunar periods, lineal, cubical and exponential estimation was performed in the
      SPSS software and the inflection point of the curve was estimated using the formula x=[In
      (1/ebx)]/ebx in the Geogebra model. The significance was establish by a p value of â‰¤ 0.05
      (95% IC).

      The second analysis was performed by the difference of media between all the stages of the
      moon cycle as in another trials. The difference was establish by the T-student test. The
      difference between groups was performed by the one way ANOVA test.

      This study had the review and approval from the Ethics Committee of the institution and
      according with Mexican regulation, and in adherence to the Helsinki declaration and
      International Conference for Harmonisation

    <description>Initial association was tempted to be done based on previous analysis described.
The &quot;Gibada moon&quot; phase showed a significant difference versus Full moon and new moon, due to average birth is increased in this phase</description>

    <measure>Second model of analysis. Luminosity - Births</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 34 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For this analysis, the moon luminosity was estimated as percentage (%), as a measure of proximity between moon and the earth, and was correlated to number of births. More the percentage of light is, closest to the earth the moon is.</description>
