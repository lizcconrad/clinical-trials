      To compare the influence of a training program with Pilates and PNF methods to elderly women
      on the strength gains and motor control during voluntary contractions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty healthy elderly women were randomly divided into 3 groups: Pilates group (PG), PNF
      group (PNFG) and Control group (CG). Pilates and PNF groups underwent one-month (three times
      per week) training program with Pilates and PNF methods, respectively. CG received no
      intervention along the one month. The maximal isometric force from knee extension and
      flexion, as well as the EMG signal from quadriceps and biceps femoris were recorded before
      and after the one-month intervention period. A two-way analysis of variance (3 groups x 2
      measures) was used to compare the results from EMG signal, isometric force and force
      variability and force spectrum. A one-month training program with Pilates and PNF methods
      induces similar strength gains from knee flexors and extensors, without differences between
      methods, but PG exhibited greater low gamma drive (i.e., 30-60 Hz band) after the training
      period. Both Pilates and PNF methods were efficient to improve the muscle strength, but with
      different neuromuscular adaptations in elderly women. These results give support to the
      recommendation these methods to older age groups, since the increment of lower limb muscle
      strength is important for gait, postural stability and performance of daily life activities
      of this population.

    <description>The exercise protocol of Pilates method consisted of muscle stretching of the upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs before the exercises. Then, exercises involving range of motion and strength of upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs were performed, always associated with breathing in different positions and with increasing repetitions and resistance along the weeks of training.</description>

    <description>The exercises from the PNF method were performed with stretching, associated to hold-relax technique, for upper and lower limbs. Then, subjects carried out exercises with the upper limbs, in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern, and with the lower limbs, in the asymmetric bilateral pattern. Additionally, scapular and pelvic girdle exercises were done with symmetrical and reciprocal combination.</description>
