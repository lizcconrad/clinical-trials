    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate which home dialysis modality pattern (home
      hemodialysis [HHD], peritoneal dialysis [PD] or a combination of both, e.g. PD and then HHD)
      allows for the longest home dialysis survival, as defined by the time dialysed in a home
      environment. The investigators hypothesize that patients transferred from one home modality
      to another will have a longer home dialysis survival compared to patients treated only with
      PD or HHD.

    <description>Case-control analysis will be performed in order to address immortal bias in patients classified in the &quot;switching&quot;categories (PD-HHD or HHD-PD). Since we expect the HHD-PD group to be small, this analysis will be performed only with the 3 other groups (PD-HHD, PD only and HHD only). Patients treated successively with PD and HHD (cases) will be matched (by age and diabetes status) to patient treated with PD only and HHD only (controls).</description>
