  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testicular cancer (TC) is a rare disease, which mostly affects young men aged 15-35 years.
      Their life expectancy has greatly improved due to the introduction of platinum-containing
      chemotherapy for disseminated TC in the late 1970s. Given the good prognosis of TC nowadays,
      prevention or early detection of late adverse effects of TC treatment has become increasingly
      important. Current literature suggests that TC treatment, and specifically exposure to
      platinum agents, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      The precise role of treatment components like platinum in the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic
      changes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) warrants further investigation, since it is not
      known if CVD develops through direct platinum-induced damage of the vascular wall or by
      mediation through development of cardiometabolic riskfactors. The aim of this study is to
      identify risk factors for development for CVD after treatment for TC. A more profound insight
      into pathophysiologic mechanisms and identification of risk factors for CVDs is needed to
      facilitate development of preventive strategies and to optimize survivorship care.

      Design: The investigators will perform a multicenter case-cohort study. Patients treated for
      TC who developed cardiac disease ((either myocardial infarction, proven coronary artery
      disease (grade ≥2) or congestive heart failure (grade ≥2)) will be invited by their (former)
      treating oncologist to participate in this study (cases). Furthermore, in each hospital a
      random sample of 15% of the total population treated for TC will be invited (the subcohort).
      The investigators will collect detailed diagnostic- and treatment data on TC and on (risk
      factors for) CVD for all cases as well as for all subcohort members. All cases and subcohort
      members will be approached to complete a questionnaire and to donate a blood sample for DNA
      analysis, after written informed consent. Patients who were younger than 40 years at TC
      diagnosis and younger than 75 years at moment of study contact will be asked to participate
      in the cardiometabolic risk inventory sub study. For this, participants have to undergo a
      basic study assessment consisting of physical examination, venapuncture and handing in a
      morning urine sample. This assessment can be performed at the participating hospital, their
      general practitioner or during a home visit by a member of the investigators research team.
      Additional (non-invasive) cardiovascular function measurements (IMT and AGEs) are only
      performed in the UMCG.
