  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the natural history and causes of chronic critical
      illness (CCI) in surgical intensive care patients who have had sepsis. The investigator also
      wants to define the long-term physical and cognitive outcomes of this disease. The
      investigator will be looking at many clinical variables to try to define CCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study aimed at identifying the frequency, natural
      history and long term outcomes of CCI and PICS in the survivors of surgical or
      trauma-associated sepsis.

      A major portion of the translational data to be obtained will be from urine and blood samples
      from septic patients identified in the surgery and trauma ICUs. The blood will be processed
      for genomic markers, inflammatory markers, immunosuppression markers, Myeloid Derived
      Suppressor Cells (MDSC) functions, and angiogenic factors. The urine will be processed for
      messenger RNA (mRNA) isolation and protein biomarkers.

      Bioimpedance analysis will performed to assess body composition. In order to assess the long
      term outcomes, the following Quality-of-life, functional and cognitive tests will be
      performed.

      Health-related quality of life questionnaire, EuroQol-5D, Mini Nutritional Assessment Form,
      the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Controlled Oral Word Association, Modified Mini-Mental
      Status Exam, Short PhysicalPerformance Battery, Hand Grip Strength Measurement and The
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), World Health Organization (WHO), Zubrod Scale
      Healthy volunteer subjects will be identified from the general population. Healthy subjects
      will be screened via inclusion/exclusion criteria upon contact. If appropriate for
      participation, the subject will be consulted for consent.
