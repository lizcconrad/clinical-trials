      Subjects achieving a clinical response in study OX4218s with a biomarker reduction or symptom
      response are eligible to enroll in this rollover study to continue once every three weeks
      fosbretabulin infusions for up to one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled in the PNET/GI-NET study OX4218s received weekly dosing with fosbretabulin
      for up to 3 cycles or approximately 9 weeks. Subjects achieving a clinical response with a
      biomarker reduction or symptom response based on investigator assessment are eligible to
      enroll in this rollover study (protocol OX4219s). Subjects will receive fosbretabulin every
      three weeks for a maximum of approximately one year or until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, protocol-noncompliance, or the investigator feels
      that it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue therapy.
