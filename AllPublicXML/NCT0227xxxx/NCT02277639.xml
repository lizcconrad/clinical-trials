  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial to determine the ability of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen
      to allow successful engraftment with CD3+ /CD19+ depleted peripheral stem cell grafts from
      mismatched donors. There are two conditioning regimens depending upon patient diagnosis and
      age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow transplantation using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for
      children with non-malignant diseases who lack a matched related or unrelated donor. Donors
      will be unrelated or partially matched related, depending upon urgency and availability. If
      each parent is haploidentical, the mother will be preferred, as there is evidence of reduced
      transplant related mortality and superior survival with a maternal donor. The risks of severe
      graft vs host disease (GVHD) and Epstein-Barr lymphoproliferative disorder will be reduced or
      eliminated by T and B cell depletion using the Miltenyi Clinimacs device. Patients with bone
      marrow failure syndromes, who are at high risk for rejection, will undergo pre-conditioning
      immune suppression with Thymoglobulin. It is recommended that patients with
      immunedysregulation syndromes receive pre-RIC alemtuzumab as this may reduce the risk on
      non-engraftment and hyperinflammatory states.

      Post-transplant immune suppression will be used to prevent GVHD, as CD3 depletion does not
      deplete as completely as CD34+ selection. It will be rapidly weaned if no GVHD by day 100 to
      allow immune reconstitution.
