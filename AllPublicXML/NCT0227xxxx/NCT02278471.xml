      In this study the investigators will examine the effect of the polypill on medication
      adherence, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol over a 12 month span.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if a polypill-based approach to primary CVD prevention
      is feasible in a low socioeconomic status population. The study will assess whether a
      polypill approach is associated with better cardiovascular risk factor control compared with
      usual care.

      The polypill will be supplied as a compounded pill containing atorvastatin 10 mg, amlodipine
      2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. The medications in the polypill have
      been extensively evaluated individually and in combination. Each of the medications in the
      polypill is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and widely
      administered in the US for the treatment of and prevention of cardiovascular disease. The
      doses of each component medication included in the polypill are low, which should minimize
      the chance of any potential side-effects.

      In this study we assess medication adherence, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol
      over a 12 month span, in subjects taking the polypill versus subjects under usual care.
