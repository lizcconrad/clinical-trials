  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, expanded access study designed to provide
      alectinib to participants with ALK-rearranged NSCLC after disease progression on or
      intolerance to prior ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Participants will receive
      alectinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, patient or
      physician decision to discontinue treatment, death, alectinib becomes commercially available
      in the United States following approval of alectinib by the FDA, or the Sponsor decides to
      close the trial, whichever occurs first (approximately 15 months).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Stage
             IIIB) not amenable to curative therapy or metastatic (AJCC Stage IV) NSCLC

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0-3

          -  Histologically confirmed NSCLC

          -  Documented ALK rearrangement as assessed by approved fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH) test, using the Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit or the
             Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC) test

          -  After disease progression on or intolerance to prior ALK TKI therapy: 1) participants
             need to have a minimum washout period of at least 5 half-lives between the last dose
             of ALK TKI therapy or other targeted therapies and the first dose of study treatment;
             2) participants must have recovered from treatment toxicities to less than or equal to
             (&lt;/=) Grade 1 or to their pretreatment levels (for participants who have developed
             interstitial lung disease [ILD], they must have fully recovered); 3) participants can
             either be chemotherapy-na√Øve or have received at least one line of platinum-based
             chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease

          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28
             days before the first dose of study treatment

          -  Adequate hematological and renal function

          -  Agreement to use highly effective methods of contraception per protocol definitions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy with alectinib

          -  Participants with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are
             neurologically unstable or require increasing doses of steroids within 1 week prior to
             Day 1 to manage CNS symptoms

          -  Administration of strong/potent cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors or inducers, or
             agents with potential QT prolonging effects within 14 days prior to first
             administration of study drug

          -  Participants with liver disease

          -  Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with
             the conduct of the study

          -  Active or uncontrolled infectious diseases requiring treatment

          -  History of organ transplant

          -  Participants with baseline QTc &gt; 470 milliseconds (ms) or participants with
             symptomatic bradycardia

          -  Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the additives in alectinib formulation
