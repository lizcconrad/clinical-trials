  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is described as a multifactorial disease and can be
      directly linked to other diseases, being of structural factors of the Stomatognathic System
      or not, such as fibromyalgia. Studies show the interconnection of Temporomandibular
      Dysfunctions with fibromyalgia. Thus, this project aims to evaluate the effect of
      Phototherapy on fibromiálgicos patients with temporomandibular dysfunction This is a
      Randomized, Controlled and double-blind, with the intention to treat. In this way the sample
      of 61 patients with Fibromyalgia, Temporomandibular joint Dysfunction associated with ages
      between 35 to 58 years, females who are selected after the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will
      be randomly distributed in homogeneous groups and the placebo group (P), Phototherapy (FT)
      group, group of physical activity (A) aerobic and aerobic physical activity + Phototherapy
      Group (FT + A). Will be used as a means of analysis before and after interventions the
      following parameters: Pain: clinical evaluation, evaluation of pain by Visual analog scale of
      pain (EVA), McGill Pain Questionnarire and pressure Algometria. Still we will evaluate the
      dosage of serotonin, indirectly, by saliva. Quality of life: own illness as questionnaires
      FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health
      Survey SF-36 and also will assess the quality of sleep, with polysomnography. The treatments
      will total in 10 sessions held twice a week, and the FT and FT + groups to receive
      Phototherapy enforcement will be used a portable cluster 9 diodes, where will be delivered
      39.3 Joules in tender points of fibromyalgia and TMJ, groups and FT + to carry out aerobic
      activity in 75% of your MHR for 50 min and the P group will receive the application of
      Phototherapy of 0 Joules (IE, the equipment does not emit any power). Statistical analysis
      will be compared using the t test intra-group-Student, one-tail and paired and can be used
      the Kruskal-Wallis test, the statistical analysis of significance 0.05 for both tests.
