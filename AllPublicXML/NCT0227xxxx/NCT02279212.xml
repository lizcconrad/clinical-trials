      Previous research on intensive care unit (ICU) survivors shows that rehabilitation is
      challenging, because of patients experiences of disease related problems both under and after
      treatment. Approximately 20 % of patients die within hospital, up to 80% suffer from
      hallucinations and nightmares, deal with paranoiac experiences, chronic pain and other
      symptoms and disability (Angus et al 2004; De Letter et al 2001; Ely et al 2001; Nelson et al
      2006; Van den Berghe et al 2001; Van den Berghe et al 2003) . A recent study shows that 28%
      of intensive care survivors have chronic pain that reduce their health related quality of
      life (Boyle et al 2004).

      The aim of this study is to perform a survey about prevalence of pain type, and which
      consequences this causes when it comes to function and quality of life up to 12 months after
      the ICU stay.

        1. What type of pain has ICU survivors and how do pain change over time, related to
           treatment/rehabilitation and the illness' development?

        2. What is the relationship between different pain characteristic, quality of life,
           anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep and PTSD in these patients?

        3. What is these patients largest obstacle for good QoL after discharge from hospital?

      A prospective and longitudinal survey 3 time points for data collection:

        1. ICU - background data about the patients ICU stay (days on ventilator, medication,
           treatment, SAPS II, SOFA etc).

        2. 3 months after ICU discharge - survey about pain, QoL, sleep, fatigue, Post traumatic
           stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression.

        3. One year after ICU discharge - the same as 3 months.

      Survey instruments:

      Pain - Brief Pain Inventory, Neuropathic Pain Syndrome Inventory, Pain diary QoL - SF 12,
      Sleep - General Sleep Disorder Scale Fatigue - Lee Fatigue Scale Anxiety and depression -
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale PTSD - PTSS 10 Social Provision - Revised Social
      Provision Scale
