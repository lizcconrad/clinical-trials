      This is a phase-I, dose escalation study to assess the safety and biological activity of
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion followed by adoptive transfer of vaccine-primed,
      ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated peripheral blood autologous T-cells, and recombinant human
      interleukin-18 (SB-485232, IL-18) treatment in adult patients with recurrent, Stage III or IV
      ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who previously underwent
      induction vaccination with whole tumor vaccine

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial cancer. Subject must have a
             measurable disease for enrollment consideration

          -  Subjects who have received at least one vaccine under protocol UPCC-19809 or
             UPCC-29810

          -  Predicted life expectancy of greater than or equal to 4 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Must be at least 4 weeks post-operative

          -  No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biological therapy for cancer,
             radiotherapy, or surgical procedures (except for minor surgical procedures) within
             four weeks before beginning treatment with SB-485232 (six weeks for nitrosoureas and
             mitomycin C). Subjects must have recovered from toxicities (incurred as a result of
             previous therapy) sufficiently to be entered into a Phase I study.

          -  Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is
             less than or equal to 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a subject
             is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin or anticoagulants for management of venous
             thrombosis including pulmonary thrombo-embolus) and a PTT less than 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal.

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent form is obtained from the subject. - The
             subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, timetables,
             instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.

          -  Normal organ and bone marrow function as defined by: - Absolute neutrophil count
             greater than 1,000/ul - Platelets greater than 100,000/ul - Hematocrit greater than or
             equal to 30 percent - AST (SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than 2.5 X institutional upper limit
             of normal - Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL unless secondary to bile duct blockage by
             tumor - Creatinine less than1.8 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or
             autoimmune conditions that in the opinion of the investigator places the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as participant in this trial.

          -  Subjects with any severe concurrent disease or condition, including significant active
             autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which in the judgment of the
             principal investigator would make the subject inappropriate for study participation.

          -  Subjects who require or are likely to require more than a two-week course of
             corticosteroids for intercurrent illness. Subjects must complete therapy prior to
             enrollment. Topical corticosteroids should be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment and systemic corticosteroids should be stopped at least 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Subjects with any acute infection or severe or uncontrolled that requires systematic
             antibiotic therapy. Acute therapy must have been completed at least seven days prior
             to study enrollment.

          -  Subjects with any underlying conditions, which would contraindicate therapy with,
             study treatment (or allergies to reagents used in this study).

          -  Women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.

          -  Subject has positive test result at the screening visit for one or more of the
             following: HTLV-1/2 and/or Anti-HIV 1 Antibody (a-HIV-1).

          -  Subjects receiving medications that might affect immune function. Additionally, H2
             blockers are excluded, as are all antihistamines five days before and five days after
             each injection of study drug. NOTE: The following are exceptions: Proton pump
             Inhibitors (PPIs), NSAIDS including COX-2 inhibitors, acetaminophen or Enteric Coated
             Aspirin.

          -  Subjects who are positive for serum anti-Yo (cdr2) antibodies are not eligible (Yo
             antibody does not need to be repeated if performed in the past).

          -  Subjects receiving class III antiarrythmic medications.

          -  Subjects with any serious medical or psychiatric disorder that would interfere with
             subject safety or informed consent.

          -  Psychological,familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.

          -  Known leptomeningeal disease or evidence of prior or current metastatic brain disease.

          -  Any investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is longer)
             preceding the first dose of SB-485232.

          -  Subject does not have measurable disease.

          -  Subject has no tissue from UPCC19809 EOS biopsy and unwilling to undergo screening
             biopsy.
