  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is a non invasive measure of lung function that is more
      sensitive than FEV1. It can be used to measure lung function in children younger than 6 years
      of age. Therefore, it has a future role in assessing novel therapeutics in the Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF) population. As such, determining if it can be used as a short term
      pharmacodynamic biomarker is paramount.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled Hypertonic saline (7%) is a treatment intervention for Cystic Fibrosis patients and
      has previously been shown to improve lung function and decrease the number of pulmonary
      exacerbations. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Gene (CFTR) protein is essential
      for maintaining fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the lung and CFTR defects cause
      depletion of the periciliary liquid layer which results in impaired mucociliary clearance.
      Inhaled hypertonic saline (7%) acts as an osmotic agent in the lungs; it repletes the airway
      surface liquid (ASL) and improves mucociliary clearance.

      In addition, we have recently demonstrated that the Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is also a
      responsive outcome measure. In an intervention study in which patients were treated with
      hypertonic saline inhalation twice daily for 28 days, LCI but not FEV1 significantly improved
      in 17 pediatric Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients with mild lung disease. In this study, LCI was
      more sensitive to a change in response to treatment than spirometry in a small number of
      patients. However, it still remains unknown if the LCI will be able to detect a treatment
      effect on a shorter time scale after an intervention. Its use as a short-term pharmacodynamic
      biomarker in CF patients remains unknown. The ability of the LCI to detect treatment effects
      within hours after an intervention would be invaluable to the development of new therapeutic
      interventions for CF patients.
