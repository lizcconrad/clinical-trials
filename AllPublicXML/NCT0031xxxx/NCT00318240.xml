      This is a feasibility study to determine the safety and the ability of HIFU (High Intensity
      Focused Ultrasound)to selectively destroy prostate cancer tissue in men who demonstrate local
      recurrence of prostate cancer following radiation treatment. All participants will receive
      treatment with HIFU and be monitored closely for recurrence of disease (if any),quality of
      life and adverse events.
