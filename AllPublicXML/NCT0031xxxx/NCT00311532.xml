    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of new-onset valvulopathy,
      determined by baseline and follow-up echocardiograms, in patients with Parkinson's Disease
      who are receiving pergolide as second-line therapy.

      The secondary objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of valvulopathy, as
      determined by baseline echocardiograms, among all patients who have Parkinson's Disease and
      are being considered for pergolide as second-line therapy.
