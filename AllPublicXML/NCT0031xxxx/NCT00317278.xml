  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are exposed to stressful stimuli such as
      loud noises, bright lights, blood drawing, suctioning, and intubation, and are frequently
      left in isolation with minimal proper interaction. Stress has been demonstrated to exert a
      negative effect on the immune system. Different psychological interventions, including
      relaxation, have been used in efforts to reduce stress, and several of these techniques have
      been shown to improve cellular immunity. Massage therapy (MT) has been used to reduce stress
      in premature infants and has been associated with weight gain, shorter hospital stay, and
      improvement in mental/motor development. While MT has been shown to increase the number and
      function of natural killer (NK) cells in healthy adults and in adults infected with HIV, the
      effect of MT on the immune system of children, including premature infants, has never been
      investigated. The investigators hypothesize that, in premature infants, MT will enhance the
      immune system. One hundred and twenty stable premature infants meeting selection criteria
      will be randomized to massage and sham treatment groups. Immunologic evaluation will be
      performed on both groups at baseline, midway and at the end of therapy. Physicians, nurses,
      and parents will be masked. The investigators' unique and innovative study will be the
      largest study in this area and will provide valuable information on potential immune
      parameters associated with stress reduction and improved development in premature infants
      undergoing massage therapy.
