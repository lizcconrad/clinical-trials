  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Lapatinib with
      Carboplatin AUC 6 in patients with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian or primary peritoneal
      carcinoma and to determine the nature and degree of toxicity of Lapatinib in combination with
      carboplatin AUC 6 in this cohort of patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to unacceptable non-dose limiting toxicities, excessive treatment delays and limited
    clinical responses.
