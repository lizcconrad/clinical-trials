      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect on cells and patient response to study
      medications, assess the side effects of these medications, and to evaluate chemicals in the
      cells that may tell how the drug works, before, and after receiving the study medications.

      Approximately 61 patients will participate at Emory Winship Cancer Institute and Emory
      Crawford W. Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

    <measure>Dose Escalation and Toxicity: Toxicities Including Grades 1 to 4</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from time of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants received a fixed dose of celecoxib 400 mg orally BID continuously for 6 months. Erlotinib was dose escalated at 3 dose levels of 50, 75, and 100 mg orally every day for 6 months. Dose escalation followed a standard 3+3 escalation design.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcome: Documented Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from time of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Response evaluation was based on pathologic examination of the degree of dysplasia observed and recorded by an expert head and neck pathologist. Pathologic complete response was defined as complete disappearance of dysplasia from the epithelium. Pathologic partial response was defined as improvement of dysplasia by at least one degree (i.e., severe dysplasia becomes moderate dysplasia). Pathologic minor response or stable disease was defined as minor focal improvement without change of degree of dysplasia (i.e., focal improvement from moderate to mild dysplasia with still moderate dysplasia overall) or no pathologic changes after treatment. Pathologic progressive disease was defined as worsening by at least one degree of dysplasia (i.e., mild to moderate dysplasia) or development of invasive cancer on or following treatment.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between October 24, 2006, and June 28, 2012, 36 subjects with documented premalignant lesions, including mild (mild-D), moderate, or severe oral leukoplakia, and carcinoma in situ (CIS) were screened. Lesion sites included oral cavity oropharynx, and the larynx.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Seventeen subjects were enrolled on the study, 3 of whom withdrew consent (one male of 69 years of age, and two females of 43 and 42 years of age). Two patients who signed informed consent were deemed to be screen failures, one secondary to prior history of oral squamous cell carcinoma and the other secondary to a history of cardiac arrhythmias.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Response evaluation was based on pathologic examination of the degree of dysplasia observed and recorded by an expert head and neck pathologist. Pathologic complete response was defined as complete disappearance of dysplasia from the epithelium. Pathologic partial response was defined as improvement of dysplasia by at least one degree (i.e., severe dysplasia becomes moderate dysplasia). Pathologic minor response or stable disease was defined as minor focal improvement without change of degree of dysplasia (i.e., focal improvement from moderate to mild dysplasia with still moderate dysplasia overall) or no pathologic changes after treatment. Pathologic progressive disease was defined as worsening by at least one degree of dysplasia (i.e., mild to moderate dysplasia) or development of invasive cancer on or following treatment.</description>
