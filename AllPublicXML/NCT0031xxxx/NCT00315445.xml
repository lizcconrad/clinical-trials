  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety of the buprenorphine transdermal system
      (5, 10, and 20) in comparison to placebo transdermal system and immediate release oxycodone/
      acetaminophen in subjects with chronic back pain. The double-blind treatment intervention
      duration is 84 days during which time supplemental analgesic medication (non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs) will be allowed for all subjects in addition to study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic with over twenty-five years of international
      clinical experience indicating it to be safe and effective in a variety of therapeutic
      situations for the relief of moderate to severe pain.

    <measure>The Time to Discontinuation Due to Lack of Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Time after dosing to dropout due to lack of efficacy</time_frame>
    <description>Dropouts due to various reasons were summarized by counts and percentage. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the treatment differences in time to dropout due to lack of efficacy. Clinically important covariates (including gender, age, race, weight, baseline pain, and previous opioid use) were incorporated into the model when statistically significant at P&lt; .10, using a backward elimination procedure.</description>

          <description>The MOS Short-Form Health Survey assesses 8 categories of functionality through 36 individual questions. &quot;Mental Health&quot; is 1 of the 8 categories. Its transformed score, scaled from 0% to 100%, is used. A higher score represents a better subject condition. The survey was completed by the subject at the clinic.</description>

This is a multiple imputation method that requires imputed changes from baseline to be stratified by discontinuation (D/C) reason. If subject D/C'd due to AE, the baseline observation was carried forward (ie, BOCF method of imputation). If subject D/C'd other than for an AE, the last missing data prior to D/C of study drug was carried forward (ie, LOCF method of imputation).</description>
