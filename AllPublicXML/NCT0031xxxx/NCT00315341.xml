  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested a study comparing buprenorphine/naloxone
      (BUP/NX) and methadone (MET) on indices of hepatic safety.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, Phase 4 study to assess the changes in liver
      enzymes related to treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) and methadone (MET) in
      participants entering opioid agonist treatment. Randomization will be stratified, within
      site, according to normal versus abnormal screening liver function tests. Participants
      meeting entry criteria will be dosed for 24 weeks during the active phase of the study with
      assessment of liver function at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and with follow-up
      assessments at week 32. Clinicians will be encouraged to treat with adequate doses of BUP/NX
      and MET.

    <description>Participants were categorized according liver transaminase (ALT, AST) levels in blood comparing the baseline sample to any and all subsequent samples in the following manner:
A: both ALT and AST started at less than or equal to two times the ULN and remained at two times or less ULN throughout the study
B: either ALT or AST started at less than or equal to 2 x ULN and at any point in study exceeded 2 x ULN
C: Either ALT or AST started &gt; 2 x ULN, decreased (both ALT and AST) to &lt; 2 x ULN, and remained &lt; 2 x ULN
D: Either ALT or AST started &gt; 2 x ULN and remained above 2 x ULN throughout the study</description>

    <description>For the BUP/NX group, all participants will receive up to 16 mg BUP/4 mg NX on day 1 and up to 32 mg BUP/8 mg NX on day 2. It is recommended that dose changes be made in 2 to 8 mg buprenorphine increments, with the range of allowable daily doses between 2 mg and 32 mg starting on day 3 and thereafter according to clinical impression and depending upon the participant's clinical need. Investigators are encouraged to dose adequately to decrease craving and to obtain negative urine toxicology specimens.</description>

    <description>For the MET group, all participants will receive a maximum of 30 mg for the first dose and a maximum of 40 mg on Day 1.

Doses will be adjusted on Day 4 and thereafter according to clinical impression and depending upon the participant's clinical need with no specific upper limit.

             *An ECG was abnormal if one or more of the following occurred:

             extremity during eligibility

         19. Pregnant or lactating (females only)

      <time_frame>Adverse events (medical and/or psychiatric) assessment will initiate with participant randomization and will continue through 30 days post last dose of study medication administered. Study staff should contact each participant 30 days after study completion and/or discontinuation of study medication to follow-up on any adverse events continuing at study end and to determine whether the participant experienced any adverse events within the 30 days after discontinuing study medication.</time_frame>
      <desc>All AEs reported during the course of the study requiring medical attention will be reported to a study physician immediately. A study physician may then meet any participants for whom additional follow-up or AE assessment is indicated. The type of AE, severity of the AE and the relationship of the AE to the study treatments will be assessed by appropriately trained medical personnel and recorded on an AE CRF, according to the procedures described in Section 14.2.</desc>

          <description>For the BUP/NX group, all participants will receive up to 16 mg BUP/4 mg NX on day 1 and up to 32 mg BUP/8 mg NX on day 2. It is recommended that dose changes be made in 2 to 8 mg buprenorphine increments, with the range of allowable daily doses between 2 mg and 32 mg starting on day 3 and thereafter according to clinical impression and depending upon the participant’s clinical need. Investigators are encouraged to dose adequately to decrease craving and to obtain negative urine toxicology specimens.</description>

          <title>Methadone</title>
          <description>For the MET group, all participants will receive a maximum of 30 mg for the first dose and a maximum of 40 mg on Day 1. It is recommended that participants receive a dose on day 2 that is 10 mg higher than their total day 1 dose, and a dose on day 3 that is 10 mg higher than their total day 2 dose, unless, in the clinical judgment of the physician, a slower induction is needed. Doses will be adjusted on Day 4 and thereafter according to clinical impression and depending upon the participant’s clinical need with no specific upper limit. Investigators are encouraged to dose adequately to decrease craving and to obtain negative urine toxicology specimens.</description>
