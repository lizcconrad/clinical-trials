      The purpose of this study was to describe the time course and extent of hemoglobin (Hb)
      changes and the erythropoietic response to PEG-IFN/RBV (Pegylated Interferon and
      Ribavirin)-induced anemia In HCV(hepatitis C virus)/HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
      co-Infected subjects.

    <textblock>
      Patients receiving combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
      (standard or pegylated interferon alfa [PEG-IFN] in combination with ribavirin [RBV])
      frequently develop moderate to severe anemia. In large, prospective, clinical trials of
      PEG-IFN alfa-2b and PEG-IFN alfa-2a, the reported mean decreases in hemoglobin (Hb) were 2.5
      g/dL, and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. Furthermore, in a retrospective study, 54% of standard
      interferon/RBV-treated patients had hemoglobin decreases of at least 3 g/dL. It is important
      to understand the causes, natural history, and risk factors associated with HCV
      therapy-induced anemia, because such decreases in hemoglobin can result in RBV dose reduction
      or discontinuation, which may decrease the likelihood of a virologic response by patient.
      Erythropoietin is an endogenous hormone that acts in the bone marrow to increase the number
      of erythroid progenitor cells (red blood cells). Normally, a decrease in the hemoglobin level
      is accompanied by an increase in the serum erythropoietin (sEPO) level, which will ultimately
      normalize the Hemoglobin level. The relationship between hemoglobin and serum erythropoietin
      is less apparent in patients with chronic diseases such as cancer and human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) infection. It is not known whether HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving
      combination PEG-IFN/RBV therapy have a similarly diminished erythropoietic response to
      anemia. The objective of this study is to document the pattern of hemoglobin changes and
      erythropoietic response (from baseline to final assessment) in HCV/HIV co-infected patients
      receiving combination therapy with IFN / RBV. N/A
