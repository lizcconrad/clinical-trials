  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have identified focussing problems related to myopia getting worse. Our trial uses optical
      and orthoptic interventions that correct the focussing problems to see if this retards myopia
      progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a burgeoning health and social problem. Currently there is no acceptable clinical
      treatment that prevents progression. This study is a double masked placebo controlled block
      randomized clinical trial of two interventions, to treat accommodative factors we have
      identified as being significantly correlated to myopia progression (rather than to the
      presence of myopia). We have shown that the interventions normalise the accommodative
      factors, and this trial examines the effect of these interventions on myopia progression.
