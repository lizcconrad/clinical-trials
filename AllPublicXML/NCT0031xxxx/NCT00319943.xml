  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the neuropsychological and neurophysiological
      impacts of a computer-based training program designed to improve the cognitive performance of
      patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of a computerized, cognitive
      intervention with three main goals: 1) to assess the magnitude of improvements in memory,
      language function, and cognitive function following computer training, 2) to investigate the
      neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such neuropsychological improvements, and 3) to
      demonstrate the feasibility of using this kind of computer-based therapy in older
      populations.
