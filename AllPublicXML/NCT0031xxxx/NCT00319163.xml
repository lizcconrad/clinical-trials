  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To determine the bioequivalence between the clinical batch process and the
      new processes for manufacturing LNG/EE.

      Secondary Objective: To obtain additional safety and tolerability data concerning LNG/EE in
      healthy, cycling women.
