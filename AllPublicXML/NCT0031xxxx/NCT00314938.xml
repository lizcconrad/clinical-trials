  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first clinical study of the development of PHA-794428 in a pediatric
      population. Since differences in PK and/or PD response may occur between adult and pediatric
      subjects, it is deemed appropriate to first conduct an exploratory single dose study in
      pediatric patients to assess safety and tolerability in this patient population. In addition
      this will add pediatric data to facilitate the prediction of the optimal therapeutic dose to
      be tested in repeated dose phase 2b trials in children, using PK/PD modeling

      The study terminated on 10-Dec-2007. Pfizer's decision to terminate the program was due to
      cases of injection-site lipoatrophy that were reported in the clinical Phase 2 studies after
      a single injection of PHA 794428.
