  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of low dose
      nicotine gel in patients with chronic diabetic ulcers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be the first time that nicotine will be applied directly onto the
      surface of chronic diabetic ulcer. The goals of the study are to evaluate safety and
      tolerability (particularly at the wound site) of a gel formulation containing low-dose
      nicotine, and to obtain preliminary information on its effects on accelerating wound closure.
      The study will be carried out on a background of conventional wound therapy in patients with
      Type II diabetes mellitus. Patients will be randomized to receive either study medication
      (ATG002), vehicle gel, or standard-of-care.
