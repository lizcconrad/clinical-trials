  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to build on preliminary data evaluating non-dopaminergic/non-motor clinical
      biomarkers to more fully assess these markers at the threshold of Parkinson disease (PD).

      Development of reliable biomarkers for both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic manifestations
      of Parkinson disease (PD) and related disorders may dramatically accelerate research on PD
      etiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutics. Biomarkers are broadly defined as
      characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal
      biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic
      intervention. Specific biomarkers may be useful at the onset of neurodegeneration, the onset
      of disease, and/or to mark disease progression.

      Two hundred patients who have undergone neurological evaluation by their general community
      neurologist and have a questionable diagnosis of PD will be recruited to participate in this
      study. Subjects will be referred by the neurologists to the Institute for Neurodegenerative
      Disorders (IND) in New Haven, CT.

      All subjects will be clinically evaluated at IND by a two movement disorders experts. At the
      baseline visit all subjects will also undergo [123I]ß-CIT SPECT ANAM, voice acoustics,
      olfactory, Spiral and biochemical testing. Each movement disorders expert will make an
      initial clinical diagnosis at baseline and again within three months follow-up. At the three
      month visit one movement disorder expert will be provided the DAT imaging data and will
      review that data with the subjects and referral physician. The other movement disorders
      physician will remain blind to the imaging and all other biomarker data. The blinded movement
      disorders expert will provide a final clinical diagnosis at the 12 month follow-up visit,
      which will represent the 'gold standard' diagnosis in this study. Statistical analysis to
      determine the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM, voice acoustics, olfactory, Spiral and
      biochemical testing compared to [123I]ß-CIT SPECT, and the gold standard clinical diagnosis
      will be completed. All subjects with DAT deficit and 10% of those without DAT deficit will be
      asked to return for repeat evaluation at 24 months.

    <description>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
SPECT imaging uses the single photon emissions from radioactive compounds that are (most commonly) injected into a patient and are metabolized by specific organs or body systems. SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called projections), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D dataset. This dataset may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as MRI, CT, and PET. The resulting SPECT images reflect body/organ function as opposed to specific anatomy of other imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.</description>
