    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the need for reflective heat shield covers over the
      temperature probes applied to the skin of newborn babies who are being nursed under a radiant
      warmer.

    <textblock>
      Servocontrolled radiant warmers are widely used for infants' temperature maintenance.
      Covering the attached skin temperature (or thermistor) probe with a reflective shield may
      prevent inadvertent warming of the probe by the radiant heat source. However the shield
      itself might cause falsely elevated or lowered measured skin temperatures, and the use of
      such shields, while widespread, is not universal nor standard of care. This study aims to
      document the effects of a reflective shield on the measured skin temperatures of neonates
      nursed under radiant warmers.

      Stable newborn infants in the Maimonides NICU who are being nursed under a radiant warmer
      will be studied. As part of routine care, the thermistor probe will be applied and the
      desired servocontrolled skin temperature set. Once stabilized, a trimmed reflective shield to
      cover only the probe itself will be placed over the thermistor probe. Changes in measured
      skin temperature and warmer power output will be recorded non-invasively, as well as the time
      taken to reestablish baseline status. A full-sized reflective shield will then be placed over
      the thermistor probe and the same observations recorded, then repeated 15 minutes later. At
      the time of a subsequent routine change in thermistor position, the same procedure will be
      followed, but omitting the intermediate step of using the smaller trimmed shield. Continuous
      core temperatures will be monitored via a short rectal probe during the study periods.

      The effect of the use of the different size temperature probes will be examined by analyzing
      the effect on measured skin temperature.
