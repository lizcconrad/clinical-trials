  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bexarotene may be useful in the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This is the first
      study on the use of bexarotene to treat patients with AML. The main purpose of this study is
      to establish the proper dose of bexarotene when used to treat AML. The side effect profile of
      bexarotene in patients with AML will also be explored.

      Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, the prognosis is still poor for patients with
      relapsed or chemotherapy resistant AML. Further aggressive chemotherapy can be attempted, but
      generally yields poor results. This clinical study is the first use of bexarotene in the
      treatment of patient with relapsed or chemotherapy resistant AML. The main purpose of the
      study is to identify the maximum safe dose of bexarotene in patient with AML. Another
      objective of the study is to explore the side effect profile of bexarotene in AML patients.
      The study is organized so that the initial patients will get a low dose of bexarotene to be
      taken daily. If these patients tolerate the drug, then later patients will get higher daily
      doses. Further groups of patients will continue to increase their dose of bexarotene until a
      maximum tolerated dose is identified. The stu dy will end at that point. Patients will take
      the drug daily by mouth until such a time that their AML is worsening or they are
      experiencing unacceptable side effects. Their participating will end at that point.

          -  Must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-M3 AML as proven by bone marrow
             biopsy. Patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis are eligible.

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent.

          -  Must have recovered from the toxicities of prior chemotherapy.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception after enrollment in
             this study and have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of study enrollment. They
             must continue to use effective contraception for 3 months after stopping bexarotene.

          -  Men must agree to use effective methods of contraception while taking bexarotene and

          -  Taken bexarotene in the past.

          -  WBC &gt;10,000/uL at the time of enrollment. Patients may be taking hydrea for WBC
             control at the time of enrollment.

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or Mylotarg within the past 7 days other than hydrea.

          -  Significant organ dysfunction: total bilirubin&gt;3x ULN, AST or ALT&gt;3x ULN,
             creatinine&gt;4mg/dL, on blood pressure supporting medications or mechanical ventilation.

          -  Active participant in any other investigational treatment study for their AML.

          -  Unable/unwilling to perform required follow-up.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 1 month.

          -  Use of blood growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, Aranesp, erythropoietin, or Neumega)
             within 1 week prior to treatment initiation.

          -  Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (triglycerides&gt;1000 while on treatment with triglyceride
