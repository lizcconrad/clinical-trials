    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an experimental topical drug for the treatment of
      chronic, neuropathic, diabetic foot ulcers. The purpose of the study is to determine the
      safety of the experimental drug when applied to large, diabetic foot ulcers. The study will
      also determine if the experimental drug can safely promote healing of diabetic foot ulcers
      better than standard treatments currently available to doctors.

      Patients participating in the study may receive an active drug (MRE0094) or inactive drug
      (placebo). What treatment a patient will receive is determined by chance (like drawing a
      number from a hat). All patients will receive additional care for diabetic foot ulcers during
      the study.

      Participation in the study can be up to 4½ months.
