  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endogenous digitalis-like compounds (DLC)are steroid hormones synthesized and released
      from the adrenal gland.They are integrated in the feed-back system of the
      Hypothalami-Pituitary-Adrenal gland axis.One of their remarkable function is to induce
      apoptosis in malignant cells. Recently, accumulating data point to the possibility of using
      synthetic DLC as new anti-cancer drugs. Less is known about the endogenous metabolism of
      these compounds in cancer patients.

      Proceeding from preliminary clinical data which demonstrated significantly reduced DLC plasma
      levels in breast cancer patients and from in vitro data which showed an impaired release of
      DLC towards stress stimuli in athymic nude mice,we put up the hypothesis that a latent
      adrenal insufficiency with low DLC levels facilitates the induction and progression of tumor
      diseases.

      To pursue this question about endogenous DLC metabolism in cancer patients we intend to start
      with the measurement of DLC plasma levels in breast cancer patients at the time of first
      diagnosis and compare them to women with benign breast disease as well as healthy women.

      Aim of the Study

        -  To evaluate the basal DLC plasma concentrations in cancer patients at the time of first
           diagnosis and the function of the HPA axis, with focussing on breast cancer patients.

        -  To analyze a potential change of HPA function and, in parallel, DLC plasma
           concentrations in the course of therapy, with special respect to treatment failure.

        -  To establish a potential correlation between DLC plasma concentrations and risk factors
           in BC.

      Patients and Methods

      Patients:

      I. 50 - (100) patients with breast cancer at the time of first diagnosis

      II. 50 - (100) patients with a benign disease of the breast

      III. 50 - (100) women undergoing plastic surgery of the breast

      IV. 50 - (100) women who need no further exploration after visit in ambulance (=normal
      population)

      V. additionally a group of 25 - 50 students (age 20-40) will be analyzed in a pilot study

      Methods:

      Time-schedule for Group I (Group II. - IV. alike, according to disease and/or situation)

        -  Day of first presentation of the woman at the clinic

        -  Day of first diagnosis, i.e. biopsy/FNA

        -  Day + 30, + 60, + 90

        -  6 month and 1 year after start of treatment

      The Group V. (students) will be analyzed in a special schedule, preceding the study 1-2
      months:

        -  4 weeks before an important exam

        -  a day before the exam (-3 days)
