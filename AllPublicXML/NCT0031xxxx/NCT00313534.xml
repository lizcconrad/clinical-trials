      RATIONALE: Nordihydroguaiaretic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      nordihydroguaiaretic acid in treating patients with nonmetastatic relapsed prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) in patients
           with nonmetastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine prostate-specific antigen-modulating effects of NDGA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NDGA until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

               -  Androgen-independent disease (testosterone &lt; 50 ng/mL)

          -  Received prior definitive therapy for primary prostate cancer comprising any of the
             following:

               -  External-beam radiotherapy with or without hormonal therapy

               -  Brachytherapy with or without pelvic external-beam radiotherapy or hormonal
                  therapy

               -  Radical prostatectomy with or without adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy

               -  Cryotherapy

          -  Must have evidence of disease progression, as evidenced by elevated prostate-specific
             antigen (PSA) that has risen serially from post-definitive therapy nadir on 2
             determinations taken ≥ 1 week apart

               -  Elevated PSA, meeting 1 of the following criteria:

                    -  At least 4 ng/mL post radical prostatectomy

               -  Must show disease progression after discontinuation of the antiandrogen (for
                  patients with androgen-dependent disease receiving antiandrogen as part of
                  primary androgen ablation)

          -  No metastatic disease, confirmed by negative bone scan and negative CT scan or MRI of
             abdomen/pelvis
