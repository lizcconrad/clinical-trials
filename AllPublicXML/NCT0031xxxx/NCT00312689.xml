  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with congenital lacrimal stenosis are treated by probing and intubation of the
      lacrimal drainage system.

      Hypothesis: Microbiological findings at the time of insertion and removal of the silicon
      intubation have an influence on the clinical outcome and success rate of the surgical
      treatment. Microbiological specimens are taken from conjunctiva and nasal mucosa during the
      two procedures under general anaesthesia and from the silicon tube after removal and examined
      for bacterial contamination.

      Children (age 0-14 years) with congenital lacrimal stenosis in whom probing and intubation of
      the lacrimal drainage system is indicated are included the study after informed written
      consent by their parents. Microbiological specimens are taken bilaterally from conjunctiva
      and nasal mucosa during the two procedures under general anaesthesia (insertion and removal
      of the silicon intubation) and from the silicon tube after removal. Specimens are examined
      for bacterial contamination. Microbiological findings are correlated with clinical data about
      the further clinical course and especially the success of the surgical treatment.
