  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate dose-response relationship and to confirm the efficacy of IM olanzapine by sequentially comparing each of IM olanzapine groups and IM placebo group with respect to the changes from baseline to 2 hours post first IM injection of agitation.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if the efficacy of IM olanzapine is greater than IM placebo by evaluating sequentially comparing changes at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min post first IM injection of agitation, as measured by the PANSS-EC in schizophrenia patients.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if the efficacy of IM olanzapine groups are greater than the IM placebo by evaluating sequentially changes from baseline to 2 hours post first IM injection in the rate of responder, CGI-I, and ACES.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine whether a dose-response relationship exists for IM olanzapine in higher agitation, by using mean changes of PANSS-EC total score from baseline to 2 hours post first IM injection as measured by PANSS-EC (Score total no less than 20).</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the efficacy of IM olanzapine(2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg) to IM placebo by evaluating sequentially changes from baseline to 24 hours post first IM injection in the PANSS-EC, CGI-S, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of Illness (CGI-), and ACES.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare efficacy of IM olanzapine(2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg)to IM placebo in the frequency of patients who need second injection and time to second injection.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the safety of IM olanzapine groups to IM placebo group over a 24 hours period in terms of ACES, TEAE, changes in laboratory values, pulse, blood pressure, ECG, DIEPSS.</measure>
