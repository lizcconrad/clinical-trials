  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We seek to develop an advanced imaging approach to identifying and localizing prostate
      cancer. We believe that high field MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has the potential to do
      this and we will endeavor to prove this by having patients with prostate cancer
      pre-operatively undergo a technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After surgery,
      the microscopic locations of cancer will be compared with the pre-operative images to assess
      how well the imaging technique succeeds.

      The proposed research is enormously relevant to the clinical understanding of early prostate
      cancer. We propose to test to see whether characteristic patterns of invivo 3T MRSI
      associated metabolites can be identified in correlation with clinically active tumor reserved
      on histopathologic analysis of resected specimens. We also plan to demonstrate that 3T MR
      spectra of prostate cancer will allow for more detailed metabolic assessment with higher
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and publish results established from MR spectra using
      1.5T MR units. Functional imaging (eg. molecular imaging such as this) is felt to be the
      clinical wave of the future for cancer imaging, and if successful, will assume a very major
      role in the detection, assessment, treatment planning and delivery of drugs, radiation, heat
      and novel therapeutics in the fight against prostate cancer.
