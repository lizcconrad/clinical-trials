  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant phase: To determine the safety of and production of antibodies by a group C
      meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MnCC), when given at 2, 3, and 4 months of age with routine
      vaccines.

      Booster phase: To compare the safety of and production of antibodies by MnCC with and without
      MMR and to compare the antibody response to that produced by a low dose of plain
      polysaccharide vaccine as a way of investigating immune memory
