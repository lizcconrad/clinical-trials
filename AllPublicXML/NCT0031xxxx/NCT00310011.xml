      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with paclitaxel
      and cisplatin works in treating patients with advanced transitional cell cancer of the
      urothelium.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine response to gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and cisplatin (GTP) among
           patients with regional or distant metastases of transitional cell carcinoma of the
           urothelium or local/regional recurrence after cystoprostatectomy.

        -  Determine response in patients who receive GTP as the initial chemotherapeutic treatment
           as well as in patients who have received prior chemotherapy.

        -  Determine response duration, freedom from progression, and overall survival.

        -  Assess the toxicity of GTP.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (yes vs no).

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving a partial response or complete response undergo surgical restaging and
      debulking. Four to 6 weeks later, patients receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study.
