  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-1 infected patients receiving long-term therapy with lamivudine or emtricitabine
      (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs]) are at risk for the development of a
      mutation at position M184 on the HIV reverse transcriptase gene. This mutation confers
      resistance to both drugs (&gt; 100 fold increase in IC50).

      In-vitro studies with elvucitabine have shown that HIV-1 isolates with the M184V mutation
      show only a 10-fold increase in IC50 as compared to wild type HIV-1. Achillion
      Pharmaceutical's intention is to demonstrate that 10 mg of elvucitabine, administered once
      per day for 14 days with continued background anti-HIV-1 medications, will demonstrate a fall
      in HIV-1 RNA plasma levels, as compared to baseline. The data from this study will guide
      dosing in future long-term studies in HIV-1 infected patients with the M184V mutation.

      Protocol Title: A 14-Day, Randomized, Double-Blind, Comparative Viral Kinetic Study of
      Elvucitabine Versus Lamivudine Administered Once Daily to HIV-1 Infected Subjects With a
      Documented M184V Variant Protocol Number: ACH443-014A Clinical Phase: 2a Primary Objectives:
      • To assess the viral kinetics of 10 mg of elvucitabine administered once daily (QD) for 14
      days in combination with background antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected subjects with a
      documented M184V variant

        -  To demonstrate the antiviral activity of 10 mg of elvucitabine administered QD for 14
           days in combination with background antiretroviral therapy as compared with lamivudine
           in combination with background antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected subjects with a
           documented M184V variant

        -  To assess the safety of elvucitabine therapy in HIV-1 infected subjects with a
           documented M184V variant Number of Subjects: 20 Number of Study Centers: Multi-center
           study Study Population: HIV-1 infected subjects who are presently failing an
           antiretroviral therapy regimen containing lamivudine or emtricitabine, genotypically
           demonstrate a MI84V variant, and have an HIV RNA plasma level ≥ 2,000 and ≤ 150,000
           copies/mL. Study Design: HIV-1 infected subjects, with a documented M184V variant, will
           be randomized to receive elvucitabine 10 mg QD or lamivudine 300 mg QD for 14 days.
           Subjects must be receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen (defined as no change in
           antiretroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization) that includes
           lamivudine or emtricitabine. At 72 hours prior to randomization, only lamivudine or
           emtricitabine will be stopped for washout; subjects will continue to receive the other
           drugs in their prescribed regimen (background antiretroviral therapy) during the 72-hour
           washout period. Subjects will then be randomized to receive blinded elvucitabine or
           lamivudine in a 1:1 ratio and continue to receive their prescribed background
           antiretroviral therapy for 14 days on an outpatient basis. Subjects will be followed for
           an additional 14 days post-treatment for safety, unless they enroll into the ACH443-018
           extension study where they will continue to be treated and followed for safety.
