  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stanford Medical Center Program in Multi-Organ Transplantation and the Division of Bone
      Marrow Transplantation are enrolling patients into a research study to determine if blood
      stem cells injected after kidney transplantation, in combination with lymphoid irradiation
      ,will change the immune system such that immunosuppressive drugs can be completely withdrawn.
      Patients must have a healthy, completely human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched brother or
      sister as the organ and stem cell donor.

      One to two months before kidney transplant surgery, blood stem cells will be removed from the
      donor and the cells will be frozen. After transplant surgery, the recipient will receive
      radiation and anti-T cell antibody treatments for two weeks to prepare for injection of the
      stem cells. The stem cells will be injected at the end of the two-week treatment. If the stem
      cells persist in the recipient, immunosuppressive drugs will be gradually reduced until they
      are withdrawn completely at least six months after transplantation. Patients will be followed
      in the Stanford clinics for transplant patients. Patients who live outside of the San
      Francisco Bay Area must remain near Stanford for six weeks after transplant surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients that can be withdrawn
      completely from immunosuppressive drugs while maintaining normal function of HLA-matched
      living related donor kidney transplants. Fifteen participants will be conditioned with total
      lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and given an infusion of
      donor &quot;mobilized&quot; blood mononuclear cells prior to transplantation.

      This is a single-center, open-label study in adult renal transplant patients. Fifteen
      patients will receive TLI, ATG, and an infusion of CD34+ selected G-CSF mobilized blood cells
      combined with a fixed number (1x10^6) of CD3+ T cells from the same mobilized blood cell
      source. Patients will receive a one-month course of mycophenolate mofetil and a six to 12
      month tapering course of cyclosporine that will be discontinued at six months. At serial
      timepoints (1) graft function will be monitored, (2) chimerism will be measured in recipient
      white blood cell subsets, (3) mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) assays of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells against donor and third party cells will be performed, and (4) protocol
      biopsies of the graft will be obtained. An attempt will be made to discontinue cyclosporine
      at six months if (1) chimerism is detectable for at least 180 days after CD34+ and CD3+ cell
      infusion, (2) there is stable graft function without clinical rejection episodes, and (3)
      there is lack of histologic rejection on protocol biopsies. In the proposed study, patients
      will be given a target dose of 8-10x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg and 1x10^6 CD3+ cells/kg because
      sustained chimerism may be necessary for sustained tolerance to the graft.

    <description>Intervention: Participants will receive hematopoietic cell transplantation and Total lymphoid irradiation. The intervention is intended to induce immune tolerance in HLA-matched living donor kidney transplantation, to allow withdrawal of the immunosuppressive drugs. Immune tolerance is achieved through the development of donor/recipient mixed chimerism following combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from the living donor.</description>
