  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of SC efalizumab in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with chronic
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving the hands and/or feet who have had no previous
      exposure to efalizumab. The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and
      an observation period.

             sites

          -  Have a PGA rating of moderate (3) or severe (4) for hand and/or foot psoriasis

          -  Be a candidate for systemic therapy in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Be naive to efalizumab treatment

          -  Weigh no more than 125 kg

          -  For women of childbearing potential, use a method of contraception acceptable to the
             investigator to prevent pregnancy and agree to continue to practice an acceptable
             method of contraception for the duration of their participation in the study and for 6
             weeks after the last dose of efalizumab

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of or an ongoing uncontrolled serious bacterial, viral, fungal, or
             atypical mycobacterial infection. This includes diagnoses that required more than 2
             weeks of therapy, such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis, that have been treated in
             the past 6 months. In addition, if the patient is currently receiving antibiotics,
             antivirals, or antifungals for an infection or for suppression or prophylaxis for any
             diagnosis, the patient will be excluded.

          -  Have any history of opportunistic infections (e.g., systemic fungal infections,
             parasites)

          -  Are seropositive for hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients will undergo testing during screening, and any
             patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or HIV
             will be excluded.

          -  Have a history of active tuberculosis or are currently undergoing treatment for
             tuberculosis. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test or chest x-ray will be
             performed at the screening visit. Patients with a positive PPD test (not due to BCG
             vaccination) or chest x-ray will be excluded.

          -  Have the presence or history of malignancy within the past 5 years, including
             lymphoproliferative disorders. Patients with a history of fully resolved basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer may be enrolled.

          -  Have a history of clinically significant anemia

          -  Have a WBC count &lt;4,000 cells/uL or &gt;14,000 cells/uL

          -  Have a platelet count &lt;150,000 cells/uL

          -  Have hepatic enzyme levels ≥3 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Have a serum creatinine level ≥2 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Have been exposed to any experimental drugs or treatments within 30 days or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the screening visit

          -  Have had any previous exposure to efalizumab

          -  Have been vaccinated with a live virus or live bacteria within the 14 days prior to
             the first dose of efalizumab

          -  Have any medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would jeopardize
             the patient's safety following exposure to study drug (efalizumab or placebo
             equivalent) or would significantly interfere with the patient's ability to comply with
             the provisions of this protocol
