      status in people with Parkinson's disease

      This pilot study is a randomized controlled study of 20-30 individuals with Parkinson's
      disease will have a control group with no training and a research group with yoga training.
      The control group will have the opportunity to attend yoga training of the same intensity
      after the study is completed. The effects of yoga will not be on the control group. Data on
      physical function will be derived from assessments including strength, balance, flexibility,
      ROM. gait, posture and functional analysis performed in the Georgia Holland Cardiopulmonary
      and Neuromuscular Research Lab. Questionnaires related to quality of life, depression and
      falls will determine psychological impact or yoga training. Vital signs, pulmonary function
      tests and blood draws will be done in the General Clinical research Center (GCRC) and protein
      analysis will be done in the diabetes research lab.
