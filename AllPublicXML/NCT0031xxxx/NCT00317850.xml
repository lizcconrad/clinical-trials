      The specific aim of the Gabapentin for the Relief of Idiopathic Subjective Tinnitus Trial is
      to assess the therapeutic benefit of Gabapentin (NeurontinÂ®) for subjective idiopathic
      troublesome tinnitus. We employed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial
      design to assess the efficacy of Gabapentin. Adults, between the ages of 18 and 70 with
      idiopathic, subjective, troublesome, unilateral or bilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus of 6
      month's duration or greater and score of 38 or greater on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory
      were enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, between the ages of 18 and 70

          -  Idiopathic, subjective, troublesome, unilateral or bilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus
             (ICD-9 --388.31) of 6 month's duration or greater

          -  Tinnitus handicap score of 38 or greater on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The symptoms of tinnitus can be affected by the concomitant use of tricyclic
             antidepressants, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate sodium, or benzodiazepines.
             Patients who have used these drugs within 30 days of screening will not be enrolled.

          -  Impaired renal function as determined from serum creatinine levels, using the
             following formulas35: adult male Ccr = (140 -age) X weight in kilograms/(72 X serum
             creatinine in milligrams per deciliter); and adult female Ccr = [(140 - age) X weight
             in kilograms/(72 X serum creatinine in milligrams per deciliter)] X 0.85,whereCcr
             indicates creatinine clearance.

          -  Patients with tinnitus related to cochlear implantation, retrocochlear lesion, or
             other known anatomic/structural lesions of the ear and temporal bone

          -  Patients with any serious or unstable medical or psychiatric condition.

          -  Patients whose ability to give informed consent is in question.
