  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study. 253 children were recruited
      and randomly assigned into one of 2 groups to receive either normal infant formula or formula
      with Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The primary aim is to assess the
      effect of early administration (from birth) of probiotics on the incidence of allergic
      sensitization, eczema, asthma and rhinitis.

      One of the most important early influences on the immune system is the intestinal microflora.
      The gastrointestinal tract, being the largest body area interacting with the environment, is
      one of the earliest to be colonized and is quantitatively the most important source of
      microbial stimulation for the immature immune system. Probiotics are helpful bacteria from
      healthy intestinal tract, and have shown potential in reducing allergy. This is extremely
      important as allergic diseases are on the rise worldwide. Probiotics are safe, easy to
      administer and can be used early for intervention as allergic sensitization, once
      established, is difficult to reverse.

      This double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study has recruited 253 children from birth.
      These babies, with a family history of atopic disease, will be randomly assigned into one of
      2 groups to receive either normal infant formula or formula with Bifidobacterium longum and
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The formula will be consumed postnatally for 6 months, after
      which the child will continue with normal follow-on milk. Children will be examined at the
      neonatal period and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Blood samples will be collected at birth
      (cord blood) and at 1 year of age. Blood will be analyzed for cytokines, total IgE and
      specific IgE. Skin prick test for common allergens will also be performed at 1 year of age.
      Stools will be collected at 5 days, 1, 3, 12 months and analyzed for the pattern of stool
      colonization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents agree to the subject's participation in the study and informed consent has
             been obtained.

          -  Either parent or sibling (i.e. first degree relative) has a history of atopy. This
             will be evidenced by a doctor-diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema and a
             positive skin prick test to any of a panel of common allergens.

          -  The subject is born at above 35 weeks of gestation and weighs above 2 kg.

          -  The subject does not have major congenital malformations/major illness.

          -  Family appears to be able to successfully complete this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mother has a medical illness, which in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere
             with the results of the study.

          -  The parent is unable/unwilling to comply with procedures.

          -  The parents choose to totally breast-feed the child.
