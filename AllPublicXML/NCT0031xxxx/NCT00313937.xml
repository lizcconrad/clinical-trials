  <official_title>Single Centre, Open, Controlled, Randomised (1:1), Parallel Group: Insulin Glargine vs. NPH: FPG (Fasting Plasma Glucose) in Patients With DM Type 1 Who Skip the Morning Meal During Treatment With MDI (Multiple Daily Injection) Basal/Bolus Insulin</official_title>

      Primary objective:

      To compare metabolic control as measured by Blood Glucose (BG) upon arising from bed (7:00 am
      - 12:00 pm) in type 1 Diabetes mellitus patients who skip the morning meal during treatment
      with MDI basal/bolus insulin: Difference of change of blood glucose between 7:00 am and 11:00
      am between patients on Insulin glargine and NPH insulin.

      Secondary objective:

      To perform an evaluation between the two patient groups for BG (10:00 pm and 12:00 pm) as
      well as for serum insulin, free fatty acid levels and Î²-hydroxybutyrate (7:00 am - 12:00 pm).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with type 1 Diabetes mellitus who have been treated with MDI (Multiple Daily
        Injection) basal/bolus insulin, regular insulin/short acting insulin analogue + NPH insulin
        on a stable dose (no change more than 10 %) for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry, who
        have an HBA1c smaller/equal 9 % (measured at visit 1) and a BMI smaller/equal 35 kg/m2. In
        addition, patients must have a FBG value at day 1 before skipping meal (6:00 am - 07:00 am)
        between 90 - 120 mg/dl (5.0 - 6.5 mmol/l).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast-feeding

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the study medication or to drugs with similar chemical
             structures

          -  Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by
             the study protocol

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug in the last 30 days before study entry

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, or other major
             systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study
             results difficult

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

        No subjects who have previously been treated with Insulin glargine will be enrolled in this
        study.
