  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation, is the preferred treatment option of end stage renal disease.
      Compared to dialysis, patients who receive kidneys have a 70% reduction in death, a
      dramatically improved quality of life and cost the health care system considerably less. As a
      result, there are over 3000 Canadians on the waiting list for a kidney. In order to meet the
      shortage of cadaveric kidneys, the rates of living kidney donation have nearly doubled over
      the last 10 years. Yet despite its advantages for the recipient, living kidney donation
      remains a complex ethical, moral, and medical issue. The premise for accepting living donors
      is that the &quot;minimal&quot; risk of short and long-term medical harm realized by the donor is
      outweighed by the definite advantages to the recipient and potential psychosocial benefits of
      the altruistic gift to the donor. The only benefit for the living donor is psychological -
      donors experience increased self-esteem, feelings of well-being, and improved health related
      quality of life with their altruistic act of assuming medical risk to help another. The
      short-term consequences of living donation are well established. On the other hand the
      long-term consequences of living kidney donation are far less certain. The main medical
      concerns of living kidney donation include an increased risk of hypertension, proteinuria,
      and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR- a measure of the filtering capacity of the kidney).
      Estimates of these outcomes are variable, inconsistent, and uncertain in the literature. This
      study is designed to quantify the long-term medical and psychosocial implications of living
      kidney donation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than 18 years old

          -  Living kidney transplant occurred between 1970 and 2006

          -  no history of hypertension, kidney disease or proteinuria prior to donation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  a medical condition (such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or active
             cancer) which makes one ineligible to be a donor. Blood group and immunological
             incompatibility (such as positive cross-match, poor HLA matches) are not reasons for
             exclusion.

          -  The eligible non-donor subsequently went on to donate a kidney

          -  Either the donor or the eligible non-donor are unable to give informed consent

          -  The living donor or eligible non-donor is currently pregnant
