    <textblock>
      A phase I trial in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia of a human monoclonal
      antibody that kills B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Trial will study safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and anti tumor activity of the antibody given as a single agent and with
      vincristine.
