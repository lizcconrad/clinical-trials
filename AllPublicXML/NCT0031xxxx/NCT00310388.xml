    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 trial is an open-label extension study of the placebo-controlled, double-blind
      VRX-RET-E22-302 trial. Patients who have completed the VRX-RET-E22-302 trial and who meet
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with 600-1200 mg/day of retigabine as an
      adjunct therapy to their current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve stimulation.
      Treatment will be continued until the subject withdraws from the study or until the program
      is discontinued. Patients will be recruited from 55-60 sites in Europe, Israel, Australia,
      and South Africa. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of long-term therapy with retigabine administered as adjunctive therapy in adult
      epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures, who completed the double-blind Study
      VRX-RET-E22-302. Secondary objectives are: to evaluate efficacy of long-term treatment with
      retigabine and patient quality of life and to evaluate whether retinal pigmentation,
      unexplained vision loss, pigmentation of non-retinal ocular tissue, and discoloration of
      nails, lips, skin or mucosa change over time after discontinuation of retigabine.

      Treatment will be continued until retigabine is commercially available, or until the program
      is discontinued. Patients will be recruited from 55-60 sites in Europe, Israel, Australia,
      and South Africa. The safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with retigabine
      administered as adjunctive therapy in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures
      will be evaluated. In addition, the efficacy of long-term treatment with retigabine and
      patient quality of life will be assessed.

    <description>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-Form 31 (QOLIE-31-P) is an adaptation of the original QOLIE-31 instrument that includes 30 items grouped into 7 multi-item subscales: Seizure Worry (5 items), Overall Quality of Life (2 items), Emotional Well-being (5 items), Energy/Fatigue (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (6 items), Medication Effects (3 items) and Daily Activities/Social Functioning (5 items), and a Health Status item. In addition to the 31 items, the QOLIE-31-P contains 7 items asking the participants to rate the degree of 'distress' related to the topic of each subscale. The subscale scores, the total score and the Health Status item score were calculated according to the scoring algorithm defined by the author with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better function. The change from Baseline was obtained by subtracting the Baseline value from the post randomization value. Baseline was Month 0 value.</description>

    <description>Monthly total seizure rates observed during the open-label extension period was compared to the monthly total seizure rates observed during the Baseline phase of the double-blind study VRX-RET-E22-302. Percent change from baseline was calculated as post randomization value divided by the baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline was Month 0 value of VRX-RET-E22-302 study.</description>
