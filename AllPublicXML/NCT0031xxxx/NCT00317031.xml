      The primary objective is to directly compare the efficacy of acamprosate, naltrexone and
      placebo for relapse prevention in alcoholics. The secondary objective is to establish an
      association between patients' motivational type and drug effects. The aim is to improve
      alcoholism treatment by identifying characteristics for response to specific pharmacological
      relapse prevention. Such items could allow for an individually adapted pharmacotherapy of
      alcoholism. Specifically, we will study the possible dependence of the efficacy of naltrexone
      and/or acamprosate on different motivational types (reward versus relief craving) and genetic
      profiles referring to glutamatergic and opioidergic candidate genes. Lastly, the longterm
      costs and cost-effectiveness of the different treatment strategies for alcoholics chosen in
      our study are established.

             initiation of abstinence, and must have had two or more days of heavy drinking
             (defined as 4 drinks for females and 5 drinks for males) in the 90-day period prior to

          3. Participants must have had a minimum of 72 hours of abstinence and no significant
             withdrawal symptoms (CIWA &lt; 8) prior to randomization.

          4. At least 2 weeks of inpatient treatment.

          5. Participants can be abstinent for a maximum of 28 days prior to randomization.
