      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a worldwide disease, endemic in 88 countries, that has shown an
      increasing incidence over the last two decades. So far, pentavalent antimony compounds have
      been considered the treatment of choice, with a percentage of cure of about 85%. However, the
      high efficacy of these drugs is counteracted by their many disadvantages and adverse events.
      Previous studies have shown nitric oxide to be a potential alternative treatment when
      administered topically with no serious adverse events. However, due to the unstable nitric
      oxide release, the topical donors needed to be applied frequently, making the adherence to
      the treatment difficult. The electrospinning technique has allowed the production of a
      multilayer transdermal patch that produces a continuous and stable nitric oxide release. The
      main objective of this study is to evaluate this novel nitric oxide topical donor for the
      treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

      A double-blind, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial, including 620
      patients from endemic areas for leishmaniasis in Colombia was designed to investigate whether
      this patch is as effective as meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis but with less adverse events. Subjects with ulcers characteristic of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis will be medically evaluated and laboratory tests and parasitological
      confirmation performed. After checking the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. During 20 days Group 1 will receive simultaneously
      meglumine antimoniate and placebo of nitric oxide patches while Group 2 will receive placebo
      of meglumine antimoniate and active nitric oxide patches. During the treatment visits, the
      medications will be administered daily and the presence of adverse events assessed. During
      the follow-up, the research group will visit the patients at days 21, 45, 90 and 180. The
      healing process of the ulcer, the health of the participants, recidivisms and/or reinfection
      will also be assessed. The evolution of the ulcers will be photographically registered. In
      the case that the effectiveness of the patches is demonstrated, a novel and safe therapeutic
      alternative for one of the most important public health problems in many countries will be
      available to patients.

      BACKGROUND

      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a worldwide disease that is endemic in 88 countries [1] . It
      is estimated that 1.5 million people suffer from CL annually and that more than 350 million
      are at risk of contracting the infection [2-4]. In America, 60,000 new cases of CL are
      reported annually [5], being endemic in 20 of its 22 countries and in 2 islands of the
      Caribbean [2]. Currently, CL has affected more than 500 U.S. Army soldiers serving in Iraq
      [6]. In the Andean region, the incidence of Leishmaniasis has been increasing dramatically
      over the last two decades; reaching more than 14,000 cases per year from 1996-98 [7]. In
      Colombia 6,500 cases have been reported [8]. The increase in the reported cases of CL in
      Colombia has been related to factors such as migration, deforestation, the multiplication of
      illicit plantations, the armed political conflict and the behavioral changes of the vector.
      The main strains of Leishmania in Colombia are L. panamensis, L. brazilensis, L. infantum and
      L. guyanensis, which are distributed throughout the entire national territory, predominantly
      in the rural areas [10]. CL is caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus
      Leishmania [1] and is transmitted to humans through the bite of a small percentage of the
      species of phlebotomus and lutzomyia sandflies classified to date [10]. In the digestive
      system of the sandflies, this dimorphic parasite presents an extracellular flagellated form
      called a promastigote, which upon its release in the host blood, is phagocytized by the
      macrophage, losing its flagella and turning into an amastigote [12]. Dogs, rodents and
      didelphidae are the natural hosts of the parasite while man is an incidental host [11]. This
      zoonosis has suffered an interesting urbanization phenomenon, changing from an eminent rural
      entity affecting mainly men of an active age, to a disease that is affecting all people,
      especially children [8,9]. The characteristic lesions of this disease are ulcers that heal
      spontaneously over a period of three months to a year, depending on the isolate, and that
      leave a flat, atrophic and depigmented scar [13-15]. The CL, especially the one produced by
      L. brazilensis can evolve into mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL), which has a worse prognosis
      owing to the deforming character of its lesions [16]. The spontaneous cure of these lesions
      allows for the acquisition of partial resistance to reinfection, which could explain the
      higher pathogenicity observed in the children and young adult population [9]. Previous
      studies have shown a higher incidence of CL and a poor response to treatment in the children
      population [17]. The program of epidemiological vigilance in Colombia requires that the
      probable cases of CL (identified by ulcer features and by the patient's origin) be confirmed
      by microscopic direct examination of a secession sample obtained from the ulcer, if these are
      negative, by biopsy of the wound. Once confirmed, the cases must be notified to the Local
      Health Secretary using clinical-epidemiological records. This institution, in charge of the
      epidemiological vigilance, studies the sources of transmission and distributes the medication
      to the people affected. Currently, various aspects are considered when treating CL, among
      which, the risk of developing MCL, the grade, localization, number, size, evolution and
      persistence of the lesions, are the most important [18]. For more than 60 years, the
      pentavalent antimony compounds: sodium stibogluconate, (Pentostan®, produced by
      Glaxo-Wellcome) and meglumine antimoniate, (Glucantime®, produced by Sanofi-Aventis) have
      been considered the treatments of choice for this disease [19]. Studies made in Colombia
      reported a percentage of cure of 85%, using meglumine antimoniate [20,21]. Despite the fact
      that the efficacy of these drugs is high, they present many disadvantages such as parenteral
      administration, and, reversible secondary effects such as nausea, vomiting, muscular and
      abdominal pain, cardiac problems, a rise in the concentration of hepatic aminotransferases,
      and chemical pancreatitis [21,22]. Additionally, the adherence to the treatment is affected
      by its duration (several weeks) and its availability by the restriction in its distribution.
      Therapeutic alternatives of second line have been proposed; amphotericin B and pentamidine
      have been used with excellent results, nevertheless their high cost, little availability, the
      necessity to hospitalize the patients for their administration and the severity of their
      secondary effects have limited their use [23,24]. In the last decade new treatments for CL
      have been developed, using oral agents such as mefloquine, itraconazole, miltefosine,
      paromomycin, ketoconazole, allopurinol and dapsone, however, they have not shown enough
      evidence of their effectiveness [19,21,25,26]. In an effort to develop a topical treatment
      for CL, paromomycin has been used in different preparations. However, rates of curation
      achieved with this medication have not been higher than conventional treatments, even when
      compared with placebo [27,28]. In several studies, in vitro and in vivo, it has been
      demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) is effective to eliminate various strains of Leishmania
      in its amastigote form [29-35]. The production of NO from the oxidation of L-arginine caused
      by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) constitutes one of the most important defense
      mechanisms of the macrophages [36], in which two oxidative forms of defense against
      Leishmania have been identified. During the first phase of infection, in response to the
      phagocytosis process, some promastigotes are eliminated due to the release of the superoxide
      ion, a process which is catalyzed by the NADPH oxidase [29]. Those promastigotes that survive
      this defense mechanism evolve into amastigotes, activating the production of IL-12 in the
      macrophages and promoting the presentation of the antigens of Leishmania [29] to the T
      helpers 1 lymphocytes that enhance the cytotoxic activities of the macrophages toward the
      intracellular parasites via the interferon gamma (INFγ) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFα) by promoting the production of NO catalyzed by iNOS [31-33]. A recent study shows a
      higher activity of iNOS in the macrophages of subjects infected with CL, suggesting a vital
      role of NO in the immunological activity against Leishmania [34]. In Studies with rodents
      resistant to Leishmania infection (C57BL/6), where L. major, L. chagasi or L. donovani were
      inoculated, the application of iNOS inhibitors like NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) caused
      a higher rate of survival and virulence of the parasites in macrophages [33,35,37,38]. After
      inoculating L. major in mice with the genetic susceptibility to develop infections with
      Leishmania (BALB/C), no activity of iNOS was observed. However, the application of IL-12, was
      able to control the infection by activating iNOS [31]. In humans, several clinical trials
      have been realized with topical treatments containing NO donors [39,40]. In Ecuador, our
      group developed and tested a NO generating topical cream with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine
      (SNAP), evidencing a beneficial effect in the management of this type of ulcers with no
      reports of any serious adverse event. Nevertheless, due to the unstable nitric oxide release,
      the cream had to be applied frequently (4 times a day) making the adherence to the treatment
      difficult [39]. In Syria, another group used potassium nitrate acidified with salicylic acid
      and ascorbic acid for the topical treatment of L. tropica [40]. In vitro, this NO generating
      mixture destroyed the amastigotes and promastigotes of Leishmania; however, in vivo, the
      study of 40 patients presented inconsistent results, reducing the size of the ulcer in 28% of
      the subjects and healing only 12%. The discrepancy in these results is believed to be due to
      the technique used to obtain the NO. The acidification of nitrite produces an instant blast
      of NO, but its release is not maintained over a long period of time [40]. The difficulty of
      controlling the liberation of NO has created the necessity of looking for new techniques to
      regulate its release. The nanofiber polymers produced by the electrospinning technique have
      been studied in order to guarantee the constant release of pharmaceuticals on the lesion. In
      the electrospinning process, a high voltage is used to create an electrically charged jet of
      polymer solution, which dries and solidifies to leave behind a dry polymer fiber [41]. As
      this jet travels through the air, the solvent evaporates leaving behind a charged fiber that
      can be electrically deflected and collected on a metal screen [42,43]. Fibers with a variety
      of cross sectional shapes and sizes are produced from different polymers. With this
      technique, the encapsulation or entrapment of several pharmaceuticals, enzymes and proteins
      has been successful. In a previous study, nanofiber patches were successfully used as
      releasing vehicles of tetracycline hydrochloride. The release of tetracycline was constant
      for a period of 5 days [41;43]. Using the same model, a multilayer transdermal patch has been
      produced, in which nitrite is bound to an ion exchange resin (DOWEX) and electrospun into a
      polyurethane nanofibers layer. A solution containing Waterlock® superabsorbent and
      polyurethane is electrospun on top of the nitrite-DOWEX layer. The ascorbic acid entrapped in
      the polyurethane solution is electrospun onto a third layer, with another layer of Waterlock®
      superabsorbent and polyurethane as the fourth and final one. Upon hydration, this Nitric
      Oxide Releasing Patch (NOP) produces a stable release of 3.5 µmol of NO during 12 hrs
      [41,44,45]. In a pilot study, developed in Landazuri, Santander, Colombia, a
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 35 patients who presented 68 ulcers
      produced by L. panamensis. Using the NOP, a 65% improvement was observed in the treated
      ulcers, with only a 25% improvement in the placebo group (p=0.001). In this pilot study the
      unique adverse event described was pruritus in the area where the patch was applied
      (unpublished data). Taking into account the wide distribution of CL, the changes in its form
      of transmission and the difficulty related with the availability of medication, this study
      proposes to investigate whether the NO donor transdermal patch, produced by electrospinning
      is, at least, as effective as the meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of CL, with less
      adverse events and a lower cost, constituting therefore an effective therapeutic alternative.
      In case that the effectiveness of the NOP is demonstrated in this study, a novel and safe
      therapeutic alternative of easy access and higher adherence for one of the most important
      public health problems in our country will be made available.

      OBJECTIVES

      General Objective

      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NOP in the treatment of CL compared with
      meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®).

      Specific objectives

        1. To evaluate the healing rate of CL ulcers using a NOP compared with the plan of
           treatment with meglumine antimoniate recommended by the health ministry.

        2. To identify adverse events associated with the application of NOP and compare them with
           the ones produced by the treatment with meglumine antimoniate.

        3. To identify and compare the recidivisms that may occur with both NOP and meglumine
           antimoniate.

        4. To advance in the search of a therapeutic alternative for CL in Colombia.

      DESIGN

      Double blind, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial, comparing nitric
      oxide releasing patches with meglumine antimoniate.

      SAMPLE SIZE

      The sample was calculated according to the arccosine formula using a power of 80% and a type
      1 error of 0.05%. Assigning a successful rate of 85% for meglumine antimoniate and 75% for
      NOP, 558 patients will be needed. After adjustment for a loss rate of 5%, the total of
      patients that must be recruited is 620 (310 patients per treatment group).

      POPULATION

      The population will be composed from two regions of Colombia. The first one is an endemic
      zone in Santander, Colombia, located between the Magdalena Valley and the East Mountain
      Range, which includes the municipalities of Landazuri, El Carmen, San Vicente, El Playon and
      Rionegro. The second region is an endemic zone in North Tolima, which includes the
      municipalities of Chaparral, San Antonio, Libano, Falan, Palocabildo and Mariquita.

      SELECTION OF THE PATIENTS

      Inclusion Criteria

        1. Men and women between 18 and 50 years old

        2. Cutaneous ulcers of more than two weeks of evolution

        3. Positive parasitological diagnosis for CL

        4. Patients that voluntarily agree to participate in the study and sign the informed
           consent.

        5. Disposition to attend all the visits punctually (initial, treatment and follow-up)

        6. Acceptation of not using any other treatment for CL while in the study

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Pregnant women

        2. Presence of any condition or disease that compromises the patient immunologically (i.e.
           diabetes, cancer, etc.) or, any other, that, based on the judgment of the researcher,
           could alter the course of CL.

        3. Diffuse CL or more than five active lesions.

        4. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (no lesion must be located less than 2 cm from the nasal,
           uro-genital, and/or anal mucous membranes or from the edge of the lips).

        5. Visceral leishmaniasis

        6. Complete or incomplete treatment with antimony compounds in the last three months.

        7. Patients with history of hepatic, renal or cardiovascular disease.

        8. Mentally or neurologically disabled patients that are considered not fit to approve
           their participation in the study.

      STUDY DEVELOPMENT

      Logistic Phase

      This phase will last 4 months and will include the following activities:

        1. Training of the personnel that will participate in the study.

        2. Acquisition of the materials required for the development of the project.

        3. Elaboration of flyers, promotional and educative material, procedures manual and case
           report forms (CRFs).

        4. Treatment randomization. The treatment randomization will be realized by the
           epidemiologist of the Cardiovascular Foundation of Colombia. This randomization will be
           done in blocks in order to keep the size of the treatment groups similar, to avoid long
           sequences of the same treatment and to balance when possible some of the bias inherent
           to the simple randomization process. Additionally, this randomization in blocks will
           facilitate the execution of interim analyses.

      Recruitment Phase

      This phase will take 22 months. In the selected municipalities, the health personnel that
      work in hospitals and health centers will receive training regarding the disease and the
      study methodology. Simultaneously an epidemiological focus study will be done with the
      leaders of the community and the health personnel to identify the geographic and demographic
      conditions with the purpose of developing strategies for the recruitment of possible cases of
      leishmaniasis. Subsequently, the subjects that present active ulcers with more than 2 weeks
      of evolution, with or without parasitological confirmation of CL, will be invited by the
      health promoters to attend the screening visit (Table 1).

      Screening Visit

      During this visit a complete clinical history will be elaborated and data about antecedents
      of leishmaniasis obtained (administered treatment, localization, number of lesions, etc). A
      full medical evaluation will be realized based on universally accepted techniques. The
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied and the selected candidates informed about the
      study after which they will sign an informed consent. For those subjects with ulcers of more
      than two weeks of evolution without parasitological diagnosis a direct test will be performed
      by the parasitologist. If the first direct test is negative, it will be repeated up to three
      times; after which, in case of negative results, a biopsy will be performed. In case
      leishmaniasis is not confirmed the patient will be remitted to the original health center.

      Initial Visit

      The included patients will be randomly assigned in one of two groups. A culture in
      Novy-Nicole-McNeal (NNN) medium will be taken for strain identification and a blood sample
      withdrawn from the antecubital vein for hepatic enzymes, creatinine, and pancreatic amylase
      determination. During this visit, a complete medical evaluation will be performed, the ulcer
      will be measured and a picture will be taken. Before taking the picture, a graduated rule
      will be placed next to the ulcer along with a sticker marked with the identification code of
      the participant, and the date of the visit. The first NOP (active or placebo) will be applied
      covering the lesion and the first shot of meglumine antimoniate (active or placebo)
      administered. The patients will receive information on how not to damage the patches and how
      to identify and report adverse events. To help the patients to do so, they will receive a
      diary to register them. The two groups randomly composed will be divided as follows:

      Group 1: During 20 days this group will receive simultaneously intramuscular (IM) meglumine
      antimoniate (Glucantime® 20 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 3 ampules per day); and a NOP
      placebo.

      Group 2: During 20 days this group will receive simultaneously placebo of IM meglumine
      antimoniate (5-15cc/day) and an active NOP.

      Treatment Visits

      The patients will visit the health center daily during 20 days to receive both the NOP
      (placebo or active) and meglumine antimoniate (placebo or active). Daily, the subjects and
      their adherence to the treatment will be assessed and the data collected. If any adverse
      event is detected, the patient will be referred immediately to the medical staff who will
      make an evaluation and report it to the adverse event committee that will take the final
      decision in each case.

      Follow-up visits

      This phase will last 10 months. During the follow-up, the patients will be seen by the
      research group in 4 opportunities. The first visit will take place the day after the end of
      the treatment (day 21) in which new blood samples will be taken for biochemical
      determinations. The second, third and fourth visits will be realized on day 45, 90 and 180
      respectively. During these visits the healing process of the ulcer, the presence of
      recidivisms and/or reinfection and the health of the participants will be assessed. The
      evolution of the ulcers will be photographically registered.

      The maximum and minimum diameters of the ulcer will be measured using a graduated ruler, and
      the induration using the ballpoint pen technique. The ulcer and induration areas will be
      calculated separately, and then registered in the CRF. The evaluation of the clinical
      response will be based on the ulcer showing the least improvement.

        1. Complete clinical response: Complete reepithelization of the ulcer and disappearance of
           the induration.

        2. Clinical Improvement: Reduction of more than 50% of the ulcer and the induration areas
           in relation to the last clinical evaluation.

        3. Absence of clinical response: Increase or reduction of less than 50% of the ulcer and
           the induration areas in relation to the last clinical evaluation.

        4. Therapeutic failure:

             1. Increase in the size of the ulcer by more than 50% in relation to the last clinical
                evaluation

             2. Presence of the ulcer three months after the beginning of the treatment.

             3. Reactivation: Appearance of a lesion on the edge or in the center of the scar, with
                positive parasitological diagnosis, after a period of complete reepithelization.

             4. Affection of the mucous membranes: Presence of affections of the mucous membranes
                during the treatment, at the end of it or in the follow-up visits.

        5. Reinfection: Activation of an ulcer in an area different from the original lesion.

      For subjects whose treatment will have been considered a failure the code will be broken and
      they will be remitted to their original health center to look for another therapeutic
      approach.

      Procedures

      Physical Examination

      A complete physical examination will be realized and vital signs will be measured.

      Blood Samples Withdrawn

      Blood samples will be withdrawn from the antecubital vein to perform the following
      biochemical analyses:

        1. Creatinine by spectrophotometry

        2. Alanine transaminase (ALT) by spectrophotometry

        3. Aspartate transaminase (AST) by spectrophotometry

        4. Pancreatic amylase by spectrophotometry

      Sampling Technique for the Direct Test of CL

      A direct test is performed to confirm the presence of cells with amastigotes in a dermis
      scrape[46,47]; the sample must be, in so far as it is possible, free of blood, cellular
      detritus or pus. If the patients present several lesions, the sample must be taken from the
      one with the shortest time of evolution, the biggest induration area and/or the least
      purulent discharge. If the lesion has a scab it must be removed to improve the quality of the
      sample. The sample can be taken from the active edge or from the bottom of the ulcer. When
      the sample is taken from the active edge asepsis must be realized with alcohol at 70% and
      hemostasis then performed using the first and second fingers to make sure that there is no
      blood in the sample. A small incision of about 3mm in length and depth is made with a scalpel
      in the active edge parallel to the edge of the ulcer. With the sharp side of the scalpel, a
      scrape is done in the dermic wall of the incision to obtain tissue. The extracted material is
      extended on two microscope slides. The sample is dried at room temperature, and then fixed
      with methanol and stained with Giemsa, Wright or Field. Using immersion oil the sample is
      observed under a microscope with a 100X lens, the presence of amastigotes of Leishmania
      assessed and their structure verified (nucleus, kinetoplast and cell membrane). If the sample
      is taken from the center of the lesion the same hemostatic technique must be used, the scab
      removed, and the bottom of the ulcer well cleaned using the sharp side of the scalpel to
      prevent the presence of cellular detritus and/or purulent material. This procedure must be
      continued until the granulomas are seen at the bottom. With the same technique used to
      process the samples from the active edge the presence of amastigotes of Leishmania is
      verified.

      Technique for the sampling of cultures

      The sample for the culture may be obtained by suctioning the ulcer active edge or by
      extracting a fragment of tissue which is then macerated in a phosphate-buffered saline
      solution (PBS) with antibiotics (1000 UI of crystalline penicillin per cc), before it is put
      in the culture medium. A tuberculin syringe with a thin needle (26G), containing 0.3 cc of
      PBS solution with antibiotics is used in the suction technique. Previous asepsis of the ulcer
      with alcohol at 70%, a needle is introduced into the dermis and through rotating movements a
      small amount of tissue is macerated by the needle bevel during about a minute, after which it
      is suctioned into the syringe. The sample is deposited in aseptic conditions into a NNN
      culture medium and incubated at 26ºC during 4 weeks [46,47]. Every week a drop is extracted
      from the culture medium and placed between two slides to be observed under a microscope. In
      case that promastigotes are not found, the cultures are rejected as negative [46]. The
      strains are identified by species using the monoclonal antibodies developed by Dr. Diane Mc
      Mahon Pratt [48,49].

      Evaluation and management of adverse events

      During the treatment and the follow-up visits, the patients will be asked about adverse
      events. Each adverse event will be classified by the physician as serious or
      non-serious(Table 2 and 3). A serious adverse event should meet one or more of the following
      criteria:

        1. Death

        2. Life-threatening (i.e., immediate risk of death)

        3. In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

        4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity The presence of a serious adverse event
           that puts the patient's life at risk and/or requires immediate medical or surgical
           procedure will call for the discontinuation of the treatment and the initiation of the
           pertinent medical management of the patients. The investigator will notify the Adverse
           Event Committee (AEC) of the FCV of any serious adverse event within 24 hours of
           learning about it.

      A non serious adverse event will be classified as follows:

        1. Mild: The patients are aware of their symptoms and/or signs, but those are tolerable.
           They do not require medical intervention or specific treatment.

        2. Moderate: Patients present troubles that interfere with their daily activities. They
           require medical intervention or specific treatment.

        3. Severe: The patients are unable to work or to attend their daily activities. They
           require medical intervention or specific treatment.

      The possible relationship between the adverse events and the tested medication will be
      classified by the investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following
      definitions:

        1. Definitely related: Event can be fully explained by the administration of the tested
           medication.

        2. Probably related: Event is most likely to be explained by the administration of the
           tested medication rather than other medications or by the patient's clinical state.

        3. Possibly related: Event may be explained by the administration of the tested medication
           or other medications or by the patient's clinical state.

        4. Not related: Event is most likely to be explained by the patient's clinical state or
           other medications, rather than the tested one.

      All the events will be reported to the AEC that, depending on their criteria, will decide for
      the continuity or the withdrawal of the patient from the study and therefore the breaking of
      the code.

      Although the project has been designed to minimize the inherent risks, any adverse event
      related to the study medications will be carefully evaluated by the AEC and the costs
      generated by the required treatment will be covered by the study.

      Data analysis phase

      This phase will last 6 months. After completing all the data entry to the CFR, the results
      will be audited and the detected errors evaluated and corrected by the person in charge. The
      information will be entered in two different databases by two different people and the
      records will be compared to detect any discrepancy. The original CFR will be used to correct
      any mistake in the database.

      For the statistical analysis, Stata 8.0 will be used. The descriptive analysis will be
      composed of medians and proportions according to the nature of the variables, with its
      respective 95% confidence intervals. As a dispersion measurement the standard deviation will
      be calculated. The distribution of the variables will be studied using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
      To detect any difference between the groups, a T-test or a Wilcoxon test will be performed
      according to its distribution. The categorical variables will be compared using the Chi2 test
      or the exact Fisher's test. If required, a model of multiple logistic regressions or a
      covariance analysis will be done.

      Two interim analyses will be performed when 35% and 70% of the calculated sample is
      collected, with the objective of determining the differences in effectiveness and safety
      between the treatments.

      Endpoints

      At the end of the study two endpoints will be evaluated:

        1. Successful Treatment:

             1. Complete reepithelization three months after the beginning of the treatment.

             2. Absence of reactivation and affections of the mucous membranes during the 6 months
                of the study.

        2. Treatment Failure:

             1. Incomplete reepithelization three months after the beginning of the treatment.

             2. Increase in the size of the ulcer by more than 50% in relation to the last clinical
                evaluation

             3. Reactivation and/or affections of the mucous membranes during the 6 months of the
                study.

      Final Report

      At the end of the study the results will be evaluated and discussed and a final report
      presented to COLCIENCIAS, entity that is sponsoring the project. The relevant results will be
      published in both, national and international journals, and presented in congresses and
      scientific meetings.

      ETHICAL ASPECTS
