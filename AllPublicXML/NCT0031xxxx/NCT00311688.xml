  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a protein found naturally in the blood that helps boost the immune
      system. The purpose of this study is to provide long-term treatment and monitoring of HIV
      infected people enrolled in NIAID-funded studies investigating the use of laboratory-made
      IL-2 for the treatment of HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-2 is a biological response modifier that can improve the body's response to disease. It is
      hoped that IL-2 treatment can help restore CD4 cell counts and immune function in people
      whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV. Over the last 10 years, NIAID has sponsored a
      number of important studies of IL-2 in HIV infected people; many of these trials are ongoing.
      This study was developed in an effort consolidate these separate, smaller trials into one
      larger study so that results between the trials can be shared and used to develop future
      protocols. This study is an umbrella study that will provide long-term administrative
      support, treatment, and monitoring for ongoing Phase I and II IL-2 trials and their
      participants. It is primarily intended for patients in the extension phases of any previous
      NIAID Clinical Center HIV Program (NIAID/CCMD) intramural research protocols in which IL-2
      therapy continues to be offered. Blood collection will occur through a patient's
      participation in this study.

      Participants will continue to follow the protocol in which they originally enrolled. A
      desired therapeutic goal or &quot;CD4 plateau&quot; will be used in most cases to help clinicians
      determine when a participant requires additional IL-2. In general, if a participant has two
      or more consecutive CD4 counts below the CD4 plateau, additional IL-2 will be administered to
      that patient. In maintaining uniformity among the many trials being consolidated under this
      trial, the frequency and nature of study visits will be solely dictated by this umbrella
      study. Participants will also be asked to join an optional substudy: Interrupted Versus
      Continuous Antiretrovirals Involving Randomization from the Umbrella Study (ICARUS).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infected

          -  Current participation and presently in good standing in a NIAID/CCMD clinical trial
             involving the use of IL-2 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Additional HIV-1
             infected people who are IL-2 naive may be selected by the investigator for this study.

          -  Willing to take antiretrovirals within a 10-day period surrounding each IL-2 cycle.
             Individual protocols may be modified as needed by the investigator to permit IL-2
             therapy in the absence of antiretrovirals.

          -  Willing to accept additional IL-2 therapy when needed

          -  Willing to use acceptable forms of contraception during a minimum 10-day period
             surrounding each IL-2 injection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of noncompliance with prior NIAID/CCMD protocols

          -  Any organic central nervous system (CNS) abnormality requiring treatment with
             antiseizure medication

          -  Unless previously exempted for this requirement, current or history of Crohn's
             disease, psoriasis, or other autoimmune or inflammatory disease with potentially
             life-threatening complications

          -  Significant heart, lung, kidney, rheumatologic, gastrointestinal, or CNS disease that
             may pose an unacceptable risk to the participant during IL-2 therapy

          -  Psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             study

          -  Current or recent substance abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             interfere with the study

          -  Refuse to follow Clinical Center policy on partner notification

          -  History of optic neuritis

          -  Refuse to allow extra blood specimens to be stored for potential use in future studies
             of HIV-1 infection or the immune system
