      The purpose of the study is to determine whether hormone replacement therapy in post
      menopausal women with coronary artery disease prevents future heart attacks or death from
      coronary heart disease.

      A randomized, blinded trial in post menopausal women with cornaornary artery disease to test
      the hypothesis, among 2340 women who have a uterus, that those randomized to receive
      estrogen-progestin replacement therapy (Premanrin .625 mg daily plus medroxygrprogesterone
      acetate 2.5 mg daily) have the same frequency on new CHD events (myocardial infarction and
      CHD death) as those randomized to placebo.
