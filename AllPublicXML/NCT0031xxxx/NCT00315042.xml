    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, randomized (1:1), double blind, double dummy, comparator-controlled,
      2 parallel treatment group study in subjects from 6 months to &lt; 13 years of age, with
      Streptococcus pyogenes tonsillitis/pharyngitis (T/P).Each subject will receive either
      telithromycin 25 mg/kg once daily for 5 days or penicillin V, 13.3 mg/kg three times daily
      for 10 days. Matching placebo for telithromycin and penicillin V will also be dispensed for 5
      and 10 days respectively, to provide blinding to the different treatment regimens. A positive
      rapid identification test for streptococcal Group A antigen will be required for all subjects
      at Visit 1 (Day 1) for entry into the study. Throat swab specimens for bacterial culture,
      identification, and antibiotic-susceptibility testing will be taken at Visits 1, 3 and 4.

               -  A positive result from a rapid detection throat swab test for Group A
                  streptococcal antigen and submission of a throat swab specimen for bacterial
                  culture, identification, and antibiotic-susceptibility testing; and

               -  A sore and scratchy throat and/or pain on swallowing (odynophagia) together with
                  at least 2 of the following clinical signs:
