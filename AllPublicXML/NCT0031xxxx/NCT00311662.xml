  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall trial objectives:

        -  Can treatment with tonabersat reduce the number of days with a migraine headache in
           patients who suffer from frequent migraine attacks

        -  How well tolerated is treatment with tonabersat

      The study is based on the hypothesis that the unique mechanism of action of tonabersat will
      inhibit some of the early events in the generation of migraine and so be effective as
      prophylactic treatment
