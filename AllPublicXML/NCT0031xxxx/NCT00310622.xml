  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to verify the ability of the HyperQ signal to detect Dobutamine
      induced Ischemia. The gold standard for ischemia will be the results of Angiography if
      performed, or Echocardiographic imaging, which was performed during the test.

      Subjects referred for Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography who will sign an Informed consent
      form will go through the test. High resolution ECG from 12 leads will be recorded using BSP's
      HyperQ system before, during and following the Echo testing. This wil be done without
      interfering or affecting any aspect of the normal procedure. Standard Protocol will be used
      with standard test termination indications.

      The Diagnostic stage will include analysis of the hyperQ signal, aiming to classify results
      as ischemic or non-ischemic.

      The HyperQ data will be compared to DSE results which will be used as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for
      this study unless Angiography results are obtained.

      An additional comparison evaluation will be performed to assess the advantage of the HyperQ
      results on the ST-changes results obtained from conventional ECG.In addition all recruited
      subjects will be followed for up to 12 months.During this period a phone call will be
      performed every 3 months to evaluate cardiac status, hospitalization and especially
      Angiography procedures.
