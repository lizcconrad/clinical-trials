      The purpose of this study is to determine patient preference and acceptance of tablet sodium
      phosphate bowel preparation in patients who had polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for their
      prior colonoscopy. This study will provide answers related to the patient preferences and
      their acceptance of this new method of bowel preparation.

        Scheduled colonoscopy list will be reviewed to identify potential subjects for recruitment.
        A cover letter will be sent to the potential study subject with tablet preparation as an
        alternative to Golytely preparation ( PEG). For subjects who are willing to participate, a
        prescription for 28 tablet sodium phosphate bowel preparation as outlined in appendix: A
        will be mailed. A questionnaire will be given to the patients prior to their colonoscopy to
        identify their preferences regarding bowel preparation and their acceptance ( see appendix:
        B).

        A separate validated questionnaire will be given to participating physicians after the
        procedure, to quantitate the colonic cleansing (appendix : C). Adverse events will be
        documented. A statistical analysis of the results will be done at the end of the study.
