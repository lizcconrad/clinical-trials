      To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of docetaxel and cisplatin combination on two schedules
      in patients with previously untreated, advanced NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60-80 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks is
      one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen in Korea for the first-line treatment of
      advanced NSCLC. Although the 3-weekly regimen is active and tolerated, it is associated with
      a significant incidence of severe neutropenia, often complicated by fever. Therefore, there
      has been increasing interest in the use of a weekly administration of docetaxel as a way of
      reducing its hematologic toxicity. We designed this randomized phase II trial to evaluate the
      safety profile and antitumor activity of two different schedules of docetaxel plus cisplatin
      given as first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.
