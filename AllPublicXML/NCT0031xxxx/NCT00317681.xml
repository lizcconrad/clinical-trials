      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical tacrolimus in different
      subtypes of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. As shown by several groups activated memory T
      lymphocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of lupus erythematosus. Tacrolimus targets T
      lymphocytes and suppresses their activation by inhibiting the expression of cytokine genes,
      such as IL-2. Therefore, treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus with topical tacrolimus
      might result in an improvement of skin lesions in such patients.

      In patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), topical corticosteroids are the
      mainstay of treatment; however, a long-term use can lead to numerous side effects including
      skin atrophy. Recently, topical tacrolimus has been suggested to be effective in patients
      with different manifestations of CLE as single or additive therapy. Its anti-inflammatory
      effect can be explained by inhibition of calcineurin and suppression of proinflammatory
      cytokines such as interleukins-2, -3, -4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and tumour
      necrosis factor alpha. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of tacrolimus in 30 patients
      with different forms of CLE (ACLE, SCLE, DLE, LET). During a period of 3 months tacrolimus
      ointment and its placebo are applied on two separate skin lesions. Clinical follow-up
      examinations including photo documentation are performed every 4 weeks.
