  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acutely ill immobilized patients are at a high risk for thromboembolic events including deep
      venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular
      weight heparins (LMWH) are thought to be effective in preventing thromboembolic events. This
      study is designed to provide efficacy and safety data for thromboprophylaxis with the LMWH
      certoparin in comparison to thromboprophylaxis with UFH in acutely ill non-surgical patients.
