  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if gastric bypass patients experience
      hypoventilation in the immediate postoperative period, and to what degree.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to determine if patients with clinically significant obesity (body mass index,
      BMI, between 40 kg/m2 and 85 kg/m2), who have undergone gastric bypass procedures under
      general anesthesia hypoventilate during the initial twenty-four hour postoperative period,
      and if so, to what degree. Adequacy of ventilation will be assessed by serial arterial blood
      analyses. Patients will be monitored for SpO2 in the preoperative holding area, in the
      operating room, and the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) by conventional and study pulse
      oximeters. SpO2 data will be collected continuously and recorded on the study pulse oximeter
      for the entire study period. Arterial blood samples will be drawn for analysis every four
      hours by in-dwelling arterial catheter, using standard sterile technique. Hypoventilation is
      defined as an increase in PaCO2 five or more mm Hg above patient's baseline.

        The study population will include male and female adult patients (age 18-65) with
        clinically significant obesity (body mass index (BMI) between 40-85 kg/m2), who are
        approved for gastric bypass surgery for weight loss. Patients must have documented
        obstructive sleep apnea and use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel
        positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and have an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
        Physical Status Classification I-III.

             the research protocol

          -  Patients in which placing an arterial catheter would pose a clinically unacceptable
             health risk, e.g., bleeding disorders, radial artery malformation
