    <textblock>
      The CARE-HF long-term follow-up trial evaluates the effects of cardiac resynchronization (CR)
      therapy on the mortality of patients from the CARE-HF program for an additional 4 year
      follow-up. Investigators are free to choose whatever available treatment they believe is in
      the patient's best interest.

      The CARE-HF study enrolled 813 patients from 82 centers in 12 European countries (Austria,
      Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
      and UK). All patients that were reported to be alive in May 2005 will be asked to
      participate.
