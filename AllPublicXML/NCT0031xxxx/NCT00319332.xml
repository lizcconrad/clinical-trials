    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, study to compare Iodine I 131 Tositumomab therapeutic
      regimen to Ibritumomab Tiuxetan therapeutic regimen in the treatment of patients with
      relapsed or transformed follicular non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. A total of 350 patients,
      approximately 175 patients per arm, will be enrolled at 30 to 40 sites in the United States.

             lymphoma (WHO/REAL classification).

          -  International Working Formulation histological equivalents of Follicular, small
             cleaved; Follicular, mixed small-cleaved and large-cell; follicular large-cell; or
             Transformed diffuse large cell lymphoma following or concurrent with a diagnosis of
             follicular lymphoma.

          -  Patients diagnosed with diffuse large cell lymphoma at study enrollment must have a
             historical or contemporaneous lymph node biopsy that demonstrates a diagnosis of
             follicular lymphoma.

          -  Recurrent lymphoma after at least three qualifying therapy regimens including at least
             one Rituximab-containing regimen and at least one chemotherapy regimen.

          -  The patient must have either not responded or responded with a duration of response of
             less than 6 months to a Rituximab-containing regimen, Performance status of at least
             70% on the Karnofsky Scale and an anticipated survival of at least three months.

          -  Bi-dimensionally measurable disease with at least one lesion measuring 4.0 cm2 by CT
             scan.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count &gt;/=100,000/mm3 within
             21 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Blood products and/or growth factors should not be taken within 4 weeks prior to blood
             draw.

          -  Adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal) and
             adequate hepatic function (defined as total bilirubin &lt;1.5x upper limit of normal and

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Greater than 25% of the intratrabecular marrow space involved by lymphoma in bone
             marrow biopsy specimens as assessed microscopically within 90 days prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Hypocellular bone marrow (&lt;/=15% cellularity or marked reduction in bone marrow
             precursors).
