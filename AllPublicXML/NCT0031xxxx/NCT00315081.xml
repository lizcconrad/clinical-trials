      neuroleptic-induced hyperprolactinemia will be examined endocrinologically. Adverse drug
      effects and diagnoses will be confirmed by measuring hormones.

      Antipsychotic drugs can cause a clinically relevant hyperprolactinemia due to blocking the
      dopamine receptors in the pituitary.Depending on its concentration hyperprolactinemia causes
      a median hypogonadism with estrogen insufficiency in women and testosterone insufficiency in
      men by inhibiting the pulsatile GnRH-secretion.The hyperprolactinemia-induced symptoms have
      been successfully medicated for years with dopamine agonists like bromocriptine.

      In patients with psychiatric diseases hyperprolactinemia is usually not treated with dopamine
      agonist fearing a reexacerbation of the underline psychiatric disease. In a few studies and
      casuistically the treatment of neuroleptic-induced hyperprolactinemia with bromocriptine has
      been shown to be effective without causing reexacerbation of psychotic symptoms.

      Schizophrenic patients suffering from a neuroleptic-induced hyperprolactinemia (in extremis
      galactorrhoea and amenorrhoea. in women, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction in men) will
      be examined endocrinologically. Adverse drug effects and diagnoses will be confirmed by
      measuring hormones (prolactin, LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol). In case of a clear
      symptomatic, neuroleptic-induced hyperprolactinemia patients will be medicated with
      bromocriptin. Therapeutical success will be determined endocrinologically in week 0, 1, 2, 3,
      4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 together with a psychiatric examination (PANSS, HAM-D, Simpson-Angus
      Scale (SAS)). Safety of therapy will be ensured by the close meshed psychiatric examinations.
