      Introduction:

      Vasopressor agents are commonly used to correct hypotension in patients with acute
      circulatory failure. Their variable alpha, beta, or dopaminergic receptor stimulation, may
      result in different hemodynamic and metabolic effects. Several experimental and human studies
      have indicated that dopamine and norepinephrine may have different effects on the kidney, the
      splanchnic region or the pituitary axis, but the implications of these findings have not been
      assessed. Hence, both agents are widely used, and several consensus or expert recommendations
      still recommend the use of both agents 1,2. An observational study has reported that dopamine
      and epinephrine may be associated with a higher mortality rate than norepinephrine 3. In
      addition, The results of the SOAP study indicated that dopamine may be associated with higher
      mortality rates than norepinephrine, but various uncontrolled factors may have influenced
      these results. Therefore, we will address this issue in a prospective, randomized, double
      blind study. We hypothesize that both agents have similar effects on survival.

      Design of the study:

      Prospective, randomized, double blind, multicenter.

      Patients:

      A total of 1600 consecutive patients with hypotension requiring the administration of
      vasopressors.

      Power calculation: Calculation is based on the results of the SOAP study (mortality 43% with
      dopamine and 36% with norepinephrine), using a two-sided analysis, with a significant p value
      at 0.05 and a power of 80%, 765 patients are needed in each group. About 40 centers will be
      recruited.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Mean arterial pressure less than 70 mmHg or systolic pressure less than 100 mmHg persisting
      despite adequate fluid loading (in example with at least 1000 mL crystalloid or 500 ml
      colloid) unless central venous pressure (CVP) or pulmonary artery occluded pressure (PAOP)
      are elevated (e.g. CVP&gt; 12 mmHg or PAOP &gt; 14 mmHg).

      Exclusions:

        -  Serious arrhythmia such as rapid atrial fibrillation (&gt; 160/min) or ventricular
           tachycardia.

        -  Brain death.

        -  Open label administration of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine or phenylephrine for
           more than 4hours.

      Consent:

      Patients will be randomized immediately, with the use of sealed envelopes placed near the
      supplies of dopamine and norepinephrine. If the patient is already being treated with one
      agent, randomization can still take place provided that it is within a 4 hour period.

      Consent will be obtained from the patient before entering the study, if possible, or from the
      next of kin as soon as possible after starting vasopressor therapy. Indeed, in such cases,
      vasopressor therapy should anyway be started, either with dopamine or with norepinephrine,
      and these 2 therapies are currently equally valid 1st choices. As soon as possible, the next
      of kin will be informed and deferred consent obtained. If the patient recovers, and is able
      to consent, consent will then be obtained.

      According to local Ethical Committee, oral or signed consents will be obtained.

      Protocol:

      Blood pressure goal: defined by the physician in charge, according to each unit's
      recommendations

      Administration of vasoactive drugs:

      Double blind administration of a solution of norepinephrine or dopamine contained either in
      vials or syringes according to the ICU's protocol (see appendices I and II for vial and
      syringe preparations). Each solution will be labeled with its randomly allocated number and
      will be prepared by the nurses in charge. The rate of administration of the blind solution
      will be determined according to a scale and using the estimated body weight. The recommended
      steps for increasing or decreasing the doses of the blinded solution are calculated to be
      equivalent to 2 µg/kg.min for dopamine and 0.02 mcg/kg.min for norepinephrine, the
      investigator being free to use multiples of this increment in case of emergency. The maximal
      dose with the 2 agents will be 20 µg/kg.min for dopamine and 0.19 mcg/kg.min for
      norepinephrine (these doses have been shown to have similar effects on mean arterial blood
      pressure 4).

      If the patient is already treated with open label vasopressors at baseline, the blinded
      solution will be rapidly incremented, and, if possible, the open label vasopressor agent will
      be decreased. If this open label vasopressor consisted in dopamine and if this agent cannot
      be fully weaned after the introduction of the blinded solution, the open label dopamine will
      be replaced by an open label norepinephrine infusion.

      When the maximal dose of the blinded solution is achieved, an open label perfusion of
      norepinephrine can be added to achieve the desired blood pressure. Epinephrine or vasopressin
      may be used only as rescue therapy. Weaning of vasopressor agents will begin by weaning of
      the open label norepinephrine, followed by weaning of the blinded solution. In case of
      recurrence of hypotension, the blinded solution will be resumed first (maximal dose with the
      2 agents will be 20 µg/kg.min for dopamine and 0.19 mcg/kg.min for norepinephrine) and if
      needed an open label solution of norepinephrine may be added. Weaning of the vasopressors
      will be performed as previously described.

      Dobutamine, dopexamine, and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase III can be used, if needed, to
      optimize cardiac output according to local practices.

      General therapeutic guidelines:

      All therapies will be performed according to local guidelines. The choice of sedative agents,
      antibiotics, fluids, transfusion threshold, ventilatory modes,…. , will be left to the
      attending physicians. Likewise, the administration of agents like corticosteroids or
      drotrecogin-alpha activated (Xigris) is permitted.

      Randomization:

      Randomization by blocks for each participating ICU, using a computer generated list to
      allocate treatments A or B, put in sealed envelopes near the drug supplies. In each ICU,
      sealed envelopes including treatment allocation and a five digit number will be available.
      The envelope will be opened by the person responsible for preparation of the dopamine and
      norepinephrine solutions. The random number and treatment allocation will be written on a
      hidden book, available only for the person responsible for preparation of the dopamine and
      norepinephrine solutions. The doctors and other nurses will be kept blinded to treatment
      allocation. On patients' charts only the rate of administration and the dilution (simple or
      double) of the solution will be written.

      Preparation of the solutions:

      The solutions of dopamine or norepinephrine will be prepared by the nurse in charge of the
      patient. The five digit number (allocated by randomization) will be written on the bag. See
      appendices I and II for details regarding the preparation of the solutions. Different
      concentrations of these solutions are provided, the choice of the concentration of the
      solution will be left to the physician in charge.

      Definition of the end of the shock period:

      Shock will be considered as having resolved when the investigational drug can be stopped for
      more than 12 hours.

      End-points:

      Primary end-point: 28 day survival

      Secondary end-points:

      ICU survival Hospital survival Severity of organ dysfunction in the ICU (SOFA score 5)

      ventilation (ventilator free days) and on renal replacement (renal replacement free days)

      dobutamine or other inotropic agents Tolerance: arrhythmia (incidence of ventricular
      tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and atrial fibrillation), myocardial necrosis, skin
      necrosis, limb or distal extremity ischemia.

      of the study in case of significant difference in 28-day survival between the two treatments,
      or futility

      B/ Final analysis:

      Intention to treat analysis Kaplan-Meier curves (with log rank test) will be used to assess
      ICU and 28-day survival as well as the durations of vasopressor therapy (both for labeled and
      open label drugs) and ICU stay.
