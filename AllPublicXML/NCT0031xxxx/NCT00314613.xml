  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assured treatment with Risperal CONSTA will provide first-episode patients, who have a
      greater potential for therapeutic response, with their best opportunity for continued
      improvement in cognitive function beyond three months of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First episode patients have a greater potential for therapeutic response than multi-episode
      patients, and many of them also havea great desire to rejoin the workforce. Unfortunately,
      first episode patients become non-compliant or intermittently compliant with prescribed
      antipsychotic treatment at least as frequently as multi-episode patients. We believe that
      assured treatment with Risperal CONTSTA will provide first episode patients wiwth their best
      opporutnity for continued improvement in cognitive function beyond 3 months of treatment and
      that improvements in cognitive function will be associated with a greater likelihood of
      employment, real-world outcomes, such as independent living, as well as measures of brain
      function.
