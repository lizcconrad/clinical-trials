  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the value of novel non-invasive medical imaging
      methods for detecting the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to the lymph nodes
      in the neck by comparing their results to findings at the time of surgery.
