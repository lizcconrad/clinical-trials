  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, double-dummy, double-blind study
      with a screening period. Subjects will receive one of the following three treatment groups
      for 15 days: loratadine 10 mg/montelukast 10 mg combination, pseudoephedrine 240 mg, or
      placebo. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combination of
      loratadine/montelukast, a once-daily tablet containing 10 mg loratadine and 10 mg
      montelukast, compared with placebo in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) in
      relieving the symptom of nasal congestion. The safety profile of combined
      loratadine/montelukast relative to placebo and pseudoephedrine will also be evaluated.

          -  A positive skin-prick test response to seasonal

          -  Clinically symptomatic at Screening and at the Baseline Visits

          -  General good health.

          -  Freedom from any clinically significant disease, other than SAR, that would interfere
             with the study evaluations.

          -  Willingness (subjects and/or a parent/guardian) to give written informed consent and
             ability to adhere to dosing and visit schedules and meet study requirements.

          -  Negative pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of anaphylaxis and/or other severe local reaction(s) to skin testing.

          -  Asthma requiring chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Current or history of frequent, clinically significant sinusitis or chronic purulent
             postnasal drip.

          -  Rhinitis medicamentosa.

          -  A history of allergies to more than two classes of medications or allergy to or
             intolerance of antihistamines, montelukast, or pseudoephedrine.

          -  An upper respiratory tract or sinus infection that required antibiotic therapy without
             at least a 14 day washout prior to the Screening Visit, or a viral upper respiratory
             infection within 7 days before the Screening Visit.

          -  Nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps and marked septal
             deviations, that significantly interfere with nasal air flow.

          -  Dependence (in the opinion of the investigator) on nasal, oral, or ocular
             decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids.

          -  Narrow-angle glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, urinary retention,
             hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes

             Visit.

          -  Current immunotherapy (desensitization therapy), unless on a regular maintenance
             schedule prior to the Screening Visit, which should be maintained for the remainder of

             the subject's participation in the study. Particular attention should be given to
             exclude subjects with conditions that would currently interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug or interfere with the
             subject's ability to complete or reliably complete the diary card.

          -  Significant medical condition(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, might
