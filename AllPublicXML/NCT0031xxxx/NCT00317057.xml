  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to Department of Internal Medicine M, Glostrup University hospital, with
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are evaluated with regard to early follow-up by
      a specialized nurse in the home after discharge. Eligible patients receive education about
      disease management. The intervention is evaluated by comparing the number of readmissions for
      COPD and the duration of admissions during the study period to the the period prior to the
      implementation of this intervention.
