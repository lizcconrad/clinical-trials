  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to test the hypothesis that patients with chronic renal disease have a
      poorer ability to preserve water after being thirsty and a poorer ability to excrete water
      after a load of fluid. They presume that these abilities become poorer when renal
      insufficiency progresses. The investigators further hypothesize that patients with
      hypertension also have a decreased ability to concentrate and dilute urine.
