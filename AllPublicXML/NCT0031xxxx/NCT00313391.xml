  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Risperdal Consta will affect the healthcare
      utilization costs in chronically ill schizophrenic patients with multiple admissions to the
      psychiatric hospital compared to the previous utilization costs under standard oral treatment
      of any atypical antipsychotic. We hypothesize that higher Risperdal Consta acquisition costs
      can be offset by reduction in total medical utilization costs, such as hospitalizations, ER
      visits, unscheduled outpatient visits or incarcerations due to worsening of psychotic
      symptoms.
