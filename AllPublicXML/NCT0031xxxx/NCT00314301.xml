  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare movement variations before and after the loaded
      training, with kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography, in children with spastic diplegia
      and to further discuss mechanisms of the loaded training.

      Subjects: This study will recruit twenty children who are aged between 5 and 12 years, with
      spastic diplegia, and without having major surgeries or botulinum toxin injection on lower
      extremities during the past 6 months prior to participate in this study.

      Methods: The Vicon 250 motion analysis system, 3 AMTI force platforms and the EMG recording
      system will be used to collect data of sit-to-stand (STS) movements. Baseline, pre- and
      post-training evaluations will be carried out. The duration of the baseline and pre-training
      evaluations is 2 months. The training period will take about 6 weeks. Each evaluation will
      take two separate days to accomplish. On the first day, the STS1RM of individual children was
      determined. On the second day, kinematic and kinetic data of STS movements in natural and
      loaded (applying load of 50% STS1RM during STS movements) conditions were collected. Data of
      smoothness, maximal extension moment and around hip and knee joints, onset time of lower
      extremity muscles will then be calculated. Results of each evaluation will be used for
      further comparison.
