  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, single-center study of
      desloratadine 5 mg or placebo in subjects 18 years of age or older with a history of seasonal
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. This study was performed to examine the effects of
      desloratadine compared with placebo, on the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis
      induced by direct conjunctival challenges with a previously identified sensitizing antigen,
      in the eyes of a subject known to be sensitive to the antigen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least a 2-year history (self-reported acceptable) of recurrent seasonal allergic
             conjunctivitis associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis

          -  Skin test positive (skin prick test with a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than
             the diluent control or intradermal testing with the wheal diameter at least 7 mm
             larger than diluent control) at Screening, or within 12 months prior to the Screening
             Visit, to an appropriate seasonal allergen, including one or more of the following:
             Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis)grass: meadow fescue, rye, Bermuda grass trees: oak,
             maple, birch cat hair or dander (Felis domesticus) ragweed

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of birth
             control (ie, hormonal contraceptive, medically prescribed IUD, condom in combination
             with spermicide) or be surgically sterilized

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             the Screening Visit

          -  A calculated best-corrected visual acuity of 0.6 logMar or better in each eye as
             measured by an ETDRS chart

          -  Free of any clinically significant disease (other than SAR) that would interfere with
             study evaluations.

          -  Must agree to record symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant
             medications, and adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary.

          -  At the Screening Visit, prior to the qualifying conjunctival allergen challenge, the
             subject must have an ocular symptom severity redness score of mild (&lt;=1) prior to
             exposure to allergen. Following allergen challenge, the subject must achieve ocular
             itching and redness scores of at least moderate (&gt;=2) in both eyes within 10 minutes
             of the last allergen challenge. For redness, the score must be &gt;=2 in 2 of the 3
             vessel beds. (details in section 8.2.6 and 8.3.2 of the protocol)

          -  At the confirmation visit, the subject must have ocular itching scores in both eyes of
             &gt;=2 in 2 of the 3 timepoints (3, 5, and 7 minutes post-challenge). The subject must
             also have the following redness score bilaterally at 15 minutes post-challenge: &gt;=2 in
             at least 2 vessel beds and &gt;=6 composite oculare redness score

             excretion of the study drug, or with the subject's ability to complete diary cards

          -  Clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical and ocular exam, which
             may interfere with study evaluation or affect subject safety
