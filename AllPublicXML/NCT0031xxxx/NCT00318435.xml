  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The type of hemodialysis access and preservation of this access greatly influences the
      quality of life and survival of patients undergoing hemodialysis. The Kidney Disease Outcomes
      Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines for vascular access recommend the primary placement of
      native or autogenous hemodialysis fistulas in preference to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      grafts and central venous catheters because the former form of access has fewer complications
      and a longer durability. However, autogenous hemodialysis fistulas, like
      polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, are also subject to dysfunction and eventual failure.
      Endovascular angioplasty has become an accepted alternative treatment to surgical revision
      for hemodialysis access-related venous stenoses and occlusions. However, the patency rates in
      the follow-up period are low because of the high frequency of restenosis due to intimal
      hyperplasia. Since 1988, noncovered stents have been used to improve fistula patency. In the
      central veins, bare stents demonstrate better patency rates than percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty (PTA) alone. Neointimal hyperplasia is the major reason for restenosis following
      stent placement. The cephalic vein forms the outflow conduit for radiocephalic and
      brachiocephalic autogenous fistulas. It has recently been suggested that a focal area of the
      cephalic vein is prone to developing hemodynamically significant stenosis, in what is now
      termed the cephalic arch. This is the perpendicular portion of the cephalic vein in the
      region of the deltopectoral groove before its junction with the axillary vein. To overcome
      the problem of restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia in the cephalic arch the investigators
      used the insertion of a stent-graft as an alternative approach. In this study they
      investigated the use of a PTFE-covered nitinol stent-graft (Fluency, Bard) versus a Luminex
      (Bard) stent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients included in this study would be presented for intervention after observation
             in the Vascular Access Unit for one of the following:

               -  the recurrent cephalic arch stenosis identified on periodic duplex scanning,
                  performed by one of the surgeons from the Vascular Access Unit;

               -  reduction of flow rate of more than 20% from baseline access flow rate;

               -  dynamic venous pressures exceeded threshold levels three consecutive times; or

               -  clinical signs (arm swelling, pulsatile fistula, prolonged bleeding from puncture
                  sites) suggesting fistula dysfunction in a patient with previously treated
                  cephalic arch stenosis.
