    <textblock>
      In this study, infants who were previously vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine at birth will
      be randomly allocated into two groups:

        -  one group of subjects will receive diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis- hepatitis B
           virus-inactivated poliovirus/Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) vaccine at
           6-10-14 weeks of age

        -  the second group of subjects will receive DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine at 2-4-6 months of
           age

      DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine will be administered at two schedules (i.e. 6-10-14 weeks of age OR
      2-4-6 months of age) in infants who were previously vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine at
      birth. The duration of the study will be approximately 3 months for each subject who will
      receive vaccination at 6-10-14 weeks of age and approximately 5 months for each subject who
      will receive vaccination at 2-4-6 months of age. Intervention name: Diphteria, tetanus,
      acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, poliovirus types 1, 2, 3 &amp; Haemophilus influenzae type b
      vaccine
