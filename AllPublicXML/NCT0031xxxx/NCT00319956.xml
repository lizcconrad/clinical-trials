  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that administration of azithromycin to ventilated premature
      infants will decrease the incidence and severity of BPD.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if Azithromycin treatment is beneficial for
      prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The survival of preterm infants has increased dramatically and has been associated with an
      increase in BPD. The incidence of BPD among extremely low birthweight infants ranges from 45%
      to 90%. Development of BPD is associated with both antenatal (maternal chorioamnionitis often
      due to Ureaplasma is related to BPD) and postnatal complications (oxygen toxicity,
      barotrauma, late onset infections). These insults appear to lead to an inflammatory response
      with resultant arrest of normal alveolar and vascular development. Multiple human studies
      support the role of inflammation in the development of BPD.

      Evaluating a medication that could decrease the inflammation in BPD, with minimal side
      effects, could significantly improve the morbidities of prematurity and the financial burden
      incurred by parents. Macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin and azithromycin) have been shown to
      have anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their antimicrobial properties.

      Azithromycin has the potential to decrease the severity of ventilator-induced pulmonary
      inflammation that is commonly seen in BPD.
