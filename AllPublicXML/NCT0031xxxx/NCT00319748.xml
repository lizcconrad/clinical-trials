  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of 852A when used to treat
      metastatic breast, ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer not responding to standard
      treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      852A will be administered as a subcutaneous injection (SC) 2 times per week for 12 weeks (24
      doses) with provisions for dose escalation or reduction based on tolerability.
