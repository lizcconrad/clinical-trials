  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases in human with high
      mortality.

      Early diagnosis followed by antibiotic treatment is the only way for control of the disease.
      However, most of commercial tuberculosis diagnostic kits are of moderate sensitivity.
      Oncoprobe Inc. recently developed a tuberculosis diagnostic kit (HR-103) based on detection
      of antibody against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in serum. The main purpose of this project is
      to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the kit in detection of pulmonary tuberculosis
      from saliva, urine, pleura and serum samples.Capilia TB assay and another
      Immunochromatographic assay such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10 based or other PCR based
      immunochromatographic assay will be tried to detection tuberculous disease.

      Sputum samples from 200 patients with chest or respiratory problems will be collected.
      Presence of M.

      tuberculosis in the samples will be checked by acid-fast stain and bacterial culture and
      identification methods.

      At the same time, saliva, urine, and serum samples from these 200 patients and 50 healthy
      volunteers will be collected. The tuberculosis diagnostic kit (HR-103) from Oncoprobe Inc. or
      capilia TB assay or another Immunochromatographic assay such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10 based or
      other PCR based immunochromatographic assay will be used to detect tuberculosis disease from
      these samples. By comparing the results with the stain and identification results of sputum
      samples from the 200 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the kit in detection of
      pulmonary tuberculosis from saliva, urine,pleura and serum samples, as well as from
      combination of these samples, will be obtained. In addition to pulmonary tuberculosis, M.
      tuberculosis causes pleural tuberculosis. Diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis involves
      determination of activities of adenosine deaminase and interferon-gamma in pleural effusion,
      which is tedious. We also plan to collect pleural effusion samples from 100 patients, and
      examined by the tuberculosis diagnostic kit (HR-103) from Oncoprobe Inc. By comparing the
      results with the adenosine deaminase and interferon-gamma activities of the same samples, the
      sensitivity and specificity of the kit in detection of pleural tuberculosis from pleural
      effusion samples will be obtained.
