    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, registration and follow-up study of women exposed to
      Betaseron® at the time of conception (i.e., any time from the first day of the last menstrual
      period) and/or during pregnancy. The Betaseron® Pregnancy Registry is designed to determine
      whether there is an increased risk or a pattern of birth defects in the offspring of women
      exposed to Betaseron® at conception and during pregnancy compared to rates from women in the
      general US population. Secondarily, the Registry will examine rates of spontaneous abortions
      and other negative pregnancy outcomes in this population. This study will be conducted in the
      United States (US). The Betaseron® Pregnancy Registry is sponsored by Bayer HealthCare
      Pharmaceuticals and is managed by the Post Approval &amp; Strategic Services group at INC
      Research, LLC. The scientific conduct and analysis of the Registry will be overseen by an
      Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (IDSMB) consisting of external specialists in
      teratology, epidemiology, maternal and fetal medicine, and neurology (external member details
      available upon request).

      Because informed consent is required, the Registration process must be initiated by the
      patient. An HCP who contacts the Registry may request an authorization for release of medical
      information packet or have the eligible patient contact the Registry directly. Once an
      eligible subject provides consent and permission to obtain information from her HCP, the
      Registry will contact the obstetric HCP and obtain information on demographics, history of
      previous pregnancies, maternal risk factors, pregnancy outcome, and neonatal health. Data
      will be collected from the maternal HCP at enrollment, during the second trimester (around
      week 20), and at outcome. Data on live born infants will be collected from the pediatrician
      at 4 months of age. If a birth defect is reported, targeted follow-up may be conducted.

      NOTE: This study has previously been posted by Berlex, Inc. which has since been renamed to
      Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the sponsor
      of this pregnancy registry.
