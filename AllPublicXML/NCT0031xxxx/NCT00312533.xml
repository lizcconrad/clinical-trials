  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of viscosupplementation is to replenish synovial fluid, which will improve patient
      symptoms and mobility. Viscosupplementation of the knee with hyaluronic acid injections has
      been shown to improve symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis. Recent studies have shown
      that this improvement may be highly variable based on the time from treatment, especially in
      the first 12 weeks following treatment. The purpose of this study is to document the outcomes
      following a treatment protocol in which corticosteroid is used in addition to the initial
      Synvisc injection in the series of three injections.

      Upon initial visit, all study patients will complete an informed consent. After consent,
      patients will complete the baseline questionnaire packet, which includes a questionnaire with
      several validated scoring systems. Following injection, patients will receive a diary to
      document any adverse events between the first and second injection. In one week, patients
      will return for a second visit to receive the second injection. Again they will be asked to
      maintain their diary of adverse events following the second injection. The patient will then
      receive the final injection at week 3 and will again complete a diary of events for one week.
      At 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks following the completed series of
      injections, the patients will complete a form that will include the pain, stiffness, and
      physical function subscales of the WOMAC score and a 10 point patient satisfaction question.

      At 6 months, the patients will receive by mail the same questionnaire packet they received at
      baseline, with the addition of patient satisfaction and subsequent injury/treatment
      questions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women aged 18 to 80 years

          -  with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee. Diagnosis will be based on
             radiographic examination (Kellgren-Lawrence 2 or 3) or by previous arthroscopic
             diagnosis.

        Surgical treatment for osteoarthritis will be limited to arthroscopic surgeries that
        include removal of loose bodies, resection of unstable meniscus tears and loose or unstable
        chondral flaps, removal of osteophytes if they limit extension, and lysis of adhesions.
        These types of treatments may provide symptomatic relief by increasing joint volume in
        knees with osteoarthritis and relieving joint contact pressures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with grade 4 Kellgren-Lawrence on radiographic examination will be excluded.

          -  Patients with a prior synovectomy on knee to be injected will be excluded.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have rheumatoid disease or any other serious
             systemic disease, acute synovitis or excessive effusion, allergy to avian
             products/hyaluronan-based injection components/corticosteroid injection, pregnant,
             previous arthroscopic surgery within the last 6 months or had a joint infection within
             the previous 3 months.

          -  Patients who have undergone a prior synovectomy will not be included.
