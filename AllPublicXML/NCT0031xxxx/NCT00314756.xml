    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream on
      nodular BCC lesions treated 5x/week for 6 weeks after primary treatment with curettage
      without electrodesiccation. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the cosmetic
      outcome after treatment of the lesions using this modality.
