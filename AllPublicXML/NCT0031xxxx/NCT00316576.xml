  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Associations between angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism and occurrence and
      outcome of ARDS, and with respiratory complications post cardiopulmonary bypass have already
      been demonstrated. Based on physiological effects of angiotensin II, we hypothesized that the
      I allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme Insertion/Deletion polymorphism may be
      associated with a higher risk of acute renal failure in critically ill patients.
