    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to treat anemic (Hemoglobin (Hb) &lt; 12 g/dL) HIV-infected
      subjects with once weekly (QW) PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) to a target Hb of &gt; 13 g/dL and then to
      assess if the target Hb level and improvements in Quality of Life (QOL) could be maintained
      with every other week (Q2W) PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) dosing.

      This was a Phase IV, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study conducted in community
      based practices, physicians networks, or academic institutions in the US. This study included
      anemic (Hb &lt; 12 g/dL) HIV-infected subjects and HIV/hepatitis C (HCV) co-infected subjects
      not receiving HCV treatment on a stable anti-retroviral therapy (ART) regimen for at least 4
      weeks prior to enrollment.

      Quality of life assessments, laboratory results, and transfusion information were obtained
      during the study. Laboratory tests, vital signs (blood pressure), and incidence and severity
      of adverse events were collected and assessed.

      The primary objective of this study was to assess if every other week PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa)
      dosing can maintain quality of life in anemic HIV-infected patients. The primary hypothesis
      of interest was that the mean quality of life score (as measured by MOS-HIV General Health
      Perception score) at the end of the every other week (Q2W) maintenance phase was not lower
      than that at the beginning of the maintenance phase by more than 7 points.

      It was anticipated that less frequent dosing, every other week, was more convenient for
      patients and will improve patient compliance. The starting dose (Baseline/Study Day 1) of
      PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) for all eligible subjects was 40,000 U given subcutaneously QW. The
      maximum duration was 24 weeks. Subjects who achieved target Hb levels &gt;= 13 g/dL were
      converted to a maintenance dose of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) sc Q2W.
