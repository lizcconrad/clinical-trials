  <brief_title>Magnevist® Injection-enhanced MRA Compared to Non Contrast MRA for the Detection of Stenosis of the Renal Arteries</brief_title>
  <official_title>Multicenter, Open-label Study of the Safety (Open-label) and Efficacy (Open-label and Blinded Reader) of a Single Administration of Approximately 0.1 mmol/kg of Magnevist® Injection-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Arteriography (MRA) and 2-dimensional-time-of-flight (2D-TOF) MRA in Patients With Known or Suspected Renal Artery Disease Undergoing MRA of the Renal Arteries With Intra-arterial Digital Subtraction Arteriography (i.a. DSA) as the Standard of Reference</official_title>

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy
      (how well does it work) of Magnevist (the study drug) used for MRI of the renal arteries. The
      results will be compared to the results of MRI taken without Magnevist and with the results
      of your X-ray angiography.
