    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the buprenorphine
      transdermal system (5, 10, and 20 mg) in comparison to placebo transdermal system and
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen in subjects with chronic back pain. The double-blind treatment
      intervention duration is 56 days during which time supplemental analgesic medication
      (ibuprofen) will be provided to all subjects in addition to study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic with over twenty-five years of international
      clinical experience indicating it to be safe and effective in a variety of therapeutic
      situations for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Transdermal systems may offer
      advantages over currently indicated oral products including ease and convenience of use,
      improved compliance, possible reduction in patient care, and prolonged and consistent
      delivery of drug.
