  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of subcutaneously administered Xolair as add-on therapy for the
      treatment of subjects aged 12-75 years old diagnosed with moderate to severe asthma who are
      inadequately controlled with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)+ long-acting
      beta-agonists (LABA) with or without additional controller therapy.

    <measure>Rate of Asthma Exacerbations Over the 48 Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A protocol-defined asthma exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids for 3 or more days; for patients receiving long-term oral corticosteroids, an exacerbation was a 20 mg or more increase in average daily dose of oral prednisone (or a similar dose of another systemic corticosteroid). The rate of protocol-defined asthma exacerbations, normalized by subject-time at risk and computed over the 48 week treatment period in each treatment group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Asthma Symptom Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 48 in Total Asthma Symptom Score (TASS), which included a nocturnal asthma score (0 to 4 scale), morning asthma symptoms (yes or no), and a daytime asthma symptom score (0 to 4 scale, total score range 0 to 9, higher TASS scores represent worse symptoms; breathlessness, tightness in chest, wheezing and cough. Score achieved by week 48 minus baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Puffs Per Day of Beta Agonist Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 48 in mean puffs per day of albuterol. Puffs per day was achieved by week 48 minus baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Asthma-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 48 in overall asthma-specific health-related quality of life, as measured by the standardized version of the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ[S]) score. The AQLQ(S) consists of 4 domains (activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli), with a total of 32 items; the overall score is the mean of these 32 items on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 = severe impairment, 7 = no impairment). Overall outcome achieved by mean visit minus baseline.</description>

        <description>A protocol-defined asthma exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids for 3 or more days; for patients receiving long-term oral corticosteroids, an exacerbation was a 20 mg or more increase in average daily dose of oral prednisone (or a similar dose of another systemic corticosteroid).
