  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been an increased interest in the association between ADHD and sleep disorders over
      the past years. A high incidence of sleep disturbance, ranging from 10% to 70%, has been
      identified in ADHD children regardless of whether or not they are receiving stimulant
      therapy. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of zolpidem in children with ADHD
      associated insomnia.

      The study is being conducted in the United States. It consists of 3 segments:

        -  Segment A: 2 to 21 day screening period

        -  Segment B: 8-week double-blind treatment period

        -  Segment C: 1-week follow-up period

      Subjects will have a polysomnography in a sleep lab two times during the study (at baseline
      and between visit 4-5) and also be required to wear an actigraphy monitoring tool. There will
      be several questionnaires completed throughout the study: CGI-child, CGI-parent/legal
      guardian, ADHD Rating Scale-IV, and the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale.

          -  Complaint of childhood insomnia as defined by repeated difficulty with sleep
             initiation or consolidation that occurs despite adequate age, appropriate time, and
             opportunity for sleep

          -  The sleep disturbance must not be attributable to either the direct physiologic effect
             of drug abuse or misuse of a prescribed medication.

          -  Subjects should be stabilized on all long-term therapy, including treatment of ADHD,
             for at least one month prior to study entry.

          -  Subjects, if females of childbearing potential (as determined by the initiation of
             menses), must have confirmed negative pregnancy test prior to randomization and be
             using a recognized effective method of birth control (oral, implant, depot or
             transdermal oestroprogestatives, intrauterine device, double-barrier with spermicide).

             interview and DSM-IV-TR criteria

          -  Current history of substance abuse/dependence

          -  Known hypersensitivity to zolpidem or previous adverse experience with zolpidem
