  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical study will assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Sanofi
      Pasteur's DTaP-IPV combined vaccines as a three-dose primary vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months
      of age compared to commercially available vaccines in order to meet the requirements for
      registration of the product in South Korea.

      Primary objective To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates
      (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/vaccine response rates to
      Pertussis antigens (PT, FHA) of Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV combined vaccine versus
      commercially available Biken's DTaP (CJ purified PDT vaccine ™) and Aventis Pasteur's IPV
      (IMOVAX POLIO) monovalent vaccines, one month after the three-dose primary vaccination.

      Secondary objectives

        1. Immunogenicity: To assess the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection rates
           (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion / vaccine response
           rates to Pertussis antigens (PT, FHA) of Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV combined vaccine
           versus historical reference (Study E2I03294 - France). To assess and describe the
           immunogenicity of the study vaccines in both groups.

        2. Safety: To assess and describe the safety of the study vaccines after each dose.
