  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 stably adjusted to diet long-term intake of
      aqueous-ethanolic extract from Hintonia latiflora over more than 12 months leads to a
      statstically significant amelioration of parameters of glycaemic control (HbA1c, postprandial
      and fasting glucose) not acchievable with diet alone.

      As safety parameters, liver function tests and cardiovascular parameters are to be monitored.
      Adverse events are to be monitored.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the long term effects of an aqueous-ethanolic extract from the bark of Hintonia
      latiflora (1:4.5, extraction medium 32% ethanol) in mild to moderate cases of type II
      diabetes, especially on parameters of glycaemic control and safety.

      Research Design and Methods:

      The trial was carried out as a controlled single-centre open study. 30 patients stably
      adjusted to diet were treated with the study medication (3 x 2 ml/day before meals) for up to
      36 months. Efficacy parameters were HbA1c and fasting and postprandial serum glucose. As
      parameters for safety, liver function tests, cardiac functions and adverse events were
      assessed.

      Results:

      All three efficacy parameters improved significantly, and the parameters of glycaemic control
      remained stable for the study duration of 36 months. As compared to baseline, after 6 months
      and 18 months of therapy mean fasting glucose was reduced by 23.9 and 21.9 % (1.8 mmol and
      2.0 mmol in absolute values). Mean postprandial glucose was reduced by 24.4 and 16.5 % (2.4
      and 2.0 mmol in absolute values), and the mean HbA1c was decreased by 10.4 and 12.4 % (0.76
      and 1.04% in absolute figures). Improvement was maintained after 18 months. Tolerability was
      excellent. No hypoglycaemic reactions occurred. No adverse effects or change in cardiac and
      liver function tests were observed. There was a tendency towards decreasing triglyceride and
      total cholesterol levels.
