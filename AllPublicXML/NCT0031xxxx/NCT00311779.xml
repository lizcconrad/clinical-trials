      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of different
      strengths of Spinosad topical creme, as compared to a vehicle control, in subjects who have
      been infested with at least a mild case of Pediculosis capitis (head lice).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are millions of children and adults affected with head lice each year in the United
      States. It has become a major nuisance in school children resulting in many lost school days
      and frustrated parents. Lice and nit (ova) resistance to current OTC products has been
      reported. Compliance with product instructions is thought to be low. Therefore a safe and
      effective alternative to these products is desirable.

      Spinosad and its formulations have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency as
      crop protection products in the US, Canada and Australia, and has received provisional
      approval in the UK, Spain and several other European Union countries.

      Spinosad is being formulated as a creme rinse using excipients that are widely used and are
      &quot;generally regarded as safe&quot; (GRAS).

      This study is intended to show the safety and efficacy of Spinosad 0.5% and 1.0%, as compared
      to the vehicle control in subjects 2 years of age and older with at least a mild infestation
      of pediculosis capitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must have head lice infestation of at least a mild severity present at
             baseline of at least 3 live lice and the presence of nits;

          2. Subject can be either male or female, 2 years or older

          3. Subject must be in good general health, based on medical history.

          5. The parent or guardian of a child subject must be willing to allow other household
             members to be screened for head lice. If other household members are found to have a
             head lice infestation, they should also be enrolled in the study. If other household
             members are not willing to enroll in the study or do not qualify for enrollment, they
             must be willing to use the standard course of OTC lice treatment at home.

          6. Subjects must agree to not use any other form of lice treatment during the course of
             the study. Subjects must also agree not to use a lice comb during the course of the
             study.

          7. Subjects must agree not to cut or chemically treat their hair in the period between
             the Baseline treatment and the Day 14 visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals with history of irritation or sensitivity to pediculicides or hair care
             products.

          2. Individuals with any visible skin/scalp condition at the treatment site which, in the
             opinion of the investigative personnel, will interfere with the evaluation.

          3. Individuals previously treated with a pediculicide within the 4 weeks prior to the
             study.

          4. Individuals who have used hair dyes, bleaches, permanent wave or relaxing solutions
             within the past 2 weeks or during the study.

             compromise the objective of the protocol.

          6. Individuals receiving systemic or topical drugs or medications, including systemic
             antibiotics, which in the opinion of the investigative personnel may interfere with
             the study results.

          7. Individuals who have participated in a clinical trial within the past 30 days.

          8. Individuals who, in the opinion of the investigator, do not understand the subject
             requirements for study participation and/or may be likely to exhibit poor compliance.

          9. Individuals with family members who are infested with lice but are unwilling or unable
             to enroll in the study or to ouse the standard course of lice treatment.
