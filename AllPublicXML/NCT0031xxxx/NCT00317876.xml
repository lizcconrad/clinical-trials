      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, before a donor bone
      marrow transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal cells. It also stops the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's bone marrow. The donated bone marrow stem cells may replace
      the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining abnormal cells. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving cyclosporine and methotrexate before or after transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cyclophosphamide in
      treating patients who are undergoing a donor bone marrow transplant for Fanconi's anemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Decrease the conditioning-related toxicity of cyclophosphamide without decreasing the
           engraftment rate to &lt; 90% in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
           for Fanconi's anemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-finding study of cyclophosphamide.

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -5
           to -2.

      Cohorts of 5-10 patients receive decreasing doses of cyclophosphamide until the optimal dose
      (OD) is determined. The OD is defined as the dose at which ≥ 4 of 5 patients achieve
      engraftment and &lt; 1 of 10 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT): Patients undergo allogeneic BMT on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine orally or IV
           twice daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 49, followed by a taper on days
           50-180 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6,
           and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
