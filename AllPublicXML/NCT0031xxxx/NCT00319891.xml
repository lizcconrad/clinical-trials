  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of computer-based training
      program (&quot;HiFi-AD&quot;) on the memory and cognitive abilities of individuals diagnosed with mild
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which computer-based cognitive
      remediation improves cognitive functions using standardized neuropsychological assessments
      relevant to AD; 2) the acceptability and feasibility of using computer-based cognitive
      remediation in an AD population.
