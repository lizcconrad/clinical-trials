  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that it may be possible to grow new blood vessels
      (angiogenesis) to supply the heart muscle that is currently not getting enough blood. One
      theory is that a certain type of stem cell, aldehyde dehydrogenase bright stem cells, may
      stimulate the growth of new vessels. After a bone marrow procedure, the special cells are
      separated and then injected back into the heart around the area of damage with a special
      guidance and injection system.

      Once a patient meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, he/she will be
      consented to the study and extensive baseline testing will be completed at St. Luke's
      Episcopal Hospital in Houston, Texas. Once all baseline criteria are met, the patient has
      his/her own bone marrow harvested and later injected, if randomized to receive active
      treatment. The day after the bone marrow harvest, the patient is taken to the cardiac
      catheterization lab where NOGA mapping is performed and the processed cells or placebo are
      injected under electromechanical guidance into the affected areas of the left ventricle. The
      patient is usually discharged home the next day and returns for follow-up at weeks 1 and 4,
      and months 3 and 6, and at one year unless there is a crossover and then he/she begins
      baseline again at 6 months and follow-up for one more year. Follow-up testing, including
      quality of life and NOGA mapping, is done at the time of injection, as well as at 6 months.

      This is a phase I, double blind trial to evaluate the use of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase-Bright
      (ALDHbr) in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. The study hypothesis is that transendocardial
      injections of autologous bone marrow cells in patients with end-stage ischemic heart disease
      is safe, can provide neovascularization, and can improve perfusion and myocardial
      contractility. The primary object of this study is to assess the safety of the ALDHbr cell
      injections. The efficacy will be based upon treadmill MVO2. A maximum of 60 patients will be
      enrolled in the study. At the end of 6 months, after the required testing has been completed,
      the patients will be told whether they were in the control group or not. The patients in the
      control group will be given the option to crossover and actually receive stem cell injection.
      At the time of crossover, which then becomes the baseline, patients will begin the follow-up
      with all testing including clinic visits for one year for a total of 18 months follow-up.

    <measure>Echocardiography Wall Motion Score Index (WMSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical and functional assessment in endstage ischemic cardiomyopathy patients using Echocardiography Wall Motion Score Index (WMSI) as defined by the American Heart Association which allows detection of abnormalities in the heart wall or blood flowing through the heart. Using this model, the left ventricle is divided into 17 segments. Normal contracting Left Ventricle has WMSI of 1. Larger WMSI indicates higher degree of abnormalities (2 for hypokinetic, 3 for akinetic, 4 for dyskinetic, and 5 for aneurysmal). WMSI was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the total number of segments.</description>

    <measure>Total Severity Score (Stress)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the stress test, cardiac SPECT polar mapping (gated dual-isotope) is used to evaluate perfusion, compared against a database with a statistically significant number of polar maps of healthy hearts based on gender, data acquisition method, stress vs rest and type of data (i.e. perfusion, wall motion or wall thickening) using a clinically validated software package (J Nucl Med Technol 2006; 34:3-17). The basal and mid-ventricle heart wall is mapped by cylindrical sampling and apex mapped by spheric, cylindric and radial sampling.
Total severity score during stress is the sum of blackout pixels in the blackout polar map of myocardial perfusion during stress using cardiac SPECT imaging (adding scores in different views), weighted by the number of SDs below the mean.
Total severity score varies from 0 (normal) to several thousands although the upper limit is not well defined. A score greater than 1000 indicates poor perfusion.</description>

    <measure>Total Severity Score (Rest)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the total severity score at rest, cardiac SPECT polar mapping (gated dual-isotope) is used to evaluate myocardial cardiac perfusion, compared against a database with a statistically significant number of polar maps of healthy hearts and compared based on gender, data acquisition method, stress vs rest and type of data (i.e. perfusion, wall motion or wall thickening) using a clinically validated software package (J Nucl Med Technol 2006; 34:3-17). The basal and mid-ventricle heart wall is mapped by cylindrical sampling and apex mapped by spheric, cylindric and radial sampling at rest.
Total severity score at rest is the sum of blackout pixels in the rest blackout polar map of myocardial perfusion cardiac SPECT imaging (adding scores in different views), weighted by the number of SDs below the mean.
Total severity score varies from 0 (normal) to several thousands although the upper limit is not well defined. A score greater than 1000 indicates poor perfusion.</description>

    <description>For the severity test, cardiac SPECT polar mapping (gated dual-isotope) is used to evaluate myocardial cardiac perfusion, compared against a database with a statistically significant number of polar maps of healthy hearts and compared based on gender, data acquisition method, stress vs rest and type of data (i.e. perfusion, wall motion or wall thickening) using clinically validated software package (J Nucl Med Technol 2006; 34:3-17). The basal and mid-ventricle heart wall is mapped by cylindrical sampling and apex mapped by spheric, cylindric and radial sampling at rest/stress.
Total severity score is the sum of blackout pixels in rest/stress blackout polar map of myocardial perfusion cardiac SPECT imaging (adding scores in different views), weighted by number of SDs below mean. Total severity score reversible is total severity scores at rest subtracted from those during stress. The severity score varies from 0 (normal) to &gt; 1000 (poor perfusion) but upper limit is not well defined.</description>

        <description>Clinical and functional assessment in endstage ischemic cardiomyopathy patients using Echocardiography Wall Motion Score Index (WMSI) as defined by the American Heart Association which allows detection of abnormalities in the heart wall or blood flowing through the heart. Using this model, the left ventricle is divided into 17 segments. Normal contracting Left Ventricle has WMSI of 1. Larger WMSI indicates higher degree of abnormalities (2 for hypokinetic, 3 for akinetic, 4 for dyskinetic, and 5 for aneurysmal). WMSI was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the total number of segments.</description>

          <description>Clinical and functional assessment in endstage ischemic cardiomyopathy patients using Echocardiography measures ejection fraction(EF)as a percentage(%) of blood leaving the heart with each beat or contraction. It can provide information concerning structural characteristics and blood flow in the heart and blood vessels. A normal heart pumps 50-75% of the blood with each contraction.</description>

        <title>Total Severity Score (Stress)</title>
        <description>For the stress test, cardiac SPECT polar mapping (gated dual-isotope) is used to evaluate perfusion, compared against a database with a statistically significant number of polar maps of healthy hearts based on gender, data acquisition method, stress vs rest and type of data (i.e. perfusion, wall motion or wall thickening) using a clinically validated software package (J Nucl Med Technol 2006; 34:3–17). The basal and mid-ventricle heart wall is mapped by cylindrical sampling and apex mapped by spheric, cylindric and radial sampling.
Total severity score during stress is the sum of blackout pixels in the blackout polar map of myocardial perfusion during stress using cardiac SPECT imaging (adding scores in different views), weighted by the number of SDs below the mean.
Total severity score varies from 0 (normal) to several thousands although the upper limit is not well defined. A score greater than 1000 indicates poor perfusion.</description>
