      Objectives: To assess the efficacy of an intervention program targeted to the elderly with
      recent-onset disability of musculoskeletal origin (DIMS), and to perform its economic
      evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methodology: 1) Controlled randomised intervention study (3 years). Subjects: persons older
      than 65 in health district 7 of Madrid with acute (&lt; 3 months) DIMS. Intervention group
      patients will be attended by rheumatologists acording with clinical (diagnostic and
      therapeutical) protocols. Control group will receive the routine attention from the Health
      System. Efficacy and costs variables will be collected through monthly structured telephone
      interviews performed by independent personnel blinded to the intervention group. Efficacy
      will be measured by differences between groups regarding: 1) time to improvement in the
      baseline DIMS episode, 2) number of subsequent DIMS, and 3) total number of DIMS days. An
      economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective.

    <description>Early Intervention Programa (IG): Patients assigned to the intervention group after the randomization were offered an immediate appointment. Patients, who voluntarily accepted, were attended by 2 rheumatologists. The rheumatologists acted as principal care providers in regular visits, home visits and phone contacts. The visits were structured following specific proceedings for the different diagnoses based on previously demonstrated approaches. Such protocols included education and promotion of independence, pharmacological and no pharmacological treatment, and timing of diagnostic tests in a stepwise manner. The program also incorporated administrative duties such as the prescription of medication for the patients. Patients were seen as often as necessary according to the medical rheumatologist decision (until the episode of disability was medically resolved).</description>
