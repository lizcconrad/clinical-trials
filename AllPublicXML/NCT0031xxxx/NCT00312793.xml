  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Myospare, a non-invasive
      device, which is connected to the body via electrodes placed in the injured leg. The
      electrodes which are placed in the middle or upper thigh will stimulate the quadriceps
      muscle.

      Myospare will be installed 1 day after the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
      surgery and will be removed after 6 weeks of treatment. The patients will be assigned to two
      groups:

        1. Physiotherapy plus Myospare

        2. Only physiotherapy

      The hypothesis of the study is that electrical stimulation combined with voluntary exercise
      is more effective than voluntary exercise alone.
