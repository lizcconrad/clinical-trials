      The purpose of this study is to evaluate ischemic events and neuropsychological changes after
      carotid artery angioplasty and stenting with a neuroprotection device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third most common cause of death in North America with approximately 750,000
      new strokes reported annually, of which 150,000 are fatal. Approximately 75% of strokes occur
      in the distribution of the carotid arteries. Among those, a thrombotic etiology (carotid
      occlusive disease) is one of the most common causes. Recently published studies have shown
      that patients who underwent carotid stenting in combination with a cerebral protection device
      had better overall outcomes as related to stroke, death and MI as opposed to carotid
      endarterectomy. What is not known is whether protection devices which allow some particles
      (100 micron particle size or less) to pass through the filter or particles that embolize
      during placement or removal of the protection device, will have any delayed abnormal outcomes
      as determined by neuropsychological testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than 18 and less than 90

          -  Symptomatic as evidenced by transient ischemic attack or non-disabling stroke in the
             hemisphere supplied by the target vessel within 180 days of procedure. Must have
             anatomic stenosis greater than 70% by ultrasound or angiography performed in previous
             30 days

          -  Asymptomatic patients with a stenosis greater than 80% by ultrasound or angiography
             performed in previous 30 days

          -  Patient has no childbearing potential or has negative pregnancy tests within one week
             prior to procedure.

          -  Patient and patient's physician agree to have the patient return for all the required
             clinical contacts following study enrollment
