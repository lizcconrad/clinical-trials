  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well the vaccine is tolerated at sites where
      administrations are given and any effects it may have on subjects' wellbeing. The study will
      also test the ability of vaccine to cause particular immune responses in the body.

    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is a serious public health problem, with up to
      20% of the US population infected. Following primary infection, HSV-2 establishes a latent
      infection that can lead to recurrent disease when the virus reactivates. Genital lesions are
      often experienced with viral recurrence and these can be uncomfortable and painful, resulting
      in significant anxiety and social distress. There are no commercial vaccines available for
      therapy of HSV-2 infection.The aim of a therapeutic vaccine would be to enhance such natural
      responses by boosting the appropriate cellular immune response to HSV-2 in those latently
      infected individuals who experience frequent and unwanted reactivations. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of a therapeutic DNA vaccine
      (pPJV7630) in combination with a DNA encoded immunostimulator (pPJV2012) when administered by
      Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED)
