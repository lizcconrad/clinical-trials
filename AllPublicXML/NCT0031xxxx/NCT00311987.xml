      The natural thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are known to have a
      cholesterol-lowering effect. Their pharmacologic use for this purpose is limited, however, by
      their actions on other organs, including the heart, bone, and brain, where there can be side
      effects of excessive thyroid hormone action. 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is a
      thyroid hormone analog with relative selectivity for a form of the thyroid hormone receptor
      expressed in the liver, where it regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism, including the
      clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

      This study is designed to determine whether DITPA is safe and effective in achieving LDL
      cholesterol levels that are consistent with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
      Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines in patients who have not achieved those levels
      on conventional therapy, due to drug-resistant disease, drug intolerance, or both.

      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a
      4-week Pre-Randomization Phase with dietary counseling and a 2-week placebo run-in, eligible
      patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive DITPA (90 mg/day, 180 mg/day), or placebo for
      a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.

      Sixty (60) patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (i.e., 20
      patients per treatment group):

        -  DITPA at 90 mg/day (45 mg twice a day [BID] taken orally)

        -  DITPA at 180 mg/day (90 mg BID taken orally)

        -  Placebo (BID taken orally)

      Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 90 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first
      2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for 10 weeks.

      Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 180 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first
      2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for the next 2 weeks, and then 180 mg/day for 8 weeks.

      INTRODUCTION

      BACKGROUND: In recent years, the need to achieve increasingly ambitious therapeutic goals for
      dyslipidemias has prompted the search for more potent pharmacological agents to lower
      circulating atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations and enhance reverse cholesterol transport
      (RCT). While mounting evidence supports the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
      reductase inhibitors (or statins) as the main stay of therapy for patients requiring lipid
      modification therapy, many patients remain under-treated or do not achieve the National
      Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended goals.1-5 Recognizing new and emerging data,
      NCEP III recently updated its guidelines to recognize the potential of a more aggressive low
      density lipoprotein (LDL) goal of &lt;70 mg/dl in patients at high risk of cardiovascular
      events.3 The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study showed that even in patients with stable
      coronary artery disease, a goal that is lower than currently recommended, &lt;80 mg/dl, may be
      desirable in further reducing and/or preventing recurrent cardiovascular events.6 More than
      40% of all Americans have LDL levels of 130 mg/dl or higher, and 13 million Americans have
      coronary artery disease that may benefit from lipid modification therapy. In these
      individuals, to achieve the optimal LDL goal and to treat other associated lipid
      abnormalities, including low HDL cholesterol and/or high triglycerides, many patients will
      likely require combination therapy.3, 7-13 Among the novel therapeutic agents investigated
      have been selective thyroid hormone analogues. Such agents hold the promise of harnessing the
      cholesterol-lowering properties of the naturally occurring thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine
      (T3) and thyroxine (T4), but with greater receptor isoform and tissue specificity that should
      result in an improved safety profile.14, 15 Unlike statins, thyroid hormones and their
      analogues, in addition to cholesterol and LDL-lowering effects, may favorably lower
      lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and triglyceride levels.15-22 Also, because of potential thyroid
      hormone-mediated genomic and non-genomic effects on the heart, certain populations, such as
      those with congestive heart failure, may derive dual benefits from use of such thyromimetic
      treatment.15, 22, 23 1.1.1 Effects of Thyroid Hormone on Lipid Metabolism Dyslipidemia has
      long been associated with disorders of thyroid metabolism (i.e., hypothyroidism) and to be
      potentially reversible by thyroid hormone therapy.17, 18, 21 Early autopsy series
      demonstrated more severe atherosclerosis in individuals with premorbid hypothyroidism.24, 25
      In studies of how thyroid hormone status affected radiolabeled lipoprotein kinetics, LDL was
      found to be cleared less rapidly in hypothyroid animals and man.26 Subsequently, hepatic LDL
      receptor number27 and mRNA expression28 were shown to be lower in hypothyroid animals. More
      recently, characterization of the LDL receptor gene promoter has revealed the presence of
      functionally important T3 regulatory elements.29 In addition to lowering total and LDL
      cholesterol concentrations in treated hypothyroid patients, thyroid hormone therapy has been
      shown in some studies to have a favorable impact on particularly atherogenic lipoproteins,
      including Lp(a)30 and small dense and oxidizable LDL subfractions.31, 32 Finally, thyroid
      hormone replacement therapy has been shown to decrease apoB100 lipoprotein synthesis with a
      resulting decrease in Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) production and hepatic triglyceride
      production.33 There is now also considerable evidence that thyroid hormone receptor agonists
      can directly or indirectly affect reverse cholesterol transport, the process by which
      cholesterol is transported from peripheral cells, including cholesterol-laden endothelial
      cells in the initial stage of atherosclerosis, to the liver for conversion to bile acids.
      First, thyroid hormone affects the activity of apoA 1 lipoprotein,34 which plays several
      critical roles in RCT-generating HDL that transports cholesterol from peripheral tissues to
      the liver, as both the principal protein constituent of HDL and an activator of
      lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which esterifies cholesterol on the surface of
      pre-β-HDL. ApoA-I also stabilizes and increases the level of ATP-binding cassette A1 protein
      (ABCA1), which, in turn, promotes efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to nascent
      HDL-particles. Thyroid hormone increases apoA-I gene expression in liver and intestine, in
      part through a 5' flanking thyroid hormone response element.35, 36 Thyroid hormone has also
      recently been shown to increased the scavenger class B type I receptor (SR-BI), another
      regulator of serum HDL concentrations and cholesterol flux, in livers of mice treated with
      either T3 or GC-1 (a thyroid hormone receptor modulator).37 Finally, thyroid hormones are
      also known to increase activity of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP-7A1)38 which catalyzes the
      rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis; in contrast, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the
      opposite effect. This thyroid hormone-induced increase in CYP-7A1 would be expected to
      increase bile acid and cholesterol excretion, as has been observed in hyperthyroidism.39
      1.1.2 Previous Clinical Research Previous studies have investigated the therapeutic potential
      of thyromimetic compounds in lipid modification and heart failure.14,15,40 Early clinical
      investigation focused on dextrothyroxine (D-T4), a D-isomer of thyroxine, which was thought
      to have similar actions, but produce less tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption.40,
      41 Although DT4 was commonly used as a cholesterol lowering drug in the 1970s,42 it is no
      longer used in clinical practice. The therapeutic effects of DT4 were evaluated in the
      Coronary Drug Project (CDP).

      The Coronary Drug Project was initiated in 1965, primarily to answer the prevailing question
      about the safety and efficacy of long term use of various cholesterol lowering agents in
      patients with coronary artery disease. The Coronary Drug Project was a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted between 1966 and 1975. It was designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of five lipid-modifying drugs in 8,341 men, with a history
      of prior myocardial infarction (MI). Niacin, clofibrate, dextrothyroxine, and two estrogen
      regimens were evaluated in the study along with a placebo arm.43, 44 DT4 was administered at
      6.0 mg /day. The primary endpoint was overall mortality at 5 years. After a mean follow-up of
      36 months, because of a nonsignificant trend toward higher mortality in the DT4 arm compared
      with placebo, the DT4 arm was discontinued.

      As acknowledged by the original investigators, the observed DT4-placebo difference in overall
      mortality is not statistically significant as judged by the statistical methods utilized in
      this study.44 Nevertheless, given the mortality trend and the low probability of eventual
      benefits, a decision was made to discontinue the DT4 arm. In discontinuing the DT4 arm, the
      study leadership recognized that the findings of the CDP left open the possibility that
      dextrothyroxine may be efficacious for a limited group of carefully selected myocardial
      infarction (MI) patients and for persons free of clinical CHD. 44 The net effect of DT4 on
      serum lipids (the observed fall corrected for the concomitant rise for the placebo group) was
      a sustained significant fall from baseline levels. The decrease was approximately 12% in
      serum cholesterol levels and 15-20% in fasting serum triglyceride levels.44 Following the
      study, it was revealed that the DT4 dispensed in the study contained less than 0.5% of
      levothyroxine (approximately 30 µg of levothyroxine).44 Interestingly, it was later found
      that contamination of levothyroxine commercial preparations varied from lot to lot (from 0.5%
      to 2.3%).45 Also, this &quot;DT4&quot; formulation had other significant thyromimetic effects, leading
      to TSH suppression that may have become clinically relevant with prolonged use.47 Suboptimal
      dosing and thyrotoxic effects due to drug contamination may explain why more than 40% of the
      DT4 patients required a dose reduction.44 1.1.3 DITPA DITPA (3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid)
      is an analogue of naturally occurring thyroid hormone (T3) that has been specifically
      designed to improve cardiac performance with a lower potential for tachycardia.22, 40, 46
      DITPA binds to the same thyroid hormone receptors α and β as T3 but with less affinity.41 In
      pre-clinical animal post-infarction models, DITPA improved calcium handling, promoted
      angiogenesis, and attenuated abnormal left ventricular remodeling.47-53 In a rat model of
      CHF, DITPA demonstrated increased cardiac output with increases in left ventricular dp/dt,
      comparable to effects seen with T4, but with significantly less tachycardia. In addition,
      there were increases in α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) RNA gene expression induced by DITPA
      treatment.41 When evaluated in combination with captopril, DITPA improved both cardiac output
      and dp/dt as well as increased the rate of LV relaxation when compared with captopril
      alone.54 In a rabbit post-infarction model, DITPA decreased left ventricular end diastolic
      pressure and increased positive and negative dp/dt without changes in heart rate or left
      ventricular systolic pressure.43 In the same model, use of DITPA prevented abnormal SERCA
      transport and abnormal contractile function associated with myocardial infarction.42, 44
      Recently DITPA was also noted to improve endothelial function following myocardial
      infarction, an action mediated through nitric oxide.55 The objective of the present study is
      to evaluate the feasibility of DITPA, a thyroid hormone analogue, as a potential lipid
      modification agent.

      KNOWN AND POTENTIAL TOXICITIES: Since DITPA is a thyroid hormone analogue with thyromimetic
      actions, safety and side effect profiles may be similar to those observed with thyroid
      hormones T3 and T4 preparations (e.g., liothyronine and levothyroxine). Although excess
      thyromimetic action is a theoretical side effect, it is also possible that tissue-specific
      hypothyroidism might result if the drug fails to have sufficient thyromimetic activity in a
      particular tissue. Due to pituitary effects of DITPA, a secondary lowering of TSH may result,
      which in turn may lead to decreased endogenous production of T4. The potential effects of
      such theoretical biochemical changes are unknown. Thus, DITPA safety will be diligently
      monitored throughout the study through multiple examinations, symptom scales, and laboratory
      evaluations.

      Based on the known effects of thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, and the side effects of T3
      and T4 preparations, potential side effects of DITPA may include:

        1. Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood
           pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest

        2. Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability,
           emotional lability, insomnia

        3. Dermatologic: hair loss, warm moist or dry skin, flushing

        4. Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density, gynecomastia

        5. Gastrointestinal: diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in
           liver function tests

        6. General symptoms: fatigue, increased appetite, excessive sweating

        7. Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, proximal myopathy

        8. Respiratory: dyspnea

        9. Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility

       10. Metabolic: weight loss or gain, heat or cold temperature intolerance, fever Please
           consult the most recent DITPA Investigator's Brochure (IB) including amendments for
           additional information.

      In addition, many drugs are known to affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism
      by altering absorption, synthesis, secretion, protein binding, and/or target tissue response,
      and may also alter the therapeutic response to thyroid hormone preparations such as
      levothyroxine. In addition, thyroid hormones and thyroid status may have varied effects on
      the pharmacokinetics and actions of other drugs. A list of drug-thyroidal axis interactions
      is provided in the prescribing information for marketed agents such as Synthroid®
      (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP), Abbott Laboratories and Cytomel® (liothyronine sodium
      tablets), King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

           UNSCHEDULED VISITS: Study patients should be evaluated and managed following best
           medical practice with particular attention paid to patient safety, assessment of
           potential treatment-related adverse events, and changes in clinical status.

           EVALUATIONS: Study patients will be closely monitored throughout the study for safety
           and clinical response. The results of all safety and efficacy evaluations must be
           recorded in the CRF and in the source documents.

           DESCRIPTION OF EVALUATIONS AND STUDY-SPECIFIC PROCEDURES

           Informed Consent: Patients must give written informed consent, after the nature of the
           study has been fully explained, in order to participate in this study. No study-specific
           procedures may be performed before written informed consent is obtained.

           Randomization of Patients: Patients who sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF), complete
           all screening evaluations, pre-randomization (qualification) evaluations, and meet all
           entry criteria, will be eligible for randomization, and enrollment into the study.
           Randomization should occur within 2 days prior to study drug administration. All
           patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups in order to
           reduce selection bias. All randomization will be managed centrally, by the GCRC.

           Medical and Medication History: A complete record of the patient's medical history,
           other medical conditions, and concomitant medications (including current lipid
           modification agents) will be obtained and recorded in the medical chart and CRF.

           Physical Examination, Vital Signs, and Weight: Patients will be seen by an Investigator
           for a complete physical examination, vital signs (temperature, systolic and diastolic
           blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate), waist measurement and weight. Height will
           be measured at baseline only. The eye examination, including a funduscopic exam and
           measurement of visual acuity, will be conducted at the Baseline Visit and End of
           Treatment Visit only.

           Thyroid Symptom Assessment: Three clinical symptom scales (Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale,60
           Modified Billewicz Index for Hypothyroidism,61, 62 and the Hypothyroid Symptom Scale)
           will be used to assess and document potential thyroid-related symptoms. See attachment B
           for details. The hypothyroid scale is a patient self-assessment and will be completed by
           the patient at the beginning of the visit. The hyperthyroid scale and modified Billewicz
           will be completed by the Investigator or designee. The same scales are currently in use
           in the ongoing DITPA studies.

           Echocardiogram: An echocardiogram will be performed at Baseline and Visit 8/End of
           Treatment Visit for safety monitoring. The echocardiograms will be interpreted by a
           designated study cardiologist for safety and efficacy, in a blinded fashion.

           Electrocardiogram (ECG): An electrocardiogram should be performed at the specified
           visits.

           DEXA Scan: Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, or DEXA scanning, will be used to measure
           bone mineral density and body fat composition.

           Laboratory Evaluations:

           The following laboratory testing will be performed according to the schedule in Appendix
           A:

           Hematology Hemoglobin, Hemoglobin A1C, Hematocrit, RBC, MCV, MCH, RBC Morphology, WBC

           concentrations* Trough steady state levels of DITPA * Testing of samples for these
           parameters may be performed at a later time, following initial efficacy analysis

           Fasting: Patients will be instructed to fast at least 12 hours prior to Visits 1, 2, 3,
           5, 6, 8, and 9 for the fasting lipid panel blood draws.

           Blood draws for DITPA concentrations: Blood for DITPA concentrations will be drawn at
           least 6 hours after the preceding dose of study drug. It is recommended that if the
           patient has a morning appointment, the patient should not take the morning dose until
           after the blood draw. If the patient has an afternoon appointment, the patient should
           take the morning dose as usual. The time of the preceding dose should be recorded in
           source documents and the CRF.
