  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to find a correlation between MRI and ICD therapy in patients with
      known cardiomyopathies, aiming to determine if cardiac scarring identified by MRI correlates
      with ventricular arrhythmias and the occurrence of ICD therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study over a 3 year period of 50 patients with known cardiomyopathy
      and LVEF of 35% or less who will have ICD implantation as part of their standard of care. All
      subjects will undergo a contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI using gadolinium to determine the
      morphological characteristics of their left ventricle prior to ICD implant. Subjects will not
      be offered sedation to minimize risk, thus those suffering from claustrophobia will be
      excluded or dropped from participation. MRI will be evaluated, and subjects will be followed
      during standard of care device interrogations for 12 months after implant.
