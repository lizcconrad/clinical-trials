  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, randomized, intervention trial (CRIT) with 20-40 year old overweight
      individuals (n = 320) across Europe in order to distinguish between biologically active
      components of seafood, i.e., seafood proteins and n-3 lipids, regarding their effects on risk
      factors for metabolic syndrome, bone health, and weight management.

      Subjects were recruited through advertisements from October 2004 until April 2005.
      Recruitment of 320 subjects (140 from Iceland, 120 from Spain, and 60 from Ireland). The
      inclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) 27.5 to 32.5 kg/m2, age 20-40 years, and a
      waist circumference of equal or more than 94 cm and 80 cm for men and women, respectively.
      Exclusion criteria were weight change due to weight loss diet within 3 months before the
      start of the study, use of supplements giving n-3 fatty acids, calcium or vitamin-D during
      the last three months, drug treatment of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or hyperlipidemia
      and women’s pregnancy or lactation. Each subject was instructed to follow a diet,
      energy-restricted by 30% from estimated energy expenditure (approximately 600 kcal/day), for
      8 consecutive weeks. The subjects were randomly assigned to four diets varying in types of
      dietary protein and amount of n-3 fatty acids (especially very long chain n-3 fatty acids):

      I: no seafood (control, including 6 placebo capsules/day)

      II: lean fish (150 g cod x 3/week)

      III: fatty fish (150 g salmon x 3/week)

      IV: fish-oil capsules (6 capsules/day)

      Risk factors for metabolic syndrome, bone health and weight management were analysed at
      baseline and endpoint.
