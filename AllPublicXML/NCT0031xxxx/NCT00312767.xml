  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Fabry disease have an alteration in their genetic material (DNA) which causes a
      deficiency of the a-galactosidase A enzyme. Fabrazyme is a drug that helps to breakdown and
      remove certain types of fatty substances called &quot;glycolipids.&quot; These glycolipids are normally
      present within the body in most cells. In Fabry disease, glycolipids build up in various
      tissues such as the liver, kidney, skin, and blood vessels because a-galactosidase A is not
      present, or is present in small quantities. The build up of glycolipid (globotriaosylceramide
      or GL-3) levels in these tissues in particular is thought to cause the clinical symptoms that
      are common to Fabry disease. This study is designed to verify that no loss of Fabrazyme
      occurs during simultaneous Fabrazyme infusion and hemodialysis in patients currently
      receiving Fabrazyme at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must provide signed, written informed consent prior to any study-related
             procedures being performed.

          -  Patient is between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Patient has documented Fabry disease.

          -  Patient has received bi-weekly 1 mg/kg infusions of Fabrazyme for at least 6 months
             prior to enrollment into the study.

          -  Patient has not experienced moderate or severe infusion-associated reactions (IARs)
             from Fabrazyme infusions, which were also associated with a rate reduction, within 3
             months prior to enrollment into the study.

          -  Patient has been receiving chronic hemodialysis for treatment of end-stage renal
             insufficiency for at least 3 months prior to enrollment into the study.

          -  Patient has good vascular access for hemodialysis.

          -  Patient has not and will not have any other (investigational) drug(s) infused during
             their hemodialysis, and is expected to have a stable concomitant medication regimen at
             all PK assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's hemoglobin is &lt; 9 g/100 mL at Screening/Baseline.

          -  Patient has a clinically significant organic disease or an unstable condition that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude participation in the study.

          -  Patient has a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating
             circumstance that would significantly decrease study compliance.

          -  Patient has participated in a study employing an investigational drug within 30 days
             prior to the start of their participation in this study.

          -  Patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.
