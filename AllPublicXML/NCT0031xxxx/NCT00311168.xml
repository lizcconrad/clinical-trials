      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the VIP™ feature (available in dual
      chamber Victory® devices) to reduce unnecessary RV pacing, and to determine if patients with
      implanted SJM pacemakers will benefit by using VIP™ rather than only a programmed AV/PV
      delay.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been implanted with dual chamber SJM Victory® device with VIP™ for 1 month
             (± 2 weeks).

          -  At the time of pacemaker implant, VIP™ is programmed &quot;OFF&quot;.

          -  At the time of enrollment, patient is paced in the RV ≤ 60% of the time.

          -  Patient is medically stable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has evidence of complete AV block, such that ventricular pacing would be
             required as part of the patient's routine management.

          -  Patient is indicated for AF Suppression.

          -  Patient has persistent or chronic atrial fibrillation.

          -  Patient is unable to comply with the follow-up visits due to geographical,
             psychological, or any other reasons.

          -  Patient is currently participating in another device research study.

          -  Patient is younger than 18 years of age.

          -  Patient is pregnant.

          -  Patients life expectancy is less than 12 months.
