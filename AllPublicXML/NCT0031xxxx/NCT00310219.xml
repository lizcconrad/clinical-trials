      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan and CT scan,
      may help doctors plan radiation therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a combined PET scan and CT scan works
      compared to a CT scan alone in planning radiation therapy for patients with stage II or stage
      III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the impact of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT fusion scan and CT scan
           alone, by comparing gross tumor volume (GTV) contours and three-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy treatment plans using 2 separate data sets (PET/CT fusion scan and CT scan
           only), in patients with stage II or III non-small cell lung cancer who are planning to
           undergo radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the impact of PET on GTV (cm^3), number of involved nodes, location of
           involved nodes, and dosimetric measures of normal tissue toxicity (mean lung dose, V20,
           and mean esophageal dose).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of elective nodal failures (nodal failures in regions that are not
           intentionally irradiated to definitive doses [i.e., ipsilateral hilum, mediastinum, or
           ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa]).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo a combined positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan. Patients also undergo
      a CT scan alone. A single three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) plan is generated
      from the combined PET/CT scan results. A single 3DCRT plan using the planning target volume
      is derived from the CT scan only.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
