  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia of a human
      monoclonal antibody that kills B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The trial will study the
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of the antibody given as a single agent and
      with vincristine.
