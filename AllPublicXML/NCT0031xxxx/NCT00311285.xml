  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgeons load during laparoscopic surgery is still unclear. Laparoscopic surgery is more
      demanding because of the challenge of operating through small scars in the abdominal wall
      without any tactile feedback depending only on the visual feedback on a monitor. The purpose
      is to establish a model of how to measure mental and physical load in laparoscopy.

      The surgeons load during laparoscopic surgery is still unclear. Laparoscopic surgery is more
      demanding because of the challenge of operating through small scars in the abdominal wall
      without any tactile feedback depending only on the visual feedback on a monitor. Most studies
      have been conducted in laboratory set-ups: Black Box.

      This study will establish a model of how to measure the biomechanical loads at muscular,
      joint and postural level, as well as measuring stress-hormone and cardiac rhythm. The study
      is a precursor of ergonomic studies performed inside the operating room. Advanced operating
      rooms designed specially for laparoscopy have been introduced in many departments. We do not
      know if they are more ergonomically correct. We will simulate laparoscopic tasks in an
      operating room. The hypothesis is that a traditional laparoscopic set-up is more demanding
      than a set-up mimicking an advanced operating room.
