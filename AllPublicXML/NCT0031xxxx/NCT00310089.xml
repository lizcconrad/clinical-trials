      RATIONALE: AZD2171 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving AZD2171
      together with combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed and may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well giving AZD2171 together with
      combination chemotherapy works in treating women with locally advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall pathologic complete response rate in women with previously
           untreated, locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant AZD2171, doxorubicin
           hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Compare changes in pretreatment levels of pKDR after 1 course of AZD2171 vs no
           medication.

        -  Determine the number of patients who respond to combination therapy beginning with the
           second course of therapy.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the changes in tumor proliferation (Ki67) in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate angiogenic parameters with tumor response in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor vascularity and permeability before and after treatment as seen on
           dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and initial area under the gadolinium curve.

        -  Determine tumor choline levels before and after treatment as measured by quantitative
           single-voxel MR spectroscopy and correlate with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-7* during course 1. During the
           second and subsequent courses, patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-21,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-5 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes, and
           docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-11 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Treatment repeats every 3
           weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      NOTE: *If biopsy cannot be scheduled prior to day 7 or 8 of course 1, AZD2171 alone can be
      continued for up to 14 days.

        -  Arm II (control): Beginning during the second course, patients receive AZD2171,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and G-CSF or pegfilgrastim as in
           arm I.

      All patients undergo tumor biopsiesat at baseline, before courses 2 and 4, and 3 weels after
      completion of study treatment. Tissue is examined for various biomarkers (phosphorylated-KDR,
      -MAPK, and -Akt, Ki67, VEGF, and p53) and for DNA ploidy analysis**.

      NOTE: **Patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and quantitative magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy 1 week before beginning therapy, 24 hours after starting therapy,
      prior to courses 2, 4, and 6, and 3 weeks after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of AZD2171 and chemotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
