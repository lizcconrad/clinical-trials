      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority, in terms of clinical and parasitological efficacy on
           D28 of administration of Coarsucam™ (artesunate+amodiaquine fixed-dose combination), as
           a single daily dose, in comparison with administration of Coartem®
           (artemether+lumefantrine).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare the 3 treatment groups in terms of:

        -  clinical and parasitological efficacy on D14 and D28 on the global population and on the
           subpopulation consisting of children aged under 5 years and that for patients aged 5
           years and over

        -  clinical and laboratory safety

        -  time to parasite clearance

        -  time to clearance of fever

        -  changes in gametocytaemia

        -  impact on anaemia
