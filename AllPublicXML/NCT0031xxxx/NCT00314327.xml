  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of long-acting risperidone for
      patients with first episode schizophrenia spectrum who did not improve sufficiently with the
      first antipsychotic medication they tried during their initial treatment trial.

    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed pilot study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of the
      long-acting injectable form of the second generation antipsychotic, risperidone, for the
      treatment of first episode patients who fail to respond to 12 weeks of treatment with an oral
      antipsychotic. The rationale for using this long-acting medication is that it eliminates
      covert non-adherence, which may be a factor in poor response. In addition, pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic differences between injectable and oral formulations may result in
      differences in treatment response favoring the injectable form. Subjects who have not
      responded sufficiently to treatment with an antipsychotic will be approached for the proposed
      long-acting risperidone trial. Risperidone treatment will be open label with titration based
      upon individual response (within FDA approved dose ranges). Treatment will begin with a phase
      of supplementation with oral risperidone. Subjects will stop their previous antipsychotic,
      start 2 mg of oral risperidone per day for one day and then increase the dose to 4 mg per
      day. Subjects who tolerate one week of oral risperidone will then begin injections of 25 mg
      long-acting risperidone every 2 weeks for a total of 12 weeks. If clinically indicated, the
      dose may be increased up to a maximum of 50 mg as per FDA guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current DSM-IV-defined diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
             schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder NOS as assessed using the Structured
             Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-I/P) (First et al, 1998)

          -  Is in the first episode of illness. First episode is defined as having had 6 months or
             less of lifetime treatment with an antipsychotic.

          -  Has not responded sufficiently to treatment with an antipsychotic. Lack of response is
             defined as a rating at study entry of 4 (moderate) or more on at least one of the
             following BPRS-A items: conceptual disorganization, grandiosity, hallucinatory
             behavior, unusual thought content.

          -  Continuous antipsychotic treatment at the time of study entry of a minimum of 12 weeks
             with the same antipsychotic agent.

          -  Antipsychotic dosing at some point during the 12 weeks must have reached a sufficient
             dose for antipsychotic response (e.g. patients who received only low dose quetiapine
             for insomnia or anxiety would not qualify). Sufficient dose for second generation
             antipsychotics is defined as a minimum dose of risperidone 3 mg/day, olanzapine 10
             mg/day, quetiapine 500 mg/day, ziprasidone 100 mg/day or aripiprazole 15 mg/day.
             Sufficient dose for first generation antipsychotics is defined as 3 mg/day of
             haloperidol or its equivalent for other first generation agents.

          -  Aged 15 to 40.

          -  If under age 18, parent or guardian consent and subject assent.

             disorder due to a general medical condition, delusional disorder, brief psychotic

             with psychotic features.

          -  Medical contraindications to treatment with long-acting injectable risperidone.

          -  Serious neurological or endocrine disorder or medical condition /treatment known to
             affect the brain.

          -  A medical condition requiring medication with psychotropic effects.
