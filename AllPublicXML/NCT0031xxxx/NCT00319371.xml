  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We study the skin-temperature (skin temperature measurement on different skin regions) and
      circadian rest-activity cycles (wrist activity monitoring) of 40 women in their daily life.

      This project will provide further information at which circadian phase vasospasms occur in
      daily routine life (one week recordings). Special interest lays on the time before sleep. The
      attained results could be used to establish a therapy with few side effects for people with
      difficulties initiating sleep because of vasospasm.

  <detailed_description>

      We study the skin-temperature and circadian rest-activity cycles of 40 women in their daily
      life.

      20 women with vasospasm and difficulties of initiating sleep and 20 women without vasospasm
      and no difficulties of initiating sleep.

      Women without contraceptives will be examined in the luteal phase (i.e. in the two weeks
      before menstruation). The ambulant registry will be done continuously during one week with so
      called i-Buttons (IButtonTM, Maxim, USA). These will be fixed to various parts of the body
      (i.e. wrist, ankle, …) with Fixomull, a medical bond. Also the subjects have to wear a
      instrument for registration activity, the so called Actiwatch (Cambridge, UK). The data that
      will be gained from these instruments, shall help us to objectify sleep-latency and
      sleep-fragmentation (&quot;sleeping-through&quot;).

      Furthermore, the subjects obtain a sleep-and activity-dairy, that has to be filled before and
      after sleeping. At one day, that the proband can choose, saliva samples have to be taken by
      the subjects themselves. In the saliva, the concentration of melatonin will be qualified. The
      attained results could be used to establish a therapy with few side effects for people with
      difficulties of initiating sleep because of vasospasm.
