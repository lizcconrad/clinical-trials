    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 110 mg ketoprofen
      in Transfersome applied to the skin twice daily as compared to placebo and oral celecoxib 200
      mg per day for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee for a period of
      six weeks.

      This is a multicenter, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on
      chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is
      being taken, or at what dosage), double-dummy, parallel group, placebo- and active-controlled
      study to determine the safety and effectiveness of 110 mg of ketoprofen in Transfersome,
      applied to the skin, in subjects experiencing at least moderate pain when not taking
      analgesic medication secondary to osteoarthritis pain of the knee. The study hypothesis is
      that ketoprofen in Transfersome applied to the skin twice daily will be more effective than
      placebo for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee as measured by
      the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC)
      pain, WOMAC function and subject global asessment of response to therapy at Week 6. WOMAC is
      a questionaire consisting of 24 questions designed to assess the three dimensions of pain,
      disability and joint stiffness in osteoarthritis of the knee. Safety evaluations include
      reports of adverse events, laboratory tests and skin irritation.

      Patients will receive one of the following treatments for six weeks - 110 mg ketoprofen in
      Transfersome applied to the skin twice per day plus one placebo capsule administered orally
      twice per day, 100 mg celecoxib administered orally twice per day plus placebo Transfersome
      applied to the skin twice per day, Placebo Transfersome applied to the skin twice per day
      plus one placebo capsule administered orally twice twice per day.
