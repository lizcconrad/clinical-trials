    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of peginesatide to increase and maintain
      increased hemoglobin levels in participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (either not on
      dialysis, receiving regular hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, or following renal
      transplant) with confirmed antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label treatment study; all patients enrolled into the study will receive
      AF37702 Injection. Hematologic data prior to treatment with AF37702 Injection will be
      compared to values obtained during treatment with AF37702 Injection (see Section 6.2).

      CKD patients with documented antibody-mediated PRCA, hemoglobin level &lt; 10 g/dL (without ESA
      therapy) or require transfusions to maintain this hemoglobin level, and who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled. It is anticipated that up to 40 patients will be
      enrolled in the trial.

      The first group of 5 patients will receive a starting dose of 0.05 mg/kg, administered every
      4 weeks (for this study, 1 month is defined as 4 weeks). Based on the assessment of the dose
      response in this initial group of 5 patients, it is recommended the starting dose in
      subsequent patients be increased to 0.075 mg/kg. The individual dose of AF37702 Injection
      will be modified based on hemoglobin levels. Dose adjustments will be made in order to
      achieve and maintain hemoglobin in the target range of 10.0-12.0 g/dL (see Section 5.4.1).
      The frequency of dosing may be decreased and dosing ultimately discontinued if Hgb is
      maintained within the target range. Due to the lack of treatment options in this population,
      more frequent dosing is justified in cases of a suboptimal response. If the Investigator
      determines that a patient has a suboptimal response despite dose increases, the frequency of
      injections may be increased up to once every other week, but the total dose may not exceed
      0.35 mg/kg every 4 weeks.
