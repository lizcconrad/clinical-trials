  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of ZD1839 Iressa™ to standard
      treatment with Casodex® (bicalutamide) for locally advanced prostate cancer can detect a
      difference in the rate of decrease of prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels.
