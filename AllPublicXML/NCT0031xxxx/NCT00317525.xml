  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between optical blur from poor
      refractive corrections (glasses) of older workers using computers and their productivity and
      comfort in the workplace. The investigators believe that improving the visual status of
      subjects who use computers will have a beneficial effect on productivity and visual comfort.

      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between optical blur from poor
      refractive corrections (glasses) of older workers using computers and their productivity and
      comfort in the workplace. We believe that improving the visual status of subjects who use
      computers will have a beneficial effect on productivity and visual comfort. All subjects will
      be required to complete a vision screening at no charge to decide if they qualify for the
      study. This is a double-blind study, which means that neither the subject nor the doctors
      will know which pair of lenses you will be wearing during the parts of the study. Subjects
      will complete a total of 4 hours of testing. The total amount of testing will be divided into
      ten 15-minute periods. During each period, the investigator will place different lenses in a
      trial frame. The trial frame that the subject will wear during the experiment will have their
      prescription for near plus an unknown pair of lenses. During the testing, the subject will
      complete a task involving finding and deleting apostrophes from a manuscript on a standard
      computer. Either the investigator or co-investigator will explain how to do this simple task.
      Subjects will answer a short survey before and after these tasks to check on symptoms
      resulting from using the computer. The following periodic measurements will be made during
      the study: productivity and accuracy to search for apostrophes (â€˜) in a document on one of
      the states of the U.S. These tasks will require a total of 4 hours testing with a total of
      ten pairs of trial lenses during a single visit.
