  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study in
      subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis comprising 3 periods: a 24-week
      double-blind period, a ≤ 24-week maintenance period, and a 48-week open-label period. During
      the double-blind period, subjects were randomized equally to 1 of 2 regimens: etanercept 25
      mg twice weekly (BIW) or placebo, administered subcutaneously (SC). After the week 24 visit,
      subjects continued on blind-labeled therapy in a maintenance period until all subjects
      completed the double-blind period. After the maintenance period, all subjects received
      open-label etanercept 25 mg BIW.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously presented data from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Protocols 016.0612
      [Investigator IND] and 016.0030 [Immunex IND]) led to the approval of etanercept for reducing
      clinical signs and symptoms of PsA. One-year radiographic data from Protocol 20021630 led to
      an additional approval of etanercept for inhibiting structural progression in PsA.

      Data are used for the following purposes:

        -  To summarize the clinical efficacy and safety results previously described in the
           6-month clinical study report and the radiographic results previously described in the
           1-year clinical study report.

        -  To show the effect of etanercept on physical function in subjects with PsA and
           psoriasis, as measured by 2 patient-reported outcome measures (disability index of the
           Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] and Medical Outcomes Study Short-form
           Health Survey [SF-36]). • To present the radiographic results at 2 years from baseline
           and the final clinical efficacy and safety results during the open-label period of the
           study.

             tender/painful joints. • Had ≥ 1 of the following subtypes of PsA: distal
             interphalangeal (DIP) involvement; polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid
             nodules and presence of psoriasis); arthritis mutilans; asymmetric peripheral
             arthritis; or ankylosing spondylitis-like.
