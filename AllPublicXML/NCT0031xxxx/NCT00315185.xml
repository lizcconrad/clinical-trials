      The purpose of this study is to determine the role of cetuximab (Erbitux) with chemotherapy
      for advanced colorectal carcinoma. This study will determine if this new agent can improve
      one's response to standard treatment.

      This research study is being done to determine if cetuximab will improve efficacy of standard
      chemotherapy. This agent targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR sits on the
      outside of tumor cells and controls tumor cell growth. This agent has been looked at alone
      and with other chemotherapy drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has shown to be
      safe and can shrink tumors. There is little information about the combination of this agent
      with both paclitaxel and carboplatin. This study combines cetuximab with monthly carboplatin
      and weekly paclitaxel.

             2 weeks prior to enrollment and be off steroids.

          -  Radiotherapy must have been completed &gt; 2 weeks prior to enrollment and patients must
             have recovered from adverse events of radiotherapy.

          -  &gt;/= 18 years of age

             platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm3.

          -  Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); AST
             and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 X ULN.

          -  Adequate renal function: serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;/=
             50cc/minute if serum creatinine &gt; 1.5

          -  Signed an approved informed consent for this protocol and an approved informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at enrollment or
             within 7 days of treatment. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand
             the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential and should practice an
             effective method of birth regulation/control. Note: Patients are considered to not be
             of childbearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are
             postmenopausal.

             patient has been disease-free for 3 years.

          -  Patients with significant history of cardiac disease, i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within
             the past year, cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction, or cardiac ventricular
             arrythmias within the last year requiring new treatment .

          -  Patients with an uncontrolled seizure disorder, or active neurological disease.

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis.

          -  Patients who have received prior systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients who have received prior cetuximab or other therapy which specifically and
             directly targets the EGF pathway.

          -  Prior infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody or prior hypersensitivity to
             Cremophor EL.

          -  Patients with known peripheral neuropathy (&gt; grade 1).
