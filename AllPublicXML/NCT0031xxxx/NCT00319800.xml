  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether in docetaxel pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with favorable clinical
      parameter(s) gefitinib can produce different outcomes from patients without favorable
      clinical parameter treated with irinotecan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that some clinical parameters, including women, no smoking history and
      a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, are associated with favorable outcomes of gefitinib
      therapy. We will conduct a phase II study in docetaxel pretreated advanced NSCLC patients
      treated with gefitinib or irinotecan according to these clinical parameters in order to
      determine whether in patients with favorable clinical parameter(s) gefitinib will produce
      difference outcomes from patients without favorable clinical parameter treated with
      irinotecan.
