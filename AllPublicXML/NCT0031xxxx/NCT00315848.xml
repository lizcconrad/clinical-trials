  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and tolerability of the
      buprenorphine transdermal system (5, 10, and 20 mg) in comparison to placebo transdermal
      system and immediate release oxycodone/acetaminophen in subjects with osteoarthritis pain
      inadequately treated with non-opioid analgesics. The double-blind treatment intervention
      duration is 60 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic with over twenty-five years of international
      clinical experience indicating it to be safe and effective in a variety of therapeutic
      situations for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Transdermal systems may offer
      advantages over currently indicated oral products including ease and convenience of use,
      improved compliance, possible reduction in patient care, and prolonged and consistent
      delivery of drug.
