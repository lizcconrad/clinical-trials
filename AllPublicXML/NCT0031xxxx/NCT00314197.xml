  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial at the patient level of
      the Telephone Linked Care - Behavioral Change (TLC-BC) system, which is designed to promote
      smoking cessation, reduce risky drinking, and improve physical activity and diet. They expect
      to:

        1. successfully integrate an automated telephone behavior change intervention into primary
           care practices;

        2. demonstrate improvement in health behaviors for individuals randomized (assigned by
           systematic chance) to use the TLC-BC system compared to individuals who receive written
           health education informational packets; and

        3. evaluate the direct costs associated with the use and operation of the TLC-BC system.

      Project aims and hypotheses follow:

      Aim 1: Integrate a proven, totally automated computer telephone intervention, Telephone
      Linked Care - Behavior Change (TLC-BC), into primary care practices. This will be assessed by
      the patient and clinician/staff surveys at the end of data collection.

      Aim 2: Demonstrate an improvement in health behaviors for individuals randomized to use the
      TLC-BC system compared to individuals who receive written informational packets.

      Aim 3: Evaluate the direct costs associated with the use and operation of the TLC-BC system
      within the primary care setting.

      Hypothesis 1: The Telephone Linked Care - Behavioral Change system will be successfully
      implemented by patients and practices.

      Hypothesis 2: At 6 months a clinically significant improvement in behavioral change rates
      will be demonstrated for diet, physical activity, and smoking in the intervention group
      compared to patients in the control group.

      Hypothesis 3: At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months risky drinking will be identified, but there
      will be no difference in improvement between the study groups.
