  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial seeks to accomplish both local and regional control of head and neck cancer and
      reduce systemic metastatic disease. To do this, patients will received chemotherapy followed
      by chemotherapy and radiation (given together) with an escalating dose of docetaxel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of head and neck cancer patients present with more advanced stages III or IV
      disease. The treatment of cancers of the head and neck can have profound consequences with
      regard to functional abilities such as speech and eating. In the treatment of both locally
      advanced HNSCC and sites where organ preservation is desirable, radiation therapy has been a
      major method of treatment. However, as a single modality, radiation therapy can cure fewer
      than 30% of patients with advanced disease. Attempts to improve the outcome of locally
      advanced HNSCC have generally added chemotherapy to radiotherapy. However, the optimal manner
      to integrate chemotherapy into the plan of care has been controversial. Chemotherapy has been
      used most commonly as either induction therapy preceding radiation, or more recently as
      concomitant therapy along with radiation. Induction chemotherapy has been associated with
      high response rates of 60-90%, but no significant change in loco-regional control or
      survival.Clinical trials incorporating chemotherapy with concurrent radiation have recently
      generated considerable interest. To accomplish both loco-regional control and reduce systemic
      metastasis, this trial proposes induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant
      chemotherapy-radiation with an escalating dose of docetaxel in patients with locally advanced
      previously untreated HNSCC.
