      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal SN-38, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well liposomal SN-38 works in treating patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate following treatment with SN-38 liposome as a
           second-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients treated with this drug who experience any grade 3
           or greater toxicity.

        -  Determine progression-free survival and overall survival for patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive SN-38 liposome IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 3 years.
