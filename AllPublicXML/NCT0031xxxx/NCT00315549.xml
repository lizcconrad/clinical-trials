    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, randomized (1:1), double blind, comparator-controlled, 2 parallel
      treatment group study in subjects equal to or over 13 years of age, with Streptococcus
      pyogenes tonsillitis/pharyngitis (T/P). Each subject will receive either telithromycin, 400
      mg over-encapsulated tablets, 800 mg once daily for 5 days or penicillin V 250 mg
      over-encapsulated tablets, 500 mg three times daily for 10days. Matching placebo capsules
      will be dispensed to maintain the blind between the treatment groups.A positive rapid
      identification test for streptococcal Group A antigen will be required for all subjects at
      Visit 1 (Day 1) for entry into the study. Throat swab specimens for bacterial culture,
      identification, and antibiotic-susceptibility testing will be taken at Visits 1, 3 and 4.
