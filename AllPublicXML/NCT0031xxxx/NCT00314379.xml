  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ICARE study, clinicaltrials.gov ID number: NCT00220831 and protocol number KL-2004, is
      recruiting diabetic patients with haptoglobin phenotype 2-2, which are randomised to either
      Vitamin E 400IU per day or placebo. Patients will be followed for 4 years for the major
      cardiovascular complications of diabetes, acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and
      cardiovascular mortality (see ICARE protocol). The EFI study, Endothelial Function in ICARE
      will recruit a sample group of 50 patients from the ICARE cohort. These patients will
      complete all requirements by ICARE protocol and in addition will be tested for endothelial
      function by a non-invasive method of flow mediated dilatation (FMD).

      Fifty patients will be randomly sampled from the ICARE untreated cohort (registry) of
      diabetic patients with Hp2-2 phenotype which were not randomised to treatment under ICARE
      study. Patients will be randomised to either vitamin E 400 IU/d or Placebo upon sampling for
      EFI study.

      The patients will be tested for endothelial function by a method of Post Ischemic Flow
      mediated Dilatation.

      all patients will undergo a baseline Endothelial Function test and then start taking the
      study drug for 2 months. at the end of two months of therapy the patients will undergo a
      second endothelial function test, then therapy will be stopped for 2 weeks and a cross over
      will be performed for an additional 2 months of therapy which in the end the third and final
      endothelial function test will be done.

      An interim Results analysis is set to be done once the first 20 patients completed the
      protocol. In case of significant differences between the groups, study principal
      investigators will decide about study completion.
