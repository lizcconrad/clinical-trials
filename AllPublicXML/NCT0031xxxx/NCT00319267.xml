  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate that the exposure to bosentan in children with
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or familial pulmonary arterial hypertension,
      using a pediatric formulation, is similar to that in adults with PAH and to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of a pediatric formulation of bosentan in this patient population.

    <description>The initial dose of bosentan was 2 mg/kg b.i.d. for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the initial dose was up-titrated to the maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. up to the end of the study treatment at Week 12. If the maintenance dose was not well tolerated, the dose could be down-titrated to the initial dose.</description>
