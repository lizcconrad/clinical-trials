      The purpose of this study is to determine if hypertonic saline with and without dextran can
      improve neurologic outcomes in victims of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

      Injury and lost blood from trauma can cause your body to go into shock (low blood pressure
      related to blood loss). This decreased blood flow can lead to organ damage. In order to
      restore the blood pressure and blood flow, the medics give fluids into the patients' veins as
      soon as possible. This is called &quot;resuscitation&quot;. The fluid most commonly used is &quot;isotonic&quot;
      or one that is the same salt concentration as the blood. The investigators are trying to
      determine if infusing a &quot;hypertonic&quot; fluid or one more concentrated than the blood can
      increase the blood pressure and restore blood flow more efficiently. The hypertonic fluids
      they are using are called hypertonic saline with dextran (HSD) and hypertonic saline (no
      dextran). Hypertonic saline is a salt solution that is slightly more concentrated than blood.
      Dextran is a sugar solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if prehospital administration of 7.5% Hypertonic Saline in 6% Dextran-70 (HSD)
      OR 7.5% Hypertonic Saline (HS) compared to current standard therapy with NS as an initial
      resuscitation fluid affects neurological outcome following severe traumatic brain injury.

      Trauma is the leading cause of death among North Americans between the ages of 1 and 44
      years. The majority of these deaths result from hypovolemic shock or severe brain injury.
      Patients in hypovolemic shock develop a state of systemic tissue ischemia then a subsequent
      reperfusion injury at the time of fluid resuscitation. Conventional resuscitation involves
      the IV administration of a large volume of isotonic or slightly hypotonic (lactated ringers,
      LR) solutions beginning in the pre-hospital setting. Although not conclusive, prior studies
      have suggested that alternative resuscitation with hypertonic saline (7.5%) solutions may
      reduce morbidity or mortality in these patients. Furthermore, hypertonic fluids may have
      specific advantages in the brain-injured patient, as they may aid in the rapid restoration of
      cerebral perfusion and prevent extravascular fluid sequestration, thereby limiting secondary
      brain injury. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that hypertonicity significantly
      alters the activation of inflammatory cells, an effect that may reduce subsequent organ
      injury from ischemia-reperfusion and decrease nosocomial infection.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, three-arm placebo controlled trial designed to
      evaluate the clinical outcome of trauma patients with severe TBI as manifested by a
      pre-hospital GCS of 8 or less. Patients will be randomized to a single 250cc IV dose of 7.5%
      saline in 6% Dextran-70 (HSD), 7.5% saline (HS) or normal saline as the initial fluid for
      pre-hospital resuscitation. No additional interventions will occur once the patient is
      admitted to the hospital. In hospital data collection will last up to 28 days. Patients will
      have neurologic outcome measurements at discharge, 1 month post discharge, and 6 months post
      injury. Enrollment will be restricted to age ≥ 15 years or ≥ 50 kg if age is unknown.

    <measure>Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)≤4 at 6 Months: Completer Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>Glasgow outcome score extended (GOSE) contains eight categories: 1. Dead, 2. Vegetative State (VS), 3. Lower Severe Disability (Lower SD), 4. Upper Severe Disability (Upper SD), 5. Lower Moderate Disability (Lower MD), 6. Upper Moderate Disability (Upper MD), 7. Lower Good Recovery (Lower GR) and 8. Upper Good Recovery (Upper GR). A measured neurological outcome of GOSE≤4 is a poor outcome of severe disability, vegetative state, or death. Completer analysis includes only those patients with GOSE completed at 6 months after injury.</description>

    <measure>Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)≤4 at 6 Months: Imputed Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>Glasgow outcome score extended (GOSE) contains 8 categories: 1. Dead, 2. Vegetative State, 3. Lower Severe Disability, 4. Upper Severe Disability, 5. Lower Moderate Disability, 6. Upper Moderate Disability, 7. Lower Good Recovery and 8. Upper Good Recovery. To adjust for 15% of subjects with absent 6-month GOSE data, an analysis using 20 hot deck imputations for the 6-month GOSE was done using data from patients who were discharged alive based on 1-month post discharge GOSE data or discharge GOSE (if 1-month post discharge data were not available), length of hospital stay, and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Subgroup of Participants With Head Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS) Greater Than or Equal to 4 (Head AIS≥4) Assessed to Have Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE)≤4 at 6 Months: Imputed Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ranks injuries on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being minor, 2 moderate, 3 serious, 4 severe, 5 critical and 6 an unsurvivable injury. A priori secondary analyses included the subgroup of participants in each intervention group with a head AIS≥4, which is a diagnostic indicator of severe to lethal head injury. Of this subset of participants with AIS≥4, a second subset of participants with a GOSE≤4 at the 6 month follow up was analyzed. GOSE≤4 represents Upper Severe Disability or worse outcomes. 15% of subjects required imputation analysis for 6-month GOSE.</description>

    <description>The DRS is an additional measure of neurological outcome that categorizes the patient's level of disability on a scale of 0 to 29, with 0 indicating no disability to 29 indicating extreme vegetative state. To adjust for 15% of subjects with absent 6-month DRS data, an analysis using 20 hot deck imputations for the 6-month DRS was done using data from patients who were discharged alive based on 1-month post discharge DRS data or discharge DRS (if 1-month post discharge data were not available), length of hospital stay, and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Worst Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) Through Day 28</measure>

    <description>Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score is described as: Six organ systems were chosen: 1) respiratory; 2) renal; 3) hepatic; 4) cardiovascular; 5) hematologic; and 6) neurologica. A score of 0-4 was allotted for each organ according to function (0 being normal function through 4 for most severe dysfunction) with a maximum score of 24.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were enrolled by Emergency Medicine Services (EMS) personnel in the prehospital setting based on pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The first subject was enrolled in May 2006. The last subject was enrolled in May 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>1331 subjects were randomized. 1282 were included in primary imputation analysis. 49 were randomized with study fluid package opened but no study fluid was given. Reasons given were: Did not meet inclusion criteria; Met an exclusion criterion; No intravenous access; Fluid bag sterility broken; EMS responder unsure of inclusion/exclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Glasgow outcome score extended (GOSE) contains eight categories: 1. Dead, 2. Vegetative State (VS), 3. Lower Severe Disability (Lower SD), 4. Upper Severe Disability (Upper SD), 5. Lower Moderate Disability (Lower MD), 6. Upper Moderate Disability (Upper MD), 7. Lower Good Recovery (Lower GR) and 8. Upper Good Recovery (Upper GR). A measured neurological outcome of GOSE≤4 is a poor outcome of severe disability, vegetative state, or death.

Of this subset of participants with AIS≥4, a second subset of participants with a GOSE≤4 at the 6 month follow up was analyzed.
