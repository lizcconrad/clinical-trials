  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of aminophylline in patients with
      out-of-hospital bradyasystolic cardiac arrest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by emergency medical services has an estimated
      incidence of 54.99 per 100,000 person years, which translates to some 155,000 episodes
      annually in the United States. Bradyasystole is the first recorded rhythm in up to 52 percent
      of cardiac arrests, and many additional patients with an initial cardiac arrest rhythm of
      ventricular fibrillation deteriorate to bradyasystole after defibrillation efforts. Survival
      to hospital discharge occurs in less than 3 percent of patients presenting with
      bradyasystole; however, due to its frequency, this rhythm accounts for over 17 percent of all
      cardiac arrest survivors. As a result, even a small improvement in survival from
      bradyasystolic cardiac arrest would result in thousands of lives saved annually.

      Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that depresses the sinoatrial node, blocks
      atrioventricular conduction, inhibits the pacemaker activity of the His-Purkinje system and
      attenuates the effects of catecholamines. Since adenosine is produced and released by
      myocardial cells during ischemia and hypoxia, it may be a reversible factor in the etiology
      or perpetuation of bradyasystole. Aminophylline is a competitive antagonist of adenosine. The
      use of aminophylline for bradycardia and heart block has been described, and a number of
      anecdotal reports and small studies have been published on the use of aminophylline in
      cardiac arrest. We undertook this study to evaluate the effect of aminophylline during
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of patients with out-of-hospital bradyasystolic cardiac
      arrest unresponsive to initial therapy.
