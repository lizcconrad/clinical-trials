  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative study of duration of respiratory weaning between adaptive support
      ventilation and succession of controlled ventilation then spontaneous ventilation for
      patients after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia is marked by the passage of a stage of controlled ventilation where the
      patient does not carry out any respiratory work and the stage of spontaneous ventilation,
      which precedes extubation. Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a new protocol of weaning of
      the tracheal prosthesis after surgery which maintains a preset ventilation by an operator and
      the activity of the patient. At each breath, a microprocessor allows an optimization of
      volume and frequency by an adjustment of the inspiratory pressure and frequency. ASV was
      already validated for fast tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Our study proposes to
      compare the duration of intubation between this mode of weaning and with the traditional way
      (controlled ventilation then spontaneous ventilation) for faster surgery. The purpose of the
      study is to check the interest of ASV to limit the duration of intubation compared to the
      traditional protocol in this kind of intervention.
