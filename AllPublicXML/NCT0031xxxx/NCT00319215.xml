  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of bedtime administration of
      a single dose of ramelteon (8 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg), and placebo on next-morning on-road
      driving performance. In addition, the drugs' effects on balance are evaluated during the
      night, and the next morning residual effects on memory and psychomotor performance.
