  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of the
      buprenorphine transdermal system versus placebo on health outcomes in elderly residents in
      supervised living environments. The treatment intervention duration is 42 days during which
      time supplemental analgesic medication (usual analgesic care) will be provided to all
      subjects in addition to study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid analgesic with over twenty-five years of international
      clinical experience indicating it to be safe and effective in a variety of therapeutic
      situations for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Transdermal systems may offer
      advantages over currently indicated oral products including ease and convenience of use,
      improved compliance, possible reduction in patient care, and prolonged and consistent
      delivery of drug.
