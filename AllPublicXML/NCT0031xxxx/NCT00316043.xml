      The aim of the study is to describe the current clinical management of young children with
      urinary tract infections in Dutch primary care and also to describe the possibilities for
      improvement and potential cost-efficiency of improved care in the light of preventing renal
      failure.

      The aim of the study is to describe the current clinical management of young children with
      urinary tract infections in Dutch primary care and also to describe the possibilities for
      improvement and potential cost-efficiency of improved care in the light of preventing renal
      failure.

      The 4 phases of the study contain the following questions:

        -  Phase 1: What is the current clinical management of urinary tract infections in young
           children in primary care?

        -  Phase 2: What are the possibilities for improving the clinical management of urinary
           tract infections and are these improvements practically achievable?

        -  Phase 3: What is the cost-efficiency of the several interventions for improving clinical
           management of urinary tract infections

        -  Phase 4: What is the influence of the intervention on clinical management?
