      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modafinil administered

      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether modafinil at 255, 340, 425, or 510
      mg'day is more effective than a placebo in alleviating the symptoms of
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults as determined by the change from
      baseline in the total score from the investigator-completed Adult ADHD Investigator Symptoms
      Rating Scale (AISRS) the at endpoint (last post-baseline observation [week 9 or early
      termination]).
