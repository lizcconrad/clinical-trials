    <textblock>
      A trial to characterize the immunogenicity of 2 different formulations of a vaccine from GSK
      Biologicals, including the following five antigens: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis
      B and Haemophilus influenzae type b. A vaccine from Commonwealth Serum Laboratories
      (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) which is co-administered with Haemophilus influenzae type b
      vaccine will also be used as a comparator. Reactogenicity and safety of all vaccines will be
      assessed as well.

      &quot;The study will be carried out in a partially double blind manner (i.e. double blind with
      respect to DTPwGöd-HBV/Hib Kft and DTPwCSL-HBV/Hib Kft groups and open with respect to CSL's
      Triple Antigen &amp; Hib group). Subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the three
      following groups to receive:

        -  GSK Biologicals Kft's combined DTPwGöd-HBV/Hib Kft vaccine.

        -  GSK Biologicals Kft's combined DTPwCSL-HBV/Hib Kft vaccine.

        -  CSL's Triple Antigen + GSK Biologicals' Hib vaccines. There will be a specific follow-up
           of solicited local and general symptoms during 4 days after each vaccination and of
           unsolicited symptoms for 31 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events reported
           during the study period will be recorded.
