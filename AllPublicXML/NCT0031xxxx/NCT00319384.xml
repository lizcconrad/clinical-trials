      This trial will look at the effectiveness and patient acceptance of ultrafiltration therapy
      in an outpatient setting.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if ambulatory patients who suffer from heart
      failure and hypervolemia can be safely and effectively treated in an outpatient infusion
      clinic. The results from this trial will be useful in planning a larger, randomized trial
      comparing usual care and ultrafiltration for this patient population in similar ambulatory
      settings.

      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, safety and patient acceptance
      of ultrafiltration in ambulatory patients with heart failure and hypervolemia. The results
      will be useful in planning a larger clinical trial.
