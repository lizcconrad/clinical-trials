  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quetiapine (Seroquel Â®), an atypical antipsychotic registered for use in schizophrenia, which
      has a very low propensity of extrapyramidal and endocrine side-effects, has also been studied
      as an adjunct in OCD. In an open trial, ten patients with OCD who had not responded to at
      least three previous treatments with a SRI at maximum dose and duration were assigned to
      receive quetiapine in addition to a SRI for 8 weeks. Given the efficacy of quetiapine in
      treatment resistant patients, and given its rapid onset of action (4-6 weeks), it is
      postulated that the combination of a low dose atypical antipsychotic and a standard dosage of
      an SRI as a treatment for patients with OCD might increase the number of responders as well
      as the effect size.

      PLEASE NOTE: Seroquel SR and Seroquel XR refer to the same formulation. The SR designation
      was changed to XR after consultation with FDA.
