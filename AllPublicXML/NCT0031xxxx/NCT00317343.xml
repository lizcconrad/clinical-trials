      RIAPRE is a non-interventional registry to be settled in Italy with the purpose of collecting
      data on 600 cases of high risk elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients
      treated with an anticoagulation regime different from unfractionated heparin in monotherapy.
      About thirty catheterization laboratories will co-operate in this activity. The long term
      outcome of patients will be taken into consideration. The availability of these data will
      allow for a better understanding of the therapeutic needs in this area.

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Medical condition or disease to be studied: age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Patients are candidates for a PCI with a planned anticoagulation regime other than
             unfractionated heparin in monotherapy. Taking into consideration the national and
             international guidelines for this area and the registered indications of the drugs
             currently used for this purpose it is predicted that the patients will probably
             receive one of the following:

               -  unfractionated heparin as an intravenous (IV) bolus followed by IV bolus +
                  infusion of a GPI (abciximab, tirofiban or eptifibatide); or

               -  bivalirudin as an IV bolus followed by IV infusion, as per the pertinent Summary
                  of Product Characteristics (SPCs).

          -  Having provided an informed consent (to anonymous data treatment).

          -  A planned anticoagulation regime means that any candidate patient should be identified
             on the basis of pre-procedural factors and requested to give his/her consent before
             the PCI is initiated. Patients receiving bail-out GPI for intraprocedural
             complications should NOT be considered for the inclusion. However, a pre-included
             patient could receive a bail-out GPI if deemed necessary.

          -  The allocation of any individual patient to the category of &quot;high risk&quot; elective PCI
             will be made independently and autonomously by the caring physician. However, it is
             recommended to consider the suitability of patients on the basis of these indicative
             elements:

               -  age &gt; 75 years.

               -  known diabetes mellitus (type I or type II).

               -  known renal insufficiency, i.e. serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg or glomerular
                  filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 60 ml/min (calculated with the Cockroft formula).

               -  multivessel or complex procedure.

               -  planned stent on a bifurcation.

               -  planned stent &gt; 6 cm long.

               -  PCI on a degenerated venous bypass: in this particular case a distal protection
                  device should always be used.

               -  non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with a PCI planned later than 72 hours
                  after the diagnosis without clinical instability (= &quot;cooled&quot; non ST elevation
                  acute coronary syndrome). This type of patient is considered to be essentially
                  stable and his/her level of risk can be comparable to the risk of patients who
                  are candidates for elective PCI with additional risk factors as listed above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There will be no specific exclusion criteria other than those listed in the Summary of
             Product Characteristics of every individual agent.
