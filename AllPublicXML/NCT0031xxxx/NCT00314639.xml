  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum psychosis frequently
      experience cognitive impairments. Such deficits may affect memory, attention and executive
      function processes. Many studies have shown that cognitive impairments predict daily
      functioning. Improvement of these difficulties represents a major component of recovery in
      such population. Second generation antipsychotics, now first line intervention, have been
      shown to improve cognitive processes compared to first generation agents. However, more
      subtle cognitive impairments may still remain. In fact, cognitive impairments is one of the
      most frequent subjective complaints from patients and their family, even though antipsychotic
      treatment has been optimized. Very few options are available to clinicians to try to improve
      such persistent cognitive difficulties. First, cognitive remediation techniques have shown
      some effectiveness but results are sparse and come from a very small number of studies. It is
      also not clear if cognitive improvement obtained from such techniques would apply to daily
      functioning and can be generalized.A second possible intervention would be to add a
      pharmacological agent able to improve cognition. Modafinil (Alertec) is officially indicated
      for improving wakefulness in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with
      narcolepsy. Some empirical data and clinical observations suggest that modafinil could
      improve alertness and/or cognitive functioning without exacerbating psychotic features in
      persons with schizophrenia and psychotic disease in the spectrum of schizophrenia. This study
      aims to (a) assess the effect on cognitive functioning of modafinil as an adjunctive to a
      second generation antipsychotic in a prospective cohort of thirty patients suffering from
      schizophrenia and psychosis in the spectrum of schizophrenia. This study will also (b)
      evaluate the impacts of the addition of modafinil on side effects, psychopathology symptoms
      and other health parameters (such as weight, metabolic profile, etc.). Our principal
      hypothesis is that significant improvements will be observed on attention processes without
      any exacerbation of psychotic symptoms or major emerging side effects. This cross-over
      placebo-controlled prospective study will include patients with schizophrenia or psychosis in
      the schizophrenia spectrum according to DSM IV definition, men or women aged over 18 years
      old, with no item score equal or over 5 at PANSS positive symptoms subscale. At enrollment,
      all patients will have to experience significant cognitive difficulties with scores equal or
      lower than Z=-1.00 at Color trail test, Mesulam and Weintraub Cancellation Test, Stroop test
      or Continuous Performance Test-II. Patients will be exposed to 100mg daily of Placebo or
      Modafinil for 2 weeks than to 200mg daily for the two following weeks. A two weeks wash out
      period will then take place before the same sequence will be start again. Patient will thus
      be exposed one month to placebo and one month to modafinil or conversely, in a random
      fashion.Assessments will include neurocognitive standardized battery, psychopathological
      tools (PANSS, CGI, SOFAS, SDS), side effects (UKU, ESRS, DAI), vital signs, anthropometric
      and metabolic profile.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. To have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum psychosis
             (schizophreniform, schizoaffective, delusional trouble, brief psychosis), as defined
             in Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ([DSM-IV], American
             Psychiatric Association [APA], 1995);

          2. To be 18 years old or more;

          3. Psychotic symptoms must be stabilized with a second generation antipsychotic for at
             least 4 weeks i.e. no item on Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale ([PANSS], Kay,
             Opler, &amp; Fiszbein, 1987) positive subscale equal or superior to a score of 5.

          4. Neurocognitive impairments are observed on attention measures. Participants will merit
             one or more result equal or lower to Z = -1,00 in at least one attention task.(Color
             trail test part A, MWCT, Stroop test, CPT-II).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. To have a diagnosis of mental retardation (APA, 1994), or medical affection other than
             schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, or neurological troubles that can
             lead to cognitive impairments (ex : temporal epilepsy);

          2. To have a current diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IV);

          3. To manifest an important suicidal potential according to the psychiatrist clinical
             judgment;

          4. To suffer from unstable hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac
             disorders;

          5. To take medications, drugs and/or natural products that have a stimulant effect on the
