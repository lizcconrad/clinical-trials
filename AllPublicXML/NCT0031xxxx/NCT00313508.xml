  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, dose-escalation study of fludarabine. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what side effects are caused in this study and
      whether Fludarabine with the dendritic cell vaccine (DC vaccine) can increase the ability of
      the immune system to recognize melanoma.

      This is a dose ranging study of intranodal administration of autologous dendritic cells (DC)
      pulsed with tumor antigen class I peptides derived from MART-1 (26-35) (27L), gp100 (209-217
      (210M), gp100 280-288 (288V), NY-ESO-1 157-165 (165V) and tyrosinase 207-215 as well as class
      II MART-1 (51-73), NY-ESO-1 (119-143), MAGE-3 (243-258) and tyrosinase (450-462) peptides
      preceded by Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion (ALI) and one of two doses of Fludarabine. The
      nine or ten amino acid peptides representing HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitopes of MART-1,
      gp100, NY-ESO-1 and tyrosinase will be pulsed onto autologous dendritic cells produced by
      incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by apheresis with interleukin-4
      (IL-4) and GM-CSF and pulsed with four helper peptides then matured with a cytokine cocktail
      including TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and PGE2. Melanoma antigen peptide-pulsed dendritic cells will
      be administered at a total dose of 10 million cells each for four intranodal injections to
      patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve metastatic melanoma.

      DC matured with a cytokine cocktail and pulsed with class I and II peptides will be injected
      intranodally, weekly for two doses, then every two weeks for two doses, for a total of four
      injections to each cohort.
