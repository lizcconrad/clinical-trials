      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well temozolomide works in treating patients
      with supratentorial low-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of temozolomide, defined as response rate (complete and partial
           response), in patients with supratentorial mixed low-grade glioma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety profile of temozolomide in patients with supratentorial low-grade
           glioma.

        -  Assess the time to tumor progression in patients treated with temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
