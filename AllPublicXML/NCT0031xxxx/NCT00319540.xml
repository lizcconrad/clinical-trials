    <textblock>
      Unipolar depression is a common disorder which may be treated by drugs or psychological
      intervention. Many patients prefer psychological treatment, but there is a lack of
      professional skills and methods for effectively dealing with this in the primary health
      services,where most of the depressed patients are seen.For this reason it is of great
      importance to develop and test psychological methods which may be applied in the primary
      health services, as well as in the specialized psychiatric services.In the present study a
      psychoeducational group method is tested, with trained psychiatric nurses as the most common
      group leaders.
