  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to follow first-ever- acute stroke patients from onset, one,
      two and four years post stroke and study the effect of two different approaches of exercises
      implemented the first year post-stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of disability and the long-term effects of stroke often lead to need
      of rehabilitation services. It has been shown that intensive stroke unit care and functional
      exercises are beneficial in the acute rehabilitation of stroke. The duration of the
      rehabilitation of patients with acute stroke is decreasing, leaving patients with not
      complete recovery at discharge in need of follow-up services. There is a general assumption
      that physical exercises are beneficial at all stages of stroke but it is questionable if
      these benefits are sustained after treatment ends. There are, to our knowledge, no
      longitudinal studies of non-interrupted regular physical exercises from the acute phase till
      one year post stroke.

      The purpose of this project is to follow first-ever- acute stroke patients from onset, one,
      two and four years post stroke. All acute stroke patients will be treated in a stroke unit
      and the physiotherapy treatment will be according to Motor Relearning Programme principles
      with functional goals, environmental context and early mobilisation. When patients are
      discharged they will be block randomised and stratified according to gender and hemisphere
      lesion into two groups. Group 1 will be offered an intensive follow-up programme, which will
      run four times in the post-stroke year with a total amount of 80 hours of physiotherapy. The
      physiotherapy treatment will be focused on physical endurance, strength and balance.

      Group 2, or the control group, will be offered the same physiotherapy programme that is
      practised within the community as of now (2003) that is when the need for follow-up is
      considered by someone involved. The physiotherapy then given is according to specified needs
      e.g. walking capacity, transfers and assistive devices.
