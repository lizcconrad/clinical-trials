      The purpose of this study is to determine whether morbidity and mortality for high-risk
      surgical patients treated with the Carotid Wallstent in conjunction with the FilterWire EX
      and EZ System distal protection device will be less than or equal to that of objective
      performance criteria (OPC) derived from historic controls undergoing surgical intervention
      with a carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

      Stroke is the third leading cause of death in this country with approximately 600,000 new
      stroke cases each year. Mortality rates as high as 40 percent have been reported for stroke
      as a result of ischemia associated with the carotid distribution. Currently, the primary
      therapy for carotid artery occlusive disease is carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or the surgical
      removal of atheromatous material from inside the artery.

      Although CEA is an effective treatment for the majority of patients with carotid occlusive
      disease, there remains a need for a treatment option for those patients with significant
      surgical risk factors. These patients have been shown to have much higher rates of morbidity
      and mortality. There are approximately 50,000-70,000 patients each year who are considered
      poor surgical candidates. These patients present with either one or more anatomical or
      co-morbid conditions and have a one-year stroke and death rate of up to 15% with traditional
      surgical treatment.

      Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported by numerous single-center trials to be
      feasible in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. Moreover, the risk benefit ratio has
      been suggested to be the largest in those patients with a higher risk profile for the CEA
      treatment option.

      This trial will study the effects of percutaneous intervention using the Monorail™ Carotid
      Wallstent® Endoprosthesis (Carotid Wallstent) in conjunction with the FilterWire System
      distal protection device (FilterWire EX and EZ) on rates of common peri-procedural
      complications as well as on long-term outcomes as compared to historical outcomes of patients
      undergoing CEA.

        Key General Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must meet criteria for either A or B:

        associated cerebral or retinal TIA or ischemic stroke symptoms within 180 days of the
        procedure, which are determined to have occurred in the cerebral hemisphere or eye
        ipsilateral to the target carotid artery lesion and to be reasonably attributable to that
        lesion; or

        B. Asymptomatic: Carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 80% via angiography without
        associated cerebral or retinal TIA or ischemic stroke symptoms within 180 days of the
        procedure.

          -  Target lesion is in the native common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery
             (ICA), or carotid bifurcation.

          -  Target arterial segment to be stented has a diameter of greater than or equal to 4.0
             mm to less than or equal to 9.0 mm.

             less than or equal to 5.5 mm as an optimal &quot;landing zone&quot; for placement of the
             FilterWire EZ System with visual angiographic recommendations as described in the
             instructions for use (IFU).

        Key High-Risk Eligibility Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must qualify in at least one high-risk category. The high-risk categories are
             defined as:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has experienced an evolving, acute, or recent stroke within 21 days of study
             evaluation.

          -  A total occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery. (Only for Roll-In and Pivotal
             patients.)

          -  A total occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery. (Only for Bilateral Registry
             patients.)

          -  Pre-existing stent(s):

               -  Roll-In and Pivotal Patients: located within the ipsilateral carotid
                  distribution; a stent was placed in a contralateral vessel within the previous 30
                  days of the study enrollment.

               -  Bilateral Registry Patients: located within the carotid distribution.

          -  A target lesion which is expected to require more than one stent.

          -  Known cardiac sources of emboli of a type likely to be associated with cerebral
             ischemic events [e.g. endocarditis, intracardiac thrombus, embolic-associated
             cardiovascular lesions, or any current arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation, atrial
             flutter, etc.)].

          -  Myocardial infarction (MI) within 72 hours prior to the index procedure, defined as
             creatine kinase (CK)-MB &gt; 2 X the local laboratory's upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Any surgery requiring general anesthesia (e.g. coronary artery bypass graft [CABG],
             valve replacement, or abdominal aortic aneurysm) less than or equal to 30 days
             preceding the stent procedure.

          -  The patient is enrolled in another investigational study protocol and has not
             completed the required follow-up period of the evaluation. The patient may not
             participate in another investigational study that may confound the treatment or
             outcomes of the BEACH protocol.
