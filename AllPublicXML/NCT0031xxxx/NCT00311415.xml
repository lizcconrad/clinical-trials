      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity offered by MenCC vaccine when
      administered in different schedules at different years of life: 2 doses in the first year of
      life given 2 months apart (at 2 and 4 months of age), with a booster in the second year of
      life, or 1 dose in the first year of life (at 2 or 6 months of age), with a booster in the
      second year of life, or only 1 dose in the second year of life.
