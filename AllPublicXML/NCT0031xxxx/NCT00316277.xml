  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment outcome for subjects dependent on
      prescription opioid analgesics can be improved by adding individual drug counseling to the
      prescription of buprenorphine/naloxone with standard medical management. This will be
      examined during: a) an initial four-week treatment with taper; b) a 12-week stabilization
      treatment for those who do not respond successfully to the initial treatment; and c) a
      long-term follow-up assessment at 1.5 years, 2.5 years, and 3.5 years after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized 2-phase, open-label; multi-center study conducted in outpatient
      treatment settings. The main objective of this study is to identify an effective sublingual
      buprenorphine/naloxone treatment regimen for subjects dependent on prescription opioids.
      Phase 1 of this study will assess the prevailing one-month detoxification practice. This
      phase will assess the benefits of individual drug counseling in a short-term treatment
      paradigm. The second phase of this study will assess the benefit of individual drug
      counseling in a longer-term treatment paradigm for participants who did not respond
      successfully to the short-term buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. There is also a long-term
      follow-up assessment to determine outcomes at 1.5 years, 2.5 years, and 3.5 years after
      treatment.

    <measure>The Number of Participants Attaining Successful Opioid Use Outcome by Counseling Condition at End of Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In Phase 1, successful outcome was defined as completing week 12 with self-reported opioid use on no more than 4 days in a month, absence of 2 consecutive opioid-positive urine test results, no additional substance use disorder treatment (other than self-help), and no more than 1 missing urine sample during the 12 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks in Phase 2 period (i.e., 24 weeks into the study)</time_frame>
    <description>In phase 2, successful outcome was defined as abstaining from opioids during week 12 (the final week of buprenorphine-naloxone stabilization) and during at least 2 of the previous 3 weeks (weeks 9-11). This outcome measure required substantial improvement but not complete abstinence.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks in Phase 2 period (i.e., 36 weeks into the study)</time_frame>
    <description>A planned secondary outcome, successful outcome at week 24, that is, 8 weeks after completion of buprenorphine-naloxone taper, was defined the same as at week 12 of Phase 2, that is abstinent from opioids during week 24 and at least 2 of the previous 3 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants Attaining Successful Opioid Use Outcomes in Phase 1 by Chronic Pain Condition</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As a planned secondary analysis, we examined the impact of the two Phase 1 stratification variables on the primary end points. Patients were designated at baseline as having current chronic pain if they reported pain &quot;other than everyday kinds of pain&quot; excluding withdrawal-related pain, for at least 3 months.</description>
