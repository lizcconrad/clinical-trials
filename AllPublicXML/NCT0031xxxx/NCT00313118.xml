      Determination of the mean value of oxidative stress parameters in normals and of the plasma
      and serum levels, resp. of malondialdehyde, glutathion and superoxide dismutase in healthy
      subjects.

      In certain situations, free radicals can be generated in an exaggerated manner and can injure
      tissues and organs by interacting with lipids, proteins, or DNA. So, oxidative stress has
      been implicated in a large number of human diseases. To survive, the human body has developed
      a complex, efficient, and highly adaptive antioxidant defense system. The eye is also
      protected against oxidative stress by several mechanisms involving antioxidant enzymes such
      as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as by low-molecular-weight
      antioxidants such as glutathion (GSH) and ascorbate.

      Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, slowly progressive optic neuropathy,
      characterized by excavation of the optic nerve head (ONH) and a distinctive pattern of visual
      field (VF) defects. The disease is multifactorial in origin, so that besides more extensively
      investigated factors oxidative stress has also been proposed as a contributing factor in the
      etiology of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Oxidative stress represents a harmful state
      defined by the presence of pathologic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) relative to
      antioxidant defense.

      Therefore, it would be also important to determine whether there is a relationship between
      circulating levels of the defense parameters to oxidative stress like malondialdehyde, GSH
      and SOD, and the occurrence of POAG.

      Since there are only the limits of variation for these defense parameters available, mean
      values of the plasma levels of malondialdehyde, glutathion and superoxide dismutase will be
      determined in healthy subjects.
