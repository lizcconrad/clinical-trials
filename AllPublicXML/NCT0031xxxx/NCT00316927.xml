      RATIONALE: Giving dexamethasone together with aspirin and diethylstilbestrol may be effective
      in lowering prostate-specific antigen levels and may slow or stop the growth of prostate
      cancer. It is not yet known which schedule of dexamethasone, aspirin, and diethylstilbestrol
      is more effective in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying dexamethasone and aspirin when given
      together with two different schedules of diethylstilbestrol to compare how well they work in
      treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients with locally advanced
           or metastatic prostate cancer treated with dexamethasone and aspirin with delayed vs
           immediate diethylstilbestrol.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1-3), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to
      prior therapy (PSA normalization vs inability to normalize), and bone scan (positive vs
      negative for bony metastases). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (deferred diethylstilbestrol): Patients receive oral dexamethasone and oral
           acetylsalicyclic acid once daily (DA). Subsequent to treatment failure with DA, patients
           continue to receive DA as before in addition to oral diethylstilbestrol once daily
           (DAS). Treatment with DAS continues in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (immediate diethylstilbestrol): Patients receive oral dexamethasone, oral
           acetylsalicyclic acid, and oral diethylstilbestrol once daily (DAS). Treatment continues
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is evaluated monthly during study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients will be accrued for this study.
