    <measure>Event Rate of Composite of Adjudicated Major Bleeding and Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding During the Treatment Period- Treated Participants With Placebo or Apixaban Low Doses</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug (Day 1) to last dose plus 2 days, up to Year 2 of the Study</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding was assessed using the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. Events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Event rate was number of participants with events divided by the number of participants treated, measured as a percentage (%). The primary outcome is based on data for the placebo and 2 apixaban low-dose groups (2.5 mg BID and 10 mg QD) combined across Phase A and Phase B. The analyses of Phase B data across all doses of apixaban are secondary because of the premature termination of the apixaban high-dose groups (10mg BID, 20mg QD) and the resulting lower duration of exposure for these groups.</description>

    <description>Events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC).

    <time_frame>first dose (Day 1) to last dose plus 2 days (or for SAEs, plus 30 days), up to Year 2 of the Study</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding was assessed using the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. Events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Event rate was number of participants with events divided by the number of participants treated (%). All bleeding events includes major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding. Treatment Period refers to the period from first dose through 2 days, or through 30 days for Serious Adverse Event (SAE) tabulations, after discontinuation of study drug. Data in this outcome are combined across Phase A and Phase B.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>1741 enrolled; 1715 randomized. Non-randomization reasons: 6 withdrew consent, 1 death, 1 poor/non-compliance, 18 no longer met study criteria. Phase A: placebo and 2 low doses of apixaban; Phase B: placebo, 2 low doses and 2 high doses of apixaban. High dose arms terminated, Phase B continued to enroll participants into placebo and low dose arms.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Study was conducted in 2 Phases (A and B). A tablet of Placebo along with ≤ 165 mg of aspirin was given daily for 26 weeks. 75 mg of clopidogrel once a day (QD) was allowed at the investigator’s discretion. After 547 subjects were randomized to Phase A, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended expanding the randomization to 2 higher doses of apixaban (10 mg BID and 20 mg QD) in Phase B of the study. Approximately 6 months after the start of Phase B, the DSMB recommended apixaban high dose groups be terminated due to excess bleeding in those participants receiving aspirin and clopidogrel concomitantly with high dose apixaban. Treatment and any new randomization into these 2 groups was halted, while randomization and treatment in the placebo and lower dose apixaban groups continued. Follow-up Period started after Week 26 through 30 days after discontinuation of study drug (for treated participants).</description>

Approximately 6 months after the start of Phase B, the DSMB recommended that the 10 mg BID QD group, be terminated due to excess bleeding for participants receiving aspirin and clopidogrel concomitantly with the 10 mg BID apixaban. Follow-up Period started after Week 26 through 30 days after discontinuation of study drug (for treated participants).</description>

        <title>Event Rate of Composite of Adjudicated Major Bleeding and Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding During the Treatment Period- Treated Participants With Placebo or Apixaban Low Doses</title>
        <description>Bleeding was assessed using the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. Events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Event rate was number of participants with events divided by the number of participants treated, measured as a percentage (%). The primary outcome is based on data for the placebo and 2 apixaban low-dose groups (2.5 mg BID and 10 mg QD) combined across Phase A and Phase B. The analyses of Phase B data across all doses of apixaban are secondary because of the premature termination of the apixaban high-dose groups (10mg BID, 20mg QD) and the resulting lower duration of exposure for these groups.</description>

          <title>Event Rate for Adjudicated All Bleeding Events During the Treatment Period - Treated Participants With Placebo or Apixaban Low Doses</title>
          <description>Bleeding was assessed using the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. Events were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Event rate was number of participants with events divided by the number of participants treated (%). All bleeding events includes major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding. Treatment Period refers to the period from first dose through 2 days, or through 30 days for Serious Adverse Event (SAE) tabulations, after discontinuation of study drug. Data in this outcome are combined across Phase A and Phase B.</description>
          <population>Participants who received at least one dose of placebo or low dose apixaban are summarized. The analyses reported are based on data for the placebo and 2 apixaban low-dose groups (2.5 mg BID and 10 mg QD) combined across Phase A and Phase B.</population>

        <title>Event Rate of Composite of Adjudicated Major Bleeding and Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding During the Phase B Adjusted Treatment Period- Treated Participants Randomized in Phase B</title>
        <description>Bleeding was assessed using ISTH guidelines. Events were adjudicated by the CEC. Event rate was number of participants with events divided by the number of participants treated, measured as a percentage (%). The analyses of Phase B data across all doses of apixaban are secondary because of the premature termination of the apixaban high-dose groups and the lower duration of exposure. Phase B Adjusted Treatment Period=safety events occurring in the period from first dose through 2 days (or through 30 days for SAE tabulations) after the earliest of last dose date or 1-Oct-2007 (termination date for the 10 mg BID group).</description>
