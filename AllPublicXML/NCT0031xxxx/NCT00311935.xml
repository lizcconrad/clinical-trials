  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether laparoscopic and open hernia repair have the same
      recurrence and complication rates in the under 60yr old age group. The overall financial
      costs of each repair will also be compared.

      Study population is Waitemata Health (Auckland New Zealand) patients presenting to clinic
      with unilateral primary inguinal hernia aged less than 60 years, fit for surgery and able to
      consent for the study. Randomized to open mesh repair or laparoscopic preperitoneal mesh
      repair. Two surgeons (Dr Rodgers and Dr Hammodat) using a standardized technique. Conversion
      rates from lap to open will be recorded.

      Phone assessment postop day 1, 1 week and at 6 months. Clinic assessment at 4 weeks, 1 year
      and 2 years.

      Primary outcome is hernia recurrence which will be assessed by a research nurse independent
      of surgeon at each clinic appointment. Assessment to also include assessment of ongoing
      symptoms such as pain/discomfort, sensory disturbance, and sexual dysfunction.

      Quality of life assessment (SF 36 questionnaire) preoperatively and at each assessment.

      Pain assessment 4hrs postop and at all other assessments by score 0-10 and measurement of
      pain relief.

      Cost analysis to include the following parameters: theatre equipment costs, theatre time,
      drug use, hospital stay, time to return to work, time to return to normal activities.

      Interim analysis at 2 years of followup by independent Health and Safety committee. Final
      analysis at 4 years of followup.
