      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a handheld computer is superior to a
      self-help manual for the treatment of chronic primary insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic primary insomnia is a highly prevalent condition, affecting up to 15% of the
      population. The condition is associated with daytime fatigue, lack of concentration, and
      decreased quality of life. Most people with chronic primary insomnia go untreated, because of
      a desire to avoid medication or lack of access to quality non-drug treatments. Therefore, an
      affordable, easy to use, and effective computer to help assess and treat insomnia symptoms
      could bring treatment to this population.

      Comparison: We are comparing a new handheld computer that uses cognitive-behavioral treatment
      principles to a popular self-help manual for the treatment of primary insomnia symptoms.
