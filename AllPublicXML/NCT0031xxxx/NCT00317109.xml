  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of
      diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B virus/Haemophilus influenzae type b
      vaccine (DTPw-HBV/Hib) at 15-18 m and to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and
      reactogenicity of a dose of Mencevax™ Group A, C and W135 polysaccharide meningococcal
      vaccine (ACW) at 24 to 30 m in primed subjects.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open study will have two parallel groups based on the vaccination received in the
      primary study: AC primed Group: primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC vaccine and AC unprimed
      Group (control): primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ vaccine. All subjects will receive a
      booster dose of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ vaccine at 15 to 18 months of age with GSK
      Biological's OPV vaccine given concomitantly and a dose of Mencevax™ ACW vaccine at 24 to 30
      months of age. Blood sampling will be done prior to (pre) and one month after (post) the
      Mencevax™ ACW vaccine administration for immunogenicity analyses. The study will last minimum
      7 to maximum 16 months per subject.

      Mencevax™ ACWY was changed to Mencevax™ ACW throughout the posting to correct an
      inconsistency in the earlier version of the protocol posting and to reflect the actual
      situation.
