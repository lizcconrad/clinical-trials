  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgics frequently report sleep disturbances, in particular poor and unrefreshing
      sleep. Additionally, studies have reported that sleep problems, pain and mood disturbances
      are associated in patients with fibromyalgia. By improving the quality of sleep, complaints
      of poor and unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, pain, which are among the main components of this
      chronic pain disorder may be improved.

      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of 2 doses
      of the investigational product in subjects with sleep disorders with fibromyalgia as compared
      to placebo (a substance which contains no active ingredient). The study will last
      approximately 70 days and will include 7 office visits.
