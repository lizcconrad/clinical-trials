      This is a Phase II, open-label study in male patients with metastatic HRPC.

      Each cycle will be 21 days (3 weeks). Patients will receive the following drugs:

        -  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV given over 1 hour on Day 1.

        -  Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily beginning on Day 1 and continuing until disease
           progression.

        -  Sargramostim 250 mcg/m2 SC on Days 2-15 of each cycle. Patients will be evaluated every
           4 cycles (12 weeks) for response using RECIST criteria. PSA response will be evaluated
           according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) PSA Working Group Criteria. To evaluate
           the safety of this drug combination, patients will be evaluated at each clinic visit for
           adverse events. Toxicities will be assessed per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE
           Version 3.0.

      Those patients achieving stable disease or better will continue therapy. Those patients
      experiencing progressive disease will be taken off study.

      Patients will receive a maximum of 10 cycles of treatment.

             following criteria):

               -  Castration and/or luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist

               -  Antiandrogen therapy (flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, or cyproterone
                  acetate)

                  ketoconazole at least 1 month. If PSA is decreasing, the patient must demonstrate
                  a rising PSA on at least 2 sequential reading at least 2 weeks apart.

          4. Patients must have a serum testosterone &lt;50 ng/dL (if the patient has not undergone
             orchiectomy, he must continue primary androgen deprivation with LHRH analogue).

          5. Patient must fulfill one of the following criteria:

               -  Patients with measurable disease:

             Patients must have disease progression defined by the RECIST criteria.

               -  Patients with no measurable disease:

             Patients with PSA only disease must have an elevated PSA by Consensus Criteria. -OR-

             pelvis), provided that less than 25% of the bone marrow has been treated, and the
             patient has recovered from the acute toxic effects of treatment prior to trial
             enrollment. Irradiation of a symptomatic lesion, or one that may produce disability
             (eg, unstable femur) prior to study initiation is permitted, provided other measurable
             disease is present. Prior radiation treatment must have been completed at least 4
             weeks prior to enrollment. Lesions that have been irradiated in the advanced disease
             setting may not be included as sites of measurable disease.
