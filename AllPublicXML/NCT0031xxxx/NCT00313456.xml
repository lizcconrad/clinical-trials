      This is a single-center, open-label (sequential-group dose-escalation dose-finding) phase I
      study of satraplatin and docetaxel in patients who have received prior chemotherapy regimens.
      Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6 patients, all with chemotherapy-naïve HRPC, will
      be enrolled. Once a recommended dose(s) (RD(s)) for phase 2 studies has/have been determined,
      6 additional patients with chemotherapy-naïve HRPC will be enrolled at the RD to further
      evaluate safety and efficacy.

      RATIONALE:

      Satraplatin is an oral platinum analog that is currently being evaluated in combination with
      prednisone in a phase III clinical trial in patients with HRPC who have progressed following
      one prior chemotherapy regimen.

      Docetaxel is a taxane that is indicated for the treatment of patients with non-small cell
      lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Specifically, it was recently approved in combination
      with prednisone for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).
      Docetaxel administered every 3 weeks was associated with a survival advantage versus
      mitoxantrone. Docetaxel administered weekly showed an improvement in survival versus
      mitoxantrone that was not statistically significant. However, it was better tolerated than
      docetaxel administered every 3 weeks, with significantly less grade 3 and 4 toxicities,
      especially neutropenia. The combination of satraplatin and weekly docetaxel may be a feasible
      regimen for patients with chemotherapy-naïve HRPC and for patients with other malignancies
      for which these medications show activity.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The objective of this study is to determine the optimum doses for satraplatin and weekly
      docetaxel when the 2 drugs are given in combination.
