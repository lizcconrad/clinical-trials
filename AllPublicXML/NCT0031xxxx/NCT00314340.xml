      Characterize the relative abuse liability of a short versus a long acting opioid in chronic
      pain patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial will be conducted providing study
      subjects either hydrocodone/acetaminophen 30mg/975mg, sustained release morphine 45mg or
      placebo on separate GCRC visits. A long acting comparator (slow-release morphine sulfate 45
      mg) will be chosen because of its putative equianalgesic effects to the dose of hydrocodone
      (30 mg) selected. Subjects will participate in the three sessions at the UC Davis/Mather
      Medical Center General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at intervals of 7-10 days. Sessions
      will be approximately 360 min in duration. Subjects will receive either
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen or sustained release morphine around-the-clock for 7-10 days prior
      to the experimental session. At each experimental session, an assessment of abuse liability
      will be completed before the intake of medications, as well as at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240
      minutes after the ingestion of the study medication.

    <description>The subjective effects of the study drug were evaluated with 3 subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI). The subscales studied included Morphine-Benzedrine Group which measured euphoria (0-16 with higher numbers indicating more euphoria), the Phenobarbital-Chorpromazine-Alcohol Group which measured sedation (-3 to +11 with higher scores indicating more sedation), and the Lysergic Acid Diethylmide Group which measured dysphoria and agitation (-4 to +10 with higher scores indicating more dysphoria). This inventory consists of 49 true/ false questions which survey major domains of drug effects. The ARCI was measured at six timepoints. Of interest were trough sedation, peak euphoria, and trough dysphoria.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from the UC Davis Medical Center Pain and VA Northern California Pain Clinics in 2007-8. They had to have had chronic pain for more than 3 months and to have self-escalated their dose of a short-acting opioid (i.e., a combination product containing hydrocodone, codeine, or oxycodone)prescribed to treat their pain.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 55 patients approached, 18 were evaluated, and 14 met entry criteria and were enrolled. Two withdrew before starting the study. One subject withdrew after starting the study because of insufficient pain relief from the study medications leaving 35 visits by 12 patients for analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The subjective effects of the study drug were evaluated with the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI. This inventory consists of 49 true/ false questions which survey major domains of drug effects. Participants indicated the pleasurable effects or desirability of the medications on 4 locally developed drug-liking ratings: craving, liking, strong desire, and “want more pain medication.” Ratings were made on a 100-mm VAS anchored with 0 at the low end and 10 at the high end. Participants also responded to 11 locally developed drug-effect ratings to assess psychoactive effects. Ratings were again made on a 100-mmVAS anchoredwith 0 at the lowend and 10 at the high end for:“on cloud 9,” “high,” “good drug effect,” “bad drug effect,” “impaired,”“stoned,” “sedated,” “confused,” “nauseated from,” “anxious,” and “down”. The rating levels over a six hour period were examined to explore the timing of these effects.</description>

        <title>3 Scores on the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)</title>
        <description>The subjective effects of the study drug were evaluated with 3 subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI). The subscales studied included Morphine–Benzedrine Group which measured euphoria (0-16 with higher numbers indicating more euphoria), the Phenobarbital–Chorpromazine–Alcohol Group which measured sedation (-3 to +11 with higher scores indicating more sedation), and the Lysergic Acid Diethylmide Group which measured dysphoria and agitation (-4 to +10 with higher scores indicating more dysphoria). This inventory consists of 49 true/ false questions which survey major domains of drug effects. The ARCI was measured at six timepoints. Of interest were trough sedation, peak euphoria, and trough dysphoria.</description>

          <description>The subjective effects of the study drug were evaluated with the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI. This inventory consists of 49 true/ false questions which survey major domains of drug effects. Participants indicated the pleasurable effects or desirability of the medications on 4 locally developed drug-liking ratings: craving, liking, strong desire, and “want more pain medication.” Ratings were made on a 100-mm VAS anchored with 0 at the low end and 10 at the high end. Participants also responded to 11 locally developed drug-effect ratings to assess psychoactive effects. Ratings were again made on a 100-mmVAS anchoredwith 0 at the lowend and 10 at the high end for:“on cloud 9,” “high,” “good drug effect,” “bad drug effect,” “impaired,”“stoned,” “sedated,” “confused,” “nauseated from,” “anxious,” and “down”. The rating levels over a six hour period were examined to explore the timing of these effects.</description>
