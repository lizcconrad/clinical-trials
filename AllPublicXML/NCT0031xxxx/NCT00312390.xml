    <textblock>
      The visual disorder of amblyopia affects 2% to 3% of the population. Amblyopia is a
      developmental condition that is characterized by reduced vision of the eye due to the
      presence of a sensory impediment during visual development, such as strabismus (ocular
      misalignment) or anisometropia (unequal refractive error), occurring early in life. Recent
      studies in humans and animals point towards a cortical locus for the processing deficit in
      amblyopia, revealing sensory deficits at the signal cell level that include reduced spatial
      resolution, reduced contrast sensitivity, and a reduced number of binocular neural cells. In
      the retina, however, no abnormalities have yet been reported.

      Like in the brain blood flow in the retina is coupled to neuronal activity. This phenomenon
      has been measured by different study groups with non invasive techniques in the brain and
      retina. We therefore use a Zeiss fundus camera for the assessment of retinal vessel
      diameters. This so called retinal vessel analyzer (RVA) is a combination of a fundus camera
      connected to a high resolution video camera equipped with a software based analyzing system.
      An unprecedented reproducibility and sensitivity of retinal vessel diameter measurements is
      attained with this system. In addition this system allows real time analysis of retinal
      vessels as well as off-line determinations from video tape. A special provocation test, which
      minimizes risk and discomfort to the subject under study is applied through the illumination
      pathway of the fundus camera: Diffuse luminance flicker is used as a stimulus to augment
      intrinsic mechanisms by which the retina can vary the vascular supply, in correspondence with
      local variations of functional activity. This system allows to study the flicker response of
      retinal vessels, which is within a magnitude of 6 to 8%.

      However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Especially
      in the eye it is not clear whether it is an exclusive metabolic effect within the retina and
      the surrounding blood vessels or dependent of central regulatory brain functions.

      The purpose of the current study is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
      flicker evoked responses of retinal blood vessels in humans. It is not clear whether the
      retina of amblyopic eyes can regulate retinal blood flow in response to increased metabolic
      demands as induced during flicking light stimulation. A detail understanding of the metabolic
      and functional processes within the retina of patients with amblyopia is a prerequisite for
      further research to prevent amblyopia.
