      The primary goal of this Stage I therapy development study will be to manualize and test the
      preliminary efficacy of a parenting intervention for drug dependent mothers that aims to
      foster their ability to recognize children's emotional needs at different ages and their
      capacity to be emotionally available to their children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mothers who are physically and/or psychologically dependent upon alcohol and drugs are at
      risk for a wide range of parenting deficits beginning when their children are infants and
      continuing as their children move through school-age and adolescent years. Behavioral parent
      training programs for drug dependent mothers have had limited success in improving
      mother-child relationships or children's psychosocial adjustment. One reason behavioral
      parenting programs may have had limited success is the lack of attention to emotional aspects
      of the mother-child relationship, including (1) mothers' recognition of their children's
      emotional needs and (2) mothers' capacity to respond sensitively to their children's
      emotional cues. Research on attachment suggests that the emotional quality of the early
      mother-child relationship has important implications for many developmental capacities,
      including emotional and behavior regulation in early years, and social competence academic
      achievement in school-aged and adolescent years. In this Stage I therapy development study,
      we propose to modify a previously piloted attachment-based group parenting intervention
      called Emotionally-Responsive Parenting Group or ERP. The goal of the intervention is to
      improve the mother's capacity to recognize and sensitively respond to her child's emotional
      cues. In a pre-pilot study (see Preliminary Study 6) we tested the feasibility of conducting
      the ERP group intervention as an adjunct group treatment for 23 primarily cocaine-dependent
      mothers in outpatient drug treatment and found that ERP was highly feasible and showed
      initial promise for improving maternal recognition of emotional cues. In this study, we aim
      to modify and validate the intervention as an individual therapy for drug dependent mothers
      of children ages 18 to 36 months in preparation for a Stage II controlled efficacy trial.

      More specifically, we will:

        1. Develop and modify a 12-session ERP individual therapy for drug dependent mothers
           enrolled in outpatient drug treatment have custody of a child between 18 and 36 months
           of age. Fifteen mothers enrolled in outpatient drug treatment will participate in this
           phase of the ERP manual's development.

        2. Develop and implement a therapist training and supervision program for delivery of the
           ERP manualized treatment. This phase will include the development of ERP adherence and
           competence rating scales.

        3. Conduct a randomized, controlled pilot study to determine the potential feasibility,
           acceptability, and efficacy of ERP compared with, Parent Education (PE), a 12-week
           comparison condition in which mothers will attend 12 1-hour parent education sessions
           conducted by a paraprofessional. Sixty mothers enrolled in outpatient drug treatment who
           have at least one child between the ages of 18 and 36 months in their custody will
           participate. Because the intervention will directly target change in maternal
           psychological representations of parenting, primary outcomes will be (a) maternal
           'reflective functioning' (capacity to make inferences about emotional cues, (b) capacity
           for balanced psychological representations of the child, and (c) knowledge of the
           child's developmental capacities. The intervention will indirectly target maternal and
           child behavior and maternal psychosocial adjustment. Secondary outcomes will be:
           maternal sensitivity to her child's emotional cues, the child's use of the mother as a
           secure base, and maternal psychiatric distress, daily functioning and substance abuse.

        4. Explore the impact of process variables on outcomes, and potential mediator and
           moderator effects.. Process variables will be: (a) attendance, (b) therapeutic alliance,
           (c) therapist adherence and competence and (d) use of additional treatment services.

    <measure>Maternal Capacity for Reflective Functioning (Assessed With the Parent Development Interview)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment and 6-week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Development Interview (PDI) was used to measure maternal capacity to mentalize about her own and her child's behavior. The PDI is a 1 hour semi-structured interview designed to elicit the mother's narrative about commonly occurring, emotionally-challenging aspects of parenting. A rating of 1 indicates a absence of recognition of mental states. A rating of 3 indicates a limited capacity to acknowledge mental states. A rating of 5 indicates the presence of a rudimentary capacity for reflective functioning.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Maternal Representations of the Child (Assessed With the Working Model of the Child Interview)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment, 6-week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Working Model of the Child Interview (WMCI; Zeanah &amp; Benoit, 1993) is a 1.5 hour interview used to elicit a narrative description of the mother's perceptions of her child and their relationship. The rater was trained to reliably code 6 qualitative subscales: Openness, Richness, Coherence, Caregiving Sensitivity and Acceptance and Involvement. On the mean of six subscales, a score of three is considered to represent average representational quality, scores of 1 and 2 are considered to represent clinical risk and scores of 4 and 5 are considered to represent optimal quality.</description>

    <measure>Maternal Caregiving Behavior (Assessed With the NCAST Teaching Scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment, 6-week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers choose a task to teach the child in a 5 minute teaching session. Maternal behavior is coded on 4 dimensions: Sensitivity to Cues, Response to Distress, Social-Emotional Growth Fostering, &amp; Cognitive Growth Fostering. The Total Caregiver Score is the sum of the 4 subscale scores (73 items) with scores ranging from 0 to 73. The Total Caregiver Contingency Score is the sum of 20 items from the 4 subscales that involve the caregiver's contingent response to child cues (scores range from 0 to 20). Higher score are better and lower scores are worse. For mothers with high school education (which a majority in our sample had) here are the normative means (SDs) reported in the scoring manual: Total Caregiver Score = 40.69 (6.85), Sensitivity to Cues = 9.16 (1.62), Response to Distress = 10.04 (1.78), Social-Emotional Growth = 8.99 (1.83), Cognitive Growth = 12.51 (3).</description>

    <measure>Child Behavior (Assessed With the NCAST Teaching Scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment and 6-wk follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Child behavior with the mother was assessed using the Clarity of Cues and the Responsiveness to Caregiver Subscales from the NCAST Teaching Scales. The Child Total Score is the sum of the 2 scales (23 items) with scores ranging from 0 to 23. The Child Contingency Score is the sum of 12 contingent items from the 2 scales (with scores ranging from 0 - 12). The 2 subscores are summed to arrive at the composite score. Higher scores are better. The normative means for the children of high school educated mothers reported in the scoring manual: Total Child Score = 15.44 (4.29), Clarity of Cues = 7.99 (1.49), Responsiveness to Parent = 7.45 (3.16).</description>

    <measure>Maternal Depression (Measured With the Beck Depression Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment and 6-wk follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) was used to assess maternal symptoms of depression. The BDI is a widely used 21-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point scale and yields a total score ranging from 0 to 63: scores between 13 and 19 indicate mild depression; scores between 20 and 28 indicate moderate levels of depression, and scores between 29 and 63 indicate severe levels of depression (Beck et al., 1996).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal Psychiatric Distress (Assessed With the Brief Symptom Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment and 6-wk follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1993) was used to assess maternal global psychiatric distress. The BSI is a standardized, widely used, 53-item, 5-point, self-report measure of psychopathology. The composite Global Severity Index (GSI) measures current overall symptomatology across multiple domains and has demonstrated good reliability and validityT-scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores within one standard deviation (ie. a T-score of 10) above the mean on any dimension are regarded as being within the normal range on that dimension (Derogatis, 1993). These scores were converted to T-scores using data from the scoring manual. The higher the scores are worse.T scores above 60 on the GSI indicate risk for a clinical disorder.</description>

    <measure>Maternal Substance Abuse (Assessed With Urine Toxicology Screens)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment and 6-wk follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal substance use was monitored weekly using results from weekly urine toxicology (UTOX) screens testing for presence of opiate, cocaine, and cannabis metabolites in urine samples collected at the outpatient clinic. For each month of the mother's participation in the study, a mother received a score of &quot;0&quot; if no drug metabolites were present in any of her urine toxicology screens during that month or a score of &quot;1&quot; if one or more of her urine toxicology screens tested positive for a drug metabolite during that month. A percentage was calculated by= number of positive substance tests/number of total test *100 for each patients during each month.</description>

    <description>This 12 session individual therapy aims to enhance maternal reflective functioning and soften harsh and distorted mental representations about the child. The intervention adopts a developmental progression based on attachment theory, supporting the mother in her parenting role and offering assistance with basic needs. Mothers are encouraged to reflect on their thoughts and feelings and how they affect behavior. The therapist assists mother's thinking about representations of herself as a parent and encourages her to explore opportunities for new understanding of her emotional needs. Therapist and mother explore representations of her child and their relationship in detail in order to understand their meaning and promote more balanced representations and affect regulation. Therapist and mother also explore child's emotional experiences underlying behavior. The goal is to support the mother in becoming more aware of her child's emotional needs.</description>

    <description>This 12 session comparison intervention was designed to match the Maternal Mentalizing Therapy on time spent with the counselor and maternal expectations for help with parenting. PE counselors helped mothers get connected to services (e.g. medical and pediatric care, child care and child guidance services, housing assistance, vocational training), solve problems of daily living and make parenting-related decisions. PE mothers also received a pamphlet each week on a parenting topic of their choice. Pamphlets focused on common issues in caring for infants (e.g., soothing a crying baby, managing bedtime routines, and establishing routines ) and toddlers (e.g., helping toddlers dress, managing bedtime battles, managing difficult behavior in public, and setting limits without using punishment). Pamphlets provided behavioral guidance at a 5th grade reading level without reference to underlying mental states or emotional needs.</description>

          <title>Mentalizing Therapy for Mothers</title>
          <description>This 12 session individual therapy aims to enhance maternal reflective functioning and soften harsh and distorted mental representations about the child. The intervention adopts a developmental progression based on attachment theory, supporting the mother in her parenting role and offering assistance with basic needs. Mothers are encouraged to reflect on their thoughts and feelings and how they affect behavior. The therapist assists mother's thinking about representations of herself as a parent and encourages her to explore opportunities for new understanding of her emotional needs. Therapist and mother explore representations of her child and their relationship in detail in order to understand their meaning and promote more balanced representations and affect regulation. Therapist and mother also explore child’s emotional experiences underlying behavior. The goal is to support the mother in becoming more aware of her child’s emotional needs.</description>

          <description>This 12 session comparison intervention was designed to match the Maternal Mentalizing Therapy on time spent with the counselor and maternal expectations for help with parenting. PE counselors helped mothers get connected to services (e.g. medical and pediatric care, child care and child guidance services, housing assistance, vocational training), solve problems of daily living and make parenting-related decisions. PE mothers also received a pamphlet each week on a parenting topic of their choice. Pamphlets focused on common issues in caring for infants (e.g., soothing a crying baby, managing bedtime routines, and establishing routines ) and toddlers (e.g., helping toddlers dress, managing bedtime battles, managing difficult behavior in public, and setting limits without using punishment). Pamphlets provided behavioral guidance at a 5th grade reading level without reference to underlying mental states or emotional needs.</description>

        <description>The Parent Development Interview (PDI) was used to measure maternal capacity to mentalize about her own and her child’s behavior. The PDI is a 1 hour semi-structured interview designed to elicit the mother’s narrative about commonly occurring, emotionally-challenging aspects of parenting. A rating of 1 indicates a absence of recognition of mental states. A rating of 3 indicates a limited capacity to acknowledge mental states. A rating of 5 indicates the presence of a rudimentary capacity for reflective functioning.</description>

        <description>The Working Model of the Child Interview (WMCI; Zeanah &amp; Benoit, 1993) is a 1.5 hour interview used to elicit a narrative description of the mother’s perceptions of her child and their relationship. The rater was trained to reliably code 6 qualitative subscales: Openness, Richness, Coherence, Caregiving Sensitivity and Acceptance and Involvement. On the mean of six subscales, a score of three is considered to represent average representational quality, scores of 1 and 2 are considered to represent clinical risk and scores of 4 and 5 are considered to represent optimal quality.</description>

        <title>Maternal Caregiving Behavior (Assessed With the NCAST Teaching Scales)</title>
        <description>Mothers choose a task to teach the child in a 5 minute teaching session. Maternal behavior is coded on 4 dimensions: Sensitivity to Cues, Response to Distress, Social-Emotional Growth Fostering, &amp; Cognitive Growth Fostering. The Total Caregiver Score is the sum of the 4 subscale scores (73 items) with scores ranging from 0 to 73. The Total Caregiver Contingency Score is the sum of 20 items from the 4 subscales that involve the caregiver’s contingent response to child cues (scores range from 0 to 20). Higher score are better and lower scores are worse. For mothers with high school education (which a majority in our sample had) here are the normative means (SDs) reported in the scoring manual: Total Caregiver Score = 40.69 (6.85), Sensitivity to Cues = 9.16 (1.62), Response to Distress = 10.04 (1.78), Social-Emotional Growth = 8.99 (1.83), Cognitive Growth = 12.51 (3).</description>

For mothers with high school education (which a majority in our sample had) here are the normative means (SDs) reported in the scoring manual: Total Caregiver Score = 40.69 (6.85), Sensitivity to Cues = 9.16 (1.62), Response to Distress = 10.04 (1.78), Social-Emotional Growth = 8.99 (1.83), Cognitive Growth = 12.51 (3).</description>

The Child Total Score is the sum of the 2 scales (23 items) with scores ranging from 0 to 23. The Child Contingency Score is the sum of 12 contingent items from the 2 scales (with scores ranging from 0 - 12). The 2 subscores are summed to arrive at the composite score. Higher scores are better. The normative means for the children of high school educated mothers reported in the scoring manual: Total Child Score = 15.44 (4.29), Clarity of Cues = 7.99 (1.49), Responsiveness to Parent = 7.45 (3.16).</description>

            <description>This 12 session individual therapy aims to enhance maternal reflective functioning and soften harsh and distorted mental representations about the child. The intervention adopts a developmental progression based on attachment theory, supporting the mother in her parenting role and offering assistance with basic needs. Mothers are encouraged to reflect on their thoughts and feelings and how they affect behavior. The therapist assists mother's thinking about representations of herself as a parent and encourages her to explore opportunities for new understanding of her emotional needs. Therapist and mother explore representations of her child and their relationship in detail in order to understand their meaning and promote more balanced representations and affect regulation. Therapist and mother also explore child's emotional experiences underlying behavior. The goal is to support the mother in becoming more aware of her child's emotional needs.</description>

            <description>This 12 session comparison intervention was designed to match the Maternal Mentalizing Therapy on time spent with the counselor and maternal expectations for help with parenting. PE counselors helped mothers get connected to services (e.g. medical and pediatric care, child care and child guidance services, housing assistance, vocational training), solve problems of daily living and make parenting-related decisions. PE mothers also received a pamphlet each week on a parenting topic of their choice. Pamphlets focused on common issues in caring for infants (e.g., soothing a crying baby, managing bedtime routines, and establishing routines ) and toddlers (e.g., helping toddlers dress, managing bedtime battles, managing difficult behavior in public, and setting limits without using punishment). Pamphlets provided behavioral guidance at a 5th grade reading level without reference to underlying mental states or emotional needs.</description>

        <title>Maternal Substance Abuse (Assessed With Urine Toxicology Screens)</title>
        <description>Maternal substance use was monitored weekly using results from weekly urine toxicology (UTOX) screens testing for presence of opiate, cocaine, and cannabis metabolites in urine samples collected at the outpatient clinic. For each month of the mother’s participation in the study, a mother received a score of “0” if no drug metabolites were present in any of her urine toxicology screens during that month or a score of “1” if one or more of her urine toxicology screens tested positive for a drug metabolite during that month. A percentage was calculated by= number of positive substance tests/number of total test *100 for each patients during each month.</description>
        <time_frame>post-treatment and 6-wk follow up</time_frame>
        <population>Data analysis was conducted for ITT sample. Baseline data was available for 47 mothers. Missing post-tx and follow up scores for mothers who left treatment early were estimated as equal to baseline scores. Post-tx and follow up scores for mothers who completed treatment but not post-tx or follow up visits were estimated as equal to tx group means.</population>

            <title>Mentalizing Therapy for Mothers</title>
            <description>This 12 session individual therapy aims to enhance maternal reflective functioning and soften harsh and distorted mental representations about the child. The intervention adopts a developmental progression based on attachment theory, supporting the mother in her parenting role and offering assistance with basic needs. Mothers are encouraged to reflect on their thoughts and feelings and how they affect behavior. The therapist assists mother's thinking about representations of herself as a parent and encourages her to explore opportunities for new understanding of her emotional needs. Therapist and mother explore representations of her child and their relationship in detail in order to understand their meaning and promote more balanced representations and affect regulation. Therapist and mother also explore child's emotional experiences underlying behavior. The goal is to support the mother in becoming more aware of her child's emotional needs.</description>

            <description>This 12 session comparison intervention was designed to match the Maternal Mentalizing Therapy on time spent with the counselor and maternal expectations for help with parenting. PE counselors helped mothers get connected to services (e.g. medical and pediatric care, child care and child guidance services, housing assistance, vocational training), solve problems of daily living and make parenting-related decisions. PE mothers also received a pamphlet each week on a parenting topic of their choice. Pamphlets focused on common issues in caring for infants (e.g., soothing a crying baby, managing bedtime routines, and establishing routines ) and toddlers (e.g., helping toddlers dress, managing bedtime battles, managing difficult behavior in public, and setting limits without using punishment). Pamphlets provided behavioral guidance at a 5th grade reading level without reference to underlying mental states or emotional needs.</description>
