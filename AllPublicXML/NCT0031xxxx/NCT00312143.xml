        Inclusion criteria

          1. Males and females aged 18 to 75 years.

          2. Recipients of living related kidney transplant, treated with cyclosporine, with or
             without corticosteroids, as primary immunosuppression.

          3. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to or at screening. Effective contraception must be used during the trial,
             and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of the study medication, even where there
             has been a history of infertility.

          4. Patients who are willing and able to participate in the full course of the study and
             from whom written informed consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Multi-organ recipients (e.g. kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any
             organ, other than kidney.

          2. Patients with any known hypersensitivity to other components of the formulation (e.g.
             lactose).

          3. Patients with low platelet count (&lt; 75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of
             &lt; 1,500/mm3, and/or leukocytopenia (&lt; 2,500/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL at
             screening or baseline.

          4. Patients who have received an investigational drug within four weeks prior to study
             entry.

          5. Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except excised
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

          6. Females of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are
             pregnant and/or lactating, who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception.
