    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two newly developed computer programs, Integrated
      Biobehavioral Monitoring and Feedback (IBMF) IBMF-1 and IBMF-2. The computer programs are
      considered experimental. Both computer programs are being tested to see if they are useful in
      helping people with type 1 diabetes avoid low blood sugar episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomized into group A or group B matched by gender, age, and baseline HbA1c.
      Group A began with routine self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) alone (level 1), followed
      sequentially by IBMF-1 (level 2) and IBMF-2 (level 3). Group B began with level 2, followed
      by level 3 and then level 1.

      Each level continued for 3 months and proceeded as follows: level 1 was routine SMBG.
      Subjects were given LifeScan OneTouch UltraSmart meters (LifeScan Inc., Milpitas, CA) and
      free strips, and asked to perform SMBG four to five times per day. No additional instructions
      about the timing of SMBG or the interpretation of the data were given. No changes to
      treatment were recommended. At each visit, the subject was only asked about any health
      concerns or any new medications or change in insulin. This information was recorded but not
      used for feedback. Thus, level 1 should be regarded as a control condition, which was
      different from routine SMBG only because subjects were enrolled in a study and given free
      test strips.

      IBMF-1 (level 2) retained level 1, but an HHC (hand-held computer) was given to the subjects,
      programmed to estimate HbA1c, risk for hypoglycemia (Low BG Index, LBGI), and glucose
      variability (Average Daily Risk Range, ADRR) using previously published algorithms. The
      subjects were asked to carry the HHC and enter all their glucose readings when per- forming
      SMBG. The estimates of HbA1c were updated weekly, and the estimates of risk for hypoglycemia
      and glucose variability were updated at each SMBG entry. Detailed instructions were provided
      on the meaning of these different types of glucose feedback; the study staff was available to
      answer any questions.

      IBMF-2 (level 3) retained level 2, but the HHC asked subjects to provide symptom ratings when
      BG (blood glucose) was low and at an equal number of matching euglycemic readings. From these
      data, the HHC estimated a set of potentially significant symptoms of hypoglycemia for each
      individual, using an iterative algorithm following a previously published symptom
      significance estimation procedure. The patient manual for the HHC program is provided in
      supplementary data of published manuscript.

        <time_frame>1 year (each level lasted 3 months)</time_frame>
        <population>All 120 participants were analyzed; data for subjects who dropped out during the study were handled according to the intention-to-treat principle, using “dropout” as a factor and adjusting significance levels accordingly. Below data for the 97 participants who completed the 1-year protocol are shown.</population>

            <title>Experimental Groups A and B</title>
            <description>Group A: SMBG alone (level 1), followed sequentially by levels 2 and 3. Group B: Level 2, followed by level 3 and then level 1.
Each level continued for 3 months.
IBMF-1 (level 2) retained level 1, but an HHC (hand-held computer) was given to the subjects, programmed to estimate HbA1c, risk for hypoglycemia, and glucose variability. The subjects were asked to carry the HHC and enter all their glucose readings when performing SMBG. The estimates of HbA1c were updated weekly, and the estimates of risk for hypoglycemia and glucose variability were updated at each SMBG entry.
IBMF-2 (level 3) retained level 2, but the HHC asked subjects to provide symptom ratings when BG (blood glucose) was low and at an equal number of matching euglycemic readings. From these data, the HHC estimated a set of potentially significant symptoms of hypoglycemia for each individual, using an iterative algorithm following a previously published symptom significance estimation procedure.</description>

          <title>IBMF-1</title>
          <description>IBMF-1 will use the OneTouch® UltraSmart® glucometer (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA) to collect routine SMBG data and the subject transfers the blood glucose (BG) value into a hand-held computer (HHC) for processing. As the subject checks BG on a daily basis, the IBMF-1 software calculates an estimate of HbA1c, acute risk for hypoglycemia and chronic risk for hypoglycemia. This information will be presented back to the subject. Specifically, (i) alarms for immediate action if BG&lt;50 mg/dL is registered; (ii) a running HbA1c estimate (71); (iii) a warning to be more careful and measure BG more frequently over the next 24 hours if elevated acute risk for hypoglycemia is found, and (iv) an indication of the subject's chronic risk for hypoglycemia in one of 4 categories (minimal, low, moderate, and high). At moderate and high risk the subject will be prompted to consider altering his/her behavior. HbA1c and chronic risk change slowly (2-3 weeks), while acute risk can change daily.</description>
