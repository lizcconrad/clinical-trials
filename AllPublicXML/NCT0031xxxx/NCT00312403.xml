  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) fulfill diverse important molecular functions and play
      pivotal roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, repair, aging, and inflammatory
      processes. MMPs are also important disease modulating factors, such as cancer, cardiovascular
      disease, rheumatoid arthritis or macular degeneration. Functional genetic variants have been
      described to fine-tune MMP activities at the gene transcriptional level and have been
      associated with increased genetic risk of e.g. arteriosclerosis or cancer. MMPs are also
      assumed to play a major role in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the optic
      nerve head during glaucomatous optic neuropathy. MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 have been shown to be
      up-regulated in a variety of animal models of glaucoma. Here, we study three promoter SNPs
      within the genes encoding three members of the MMP family. By assessing the prevalence of
      genetic variants associated with either increased/decreased enzyme activity, we will (i)
      estimate their contribution to the genetic risk of developing primary open angle glaucoma
      (POAG) and (ii) investigate the potential role of MMPs in the functional pathology of POAG.
