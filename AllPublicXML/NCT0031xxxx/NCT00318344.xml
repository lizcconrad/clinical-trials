  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For thousands of years people in the South Pacific have used Atuna racemosa extract as a
      topical anti-inflammatory. We, the researchers at the Mayo Clinic, have shown this extract to
      also have antibacterial properties. While this extract has been used for decades in the South
      Pacific, a controlled clinical trial to evaluate toxicity has never been performed.
