      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of OPC-6535 (tetomilast) and
      to determine its optimal dose by once-daily oral administration at 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg for
      8 weeks in combination with a fixed oral dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients
      with active ulcerative colitis.
