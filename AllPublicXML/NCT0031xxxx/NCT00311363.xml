  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the maintenance of efficacy of gabapentin
      enacarbil (GEn, XP13512) taken once daily in the long-term treatment of patients suffering
      from Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a multicenter, blinded, randomized withdrawal study in subjects with primary
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Eligible subjects were initially enrolled in a 24-week single
      blind (SB) treatment period during which they received XP13512. Subjects who completed the
      initial treatment period and met the responder criteria were then randomized 1:1 to receive
      either XP13512 or placebo during the 12-week double-blind (DB) treatment period. The primary
      study objective was to assess the maintenance of efficacy of XP13512 1200 mg taken once daily
      in the long-term treatment of subjects with primary RLS. The secondary study objectives were
      to assess maintenance of improvements in sleep outcomes and quality of life, and to assess
      the safety and tolerability of XP13512 in the treatment of primary RLS subjects.

    <time_frame>Randomization (Week 24) and Week 36 (or end of DB treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS Rating scale is a measure of RLS disease severity and reflects the participant-reported assessment of primary sensory and motor features and associated sleep problems in RLS. Items are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants' mood, daily life, and activities. The total score ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement. LOCF: Missing data (MD) values were imputed using the last non-missing observation prior to the visit with MD; randomization visit data could be carried forward.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced a Relapse During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Relapse was defined as worsening of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) symptoms or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy during the 12-week double-blind (DB) treatment period (the period from Randomization on Visit 14 [Week 24] through the end of treatment). Worsening of symptoms was defined as an increase in the total International RLS (IRLS) Scale score by at least 6 or more points relative to the participant's score at Randomization, achieving an IRLS score of at least 15, and an assessment of &quot;much worse&quot; or &quot;very much worse&quot; on the investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Randomization to Week 36 (or End of Treatment) in the IRLS Rating Scale (IRLS) Total Score Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The IRLS Rating scale is a measure of RLS disease severity and reflects the participant-reported assessment of primary sensory and motor features and associated sleep problems in RLS. Items are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants’ mood, daily life, and activities. The total score ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement. LOCF: Missing data (MD) values were imputed using the last non-missing observation prior to the visit with MD; randomization visit data could be carried forward.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Responded to Treatment Based on Scores on the Investigator-Rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Scale as a Dichotomous Variable at Week 36 (DB Treatment Phase) Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The CGI-C scale is a widely used tool designed to allow clinicians to rate the severity of illness and the change over time based on a seven-point rating scale, with a score of 1 being “very much improved” and a score of 7 being “very much worse” compared to baseline. For this endpoint, “response” on the CGI-C was defined as participants with a rating of “no change,” (score of 4) ”minimally improved,” (score of 3) “much improved,” (score of 2) or “very much improved” (score of 1) compared to Randomization (Week 24).</description>

        <description>The MOS Sleep Scale is a participant-rated non-disease-specific measure with questions relating to four areas related to sleep: quantity (hours slept), sleep disturbance, sleep adequacy, and daytime somnolence. Responses are recoded so that a higher score reflects more of the attribute, and then converted to a 0 to 100 scale. The daytime somnolence score is based on questions pertaining to feeling drowsy or sleepy, trouble staying awake, and taking naps &gt; 5 minutes. For daytime somnolence, a negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The RLS QoL is an 18-item scale assessing the impact of RLS on daily life, emotional well-being, social and work life. Responses range from 1 (not at all/never) to 5 (a lot/all of the time). Ten items contribute to a single summary score, the Overall Life Impact, which is standardized to range from 0-100, with lower scores representing better QoL.</description>

        <title>Median Time to Onset of First RLS Symptoms Using the 24-hour RLS Symptom Record at Week 36 (DB Treatment Phase)</title>
        <description>The 24-hour RLS Record is a diary in which participants report the presence and severity of RLS symptoms (none, mild, moderate, or severe) for a 24-hour period, in 30-min increments beginning at 8AM on the day prior to the visit. Note: The median is not estimable with Kaplan-Meier methodology when fewer than 50% of participants experience an event; thus, no data are presented for the DB GEn 1200 mg arm.</description>

        <description>The IRLS Rating scale is a measure of disease severity. The scale reflects participant-reported assessment of sensory and motor features and associated sleep problems in RLS. In addition, items are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants’ mood, daily life, and activities. Total score ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 24 (SB Treatment Period) in the Mean Daytime Somnolence Domain Score of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The MOS Sleep Scale is a participant-rated non-disease-specific measure with questions relating to four areas related to sleep: quantity (hours slept), sleep disturbance, sleep adequacy, and daytime somnolence. Responses are recoded so that a higher score reflects more of the attribute, and then converted to a 0 to 100 scale. The daytime somnolence score is based on questions pertaining to feeling drowsy or sleepy, trouble staying awake, and taking naps &gt; 5 minutes. For daytime somnolence, a negative value indicates an improvement.</description>

Participants rated overall sleep quality and their ability to function on scales ranging from “excellent” to “poor” and were asked to provide the number of nights they experienced RLS symptoms and the number of times/hours they awoke at night during the week prior to the measurement.</description>
