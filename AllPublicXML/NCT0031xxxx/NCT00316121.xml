    <description>Success is bridging bone, slip of study level versus adjacent levels less than 3 millimeters, angulation less than 5 degrees, 15 point increase in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (how back/leg trouble affects activities of daily living), no new problems in motor strength in legs, presence/absence of pain on leg raise, sensation intact on thigh/leg/foot reflexes of the knees/ankles, no permanent/serious complications, no revision/removal/reoperation/supplemental fixation. The ODI is on a 6 point scale from 0 (no pain/no impact on duties) to 5 (worst pain ever/unable to perform duties).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were enrolled from 3Apr06 to 31Dec07. Subjects were seen at medical clinics/hospitals, usually by their regular doctor and not found through ads. Subjects were asked to enroll if they were having back surgery for back pain. Enrollment was stopped for administrative reasons at 138 subjects; the per protocol plan was at least 350 subjects.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>220 subjects were screened and 82 were excluded (59 did not meet criteria and 23 refused participation).Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications or cyclooxygenase-II (COX-2) inhibitors (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that directly targets COX-2, an enzyme responsible for inflammation and pain) at time of surgery were exclusionary.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>HEALOS</title>
          <description>HEALOS is a synthetic bone graft material made of collagen (a fibrous protein) and hydroxyapatite (a natural mineral structure). The collagen is a bovine derivative (obtained from cows). HEALOS is similar to what is found in natural bone and has the clearance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in filling bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system. It is combined with bone marrow (a vascular or vessel-like tissue found in the cavity of bone) to form new bone. HEALOS with bone marrow aspirate is currently available for use in a procedure where rods and screws are placed in the back with graft material to fuse the vertebrae.
The Leopard cage is a spinal implant made of a material called carbon fiber. HEALOS, when used with the Leopard Cage is an investigational device. An investigational device is one that is being tested and has not yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the use in which it is being tested.</description>

            <title>HEALOS</title>
            <description>HEALOS is a synthetic bone graft material made of collagen (a fibrous protein) and hydroxyapatite (a natural mineral structure). The collagen is a bovine derivative (obtained from cows). HEALOS is similar to what is found in natural bone and has the clearance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in filling bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system. It is combined with bone marrow (a vascular or vessel-like tissue found in the cavity of bone) to form new bone. HEALOS with bone marrow aspirate is currently available for use in a procedure where rods and screws are placed in the back with graft material to fuse the vertebrae.
The Leopard cage is a spinal implant made of a material called carbon fiber. HEALOS, when used with the Leopard Cage is an investigational device. An investigational device is one that is being tested and has not yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the use in which it is being tested.</description>
