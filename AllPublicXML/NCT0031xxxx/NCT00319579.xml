  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation, a 'miracle' of modern medicine, is the preferred treatment option for
      End Stage Renal Disease compared to dialysis, patients who receive kidneys have a 70%
      reduction in risk of death, a dramatically improved quality of life and cost the health care
      system considerably less. As a result there are over 3000 Canadians, and 57,000 Americans on
      the waiting list for a kidney. To meet the shortage in cadaveric kidneys, rates of living
      kidney donation have nearly doubled over the last 10 years, and will continue to rise with
      growing demand.

      Yet despite its advantages for the recipient, living kidney donation remains a complex
      ethical, moral and medical issue. The premise for accepting living donors is that the
      &quot;minimal&quot; risk of short and long-term medical harm realized by the donor is outweighed by the
      definite advantages to the recipient and potential psychosocial benefits of the altruistic
      gift to the donor. The only benefit for the living donor is psychological - donors experience
      increased self-esteem, feelings of well-being and improved health related quality of life
      with their altruistic act of assuming medical risk to help another. The short-term
      consequences of living donation are well established. On the other hand the long-term
      implications of living kidney donation are far less certain. This study will look at the long
      term implications of living kidney donation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than 18 years old

          2. A predicted Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance &gt; 80 mL/min

          3. Average sBP &lt; 140 and dBP &lt; 90 based on 3 readings

          4. A spot urine protein to creatinine ratio &lt; 15 mg/mmol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A medical condition (such as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, active cancer)
             or psychological condition (such as major affective disorder, personality disorder, a
             history of chemical dependence) which the local transplant centre deems unfit for
             donation. Blood group and immunological incompatibility (such as positive cross-match,
             poor HLA matches) are not reasons for exclusion

          2. Evidence of a financial incentive for donation

          3. A contraindication to general anaesthesia or surgery

          4. A past medical history of hypertension

          5. Use of antihypertensive class medications for any reason.(ACE-Is, ARBs, diuretics,
             beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers)

          6. A past history of permanent proteinuria

          7. The eligible non-donor is planning to donate their kidney within the next year

          8. Unable to give informed consent

          9. Unwilling to participate in the follow-up assessments at one, two, three, four and
             five years, or unwilling or unable to conduct home blood pressure or laboratory
             measurements

         10. The living donor or eligible non-donor is currently pregnant

         11. Despite being planned the donor nephrectomy does not take place

         12. Enrolled in another clinical study which interferes with the conduct or outcomes of
             this study
