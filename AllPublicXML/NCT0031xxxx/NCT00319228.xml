      To assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a plasma-derived AT-III concentrate in
      the treatment of subjects with congenital AT-III deficiency.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, unblinded, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center Phase
      II/III study with 2 segments, i.e. a PK evaluation (Segment I), and an assessment of
      prophylaxis in surgical interventions and pregnancy/delivery, (Segment II). During the PK
      segment, the subjects would remain on their current anticoagulation therapy except for
      subjects on heparin therapy where a wash-out period of at least 5 half lives would be
      required. In total, 15 subjects with congenital ATIII Deficiency will be enrolled for the PK
      assessment (Segment I).

      For Segment II, fifteen episodes will be treated. Recruitment of individual subjects with
      high risk for venous thrombosis for Segment II of this study is necessary because of the
      rarity of Antithrombin deficiency in the population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Congenital ATIII deficiency documented by determination of plasma levels of ATIII off
             all therapies. Specifically, the baseline levels of ATIII activity should be equal to
             or less than 60%.

          -  Age &gt; 12 years with a body weight of no less than 30 kg.

          -  Have not participated in another investigational study for at least 30 days For
             Segment II, enrollment requires a pregnancy/delivery or a surgical procedure (it
             should be a major surgery although data from a minor surgery will also be collected).

          -  Documented personal history of major thromboembolic or thrombotic event.

          -  Male or female

          -  HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV and PARVO B19 status known prior to entry.

          -  The subject is willing to comply with all aspects of the protocol, including blood
             sampling, for the duration of the study.

          -  The subject has signed an informed consent form (if at least 18 years old), or the
             subject's parent or legal guardian has signed the informed consent form. Subjects
             below the age of 18 years will also be asked to sign an assent form. All consent and
             assent forms must be approved in advance by the Institutional Review Board of the
             investigator's institution.

          -  Patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia who require anticoagulation with
             non-heparin containing drugs will be eligible if they can be safely transitioned
             during the washout period for the Segment I PK study.

          -  If pregnant, a woman must be Parvo B19 IgG antibody positive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acquired deficiency of ATIII

          -  Receiving concomitant treatment for thrombophilic disorders other than ATIII
             deficiency

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol requirements

          -  History of anaphylactic reaction(s) to blood or blood components

          -  Allergies to excipients.

          -  Liver function tests &gt;/= 2.5 X ULN

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.2 X ULN

          -  Urine &gt;/= 2+ protein with urine dipstick test.

          -  The subject is known to have abused alcohol or illicit drugs within the past 12
             months.

          -  The subject is unlikely to adhere to the protocol requirements of the study or is
             likely to be uncooperative or unable to provide a storage serum sample at the
             screening visit.

          -  Patients on heparin-treatment who, for clinical reasons, cannot safely be discontinued
             from heparin therapy during the PK segment.
