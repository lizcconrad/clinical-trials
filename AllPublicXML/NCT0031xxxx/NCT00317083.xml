  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery have obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is responsible for laryngeal sensory impairment. As the afferent neural
      pathway involved in the initiation of cough is located in the laryngeal epithelium, cough
      reflex sensitivity may be decreased in obese OSAS patients. The researchers therefore
      conducted this study to determine the effect of OSAS associated with obesity on cough reflex
      sensitivity, assessed by cough reflex threshold to an inhaled irritant (citric acid).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients undergoing scheduled bariatric surgery underwent a cough challenge as part of
      their routine preoperative evaluation. Patients were classified as presenting OSAS if
      apnea-hypopnea index obtained from preoperative full-night polysomnography was greater than
      5/hour. Cough threshold was measured with citric acid. Increasing concentrations of mouth-
      nebulized citric acid (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 and 640 mg/mL) were delivered during
      inspiration until a cough was elicited. The citric acid concentration eliciting one cough
      (C1) was defined as the cough reflex threshold.
