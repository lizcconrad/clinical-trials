  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50-60% of patients with chronic hepatitis C are not cured by treatment with pegylated IFNα
      plus ribavirin.

      Retreatment of non-responders of previous (pegylated) IFNα plus ribavirin therapies with
      pegylated IFNα plus ribavirin results in a sustained response in less than 10% of the
      patients.

      Extensive analysis of IFNα signaling in cells expressing HCV proteins, in transgenic mice
      expressing HCV proteins, and in liver biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis C point
      to STAT1 methylation as an important posttranslational modification targeted by HCV to
      inhibit IFNα signaling.

      STAT1 methylation can be increased and IFNα can be improved by adding AdoMet and betaine.

      The study is designed to test the hypothesis that a combination treatment with pegylated
      IFNα2b, ribavirin, AdoMet and betaine is superior to the current standard combination therapy
      with pegylated IFNα plus ribavirin.
