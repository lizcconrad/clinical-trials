      The purpose of this study is to determine if hypertonic saline with and without dextran can
      improve overall survival in victims of trauma with shock.

      Injury and lost blood from trauma can cause your body to be in shock (low blood pressure
      related to blood loss). This decreased blood flow can lead to organ damage. In order to
      restore the blood pressure and blood flow, the medics give fluids into the patients' veins as
      soon as possible. This is called &quot;resuscitation.&quot; The resuscitation fluid most commonly used
      is &quot;isotonic&quot; or one that is the same concentration as the blood. The investigators are
      trying to determine if infusing a &quot;hypertonic&quot; fluid (or one more concentrated than the
      blood) can increase the blood pressure and restore blood flow more efficiently. The
      hypertonic fluids the investigators are using are called hypertonic saline with dextran (HSD)
      and hypertonic saline (no dextran). Hypertonic saline is a salt solution that is slightly
      more concentrated than your blood. Dextran is a sugar solution.

      Specific Aim: To determine if prehospital administration of 7.5% hypertonic saline /6%
      Dextran-70 (HSD) OR 7.5% hypertonic saline alone (HS), compared to current standard therapy
      with normal saline (NS), as an initial resuscitation fluid, affects survival following
      traumatic injury with hypovolemic shock.

      Trauma is the leading cause of death among North Americans between the ages of 1 and 44
      years. The majority of these deaths result from hypovolemic shock or severe brain injury.
      Patients in hypovolemic shock develop a state of systemic tissue ischemia then a subsequent
      reperfusion injury at the time of fluid resuscitation. Conventional resuscitation involves
      the IV administration of a large volume of isotonic or slightly hypotonic (lactated ringers,
      LR) solutions beginning in the prehospital setting. Although not conclusive, prior studies
      have suggested that alternative resuscitation with hypertonic saline (7.5%) solutions may
      reduce morbidity or mortality in these patients. Furthermore, hypertonic fluids may have
      specific advantages in the brain-injured patient, as they may aid in the rapid restoration of
      cerebral perfusion and prevent extravascular fluid sequestration, thereby limiting secondary
      brain injury. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that hypertonicity significantly
      alters the activation of inflammatory cells, an effect that may reduce subsequent organ
      injury from ischemia-reperfusion and decrease nosocomial infection. The majority of previous
      clinical trials have focused on the use of HSD. The potential for 7.5% saline alone (HS) to
      have similar effects has not been well studied. Removal of the dextran component may enhance
      the anti-inflammatory effects of this solution, which could improve secondary outcomes such
      as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) and
      rates of nosocomial infections.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, three-arm placebo controlled trial designed to
      evaluate the clinical outcome of trauma patients with hypovolemic shock, as manifested by
      prehospital hypotension. Patients will be randomized to a single 250cc IV dose of 7.5% saline
      in 6% Dextran-70 (HSD), 7.5% saline (HS) or normal saline as the initial fluid for
      prehospital resuscitation. No additional interventions will occur once the patient is
      admitted to the hospital. In hospital data collection will last up to 28 days.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were enrolled by Emergency Medicine Services (EMS) personnel in the pre-hospital setting based on pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The first subject was enrolled on May 9, 2006 and the last subject was enrolled on August 25, 2008.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>895 subjects were randomized. 852 subjects completed the study. Randomization was performed when the outer study fluid bag wrapper was removed in the presence of a patient. To ensure there was no bias, a secondary intention to treat analysis was also performed which included all randomized patients even if the fluid was not administered.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Worst Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) Mean Through Day 28</title>
        <description>Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score is described as:
Six organ systems were chosen, and a score of 0-4 allotted for each organ according to function (0 being normal function through to 4 for most severe dysfunction) with a maximum score of 24. The worst score based on available data (missing values were assumed normal) in each 24-hour period is taken for calculation of the aggregate score.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The trial was stopped early for futility in the presence of a potential safety concern regarding increased mortality among patients receiving hypertonic solutions and no blood transfusions. This was no longer evident 6 hr after hospital admission.</limitations_and_caveats>
