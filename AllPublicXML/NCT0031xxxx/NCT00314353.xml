  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor which means it works to stop blood vessel formation
      in tumors. Without new blood vessels, the growth of a tumor is slowed. Chemotherapy works to
      kill cancer cells directly. This study is being done to see how colorectal cancer responds to
      treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to greater patient convenience and favorable toxicity profiles, clinical practice has
      seen an increased use of the combinations of capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and
      capecitabine with irinotecan (CAPIRI). Given the data documenting the improved efficacy for
      5-FU based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab, it is important to investigate the
      potential advantages of adding this agent to regimens containing capecitabine.
