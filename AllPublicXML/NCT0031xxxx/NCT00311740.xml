  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of the fixed combination of
      valsartan+hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on blood pressure reduction with valsartan and HCTZ
      alone and whether the combination treatments are safe and well tolerated. The study aims to
      establish a dose response relationship for both monotherapies and the combinations.

      This study is being conducted in Japan.
