      The objective of this study is to compare optimally given methadone maintenance treatment
      (MMT) for heroin dependence with a novel, sequential strategy, where patients are offered
      buprenorphine as first line treatment, allowed dose adjustments as needed, and switched to
      methadone if the maximal dose of buprenorphine is insufficient.

      The objective of this study is to compare optimally given methadone maintenance treatment
      (MMT) for heroin dependence with a novel, sequential strategy (STEP), where patients are
      offered buprenorphine as first line treatment, allowed dose adjustments as needed, and
      switched to methadone if the maximal dose of buprenorphine is insufficient.

      For this purpose, 96 subjects at two centers (Uppsala and Stockholm) are randomized to MMT or
      STEP and followed for 6 months. Retention in treatment is the primary outcome. Secondary
      outcomes in completers are proportion urine samples free of illicit opiates on app. twice
      weekly sampling, and problem severity as measured by a semistructured interview, the
      Addiction Severity Index (ASI) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.
