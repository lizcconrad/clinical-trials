    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic equilibrium disorders result in over five million patient visits per year
      in the United States with unknown additional individuals not seeking care. Symptoms of
      dizziness, vertigo, and lack of balance are among the most common symptoms reported to
      physicians. Equilibrium disorders not exclusively due to visual or vestibular conditions are
      typically due to problems in proprioception. Proprioception is the specialized sensory
      modality that informs the body as to movement, position, and spatial orientation through
      mechanisms that track sensations accompanying joint movement and position. Mechanoreceptors
      in joints, along with vestibular, visual, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ, ligament and
      tendon sensory receptors, comprise the propriosensory system, which conveys information to
      the motor system to maintain equilibrium on a reflexive, automatic basis. Alterations in
      somatosensory input from mechanoreceptors have been identified as causing aberrant muscle
      firing patterns.

      The NeuroCom Balance Master is an FDA approved device designed to both measure and treat
      balance problems and evaluate the neuromuscular control by quantifying the ability to
      maintain dynamic postural stability. The NeuroCom Unit is a microprocessor controlled balance
      unit that provides quantitative data regarding the patient’s ability to control the platform.
      This unit is widely used throughout the country in both university and clinical settings to
      help patients restore their balance.
