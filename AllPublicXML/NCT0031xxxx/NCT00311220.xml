  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is still the most common infectious disease in Taiwan. The infants in Taiwan
      have been vaccinated at birth with BCG -Tokyo 171 strain since 1951. The BCG vaccination rate
      is 97% among first grade students in a recent national survey. Even with such a high BCG
      vaccination coverage, Taiwan still has a relatively high TB incidence rate. In 2004, there
      were totally 16,784 newly diagnosed TB cases and the annual incidence was 74.11 per 100,000
      population nationally. Nearly 70% of the incidence cases were men and 30.4% were women. The
      mean age of incidence cases was 57.8 years old (median=63). 8,440(50.29%) patients were
      elderly than 65 years old. The elderly men did not receive the BCG vaccination and were the
      most important group to develop newly diagnosed tuberculosis and a special issue for the
      national TB control program in Taiwan.

      The tuberculin skin test (TST) is the only widely available method for detecting whether
      people have an immunologic reactivity to mycobacterial antigens and identified as latent
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Targeted tuberculin testing for latent TB infection is a very
      important strategy to identify subjects with high risk to develop tuberculosis including
      those who have recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or have clinical conditions
      that associated with an increased risk for progression of LTBI to active TB but the
      sensitivity was lower in elderly patients.

      Quantiferon-TB gold test (QFT-RD1) is a new diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis and a
      valuable alternative to skin testing. This whole-blood assay measures the production of IFN-
       in whole blood upon stimulation by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 and allows distinction of latent M.
      tuberculosis infection from BCG-induced reactivity. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are deleted from BCG
      Region 1 (RD1), not present in most nontuberculous mycobacteria and are highly specific
      indicators of M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the
      specificity and sensitivity of a whole blood IFN-γassay employing CFP-10 and ESAT-6, for the
      detection of M. tuberculosis infection in a clustered high risk elderly population.

      Changhwa Veterans Home is a government-expense veterans home with totally 519 residents in
      2004.The inhabitants were all elderly people and lived in groups. , They did not receive BCG
      vaccination and were the high risk group to develop endemic TB infection. The annual TB
      incidence rate over there was 3,500 per 100,000 population.

      STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS Population The study population represented individuals screened
      for TB over a 6-month period ending in December 2004 as part of a number of community health
      outreach programs based at the Center of Disease Control in Taichung, Taiwan. Changhwa
      Veterans Home is a government-expense veterans home with totally 519 residents in 2004. Only
      individuals with a properly read TST and signed informed consent were included in the study
      population. If a TST was positive, further evaluation for TB was advised. Anyone found to
      have active TB infection (12 individuals diagnosed, all from household contacts) was
      appropriately treated and were also included from the study. No general population low-risk
      controls were included in the study population. There were no other entry exclusions for the
      study. Before the TST was administered, a short interview including verbal consent and a BCG
      scar count evaluation was conducted by an experienced nurse.

      The TST contained 2 tuberculin units (TU) of RT23 tuberculin with Tween 80 (0.2 ml of 1TU/0.1
      ml) given intradermally on the left forearm volar surface by Mantoux technique. Validity
      measures such as inter-observer performance were done for TST placement or interpretation
      individually by two experienced nurse. A purified protein derivative-Siebert (PPD-S) dose of
      5TU is roughly equivalent to the 2TU of RT23. 2TU is the International Union Against
      Tuberculosis and Lung Disease recommended dose for RT23 TST. TST was also performed on
      BCG-vaccinated health care workers . After 48–72 h of injection, the TST site should be
      evaluated for induration and a transverse measurement was recorded. Any readings made outside
      of the above time period were excluded from the study. All unvaccinated subjects had their
      blood drawn for the QFT-RD1 the same time with applying the first TST. A TST reaction size of
      ≧10 mm was interpreted as a ‘positive’ TST which guided any further medical evaluation. This
      is the traditional cutoff point used for RT23 tuberculin in Taiwan as well as in most studies
      worldwide. If initial TST diameter less than 10 mm, second TST was repeated within 1-5 weeks
      to observe any ‘boosting phenomenon’ was possible. Statistical analysis of skin test results
      for each population characteristic was done at this cut-off point, with the exception of one
      analysis specifically done at≧18 mm in BCG-vaccinated health care workers.

      Household contacts of active TB patients were presumably at highest risk for TB infection;
      the group was labeled ‘household contact’. No active TB cases have been reported among these
      residents for years.
