  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immune response after a single
      vaccination of pre-immune subjects compared to two vaccinations in naive subjects.

      In addition the study further investigates the safety profile of MVA-BN® in a healthy
      population compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 4 groups, which receive either MVA-BN once, MVA-BN two times, MVA-BN
      followed by placebo, or two administrations of placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects between 18 and 55 years of age.

          2. Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine or
             serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to vaccination.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have used an acceptable method of contraception
             for 30 days prior to the first vaccination, must agree to use an acceptable method of
             contraception during the study, and must not become pregnant for at least 28 days
             after the last vaccination. A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless
             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized. (Acceptable contraception methods are
             restricted to abstinence, barrier contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive devices
             or licensed hormonal products.)

          4. Lab values without clinically significant findings

          5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) without abnormal findings (e.g. any kind of atrioventricular
             or intraventricular conditions or blocks such as complete left or right bundle branch
             block, AV-node block, QTc or PR prolongation, premature atrial contractions or other
             atrial arrhythmia, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, 2 premature ventricular
             contractions (PVC) in a row, ST elevation consistent with ischemia).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled serious infection i.e. not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          2. History of or active autoimmune disease. Persons with vitiligo or thyroid disease
             taking thyroid replacement are not excluded.

          3. Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function including, but not limited to,
             clinically significant liver disease; diabetes mellitus; moderate to severe kidney
             impairment.

          4. History of malignancy, other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, unless
             there has been surgical excision that is considered to have achieved cure. Subjects
             with history of skin cancer at the vaccination site are excluded.

          5. History of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart
             failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled high blood
             pressure, or any other heart condition under the care of a doctor.

          6. History of an immediate family member (father, mother, brother, or sister) who died
             due to ischemic heart disease before age 50 years.

          7. Ten percent or greater risk of developing a myocardial infarction or coronary death
             within the next 10 years using the National Cholesterol Education Program's risk
             assessment tool. (http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/atpiii/calculator.asp?usertype=prof) NOTE:
             This criterion applies only to volunteers 20 years of age and older.

          8. History of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction.

          9. Immune modulatory therapy.
