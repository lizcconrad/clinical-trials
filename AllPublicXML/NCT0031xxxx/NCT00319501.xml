  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of diazepam in the management of refractory epilepsy in
      selected patients who require intermittent medical intervention for the control of episodes
      of acute repetitive seizures. In addition, to assess the support provided by caregivers who
      are not themselves or not under the direct supervision of health care professionals at the
      time of administration.

    <time_frame>From 15 minutes to 12 hours after study drug administration for an episode of ARS during the Double-blind Period</time_frame>
    <description>An event was defined as an episode of or required rescue medication for an episode of acute repetitive seizures (ARS) within 15 minutes to 12 hours following study drug administration. Patients without an ARS event were censored at 12 hours. Diaries were provided; if no diary was returned, or the diary did not provide answers to questions about seizures and rescue during the 12-hour follow-up period, the patient was considered censored as of 15 minutes past the treatment time, unless another contact was documented. If seizure control following study drug administration was inadequate, diazepam rectal gel was provided as a rescue medication, given only in the first 4 hours after study drug administration and only if the caregiver was directed to do so by the Investigator or designee at the time of the ARS episode. Patients and their caregivers were trained to recognize the onset of an episode of ARS and when and how to administer study drug.</description>

    <description>If seizure control following study drug administration was inadequate, diazepam rectal gel was provided as a rescue medication, given only in the first 4 hours after study drug administration and only if the caregiver was directed to do so by the Investigator or designee at the time of the acute repetitive seizure (ARS) episode. Each patient's specific criteria for seizure and an episode of ARS were determined by the Investigator. Patients and their caregivers were trained to use these criteria to recognize the onset of an episode of ARS and when and how to administer study drug. An episode of ARS was defined as an episode of multiple complex, partial, or generalized seizures occurring over a brief period (minutes to 12 hours) with the patient regaining consciousness between seizures, which were readily recognizable by the patient or a trained caregiver. ARS includes seizures sometimes referred to as serial, cluster, crescendo, or stuttering prolonged.</description>

    <description>Any use of emergency treatment (such as an emergency room visit) was recorded in the patient's diary, along with the date, time, and reason for the emergency treatment. Emergency department visits required some type of rescue action taken, other than the visit itself.

        <title>Time to Next Seizure or Rescue Medication During the Double-blind Period (Kaplan-Meier 50th Percentile)</title>
        <description>An event was defined as an episode of or required rescue medication for an episode of acute repetitive seizures (ARS) within 15 minutes to 12 hours following study drug administration. Patients without an ARS event were censored at 12 hours. Diaries were provided; if no diary was returned, or the diary did not provide answers to questions about seizures and rescue during the 12-hour follow-up period, the patient was considered censored as of 15 minutes past the treatment time, unless another contact was documented. If seizure control following study drug administration was inadequate, diazepam rectal gel was provided as a rescue medication, given only in the first 4 hours after study drug administration and only if the caregiver was directed to do so by the Investigator or designee at the time of the ARS episode. Patients and their caregivers were trained to recognize the onset of an episode of ARS and when and how to administer study drug.</description>

Patients and their caregivers were trained to use these criteria to recognize the onset of an episode of ARS and when and how to administer study drug. An episode of ARS was defined as an episode of multiple complex, partial, or generalized seizures occurring over a brief period (minutes to 12 hours) with the patient regaining consciousness between seizures, which were readily recognizable by the patient or a trained caregiver. ARS includes seizures sometimes referred to as serial, cluster, crescendo, or stuttering prolonged.</description>

          <title>Mean Score on Physician Global Treatment Assessment During the Open-label Period</title>
          <description>Physician global evaluation is based on seizure frequency, severity, and overall outcome compared with previous episodes and is rated on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, where 0=much worse and 10=much better. A higher score indicates greater improvement. An episode of acute repetitive seizures (ARS) is defined as an episode of multiple complex, partial, or generalized seizures occurring over a brief period (minutes to 12 hours) with the patient regaining consciousness between seizures, which were readily recognizable by the patient or a trained caregiver. ARS includes seizures sometimes referred to as serial, cluster, crescendo, or stuttering prolonged.</description>
