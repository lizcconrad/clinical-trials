  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in rodent models that chronic substance abuse is associated with a
      rigidification of cell membrane fluidity due to a change in the membrane
      cholesterol/phospholipids ratio. Upon substance withdrawal the membrane undergoes
      reequilibration of this ratio, a process resulting both in an acute and a prolonged severe
      withdrawal syndrome. MBM has developed a patented,phosphatidic acid-enriched phospholipid
      platform (&quot;LIBERTAL&quot;), which is supposed to facilitate the membrane fluidity recovery. The
      company has focused on nicotine withdrawal in smoking cessation,as primary target.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized,double-blind, dose-finding,phase IIB study with Libertal has been performed in
      493 volunteer smokers, wishing to quit. They were divided into 5 arms: 4 treatment groups of
      0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0g/day respectively, and one placebo, divided BID. Treatment was
      administered during one week prior to smoking cessation, then continued during 8 weeks (56
      days), followed by another 4 weeks without treatment (up to day 84). The primary endpoint was
      complete smoking cessation during at least 28 consecutive days. There were 6 on-site visits
      and 4 telephone interviews.
