  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of 851B gel over a range of concentrations
      and dosing regimens on high-risk cervical human papillomavirus infection in women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is caused by infection with specific genotypes of the human papillomavirus
      referred to as oncogenic or high-risk human papillomavirus. Current epidemiologic evidence
      suggests that 80% of sexually active women will become infected during their lifetime with
      human papillomavirus and 50% of these infections will be due to high-risk human
      papillomavirus. With US annual rates of cervical cancer now in the range of 13,000/year, a
      very substantial number of women are left with uncertainty regarding whether their infection
      will clear spontaneously or progress to cancer.

      Subjects participating in this study were required to visit the clinic for approximately 15
      or 16 visits, and maintain a diary of self-dosing and menstruation cycles. The total time of
      participation in this study was approximately 27 months.
