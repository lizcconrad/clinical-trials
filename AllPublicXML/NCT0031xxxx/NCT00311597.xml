      RATIONALE: Extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of extracranial
      stereotactic radiosurgery and to see how well it works in treating patients with solid
      tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of extracranial stereotactic radiosurgery in
           patients with isolated tumors. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the minimum dose required for local control. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the radiographic response rate.

        -  Determine the median time to progression of the treated tumor.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of treatment.

        -  Evaluate the cause of death.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II open-label study.
      Patients are stratified according to tumor size.

        -  Phase I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to one lesion. Cohorts of 3-6
           patients undergo escalating doses of stereotactic radiosurgery until the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 33% of
           patients experience dose-limiting toxicity within 3 months of treatment.

        -  Phase II: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to one lesion at the MTD or at the
           dose at which local control at 3 months is ≥ 80%, as determined in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, 3 months, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
