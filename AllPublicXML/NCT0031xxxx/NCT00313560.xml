      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving erlotinib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      capecitabine and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving erlotinib together with combination
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after
      surgery.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib before and
      after surgery together with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy works in treating
      patients with stage I or stage II pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic (inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]
           activation and signaling) effects of neoadjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride on tumor tissue
           of patients with resectable stage I or II pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, antitumor activity (progression-free survival) of adjuvant
           erlotinib hydrochloride in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy comprising
           capecitabine, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and radiotherapy after surgical resection in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the toxicity profile of adjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride in combination
           with standard chemoradiotherapy in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic (inhibition of EGFR activation and signaling) effects of
           erlotinib hydrochloride on normal tissue (skin and oral mucosa) of patients receiving
           erlotinib hydrochloride as adjuvant therapy.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib hydrochloride (assessing both total and
           unbound levels) given in combination with capecitabine and evaluate the association of
           common allelic variants in candidate genes (EGFR, TS, DPD, MTHFR, and ORM1) with drug
           disposition and toxicity.

        -  Determine the relationships between pharmacodynamic effects and patient outcome.

        -  Assess the value of PET/CT scanning as a predictor of response to erlotinib
           hydrochloride treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer.

        -  Evaluate the benefit of fusing PET/CT scans together with the radiation treatment
           planning CT scan.

        -  Determine if the Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) minimizes the effects of respiratory
           motion during radiation treatment and results in better radiation coverage of the tumor
           bed and adjacent lymph nodes.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study.

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 neoadjuvant treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once a day for 3-5 days.
                Patients then proceed to surgery.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once a day for 3-5 days. Patients then
                proceed to surgery.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo surgical resection. Patients then proceed to adjuvant therapy.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice a day and oral erlotinib
           hydrochloride once a day for 5½ weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5
           days a week for 5½ weeks. Beginning 6 weeks later, patients receive gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on
           days 1-28. Treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride and erlotinib hydrochloride repeats
           every 28 days for 4 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
