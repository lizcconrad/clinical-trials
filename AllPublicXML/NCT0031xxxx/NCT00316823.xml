      RATIONALE: Finding genetic markers for thyroid cancer in a biopsy specimen may help doctors
      diagnose thyroid cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well genetic analysis works in diagnosing
      thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers and mRNA expression analysis using
           fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy samples from patients with thyroid nodules.

        -  Correlate the level of gene expression with the aggressiveness of differentiated thyroid
           cancer in FNA biopsy samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy as part of routine care.
      Additional thyroid tissue is collected during the biopsy for gene expression analysis.
      Patients who have already had a biopsy undergo FNA biopsy during thyroidectomy.

      Tissue samples will be examined for gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR), real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.
