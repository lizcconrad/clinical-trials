  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for more effective therapy for patients following surgery for esophageal
      carcinoma. Docetaxel and Irinotecan, independent of each other, have demonstrated activity in
      this disease. There is interest in the combination of these two active agents plus
      radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high rate of local and distant failure following surgery for esophageal carcinoma
      necessitates a more effective therapy for these patients. The merit of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy is early management of micrometastatic disease and radiosensitization. A
      longstanding regimen, 5-FU and Cisplatin, have failed to produce a substantial survival
      benefit, but the approach has resulted in pathologic complete responses prior to surgical
      eradication of the diseased organ. This raises questions of organ preservation in some
      patients. Docetaxel and Irinotecan have both demonstrated independent activity in this
      disease and are radiosensitizers. In this study, Docetaxel and Irinotecan will be given
      together weekly for 3 consecutive weeks in an attempt to decrease the recurrence of systemic
      disease, and this will be followed by giving each agent independently with radiation therapy
      to decrease the local relapse rate and independently measure the toxicity of each with
      radiation. Following completion of chemoradiotherapy, the patients will undergo resection and
      be evaluated for the pathologic response rate.
