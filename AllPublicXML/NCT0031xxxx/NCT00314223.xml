      Background: Sinus node dysfunction is a major cause of bradycardia necessitating pacemaker
      implantation. Evidences of genetic study supported that some genes involved in the pacemaker
      current or renin-angiotensin system were related to sinus node dysfunction. However, the
      influence of gene polymorphisms on sinus node dysfunction was not well studied.

      Methods: A group of 100 patients with documented sinus node dysfunction and 100 age- and sex-
      matched healthy control patients will be enrolled into this study. Gene polymorphism study
      includes the angiotensin-I converting enzyme gene, angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene,
      HCN1-4, SCN5A, KCNE and other possible gene polymorphisms which are related to sinus node
      function based on previous reports. Genetic polymorphisms are identified with polymerase
      chain reaction-based restriction analysis. Comparison of multiple haplotype analysis and
      single-locus analysis will be analyzed between the cases and controls.

      Estimated Results: Some genetic polymorphisms of these genes which are related to sinus node
      function or rennin-angiotensin system will show association with sinus node dysfunction. In
      multilocus haplotype analysis, some genetic haplotype profiles may demonstrate significant
      difference between cases and controls. In single locus analysis, some genetic polymorphisms
      may be associated with sinus node dysfunction.

      Estimated Conclusion and Clinical Implication: This study will demonstrate the genetic
      polymorphisms in RAS genes or some other genes associated with sinus node dysfunction. These
      results will support the roles of these genetic polymorphisms in determining the risk of
      sinus node dysfunction among the Chinese population in Taiwan.
