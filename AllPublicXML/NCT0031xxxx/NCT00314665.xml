      This research study is for patients that have been diagnosed with chronic uveitis, a disease
      that causes inflammation in the eye. Patients are currently being treated with Remicade,
      Humira, Methotrexate and or similar chemotherapy type drugs to control this inflammation.
      Despite these medications, patients still have inflammation in their eyes. Patients are being
      asked to add an additional drug, thalidomide.

      Patients will be in the study for approximately 24 weeks. The visits are at screening,
      baseline (week 0), and weeks 4,8,12, and 24.

      The purpose of this research study is to see if Thalidomide is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with chronic inflammation in their eyes. Thalidomide is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a leprosy skin condition, erythema nodosum leprosum
      (ENL). The drug works in many different ways, including as an anti-inflammation drug.
      Therefore, it is thought that this drug might be able to improve symptoms and lung function.
      At this time, the drug is not approved for use for uveitis.
