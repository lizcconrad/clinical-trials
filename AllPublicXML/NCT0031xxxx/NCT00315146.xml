  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare two strategies intended to improve the health
      of overweight older adults by improving body composition. One strategy, resistance training,
      is designed to preserve skeletal muscle mass. The other strategy, the use of a PPAR-γ
      agonist, is designed to enhance the loss of fat from visceral and skeletal depots. These
      strategies will be used in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet and will be compared to a
      hypocaloric diet alone to determine if either of these strategies are superior in reducing
      visceral fat and preserving muscle mass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot we propose to recruit 88 older (65 - 79 yrs) men (n=48) and women (n=40) at
      risk for disability and with indications for weight loss according to NIH guidelines. All
      will be enrolled in a dietary intervention designed to generate a caloric deficit of 500
      kcal/day for a 4 month period. All will receive supplemental vitamin D and calcium. These
      participants will be randomized into one of 4 groups:

      Group 1 - Hypocaloric diet (and placebo) Group 2 - Hypocaloric diet and resistance training
      designed to maximize muscular power (and placebo) Group 3 - Hypocaloric diet and a PPAR- γ
      agonist (pioglitazone/Actos™) Group 4 - Hypocaloric diet and resistance training and
      pioglitazone/Actos™

      The specific aims of the pilot are:

        1. In both men and women, to determine whether randomization to resistance exercise is
           associated with an increased retention of appendicular non-bone lean mass compared to
           those not undergoing power training.

        2. In both men and women, to determine whether randomization to the pioglitazone group is
           associated with an increased loss of visceral adiposity relative to randomization to the
           non-pioglitazone group.

        3. Assess the feasibility of the recruitment, assessment and intervention strategies

        4. To estimate adherence to the weight loss, exercise training, and drug interventions;

        5. In this population, to determine measurement characteristics of the functional outcomes
           that will be considered as primary end-points of the larger study.

        6. To obtain pilot data on a subset of participants to determine the feasibility,
           acceptability and measurement characteristics of muscle samples (biopsies) to quantify
           intramyocellular lipid in this study population.

      <recruitment_details>Starting in April 2006,144 participants underwent a medical screening. After further exclusion (n = 47) and declining to participate (n = 9), 88 participants (48 men, 40 women) were randomized to one of the four treatment groups.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Two meal replacements per day (bars and shakes) were provided to all participants (containing ~220 kcal with 7-10 g protein, 33-46 g carbohydrates, and 1.5-5 g fat with 2-5 g of fiber). For the third meal, a weekly menu plan with recipes was given to the participants. This meal was composed of traditional foods, was low in fat, high in vegetables but allowed for individual preferences, and provided 500-750 kcal. In addition, up to three snacks (~100 kcal each) were allowed each day. The macronutrient goal for each individual was ~55-60% carbohydrates, ~15% protein, and ~25% fat.</description>

Pioglitazone was given an initial 15 mg/day dose. Participants were assessed for side effects after 3 weeks, but none were reported. Therefore, after 3 weeks, the dose was increased to 30 mg/day for the remainder of the study for all participants randomized to receive pioglitazone. In order to understand the potential effects of changes in body composition independent of drug effects, a 1-week wash-out period preceded the follow-up outcome assessment.</description>

The goal of the resistance training program was to increase strength and muscle mass in the major muscle groups of the body, while also improving muscle power in the lower extremity. Participants randomized to the resistance training exercised 3 days/week. Participants warmed-up by walking or cycling for 3-5 min at a slow pace followed by 5 min of large muscle flexibility exercises targeting the major muscle groups of the body. Training sessions ended with a cool-down session of light stretching.</description>

            <description>Two meal replacements per day (bars and shakes) were provided to all participants (containing ~220 kcal with 7-10 g protein, 33-46 g carbohydrates, and 1.5-5 g fat with 2-5 g of fiber). For the third meal, a weekly menu plan with recipes was given to the participants. This meal was composed of traditional foods, was low in fat, high in vegetables but allowed for individual preferences, and provided 500-750 kcal. In addition, up to three snacks (~100 kcal each) were allowed each day. The macronutrient goal for each individual was ~55-60% carbohydrates, ~15% protein, and ~25% fat.</description>

Pioglitazone was given an initial 15 mg/day dose. Participants were assessed for side effects after 3 weeks, but none were reported. Therefore, after 3 weeks, the dose was increased to 30 mg/day for the remainder of the study for all participants randomized to receive pioglitazone. In order to understand the potential effects of changes in body composition independent of drug effects, a 1-week wash-out period preceded the follow-up outcome assessment.</description>

The goal of the resistance training program was to increase strength and muscle mass in the major muscle groups of the body, while also improving muscle power in the lower extremity. Participants randomized to the resistance training exercised 3 days/week. Participants warmed-up by walking or cycling for 3-5 min at a slow pace followed by 5 min of large muscle flexibility exercises targeting the major muscle groups of the body. Training sessions ended with a cool-down session of light stretching.</description>
