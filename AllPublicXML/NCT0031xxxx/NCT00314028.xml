  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a brief clinic-based program designed to promote
      the correct use of condoms among young African-American men newly diagnosed with a sexually
      transmitted disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV infections, are most commonly spread
      through unprotected sexual intercourse. STDs are a major health concern, especially among
      young ethnic minorities in the United States. The rate of STDs is significantly greater in
      urban areas where ethnic minorities, particularly African-American males, are commonly
      represented. Despite this knowledge, safe sexual practices, including correct condom use, are
      not the norm among minority males. It is believed that educational outreach designed to
      motivate and inform on the correct use of condoms will be effective in encouraging safer sex
      practices. This study will test the effectiveness of a brief clinic-based program designed to
      promote the correct use of condoms among young African-American men newly diagnosed with an
      STD.

      Participants in this single blind study will be randomly assigned to an experimental or
      control group. Upon being diagnosed with an STD, men in both groups will receive standard of
      care follow-up treatment. Men in the experimental group will also receive a one-on-one
      educational session on condom use. The educational session will be led by a health educator
      and will last about 30 minutes, depending on the existing skills and learning abilities of
      the participants. Using information provided by the participants on past experience with
      condoms, the health educator will attempt to correct misunderstandings about and problems
      with condom use. Upon enrollment, all men will respond to a series of pre-recorded questions
      and will be required to demonstrate their ability to apply condoms to a penile model. The
      same questions and procedure will be repeated 3 months later.
