        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of B-cell CLL including

               -  Lymphocytosis of &gt;=5,000 monoclonal B-cells/microliter co-expressing &gt;= one
                  B-cell marker (CD19, CD20, or CD23) and CD5 in peripheral blood AND

               -  &lt;= 55% prolymphocytes AND

               -  Bone marrow with &gt;=30% mononuclear cells being lymphocytes

          2. ZAP-70 positive CLL

          3. Intermediate or High risk, poor prognosis CLL refractory to fludarabine-based therapy
             as defined by one of the following:

               -  Disease progression following 2 cycles of fludarabine OR

               -  Failure to achieve PR or CR after at least 2 cycles OR

               -  No response to treatment or stable disease after at least 2 cycles of fludarabine
                  OR

               -  Disease progression after chemotherapy treatment after fludarabine-based therapy

             OR

             Â· CLL patients intolerant to fludarabine-based therapy. [Intolerance is defined as the
             development of any serious medical condition occurring after exposure to fludarabine
             that would restrict further use of the agent as treatment for the patient's CLL (i.e.,
             autoimmune hemolytic anemia, myelosuppression, hypersensitivity)]

          4. Indication for treatment as defined by the NCI Working Group Guidelines

          5. Laboratory parameters as follows:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;=10 g/dL (may be post-transfusion); platelet count &gt;=50 x103/mm3

               -  Creatinine &lt;=2 x ULN

          6. ECOG Performance Score &lt;=2

          7. For patients of child-producing potential, use of effective contraceptive methods
             during the study and for 1 month following treatment

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

             Classification and/or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%

          3. History of prior radiation that potentially included the heart in the field.

          4. History of myocardial infarction or active ischemic heart disease within 6 months of
             study entry

          5. History of arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, multifocal premature ventricular
             contractions, ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia or a
             requirement for antiarrhythmics (including digoxin)

          6. Baseline QTc &gt;=450 msec for men and &gt;= 470 msec for women in the absence of
             correctable electrolyte imbalance

          7. Poorly controlled angina

          8. Congenital long QT syndrome or first-degree relative with unexplained sudden death &lt;40
             years of age

         10. Treatment with chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody or radiotherapy within 28 days of
             study entry

         12. Participation in any investigational drug study within 28 days prior to CNF1010
             administration. (Patient must have recovered from all acute effects of previously
             administered investigational agents)

         13. Presence of active malignancy with the exception of basal cell carcinoma

         14. Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including active HIV or
             viral (A, B or C) hepatitis

         15. Known allergy to soy

         16. Requirement for concomitant therapy with drugs that alter metabolism by cytochrome
             P450 3A4 except low-dose warfarin for implanted device patency
