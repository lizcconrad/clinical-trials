      Background: Stavudine-containing regimens are associated with a potential for lipoatrophy and
      dyslipidemia. We assessed the safety and efficacy of reducing the dose of stavudine compared
      to switching to tenofovir or maintaining the standard dose of stavudine.

      Methods: Clinically stable lipoatrophic HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral
      therapy containing stavudine 40 mg bid with a plasma HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL for at least 6
      months were randomized to maintain stavudine 40 mg bid (d4T40 arm), to reduce to 30 mg bid
      (d4T30 arm), or to switch from stavudine to tenofovir-DF (TDF arm) while preserving the
      remaining drugs. Fasting metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline and at weeks 4, 12,
      and 24. Mitochondrial parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and body composition
      were measured at baseline and at week 24.
