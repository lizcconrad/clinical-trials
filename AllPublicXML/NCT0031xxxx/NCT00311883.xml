      Study levels of inflammatory mediators in induced sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis
      before and after a 4 week course of oral hydroxychloroquine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label study of effect of hydroxychloroquine on inflammation, bacterial burden and
      exhaled breath condensate pH in patients with cystic fibrosis. Patients with cystic fibrosis,
      16 years or older and with pulmonary function tests with an FEV1 greater than 40% predicted
      will be eligible for enrollment. Enrolled subjects will undergo collection of exhaled breath
      condensate and sputum induction and collection following nebulized hypertonic saline, before
      and following a 4 week course of oral hydroxychloroquine at 200 mg a day. Inflammatory
      mediators, neutrophil counts, and bacterial density in sputum and exhaled breath condensate
      pH will be measure at entry and at the end of 4 weeks of oral drug. There will be no placebo
      group.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of CF based on the following criteria:

             i. positive sweat chloride 60 mEq/liter (by pilocarpine iontophoresis) and/or ii. a
             genotype with two identifiable mutations consistent with CF, and iii. accompanied by
             one or more clinical features consistent with the CF phenotype

          3. FEV1 50% predicted value (subjects 16- &lt;18 years of age) or 40% predicted value
