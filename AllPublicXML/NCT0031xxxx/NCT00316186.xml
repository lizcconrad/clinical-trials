    <time_frame>Baseline until up to Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>The categories of tumor response were: complete response (complete disappearance of all known lesions determined by 2 measurements not less than 4 weeks apart), partial response (&gt;50% decrease in measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks with no appearance of new lesions), stable disease (no change in tumor size for at least 8 weeks), progressive disease (&gt;25% increase in measurements of lesions or appearance of new lesions), and not evaluable. The overall response rate was determined using a scan performed within the first 30 days of the first response.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to evidence of partial or complete response</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response is calculated as the time from the start of treatment until first documented evidence of partial or complete response. The study was terminated after the dose-finding run-in component was completed because of slow recruitment and acknowledgement of a competing Phase II study. Data not available, as the activity stage was not done.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to disease progression/death</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause, if sooner. The study was terminated after the dose-finding run-in component was completed because of slow recruitment and acknowledgement of a competing Phase II study. Data not available.</description>

             started

          -  Performance status ECOG 0-1

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function •Hematologic: ANC 1500/mm3 [1.5 x

          -  Presence of measurable disease according to World Health Organization (WHO)* criteria,
             as determined by diagnostic tests, including CT scan of the chest and abdomen, or MRI
             scan of the brain, or CXR, or PET CT, MRI, and/or CXR are the preferred diagnostic
             methods to evaluate disease during the course of this study. Use of positron-emission
             tomography (PET) is not required, but is permitted if it is the standard diagnostic
             tool employed by the institution. Measurable disease - Presence of at least one
             bidimensionally measurable, non-CNS lesion (indicator lesion). If the measurable
             disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed
             by cytology/histology • Measurable disease, either on CT or MRI scan, requires one
             diameter 1 cm and one diameter 2 cm. • Measurable disease on CXR requires both
             diameters 2 cm. • Palpable tumor masses that could not be evaluated radiologically
             require two diameters 2 cm

             chemotherapy, and the subject has no symptoms of spreading of disease to the brain,
             and is not receiving drugs called steroids to control the symptoms.

             kidney and liver function.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Concurrent or planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational
             therapy for the treatment of SCLC. (Concurrent radiation for palliation of bone

             Medical Monitor)

          -  Concurrent severe medical problems other than the diagnosis of SCLC, which would
             significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to extreme

          -  Severe medical problems other than the diagnosis of SCLC that would limit the ability
             of the subject to follow study plan or that would expose the subject to extreme risk.

          -  Ongoing or planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation treatment, or other
             experimental drug therapy for the treatment of SCLC.

          -  Use of investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

        <description>Hematology evaluation included hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell with differential and platelet count. Differential included neutrophils, bands, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. The intensity of each hematological toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAEs). Hematological toxicities are summarized by Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) V3.0 Maximum Toxicity Grade.</description>
