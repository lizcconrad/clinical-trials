  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvements in therapy for relapsed SCLC are much needed. Paclitaxel has been previously
      tested and found to have significant single agent activity in relapsed SCLC, including in
      refractory patients. Angiogenesis plays an important role in SCLC, increased VEGF levels are
      associated with worse outcomes. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF, increase response
      rates and survival when combined with chemotherapy agents compared with the chemotherapy
      agent alone in NSCLC, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, in
      the dose and schedule proposed in this study, improves response rates and progression free
      survival compared with paclitaxel alone in women with metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, we
      will be testing the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of this regimen in patients with
      chemosensitive relapsed SCLC.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycle.

        -  1 cycle = 28 days (4 weeks)

        -  Disease assessments will be performed per RECIST every other cycle

        -  After a minimum of 4 cycles or a maximum of 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy,
           bevacizumab monotherapy may continue until disease progression or intolerable side
           effects

        -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000 mm3

        -  International normalized ration (INR) of prothrombin time ≤ 1.2

        -  PTT no more than 5 seconds longer than the ULN

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris/anginal equivalent in the last 6
           months. Note: The patient may be on anti-anginal medications if the symptoms have been
           entirely controlled for greater than 6 months.

        -  No history of uncontrolled congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension
