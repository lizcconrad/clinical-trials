  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) are rare disorders characterized by dysfunctional
      hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to all red and white blood cells. The deficiency of
      blood cells, or cytopenia, caused by this malfunction leads to an assortment of diseases and
      disorders, all of which are characterized as BMFS. Because these diseases are rare,
      conducting research on them is difficult, and standards of treatment for most BMFS have yet
      to be developed. This study will collect clinical and laboratory data from people with BMFS
      to identify the characteristics and biological markers associated with these diseases over
      time. This information will assist doctors and researchers to develop better therapies and
      diagnostic tests that will help improve the management of BMFS and cytopenias.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BMFS result from hematopoietic progenitor or stem cell failure within the bone marrow.
      Specific causes of this problem, however, have been difficult to identify, as BMFS occur
      sporadically. For the same reason, few studies have been conducted to find out more about
      these diseases and to develop more appropriate and effective therapies. Aplastic anemia (AA)
      is the most common of all BMFS. Other types of BMFS include the following: myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS); paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); pure red cell aplasia (PRCA);
      amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP); and large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL
      leukemia). Though AA is the most common of the BMFS, all BMFS are closely related in terms of
      their symptoms and characteristics. This study will collect clinical and laboratory data from
      people with BMFS to identify the characteristics and biological markers specific to each
      disease as it evolves. This information will assist doctors and researchers to devise better
      therapies and diagnostic tests that will help improve the management of BMFS and cytopenias.

      Participants in this observational study will report to the study site for an initial
      screening visit, followed by study visits every 6 months for at least 5 years. At each visit,
      participants will be interviewed and examined by a physician. Laboratory tests, including
      blood collection and a bone marrow aspirate, will also be performed. Data collected for this
      study's database will be used to determine the prevalence of clinical events and laboratory
      abnormalities over the course of disease, to study the evolution of disease parameters and
      symptoms, and to evaluate current therapies and diagnostic tests.
