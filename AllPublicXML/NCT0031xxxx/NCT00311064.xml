      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if disturbances in cytokines or factors of the
      metabolic syndrome, can predict complications in pregnancy, birth, and the perinatal period
      in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes or who are overweight. At the same time we, the
      investigators at Rigshospitalet, want to determine if physical activity in the overweight
      pregnant woman can influence these factors in a favourable way and, with that, improve the
      progress of pregnancy and birth.

      Material and Method:

      This study falls in two fields:

      First 80 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes are followed with determination of cytokines and
      factors of the metabolic syndrome throughout the pregnancy. The correlation between these
      variables and the pregnancy and delivery progress is evaluated.

      280 overweight (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 30 kg/m2) pregnant women with no medical conditions
      are examined in the same way. The women are randomized in week 14 to either continue their
      habitual physical activity or to elevate it by participating in a training program with other
      pregnant women 3 times weekly.

      Both groups will get blood samples taken during fasting approximately 50 ml 3-4 times during
      the pregnancy.
