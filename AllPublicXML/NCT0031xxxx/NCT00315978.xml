  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing patients with information about
      their global coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and effective risk-reducing strategies allows
      them to make appropriate decisions about heart disease prevention.

      Background: Low utilization of effective CHD prevention strategies may be due to many
      factors, but chief among them is the lack of patient involvement in prevention decisions. We
      undertook this study to test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored, computerized
      decision aid about CHD on patientsâ€™ discussions with their doctor and their plans for CHD
      prevention.

      Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized trial in a convenience sample of adults with no
      previous history of cardiovascular disease to test the effectiveness of an
      individually-tailored, computerized decision aid about CHD prevention against a risk factor
      list that patients could present to their doctor.
