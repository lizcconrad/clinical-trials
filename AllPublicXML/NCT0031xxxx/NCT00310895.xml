    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and the maximum tolerated dose of
      GRN163L administration in treating patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumor
      malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GRN163L is a telomerase template antagonist with in vitro and in vivo activity in a variety
      of tumor model systems. Telomerase is an enzyme that is active primarily in tumor cells and
      is crucial for the indefinite growth of tumor cells. Inhibition of telomerase may result in
      antineoplastic effects.
