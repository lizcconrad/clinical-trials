  <brief_title>24-Hour Glycemia: Rosiglitazone Versus Glimepiride In Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
  <official_title>Comparison of the Effects of Rosiglitazone and Glimepiride, Both Given in Combination With Metformin, on 24-Hour Glycemia in Type 2 Diabetes Patients Not Controlled With Metformin Alone. A 3-Month Multicentre, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Open-Label Study.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A better glycemic control is associated with less complications (cardiac diseases, blindness,
      etcetera) for type 2 diabetic patients. The objective is to study if rosiglitazone may lead
      to a more regular glycemic pattern with less hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia episodes than
      with a sulphonylurea (glimepiride).
