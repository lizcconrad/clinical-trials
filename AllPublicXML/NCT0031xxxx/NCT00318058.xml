  <brief_title>Safety Study of an Adjuvanted Candidate Influenza Vaccine to Prevent Influenza Disease in the Elderly Population</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I/II, Open, Controlled Study in Order to Evaluate the Reactogenicity and the Immunogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals Influenza Candidate Adjuvanted Vaccine in an Elderly Population Aged Over 65 Years Previously Vaccinated in 2004 With the Same Candidate Vaccine</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As influenza vaccine efficacy is reported to be lower in elderly subjects compared to healthy
      adults, probably as a result of immunosenescence, there is a desire to devise ways to
      increase the current vaccines efficacy for this target population. Adjuvants are known to
      boost immune responses, thus representing one way to increase the efficacy of the current
      GlaxoSmithKline Fluarix™ influenza vaccine in elderly subjects. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the immunogenicity and the reactogenicity of a revaccination with the adjuvanted
      GlaxoSmithKline influenza vaccine administered intramuscularly about 1 year after
      administration of the first dose of vaccine. For immunogenicity and safety evaluations,
      subjects who have already received Fluarix™ during the preceeding year will receive a dose of
      commercial vaccine and will form the control group of this trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or female aged over 65 years at the time of the revaccination; who previously
             received the adjuvanted candidate vaccine or Fluarix during a clinical study organized
             during the preceeding year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the administration of the study vaccine, or
             planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the administration of the study
             vaccine.

          -  History of confirmed influenza infection since a year from the date of previous
             vaccination.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination

          -  History of hypersensitivity to vaccines.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional
             abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.
