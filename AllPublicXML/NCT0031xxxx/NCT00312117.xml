  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast nephropathy (CN) is a common cause of renal failure associated with prolonged
      hospitalization, significant morbidity/mortality, and cost. In addition, these patients may
      require temporary or permanent hemodialysis which, in turn, is associated with further
      morbidity, mortality, and cost. CN has been reported to account for 10% of hospital acquired
      renal failure. In recent years, studies have investigated preventive therapies with mixed
      results. Fenoldopam was found to be ineffective in a large randomized trial. Dopamine has
      been shown to be ineffective as a preventive strategy. Hemofiltration has been shown to be
      beneficial (New England Journal of Medicine [NEJM] 2003) but is costly and not practical.
      Mucomyst has shown mixed results. The single strategy which most would agree as being
      beneficial remains hydration, most commonly with intravenous 0.9% normal saline. Most
      recently, sodium bicarbonate has been shown to be beneficial in a small randomized trial
      (n=119). It is clear that the most cost effective strategies for treatment of CN should be
      aimed at prevention.

      The general question is: &quot;Is a sodium bicarbonate solution more efficacious in preventing
      contrast nephropathy compared to normal saline?&quot; The general hypothesis is that sodium
      bicarbonate will be more efficacious.
