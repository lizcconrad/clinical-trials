      The primary purpose of the study is to determine if Seneca Valley Virus may be administered
      safely to patients with certain types of advanced cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in man of Seneca Valley Virus, a virus which seeks and kills certain
      tumors in non-human model systems. Subjects in this trial will be patients with advanced
      cancer displaying certain specified neuroendocrine features, pathologically; they will have
      exhausted standard methods of treatment for their tumor. The primary purpose of the trial is
      to determine if the virus may be administered safely. Additional purposes are to learn about
      the distribution of the virus in the body, the elimination of the virus from the body, the
      immune response to the virus and whether the virus might have some beneficial effects upon
      the tumors which the patients have. The first patients will be treated with low amounts of
      virus and subsequent patients may receive higher amounts. At the end of the trial, it is
      intended to select a dose for further study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor (including carcinoid) with
             neuroendocrine features (i.e., expression of &gt;= 1 of the following 3 markers:
             synaptophysin, chromogranin A, or CD56) that is metastatic or unresectable and for
             which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer
             effective.

          -  Patients must show evidence of disease progression in the three months prior to
             treatment with SVV-001.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on
             the use of SVV-001 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study. Children may be eligible for future pediatric Phase I single-agent trials.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 24 weeks.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function as defined below:

               -  absolute lymphocyte count &gt;= 1,000/ul

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ul

               -  platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul

               -  AST/ALT &lt;= 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;= 5 x ULN if liver metastases
                  present

               -  total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR

                    -  creatinine clearance (calculated) &lt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with
                       creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Women must have been surgically sterilized or be post-menopausal.

          -  Men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for up to 6 months.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Patients must have oxygen saturation of at least 95% on room air.

          -  Patients who have been hospitalized for emergent conditions requiring inpatient
             evaluation, treatment or procedure during the 30 days prior to entry on study. In
             addition, emergent conditions requiring inpatient evaluation, treatment or procedure
             must have resolved or be medically stable and not severe for 30 days prior to entry on
             study.

          -  Use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of initiation of SVV-001, or
             continued &gt; Grade 1 adverse events, excluding alopecia, due to agents administered
             more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients with clinically evident Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B
             Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection.

          -  Patients with &gt; Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy (CTCAE version 3.0).

          -  Concurrent use of any other investigational agents.

          -  Presence of or history of central nervous system metastasis.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pre-menopausal women who have not been surgically sterilized. Although SVV-001 has no
             affect on the ovaries from a toxicological perspective, SVV-001 RNA is present in the
             ovaries at 12 weeks in animals that were administered high and medium doses. No
             pre-clinical reproductive tests have been conducted with SVV-001.
