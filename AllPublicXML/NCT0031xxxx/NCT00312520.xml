      The purpose of the study is to determine if pulse steroids are more efficacious and safer
      than the standard treatment with oral corticosteroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no prospective study in hemangioma patients answering critical questions
      such as: which type of steroid should be used,how much should we use and for how long. This
      study is an investigator blinded study with two arms:one arm is receiving standard treatment
      with daily oral corticosteroids and the other is receiving intravenous pulse corticosteroids
      daily for 3 days, monthly for 3 months. The main outcome of the study is assess the efficacy
      of each treament modality as the percentage improvement in the hemangioma's appearance. The
      secondary outcomes are the safety profiles of the two drugs and the changes in the
      angiogenesis markers as a result of treatment intervention.
