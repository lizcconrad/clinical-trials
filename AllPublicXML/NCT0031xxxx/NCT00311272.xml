  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells loaded with tumor antigens induce cytotoxic T-cells which have been proved
      capable of killing both melanoma and breast cancer cells. Melanoma and colorectal cancer
      cells express some common antigens. Hence it is possible to use melanoma lysate to load the
      dendritic cells with tumor antigens similar to the antigens expressed by the patients'
      colorectal cancer cells.

      The patient receives 10 vaccinations with 14 days between each. The parameters for effect are
      changes in tumor/metastasis size measured with computed tomography (CT), decrease in serum
      concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), performance status measured by the World
      Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and Quality of Life.
