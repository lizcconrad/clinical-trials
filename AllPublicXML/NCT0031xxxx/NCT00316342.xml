      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of back supports plus education upon
      recovery from a work-related low back disorder. The study tests the hypothesis: the use of
      back supports plus health education is not different from health education alone in promoting
      recovery from a work-related low back disorder in consideration of personal, health, and job
      factors. Significant improvements in physical health, neurogenic symptoms, back pain
      disability, and low back pain were observed over the twelve months of study follow-up. No
      statistically significant difference between the study groups was found with respect to these
      measures.

      BACKGROUND Low back pain remains a common major source of morbidity and disability. Few
      studies consider the effectiveness of interventions for low back pain while simultaneously
      considering personal, health, and job characteristics.

      METHODS This is a randomized clinical trial in which 433 active employees with low back
      disorders were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: 1) back support plus education
      on back health; or 2) education on back health only. Demographic, health, medical, and job
      factors were recorded. Outcomes were evaluated over a twelve month period and included
      self-reported measures of back pain, back pain disability level, physical health, mental
      health, back pain recurrence and administrative measures.

      RESULTS Significant improvements in physical health, neurogenic symptoms, back pain
      disability, and low back pain were observed over time in both study groups. However, there
      was no significant difference between the study groups with respect to these outcome
      measures. The adjusted hazard ratio of recurrence rate was suggestive of an incremental
      protective effect due to back supports over education alone (adjusted hazard ratio
      [AHR]=0.711, 95% CI 0.50, 1.04, p=.085). There was also a marginal effect of back supports
      and education on decreasing low back pain over time (AHR=0.0015, p=0.091).

      CONCLUSIONS Back supports may have some value in promoting recovery from low back pain, but
      this effect is only observed in individuals who are actively employed in jobs with medium
      risk of low back disorders.
