  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the food supplement OPC Factor will be tested to determine its effectiveness
      for increasing energy levels in healthy people aged 45-65 when compared to a placebo. All
      subjects will receive both active product and placebo at some time during the study. The
      study is nine weeks in duration. It involves three visits, taking an effervescent powder in
      water twice a day, and answering 24 multiple choice questions once a week. Subjects who
      complete the study can elect to receive a two month supply of the study product free of
      charge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPC Factor, a food supplement which contains grape seed extract, pine bark extract,vitamins
      and minerals, has shown during clinical observation the effect of raising energy levels in
      people aged 45-65. It is believed that the mechanism of action is based on enhanced
      production of ATP by mitochondria.

      In this study subjects will be assigned by chance to either the active product group or the
      placebo group. Subjects will take the product for three weeks. Then there will be a two week
      wash out period followed by subjects being crossed over to the other group for a three week
      period. Subjects, assessors, and health providers will be masked as to who is in the active
      product group and who is in the placebo group. Subjects will meet with the primary
      investigator three times during the study, will fill out very short questions once a week,
      and receive phone calls once a week from study personnel.

      This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, triple-blinded, cross-over study that tests
      the hypothesis that OPC Factor produces a response rate of 70% in the active product phase
      versus a 30% response rate during the placebo phase. A response is defined as at least a 20%
      absolute increase on the Energy subscale of the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 45 to 65 years of age at the time of recruitment

          2. Healthy -- see exclusion criteria

          3. There is the possibility of at least a 20% absolute increase in the subject's energy
             subscale score of the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Checklist (AD ACL). For the
             purpose of meeting the inclusion criteria, the subject fills out the AD ACL with the
             following instructions: &quot;Each of the words below describes feelings or moods. Please
             circle the rating next to each word that best describes your feelings during the past
             month. These instructions are different from the instructions used when the study
             endpoints are being measured so as to be consistent with the way the questionnaire was
             validated.&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any major medical or mental illness (including a history of bipolar disorder,
             borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia)

          2. Medical diseases known to be associated with fatigue but not limited to:

               -  AIDS

               -  Anemia

               -  Cancer or history of cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

               -  Hypothyroidism

          3. Subjects taking the following medical therapies:

               -  Beta-blocking medications

               -  Human growth hormone

               -  Testosterone

               -  Warfarin

          4. Subjects taking the following complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) products:

          6. The subject's score on the energy subscale of the AD ACL is at a level that precludes
             at least a 20% absolute increase of that score.

          7. Subjects who are unable to make their own decisions regarding informed consent

          8. Those subjects who have taken any of the medical therapies or CAM products listed but
             are no longer taking them are eligible to participate provided no other exclusion
             criteria are present and the subjects have not taken those therapies or products in
             the six months prior to enrollment.
