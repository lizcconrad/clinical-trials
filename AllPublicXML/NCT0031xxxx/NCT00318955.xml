  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine at the time of
      extubation and after extubation, in patients requiring postoperative sedation in the ICU.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to conduct as a phase IV post-marketing clinical study in accordance with the
      approval condition of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in Japan. The study will compare the use
      of dexmedetomidine in patient management at the time of extubation with other sedative/
      analgesic management, Comparison is made in the use of dexmedetomidine in patient management
      between a group in which management is performed with dexmedetomidine and a group in which
      standard management is performed with propofol in patients requiring postoperative sedation
      in the ICU The usefulness of dexmedetomidine during postextubation period is also evaluated.
