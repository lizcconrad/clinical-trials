      Umbilical cord blood is an important source of stem cells and can be used to treat blood and
      immune system disorders and certain types of cancer. Stem cell transplants of umbilical cord
      blood have been shown to be effective in treating illness in children, but more research is
      needed to confirm the benefit of this procedure in adults. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the immune system response to cord blood stem cell transplantation in adults with
      advanced blood disorders or cancer.

    <textblock>
      The use of umbilical cord blood stem cells to treat blood disorders and cancer is an
      important medical advance; currently, more than 45 disorders can be treated with this method.
      While bone marrow transplants are the most common method for stem cell donations, research
      has shown that there are many advantages to using allogeneic grafts of stem cells obtained
      from umbilical cord blood. Cord blood stem cells are relatively easy to obtain. Additionally,
      a perfect donor match is not necessary, thereby decreasing the likelihood of
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious side effect in which donor stem cells attack the
      recipient's tissues. Cord blood has been used successfully in pediatric patients but its
      benefit in adults remains untested. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation in adults with advanced blood
      disorders or cancer. Upon receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplant using umbilical cord
      blood, participants will be observed for successful engraftment in which the transplanted
      stem cells &quot;take&quot; and begin producing new blood cells. The incidence of GVHD and the overall
      immune system's response will also be examined. In turn, these findings may guide future
      umbilical cord blood stem cell clinical trials.

      This 1-year study will enroll individuals with advanced blood diseases or cancer.
      Participants will receive an allogeneic umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant and will be
      closely monitored while in the hospital to determine when engraftment occurs and if GVHD
      develops. Study visits will occur at Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and Year 1. At each visit,
      participants will have blood drawn for laboratory testing and for evaluation of immune system
      response. Quality of life questionnaires will also be completed at each visit.
