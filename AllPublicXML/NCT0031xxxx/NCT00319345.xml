  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of bolus of either sodium-lactate or
      mannitol on the evolution of intracranial pressure (ICP) during intracranial hypertensive
      episodes (IHE)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osmotherapy with mannitol remains the first treatment currently recommended to treat
      intracranial hypertension in severe head injury.However, this treatment in not always
      efficient and is associated with side-effects and a transitory action. Hypertonic
      sodium-lactate, by its osmotic and energetic properties could be superior to mannitol to
      decrease ICP. Study objectives : to compare the effect of mannitol and sodium-lactate on ICP
      at the fourth hour after the start of infusion during IHE in severe traumatic brain injury
      (TBI) (main endpoint) ; to compare the percentage of successfully treated episodes between
      both treatments and to compare the neurological status after one year of evolution (glasgow
      outcome score)(secondary endpoints)

      Patients inclusion : adult severe TBI (glasgow coma score &lt; 9) &lt; 66 yrs Exclusion criteria :
      polytrauma, bilateral fixed dilated pupils, motor score &lt; 4, neurosurgery, prolonged episode
      of hypoxia or arterial hypotension, 34 patients included from november 2003 to november 2004
      and randomized into two groups : MAN group receiving mannitol 20% 100 ml in 15 min (17
      patients, 36 episodes of IHE treated) and LAC group receiving semimolar sodium-lactate 100 ml
      in 15 min (17 patients, 37 episodes of IHE treated). For ethical reasons a rescue treatment
      in a crossover fashion was performed for each episode of IHE when the randomized treatment
      failed.

      Follow-up : one year after the TBI. Study end : november 30, 2005
