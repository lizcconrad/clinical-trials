  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare nasal saline irrigation with nasal saline spray for the treatment of
      chronic nasal and sinus symptoms. Participants will complete a questionnaire regarding their
      nasal and sinus symptoms and will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups. Each
      participant will be instructed on how to perform daily nasal treatment.The subjects will
      complete follow-up surveys at regular intervals to assess any change in their nasal symptoms
      after starting nasal saline treatment. Participants may take their usual medications for
      sinus symptoms during their participation in the study.
