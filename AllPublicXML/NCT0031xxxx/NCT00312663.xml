      -  Controlled challenge, Phase I/IIa WRAIR study.

        -  Healthy, malaria-naive adults aged 18 - 50 years.

        -  2 groups, 5 subjects in group A (10µg dose) and 15 subjects in group B(50µg dose).

        -  Control: none for immunization phase; infectivity controls for challenge and rechallenge
           phases. Six infectivity controls per day of challenge will be enrolled for the challenge
           phases, with 3 alternates available for challenge if needed.

        -  Vaccination schedule of 0, 1 months.

        -  Challenge of up to 15 subjects in Group B.

        -  Contingent upon short term efficacy, rechallenge of initially protected subjects 6
           months (+/- 2 months) after second dose of vaccine.

        -  Self-contained study.

        -  Duration of the study, per subject: approximately 15 months (screening, enrollment,
           vaccination, challenge and rechallenge).

        -  Data collection will be by done onsite.
