    <textblock>
      Treatment with systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of COPD results in the
      improvement of clinical outcomes. The optimal route of administration has not been rigorously
      studied in COPD. Upon hospitalization, corticosteroids are administered intravenously in many
      hospitals. Oral administration is more convenient, though, because there is no need for
      intravenous access, less personnel is required for starting and monitoring therapy, and
      material costs are smaller.

      The investigators hypothesized that oral administration is not inferior to intravenous
      administration of prednisolone in the treatment of patients hospitalized for an acute
      exacerbation of COPD.
