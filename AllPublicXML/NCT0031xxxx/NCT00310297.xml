      Primary objective:

      To compare the pharmacodynamics of insulin glulisine and insulin lispro injected
      subcutaneously before three 500 kcal standard meals during a 12 hour day, in obese subjects
      with type 2 diabetes.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetics of insulin glulisine and insulin lispro in obese
           subjects with type 2 diabetes, injected subcutaneously before three standard meals
           during a 12-hour day.

        -  The safety of insulin glulisine, the relationship of the pharmacodynamics and
           pharmacokinetics with skin thickness and C-peptide, non-esterified fatty acid,
           triglyceride and β-hydroxybutyrate levels in these subjects will also be assessed.
