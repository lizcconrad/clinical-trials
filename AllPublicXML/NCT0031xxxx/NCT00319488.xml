  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effectiveness of initiating a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid
      (ICS) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in addition to an inhaled beta2-agonist
      (albuterol) at the onset of respiratory tract illness (RTI)-associated symptoms in increasing
      episode-free days among young children with recurrent severe wheezing.

    <textblock>
      Acute Intervention Management Strategies (AIMS) is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled parallel comparison study that will compare the effectiveness of three
      treatments, when given at the onset of RTI-associated symptoms, in increasing the proportion
      of symptom-free days over the entire treatment period of the 5- to 9-month study. There will
      be a 2-week period to qualify and characterize participants, who at that time will have no
      lower respiratory tract symptoms other than mild cough. A total of 244 participants will be
      randomized to one of three treatment groups and followed for the remainder of the
      fall-winter-early spring season. Participants will receive one of the following treatment
      regimens for 7 days, at the first sign of RTI-associated symptoms: 1) active ICS plus placebo
      LTRA plus albuterol inhalation treatments four times daily; 2) active LTRA plus placebo ICS
      plus albuterol inhalation treatment four times daily; or 3) placebo ICS plus placebo LTRA
      plus albuterol inhalation treatments four times daily.

             interfering with activities; score greater than 2 for daytime cough on an average of 4
             or more days/week during the 2-week observation period

             observation period

          -  Use of long-term controller medications for asthma (e.g., corticosteroids [inhaled or
             oral], leukotriene modifiers, cromolyn/nedocromil, or theophylline) during the 2-week
