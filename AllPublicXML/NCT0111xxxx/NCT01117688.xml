  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a safety guidewire (SGW) on the
      results of ureteroscopy for urolithiasis.

      Study hypothesis: Routine use of SGW has no impact on the results of ureteroscopic treatment
      of urolithiasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of SGW is generally recommended at any ureteroscopic procedure in order to facilitate
      the introduction of the endoscope and to secure placement of internal tubes for drainage of
      urine after the procedure.

      However, SGW may be an obstacle to efficient disintegration and retraction of calculi in the
      narrow ureter.

      The intention of this study is to compare the results of endoscopic stone treatment with and
      without the use of SGW.
