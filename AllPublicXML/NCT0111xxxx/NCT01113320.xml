    <textblock>
      Approximately twenty four (24) subjects will participate in this research trial. The research
      trial will be conducted in approximately twelve (12) medical centers in the following
      countries: Germany, France, South Africa, Austria and Canada. The research trial will last
      until December 2011.

             the United Kingdom (UK) Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnosis
             Criteria

          3. The subject is an out-patient aged 30 years or above.

             treatments, and the clinical presentation, the subject is considered as being
             optimally treated at screening (i.e., further adjustments of current medication will
             not further improve the subject's symptoms of Parkinson's disease).

         10. Stable dose of PD drugs for at least 4 weeks before Screening Visit. This may include:
             levodopa dopamine agonists, c-ortho methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, and

         11. The dose of levodopa and all PD drugs used during the trial must remain unchanged
             throughout the trial.

         12. Female subjects must be neither pregnant or breast-feeding and must lack child-bearing
             potential, as defined either by:

               1. be either post menopausal for at least 2 years , surgically sterilised or have
                  undergone hysterectomy, or

               2. if of child bearing potential, be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate
                  method of contraception for four weeks prior to, during and four weeks after the
                  last dose of trial medication. For the purposes of this trial, women of
                  childbearing potential are defined as all female subjects after puberty unless
                  they are post-menopausal for at least two years, are surgically sterile or are
                  sexually inactive.

         13. The subject shows adequate compliance with the schedule for intake of trial medication
             and the completion of the diaries.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has participated in any safinamide clinical trial before.

          2. The subject is experiencing exclusively diphasic, off state, myoclonic, dystonic, or
             akathetic dyskinesias without peak dose dyskinesia.

          3. (For female subjects) The subject is pregnant or lactating.

          4. Treatment with a MAO-B inhibitor within the eight weeks prior to the screening visit.

             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine), tri- or
             tetra-cyclic antidepressants, in the past 8 weeks prior to the screening visit.
             Dextromethorphan will be permitted if used for treating cough.

          7. The subject has received neurosurgical intervention related to PD (e.g. deep brain
             stimulation, thalamotomy etc.) or is scheduled to do so during the trial period.

          8. Current clinically significant gastro-intestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine, pulmonary
             or cardiovascular disease, including acute gastric ulcer, hypertension that is not
             well controlled, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and unstable
             Type I diabetes. Subjects with a history of gastric ulcer who have not had a recent
             episode of acute gastritis and are not currently experiencing gastric pain will be
             eligible for inclusion.

          9. Neoplastic disorder, which is either currently active or has been in remission for
             less than one year.

         10. Diagnosis of HIV, or positive test for Hepatitis C antibodies, or Hepatitis B surface
             antigen.

         11. Concomitant disease likely to interfere with trial medication (e.g. capable of
             altering absorption, metabolism, or elimination of the trial drug).

         12. The subject has any clinically significant illness that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, might interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the trial.

         13. Second- or third-degree atrio-ventricular block or sick sinus syndrome, uncontrolled
             atrial fibrillation, severe or unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial
