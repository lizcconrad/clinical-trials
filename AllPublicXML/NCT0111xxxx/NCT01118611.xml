      RATIONALE: Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A (GSK1070916A) may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of GSK1070916A in
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine and establish the safety profile of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A
           and define the dose-limiting toxicity in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters following administration of Aurora
           B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in these patients.

        -  To evaluate tumor response after at least 1 cycle of treatment with Aurora B/C kinase
           inhibitor GSK1070916A in these patients.

        -  To propose a safe dose for Phase II evaluation.

      Tertiary

        -  To investigate the effects of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A on markers of
           mitosis/cell proliferation and apoptosis in humans.

        -  To investigate the metabolism of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in humans.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A IV over 1 hour once daily on days
      1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients receive escalating doses of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A until the
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD has been defined, 15-18 additional
      patients are recruited for an expanded MTD cohort in which patients receive Aurora B/C kinase
      inhibitor GSK1070916A at the MTD. Patients at the expanded MTD cohort must consent to have
      either tumor biopsies taken or FDG-PET/CT and DW-MRI scans performed.

      Patients may undergo tissue, blood, and urine sample collection periodically for
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 28 days.

        Eligibility criteria The patient must fulfil the eligibility criteria (listed in Section
        4.1.1 and 4.1.2).

        Additional eligibility criteria must be fulfilled for the expanded MTD cohort (listed in
        Section 4.1.3).

        4.1.1 Inclusion criteria:

             treatment, or for which no conventional therapy exists

          2. Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          3. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1

          4. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These

             aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless raised due to tumour in which case up to 5 x
             ULN is permissible Calculated creatinine clearance (preferably measured by EDTA/ DTPA
             (isotope method) otherwise to be calculated using Wright formula) ≥ 50 mL/min
             (uncorrected value)

          5. 18 years or over

          6. Written (signed and dated) informed consent and be capable of co-operating with
             treatment and follow-up

        4.1.2 Exclusion criteria:

          1. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, immunotherapy or
             chemotherapy during the previous four weeks (six weeks for nitrosoureas, Mitomycin-C
             and six weeks for investigational medicinal products) before treatment.

          2. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the Drug
             Development Office (DDO) should not exclude the patient.

          3. Known brain metastases.

          4. Patients on therapeutic anti-coagulation with warfarin are excluded. (1mg warfarin for
             line maintenance is acceptable; conversion to low molecular weight heparin is
             acceptable but must be done a minimum of seven days prior to the first dose of study
             drug).

          5. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female
             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree
             to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal contraception and condom, have a intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm
             with spermicidal gel and condom) for four weeks before entering the trial, during the
             trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.

          6. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (e.g. condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.

          7. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

          8. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active
             uncontrolled infection.

          9. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         10. QTc interval ≥ 450 msecs for men and ≥ 470 msecs for women or other clinically
             significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (QTc preferably calculated using the
             algorithm in Appendix 6).

         11. Use of medicines known to prolong QTc within 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug (see Category 1 of Appendix 5).

         12. Previous exposure to aurora kinase inhibitors

         13. Concurrent congestive heart failure, prior history of class III/ IV cardiac disease
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] - refer to Appendix 4)

         14. History of cardiac ischaemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary angioplasty or stenting in
             the previous 12 months. Patients currently on medication for cardiac arrhythmias are
             also excluded.

         15. Patients with a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%. A multi-gated
             acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram must be performed if clinically indicated.

         16. Any other condition which in the Investigator‟s opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.

         17. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical study,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of GSK1070916A. Participation in an
             observational study would be acceptable.

        4.1.3 Additional inclusion / exclusion criteria for expanded MTD cohort:

        Once tolerability has been confirmed in the initial three to six patients of the MTD,
        further patients in this expanded cohort must either consent to have tumour biopsies taken
        or having FDG PET-CT and DW/DCE-MRI scans performed. The minimum number of patients
        required in each part of the expansion cohort is six. The following additional inclusion /
        exclusion criteria will apply.

        For patients consenting to tumour biopsies:

          1. Additional written (signed and dated) informed consent for tumour biopsies must be
             given.

          2. The patient‟s tumour should be amenable to biopsy.

             For patients consenting to FDG PET-CT and DW/DCE-MRI scans:

          3. Additional written (signed and dated) informed consent for FDG PET-CT and DW/DCE-MRI
             scans must be given.

          4. Patients with diabetes must have their condition under good control (blood sugar less
             than 10mmol/L).

          5. Patients must be able to tolerate / comply with imaging protocol (i.e. patients with
             high levels of pain, urinary incontinence, or claustrophobia etc should be excluded).

          6. Patients with tumours known to be poorly FDG avid (e.g. mucinous adenocarcinoma, well
             differentiated neuroendocrine or hepatocellular carcinoma) or falsely negative (e.g.
             all tumours less than 5-6mm) are excluded. Refer to Appendix 7 for full list of
             excluded tumours.

          7. Patients with implanted metallic devices (e.g. pacemaker) are excluded.
