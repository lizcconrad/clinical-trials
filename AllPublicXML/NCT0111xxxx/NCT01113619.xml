      This is a Phase 2 study designed to assess the ability of RP-G28 to improve lactose digestion
      and tolerance.

      Lactose intolerance is a common gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that develops in lactose
      maldigesters when consuming too much lactose or when lactose is added to a previously
      low-lactose diet. Lactose intolerance is characterized by one or more of the cardinal
      symptoms that follow the ingestion of lactose-containing foods. These symptoms include;
      abdominal pain/cramps, bloating, flatulence [gas] and diarrhea. As such, most lactose
      intolerant individuals avoid the ingestion of milk and dairy products, while others
      substitute non-lactose containing products in their diet.

      Based on the health implications from insufficient calcium intake over a lifetime, including
      increased risk of osteoporosis and hypertension, there is need in the medical community for a
      tolerable and convenient treatment that allows for all levels of milk and dairy product
      consumption in people suffering from mild to severe lactose intolerance. This study will
      evaluate a treatment that provides a simplified dosing regimen as well as the potential for
      extended relief from symptoms following a limited therapy regimen.
