  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to compare the impact of a minimal and a full Internet-based
      self-help intervention for problem drinkers in the general population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many problem drinkers never access any treatment services. Because of the individual as well
      as societal costs of heavy alcohol consumption, it is essential to find ways to intervene and
      provide assistance to problem drinkers. The Internet takes treatment to problem drinkers
      rather than requiring them to come to treatment, resulting in increased options for help for
      alcohol abusers. There is a preponderance of internet websites which are designed for self
      change in areas that include alcohol use. To date, however, there has been minimal scientific
      evaluation regarding the efficacy and safety of such programs.

      Our own previous research found that we could reduce alcohol consumption by about three
      drinks per week at a six-month follow-up using a minimal, personalized feedback
      Internet-based intervention. Building on this, the current project will attempt to increase
      the impact of Internet-based interventions as well as produce sustained reductions in
      drinking by adding an extended online self-help service to this already promising minimal
      intervention. More specifically, this randomized, double blinded study will compare and
      evaluate the efficacy of two different degrees of treatment intervention for problem
      drinkers: a minimal one (&quot;Check your Drinking&quot;) and a full one (&quot;Alcohol Help Centre&quot;).
