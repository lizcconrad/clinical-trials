  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information will be collected prospectively in about 3,000 patients having Optical Coherence
      Tomography during cardiac catheterization. Subjects will be initially enrolled at sites
      outside of the United States, where Optical Coherence Tomography is approved by regulatory
      agencies. Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years.

    <textblock>
      This project will create a prospective registry of 3,000 patients with follow-ups of up to 5
      years.

      The aims of the project will be:

        1. identify plaque characteristics on OCT that are associated with adverse cardiac events
           including myocardial infarction

        2. to identify characteristics of stented arteries that are associated with adverse events
           including restenosis and stent thrombosis

      Because detailed clinical, angiographic and intravascular imaging data will be gathered from
      a large number of patients with clinical follow-ups, we anticipate that the registry will be
      a tremendous resource for additional research questions going forward.
