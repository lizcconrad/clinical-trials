  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol is an opioid analgesic, which is widely used in the treatment of acute and
      neuropathic pain. Treatment of neuropathic pain often requires a combination of pain
      medications due to the complex nature of neuropathic pain and frequent inadequate response to
      drug treatment. Common drugs used concomitantly with tramadol are SNRI antidepressant
      duloxetine and anticonvulsants such as pregabalin. Both tramadol and duloxetine have
      serotonergic effects and duloxetine has also a potential to inhibit metabolism of tramadol.
      The objective of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      interaction of oral tramadol with duloxetine and pregabalin in patients with chronic
      neuropathic pain due to postherpetic neuralgia or diabetic polyneuropathy. All subjects will
      receive tramadol and duloxetine or tramadol and pregabalin in a randomized double-blind
      order. Primary end point is O-desmethyltramadol concentration.

    <description>Pain intensity will be rated by the subjects on a numerical 11-point rating scale of 0-10 (NRS) with 0 meaning &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 meaning &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The subjects will be asked to rate pain intensity on the average over the past 24 hours. Pain intensity will be recorded at each study visit and daily by the subject using a pain diary.</description>

    <description>To ascertain the double-blinding of subjects and investigators, duloxetine and pregabalin will be administered as 2 similar capsules twice a day. Each of these capsules will contain either 30mg of duloxetine, 75 mg of pregabalin or placebo. Capsules will be prepared at the hospital pharmacy.</description>

    <description>Initial dose of oral tramadol (depottabl Tramal retard, Orionpharma, Finland) will be 100mg once daily. If the subject is currently on opioid treatment with codeine, tramadol or buprenorphine, the opioid treatment will be stopped, and an equal dose of tramadol will be used as the initial dose. The dose will be titrated on visits V2 and V3 based on the adequacy of pain relief and tolerability. If pain intensity ≥ 4 on a numeric rating scale of 0-10 during V2 and V3 and tramadol is well tolerated, the daily dose will be increased by 100mg. The maximum daily dose of 400 mg tramadol will not be exceeded. If the subject does not tolerate the initial dose of tramadol, he/she will be dropped out of the study and replaced by another patient.</description>

If pain intensity is ≥ 4 on a numeric rating scale of 0-10 and duloxetine is well tolerated, the daily dose will be increased to 60mg once daily. If the subject does not tolerate the initial dose of duloxetine, he/she will be dropped out of the study and replaced by another patient.</description>
