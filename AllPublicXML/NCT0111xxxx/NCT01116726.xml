    <textblock>
      A program of motivational interviewing plus enhanced community services in prevention of
      early childhood caries vs. enhanced community services alone for American Indian mothers and
      their children will reduce the childrens' decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces measure
      over a 3-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six hundred mothers and their children will
      be randomized over a 2-year period to motivational interviewing (MI) plus enhanced community
      services vs. enhanced community services alone in equal numbers in the 2 groups. The MI
      sessions will involve home visits concentrating on the mitigation of behavioral risk factors
      for early childhood caries (ECC), shortly after childbirth and at 6, 12, and 18 months. The
      enhanced community services will involve development of culturally appropriate messages
      related to the mitigation of risk factors for ECC through public announcements and simple
      brochures. The primary outcome measure will be decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces
      (dmfs) of the children at ages 1, 2, and 3. Secondary outcomes will include children's ds, %
      with dmfs and ds &gt;0, mother's dental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, caries patterns,
      and costs.
