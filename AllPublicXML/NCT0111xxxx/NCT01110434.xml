  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use is a significant public health concern that disproportionately affect youth.
      Although promising psychosocial interventions are being developed, most youth do not benefit
      from these interventions alone. Given the clinical demand for effective treatments, the
      National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) identified the critical need for data on the
      tolerability and potential efficacy of medications in adolescents. The purpose of this
      two-year study is to test if and how topiramate, a medication under intense study for
      treating several drugs of abuse, reduces cannabis use among teenagers. To this end, the
      investigators will randomize 56 nontreatment-seeking regular cannabis users (15 or 20 years
      old) to receive topiramate or placebo for 6 weeks. Youth will monitor their cannabis use for
      the 6-week period using handheld electronic diaries and complete assessments of reactivity to
      cannabis-related cues.
