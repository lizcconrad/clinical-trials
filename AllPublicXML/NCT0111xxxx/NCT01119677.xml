    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether titration of Avonex reduces the
      severity of flu-like symptoms (FLS). Secondary objectives of this study are to determine
      whether titration of Avonex reduces the incidence of FLS and to evaluate the overall safety
      and tolerability of Avonex intramuscular (IM) injections.
