    <textblock>
      Liposuction, one of the most common cosmetic procedures performed in the United States, is a
      surgical technique used to reduce localized areas of excess subcutaneous fat. The neck is a
      common area of treatment, where liposuction reduces fat volume and neck size. We hypothesize
      that suctioned removal of fat of the neck will reduce the severity of obstructive sleep
      apnea.
