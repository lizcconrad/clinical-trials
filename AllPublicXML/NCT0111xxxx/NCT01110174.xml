  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study of adult (≥ 18 years) women with stage II-III breast cancer who will receive
      preoperative chemotherapy prior to mastectomy. Patients will have real-time serum glycan
      profiling, expression of tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms to predict neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy response and additional mammography and HD PET/CT examinations to assess
      response. The investigators hypothesize that a functional tumor assessment utilizing
      high-definition positron emission tomography/computed tomography (HD PET/CT), real-time serum
      glycan profiling, and expression of tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms will predict
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients.

      This is a non-randomized clinical trial pilot study. Consenting adult (≥ 18 years) women with
      stage II-III breast cancer undergoing will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a standard
      ACT regimen prior to mastectomy. Prior to beginning chemotherapy, patients will receive a
      baseline mammogram, breast HD PET/CT, and blood draw. Not more than 7 days prior to the
      second cycle of chemotherapy, patients will have both HD PET/CT and diagnostic mammography
      images taken to assess early response to treatment. Patients will have two additional
      mammography and HD PET/CT examinations: one after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and
      another upon completion of the last cycle of chemotherapy but before mastectomy. The
      investigators will collect data on the size (maximum diameter, estimated volume) and 18FDG
      uptake (SUV) of the known primary breast cancer on HD PET/CT. Blood will be sampled from
      patients at 12 separate time points during the study for glycan analysis. At least 3 ml will
      be taken with each blood draw. The first blood draw will be taken when the patient agrees to
      enroll in the study. The second blood draw will be taken prior to the first cycle of
      chemotherapy. Thereafter, blood will be drawn for serum glycan analysis after each cycle of
      chemotherapy is completed. After the patient undergoes mastectomy, tissue will be collected
      for MUC-1 assay and two additional blood draws will be taken.
