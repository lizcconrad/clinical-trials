  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that exhaled nitric oxide can be useful to monitor the
      efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment as well as to predict a risk of asthma relapse in
      asthmatic patients.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the time course of exhaled nitric oxide in mild
      asthmatic patients, stopping regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, if it is
      possible, in relationship with symptoms and lung function.

      All patients were evaluated with pulmonary lung function, exhaled nitric oxide and peak
      expiratory flow (PEF) and fill in a personal diary for the first two weeks when patients are
      in treatment; the same evaluation will be made for other four weeks without treatment.
