    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the overall safety and effectiveness of an
      investigational drug, GC1008, in patients with mesothelioma. An investigational drug is one
      that has not been approved by the FDA. Approximately 40 people will be enrolled on this study
      at the University of Pennsylvania (Main Institution/Coordinating Site) and the University of
      Chicago (Participating Institution). We expect about 20 subjects to be enrolled at each
      institution.

      Primary: - To assess progression-free survival rate at three months Secondary: - To determine
      the toxicity and safety of systemic infusion of anti-TGF beta antibody at three-week dosing
      intervals. - To assess time to progression and overall survival - to assess response rate
      using Modified RECIST Criteria for Mesothelioma Additional Objectives: - To assess efficacy
      using serial measurements of serum [and intrapleural, if indwelling catheter in place]
      biomarkers, including serum-mesothelin related peptide (SMRP/MesomarkÂ®) and osteopontin. - To
      assess systemic [and intrapleural if indwelling catheter in place] humoral anti-tumor immune
      responses after repeated anti-TGF beta antibody instillation. - To assess systemic [and
      intrapleural, if indwelling catheter in place] TGF beta, and other cytokine levels after
      repeated anti-TGF beta antibody instillation. - To assess biologic response measurements of
      TGF beta blockade from serum tests and from pleural fluid or biopsy tissue if this is
      available.

    <description>GC1008 is a human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing all mammalian isoforms of TGFbeta (i.e., beta1, beta 2 and beta 3). GC1008 is a high affinity antibody with dissociation constants (Kds) of 1.8 nM, 2.8 nM and 1.4 nM for TGF1,2,and 3, respectively.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically [histologically or cytologically] documented pleural malignant
             mesothelioma.

        Patients must have had at least one, but no more than two prior systemic therapies, at
        least one of which contained pemetrexed.

          -  Documented progressive disease evaluable by Modified RECIST criteria. [Progressive
             symptoms after 1st line therapy in the absence of objective progression are acceptable
             as a criterion for enrollment]. Patients who have had previous extrapleural
             pneumonectomy and disease recurrence will be eligible if they have no other exclusion
             criteria.

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Greater or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Male and female patients of child-producing potential must agree to use effective
             contraception while enrolled on study and receiving the experimental drug, and for at
             least 3 months after the last treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 1 week prior to beginning treatment on this trial.

          -  Must be able and willing to give written informed consent. Patients may not be
             consented by a durable power of attorney.

          -  Serum albumin greater or equal to 2.5

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Patients must have negative tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and for
             hepatitis viruses B and C (antibody and/or antigen) unless the result is consistent
             with prior vaccination or prior infection with full recovery.

          -  At the time of enrollment, patients must be greater than 3 weeks since major surgery,
             radiotherapy, chemotherapy (greater or equal to 6 weeks if they were treated with a
             nitrosourea, mitomycin or monoclonal antibody), immunotherapy, or biotherapy/targeted
             therapies and recovered from the toxicity of prior treatment to less than or equal to
             Grade 1, exclusive of alopecia. Concurrent non-protocol cancer therapy is not
             permitted. (In patients who received long acting agents, a treatment free interval of
             2 half lives should be considered.) Note: Although a patient can be entered by these
             criteria, if a patient is less than 3-6 months from radiotherapy or talc pleurodesis,
             FDG-PET scanning will not be useful. 12).

             seizures, or a disease that either causes or threatens neurologic compromise (e.g.,
             unstable vertebral metastases).

          -  Presence of pericardial effusion

          -  Rapidly re-accumulating, symptomatic malignant pleural effusions status-post
             thoracentesis or pleural catheter insertion that requires immediate mechanical or
             chemical pleurodesis for adequate palliation.

          -  Active thrombophlebitis, thromboembolism, hypercoagulability states, bleeding, or use

             dipyridamole, and other agents used to induce long-acting platelet dysfunction).
             Patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis may participate if successfully
             treated, completely resolved, and no treatment has been given for greater than 4
             months.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women, due to the unknown effects of GC1008 on the developing
             fetus or newborn infant.

          -  Other active invasive malignancy requiring ongoing therapy.

          -  Patients with an organ transplant, including those that have received an allogeneic

          -  Patients on immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Significant or uncontrolled medical illness, such as congestive heart failure (CHF),
             myocardial infarction, symptomatic coronary artery disease, significant ventricular
             arrhythmias within the last 6 months, or significant pulmonary dysfunction.

        Patients with a remote history of asthma or active mild asthma may participate.

          -  Active infection, including active herpes zoster, as well as unexplained fever
             (temperature 38.1C), or antibiotic therapy within 1 week prior to enrollment.

          -  Systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, active rheumatoid
             arthritis, etc.).

          -  Positive stool fecal occult blood test (patients who are positive will need a standard
             GI work-up consisting of an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and Colonoscopy) prior to
             enrollment to rule out possible reasons for bleeding. A patient will be eligible with
             negative results for both exams.

          -  Active GI bleeding within past 5 years other than due to benign anorectal causes such
