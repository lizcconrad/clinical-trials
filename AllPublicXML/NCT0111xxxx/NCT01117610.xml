  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of epidural injection of
      ropivacaine on the relief of pain in patients undergoing laminectomy.

      Total 60 patients will be randomized into one of two groups (groupC or groupI) based on Excel
      number generation.

      Patients in group C will receive no medication intraoperatively, and patients in group I will
      receive epidural injection of 0.1% ropivacaine 10ml before skin incision.

      Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption and the frequency at which patients
      pushed the button (FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system will be recorded at
      4,12,24,48 hour postoperatively.

    <description>Patients will be assessed for pain using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). It is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end; left side end which represents 0 is 'No pain', right side end with 100 is 'Very severe pain'. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.
To check the severity of pain VAS will be measured at post op 4hour.</description>
