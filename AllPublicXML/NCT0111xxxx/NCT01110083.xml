  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EMD Serono has closed enrollment into this trial prior to determination of maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). EMD Serono has decided not to pursue the development of EMD 1204831 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors for reasons other than safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a an open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-man (FIM) study designed to explore the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of an investigational drug, EMD
      1204831, in patients with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to previous therapies
      or for whom no other therapies are available. Subjects will receive EMD 1204831 twice a day
      (BID) during each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
