  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fracture of the humeral diaphysis is a condition that represents 2% of all fractures. The
      conservative treatment of diaphyseal fractures of the humerus has long been considered the
      only option and the surgical treatment was primarily reserved for displaced fractures with no
      contact of bone ends. However, for a few years there has been an upsurge of indications for
      the surgical treatment of diaphyseal fractures.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the functional outcomes and the quality of life of
      surgically treated patients versus those who undergo a conservative treatment.

    <description>The union is defined by the presence of a strong radiological callus associated with lack of pain at the fracture site. The humerus unifies in an average of three months. It is considered non-union if it is not unified after six months, and it is classified as delayed union between 3 and 6 months.
The rates will be presented by the number of patients with non-union in each group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Plate and screws or nailing</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients included in the surgical group will be divided into two subgroups according to the method of fixation chosen: plate and screws or nailing. Surgeries take place under general anesthesia and a prophylaxis antibiotic is administrated. The installation and the approach will be chosen by the surgeon according to his preferences. A thoraco brachial brace is placed on the patient at the end of the intervention and it remains in place for a period of 5 to 10 days (patient comfort). A gradual mobilization of the elbow and shoulder will be initiated by the patient at home. The addition of physical therapy will be decided by the surgeon and noted down accordingly.</description>

    <description>Patients included in the conservative group will be taken to a plaster room where the HSS brace will be installed by a qualified technician. Advice will be provided for the care, personal hygiene and clothing. The brace will be kept for a period of 6 to 12 weeks depending on the degree of healing of fracture. The maintenance of the proximal part (Brace) may be recommended by the surgeon. The mobilization will begin with exercises at home and whether the patient does physical therapy or not is the surgeon's choice.</description>
