    <textblock>
      A major complication in studies to identify the nature of bladder sensations is language. It
      is difficult, if not near impossible, for the lay person, with no knowledge of physiology,
      anatomy or pathology, to put into simple terms a description of basic visceral sensations.
      Therefore, before the investigators can speculate about the detailed mechanisms generating
      sensation the investigators must overcome this language and communication difficulty. This
      will be addressed in the present study.

      There are important reasons why the investigators must identify the mechanisms generating the
      different sensations as the bladder fills. One of them is that these are basic physiological
      mechanisms which need to be better understood.

    <description>The primary objective of this experiment is to address how medical students and patients with OAB describe the sensations they feel during the filling phase of the bladder.
