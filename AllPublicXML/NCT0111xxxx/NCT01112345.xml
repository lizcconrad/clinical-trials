  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess the adherence to therapy with interferon beta-1a (Rebif®)
      and at investigating potential factors that are involved in its outcome, in a representative
      sample of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), under real life
      conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the relapsing-remitting type of the disease the objective of the therapy is the reduction
      of relapse rate, duration and severity, as well as the delay of transition to the progressive
      form of the disease. Subjects' adherence to long-term therapy of MS plays a pivotal role in
      the optimization of therapeutic outcome and maximization of the derived clinical benefit for
      the treated subjects. Rebif current formulation has been developed by assessing and refining
      the physicochemical characteristics of existing formulations aiming at further improving
      product's tolerability profile. Studies performed for the assessment of Rebif have
      demonstrated a 3-fold reduction in injection site reactions as well as improved overall
      tolerability and safety profile.

      This is a multicentre, prospective, non interventional, non randomized, open label study for
      the assessment of the adherence to therapy with Rebif of subjects with RRMS. The
      participating subjects shall be already on treatment with (Rebif) prior to their enrolment
      into the study, according to the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the
      clinical, imaging and laboratory findings of the disease, as evaluated by their treating
      physician, in real life clinical practice. Data will be collected retrospectively from a
      sample of 150 subjects' medical files and through questions that will be posed to the
      subjects, and prospectively during the course of the study. The total duration of the study
      is estimated to be 18 months.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess the compliance and persistence with Rebif therapy in MS subjects, after six
           months of therapy, in &quot;real life&quot; clinical settings in Greece

      Secondary objective:

        -  To investigate the potential factors influencing compliance and persistence to Rebif
           therapy.
