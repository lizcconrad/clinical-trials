  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beautiful skin requires maintenance of proper care. Skin exercise, protections from direct
      sunlight or harsh wind, and maintaining a healthy diet are some of the ways of having a good
      and radiant skin. However despite all the care taken passage of time will bring about
      conditions that will automatically lead to skin aging, which may require certain therapeutic,
      care. Fibroblasts are cells that synthesize the extracellular matrix and collagen and play a
      critical role in wound healing and maintenance of healthy skin. Loosing of fibroblast cell is
      the main problem in aging and wrinkles and non-healed skin wounds. Therefore proliferation of
      skin fibroblast along with differentiation of stem cells in the skin tissue is the best
      method for healing.

      Autologous cultured fibroblast is derived from in vitro expansion of fibroblasts harvested
      from the patient's normal skin. Biopsies from behind a patient's ear are the source of
      fibroblasts, which are isolated, expanded through cell culture, and used for the correction
      of facial contour deformities such as nasolabial folds, glabellar crease, deep wrinkles of
      the forehead, and acne scars. Prior to final packaging, cell viability is assessed to be at
      least 85%.

      Each single use container of autologous cultured fibroblasts has approximately 20 million
      cells aseptically processed and suspended in 1 mL of sterile, buffered Dulbecco's Modified
      Eagles Medium (DMEM). Both the biopsy transport media and the cell culture media contain
      gentamicin. Residual quantities of gentamicin up to 5 Âµg/mL may be present in the Cell
      product
