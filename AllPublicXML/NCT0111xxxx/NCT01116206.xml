  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of prucalopride to placebo
      (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real
      effect in a clinical trial) in treatment of participants with chronic (very serious, life
      threatening) constipation (decreased number of or difficulty making bowel [the intestine]
      movements).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor
      participant knows the treatment that the participants receives), placebo-controlled,
      multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study with a parallel-group design (a medical research study comparing the response in
      2 or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) study of prucalopride. This
      study consist of 3 phases: a 2 weeks drug-free screening or run in phase, a 12-week treatment
      phase and follow-up (post-treatment) phase performed 7 days following the last dose of study
      drug. The total duration of study will be approximately 15 to 20 weeks, including the run-in
      and post-treatment phases. During the run-in phase, participants will receive laxative
      (bisacodyl) as a rescue medication throughout the study, if they will not have bowel movement
      (BM) for 3 or more consecutive days. If participants will not be able to tolerate bisacodyl,
      an enema may be used in place of the bisacodyl. During the double-blind treatment phase,
      participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive
      either 2 milligram (mg) prucalopride or matching placebo prucalopride for 12 weeks, orally
      once daily. Participants will be primarily assessed for spontaneous complete bowel movements
      (SCBMs) per week. Participant's safety and quality of life will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <description>Percentage of responders (responders: participants with an average of 3 or more SCBMs per week) will be assessed during 12-week double-blind treatment phase (total treatment duration). SCBM is defined as a Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) associated with a sense of complete evacuation. SBM is defined as a bowel movement (BM) that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository used on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM. The total number of SBMs associated with a feeling of complete evacuation will be summed and divided by 12. Average weekly frequency of SCBMs will be calculated as number of SCBMs in treatment phase multiplied by 7 divided by total number of evaluable days in treatment phase.</description>
