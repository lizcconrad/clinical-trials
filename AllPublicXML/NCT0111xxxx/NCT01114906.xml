    <textblock>
      This study has been conceived in the context of Health Outcomes Research where the outcomes
      of health interventions in routine clinical practice constitute the main objective of the
      research process. In the case of asthma in Spain, the investigators do not clearly know the
      use of resources generated by the patient with asthma, its impact on the effectiveness of the
      current approach of asthmatic patients and the overall efficiency of health interventions on
      asthmatic patients. This observational, retrospective and multicenter study aims to estimate
      the use of health care resources in managing patients with asthma and to determine the
      management of the disease in the usual clinical practice in Valencia Autonomous Region. The
      data will be obtained at primary care level from the Electronic Health Record SIA+GAIA data
      base and at hospital level from allergologists and pneumologists clinical records. The
      investigators plan to introduce 289 ambulatory patients followed-up in Primary or Specialized
      Care Services, older than 15 years of age, diagnosed of asthma at least one year before the
      beginning of the study. The inclusion period will be of 3 months and the retrospective data
      of 12 previous months of follow-up will be collected.

      The direct and indirect use of resources will be collected in order to estimate the
      management and use of health care resources in managing patients with asthma in the
      Autonomous region of Valencia as primary endpoint and also to estimate the mean cost of
      asthmatic patient healthcare; to determine the global effectiveness and the efficiency of the
      actual asthmatic patient healthcare and to model the health budget according to different
      objectives of effectiveness for the next five years.
