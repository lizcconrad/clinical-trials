             For the non-cancer conditions, if the condition has been stable for at least one year
             before the screening visit and is judged by the site investigator not to interfere
             with the subject's participation in the study, the subject may be included.

          -  History of a clinically significant medical condition that would interfere with the
             subject's ability to comply with study instructions, would place the subject at
             increased risk, or might confound the interpretation of the study results.

          -  Contraindication to MRI examination for any reason (e.g., severe claustrophobia,
             ferromagnetic metal in body).

          -  Structural abnormality on MRI that precludes diagnosis of PSP, such as cortical
             infarct in brain region that might account for subject's symptoms.
