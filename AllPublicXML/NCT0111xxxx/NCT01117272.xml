  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-age
      women. According to Rotterdam 2003 criteria: at least two of three criteria are met,
      hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovary. PCOS will cause irregular
      menstrual cycle, infertility, acne, hirsutism, obesity, or/and metabolic syndrome, diabetes
      that may increase risk of cardiovascular disease.

      Hyperprolactinaemia is also a common problem in reproductive aged women. Both
      hyperprolactinaemia and PCOS had endocrine disorder and irregular menstrual cycle.
      Investigators hope to collect clinical data from PCOS and prolactinemia patients followed in
      Wang Fang hospital for many years in endocrinological and metabolical aspects for comparison.
      Investigators at the same time would like to understand more about other similarities and
      differences between these two endocrinological dysfunction for future study.
