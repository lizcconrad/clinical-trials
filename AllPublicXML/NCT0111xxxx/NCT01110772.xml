  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose if this study is to determine whether a microbial sealant (iodine +
      cyanoacrylate) [InteguSEAL®, Kimberly-Clark] reduces surgical site infections when compared
      to iodine and isopropyl alcohol (povacrylex in isopropyl alcohol) [Duraprep®] in oncologic
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient's skin flora is a major source of pathogens, and microbial contamination of the
      surgical site is a likely precursor of SSI. A variety of skin products may be used, including
      iodophors, alcohol-containing products, and clorhexidine gluconate. Despite these
      perioperative tactics, bacteria continue to survive at the skin level and migrate to
      contaminate the wound.

      A microbial sealant (InteguSEAL®, Kimberly-Clark) that uses cyanoacrylate to seal endogenous
      skin flora has demonstrated to reduce wound contamination. The efficacy of the microbial
      sealant in preventing SSI has been tested in cardiovascular surgery and open inguinal hernia
      repair, with a reduction on SSI rate when compared to standard skin preparations. This
      cyanoacrylate has not been tested in oncologic surgeries.
