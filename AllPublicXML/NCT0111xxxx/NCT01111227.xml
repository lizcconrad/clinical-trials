    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the profile of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      IL-12 and TNF-alpha under inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane and intravenous anesthesia
      with propofol in healthy patients subjected to minimally invasive elective surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty ASA-I patients, subjected to otorhinolaryngology surgery, were randomly allocated in
      one group to receive anesthesia with isoflurane 1 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) (n =
      20). Other group with twenty ASA-I patients received propofol 2 to 4 microgram mL-1 (n = 20).

      Fentanyl 5 mg kg-1 and rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg kg-1 were also administered to all patients.
      Venous blood (10 mL) was collected from each patient at each of the following times: before
      the beginning of surgery and anesthesia (T1), 2 h after the beginning of surgery (T2), and on
      the day after the anesthetic-surgical procedure (T3).

      Plasma concentrations of interleukins IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 and tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were measured in each sample through flow cytometry technique by
      using the method Cytometric Bead Array (CBA). Venous blood samples from fifteen volunteers
      not subjected to stress were also collected as control, and the same cytokines were measured.
