  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Dichloroacetate
      (DCA) in the treatment of recurrent malignant brain tumors (RMBTs). RMBTs are defined as
      either: 1) malignant tumors, originating in the brain, that have recurred at least once or 2)
      malignant tumors originating elsewhere in the body that have spread to the brain at least
      once. Otherwise, there are no limitations to the number of prior recurrences. There are no
      limitations to the number or types of prior therapies.

      Malignant brain tumors are defined as any World Health Organization grade III-IV glioma and
      any solid tumor metastasis (spread) to the brain. Recurrent malignant brain tumors (RMBTs)
      are defined as either: 1) malignant tumors, originating in the brain, that have recurred at
      least once or 2) malignant tumors originating elsewhere in the body that have spread to the
      brain at least once. They share an increasing incidence, clinical and radiographic
      characteristics, lack of effective therapies, tendency to recur, and poor outcome.
      Importantly, recurrent malignant brain tumor's shared characteristics may be usefully
      exploited by an emerging class of biologic agents called metabolic modulators of which
      Dichloroacetate (DCA) is the drug in the class most thoroughly investigated clinically. DCA's
      mechanism of action and tolerability have been extensively demonstrated in the treatment of
      chronic metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the preciseness of DCA's mechanism of action
      appears to target abnormal tumor cell metabolism.

    <measure>Determine the safety and tolerability of DCA in RMBTs.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 28 days of starting DCA +/- 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Oral DCA will be administered until intolerance, toxicity, radiographic progression, or death. Safety and tolerance will be assessed by reviewing available standardized clinical, radiographic, and quality of life (QOL) criteria. The safety and tolerance will also be assessed by reviewing available plasma, urine, and brain tumor tissue for metabolites of the tumor and the effects of DCA thereon.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conduct an exploratory investigation of the metabolites of patients with RMBTs and the effects of DCA thereon.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>We postulate that the metabolism of RMBTs and the effects of DCA thereon will help investigators understand RMBTs, how DCA works on them, and how to design future treatment studies.</description>

    <description>Subjects after passing the inclusion criteria are given a dose of dichloroacetate 4mg/kg bid for thirty days. While in the clinical research center they participate in a breath test where they exhale through a straw into a glass tube. This will measure CO2. They are monitored every two weeks for side effects and return to the clinical research center for evaluation in thirty days. They undergo another breath test and if all health parameters are within normal limits they are given a month's supply of dichloroacetate. The cycles continue unless a serious adverse event occurs or the PI judges the side effects preclude another 30 days of medication</description>
