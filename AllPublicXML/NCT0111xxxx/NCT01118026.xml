      This research is being done in order to improve treatment outcomes in patients diagnosed with
      bulky, early stage Hodgkin lymphoma and to reduce the side effects that are associated with
      use of radiation used in current treatments. The chemotherapy treatment in this study
      consists of a combination of four drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):
      doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. This regimen (called ABVD) has been
      found to be effective in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and is considered the
      standard of treatment used with radiation therapy in patients with bulky early stage Hodgkin
      lymphoma. As part of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the chemotherapy treatment, PET
      scans will be obtained during the course of therapy. The usefulness of this PET scan will be
      evaluated to determine whether radiation may be left out in the treatment of disease if the
      PET scan shows that the patient has responded to chemotherapy alone. The plan is to identify
      a group of patients using early PET scans in order to change to a chemotherapy treatment
      called BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
      procarbazine and prednisone). It is one of the most highly effective chemotherapy regimens
      for Hodgkin lymphoma, but is associated with more side effects than ABVD. Although it has
      become standard of care in Europe, its use has been more limited in the U.S. because of
      concerns about toxicity.

      This is single-arm phase II clinical trial of response-adapted therapy based on PET for bulky
      stage I and stage II Hodgkin lymphoma. A maximum of 123 patients will be entered to the
      study. The primary outcome of this study is progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the
      time from study entry to disease progression or death.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 36 months from enrollment for patients
      with bulky stage I and II Hodgkin lymphoma. All patients will begin treatment with ABVD.
      Patients who are PET negative after 2 cycles of chemotherapy will receive 6 cycles of ABVD
      without radiotherapy. Patients who are PET positive after 2 cycles of ABVD will then receive
      4 cycles of escalated BEACOPP followed by IFRT. A comparison will be made of the 36-month PFS
      between patients who are PET positive and those who are PET negative following 2 cycles of
      ABVD.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate of patients diagnosed with bulky stage I and
           II Hodgkin lymphoma following PET response-adapted chemotherapy with or without
           radiation therapy.

        2. To determine the predictive value of FDG uptake using various semiquantitative
           approaches, at baseline, after 2 cycles of ABVD and at completion of therapy.

        3. To determine the predictive value of volumetric vs. 2 dimensional (2-D) measurement
           changes on CT between baseline and after 2 cycles, at the end of chemotherapy (PET
           negative patients only) and after RT (PET positive patients only) and compare with PET
           parameters.

        4. To determine if changes in both qualitative and semiquantitative FDG-PET findings
           between baseline and after cycle 2, at end of chemotherapy (PET negative patients only)
           and after RT (PET positive patients only) with combination analyses with incorporating
           changes obtained from dedicated CT scans, correlate with response and PFS.

        5. To compare the predictive value of both qualitative and semiquantitative FDG-PET
           changes, 2-D and volumetric CT changes, and combinatorial analyses (PET+dedicated CT
           data) with molecular parameters, and conventional parameters, including IPS.

        6. To assess whether elevated baseline serum soluble CD30 (sCD30), IL10, CCL17, and CCL22
           correlate with clinical response and PFS.

        7. To assess whether persistent or recurrent elevation of serial serum sCD30, IL10, CCL17,
           or CCL22 correlate with relapse/progression or PET scan results.

        8. To confirm independently useful tissue biomarkers (bcl-2, MAL, FOXP3, CD68, GzB) for
           risk stratification in patients with bulky stage I and II Hodgkin lymphoma treated with
           this regimen.

        9. To compare mediastinal bulk on standing PA and lateral chest x-ray (&gt; 0.33 maximum chest
           diameter) with chest CT (mass &gt; 10 cm).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2-3 years, and then once a year for a maximum of ten years from the time
      of entry on the study.

               -  Histologically documented Hodgkin lymphoma subclassified according to the WHO
                  modification of the Rye Classification and staged according to the modified Ann
                  Arbor Staging Classification system.

                    -  Patients must have clinical stage IA, IB, IIA or IIB.

                    -  Patients with &quot;E&quot; extensions will be eligible if all other criteria have
                       been met.

                    -  Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is excluded.

                    -  Core needle biopsies are acceptable if they contain adequate tissue for
                       primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping. Fine needle aspirates are not
                       acceptable. If multiple specimens are available, please submit the most
                       recent. Failure to submit pathology materials within 60 days of patient
                       registration will be considered a major protocol violation.

               -  Patients must have a mediastinal mass &gt; 0.33 maximum intrathoracic diameter on
                  standing postero-anterior chest x-ray or mass measuring &gt; 10 cm in its largest
                  diameter.

          2. Second Malignancy: No &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma
             skin cancers. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if
             they have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than
             30% risk of relapse.

          3. Prior Therapy - Patients may have had one cycle only of ABVD prior to enrolling on
             study. No other prior treatment (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) for Hodgkin
             lymphoma is allowed. If patient has had one cycle of ABVD, in order to be eligible to
             enroll on CALGB 50801, the patient must have had all of the following tests prior to
             starting the first cycle of ABVD:

               -  LVEF by ECHO or MUGA

               -  PFTs (including DLCO/FVC)CT scan (neck*, chest, abdomen, pelvis)

               -  FDG-PET/CT scan

               -  Chest X-ray, PA &amp; Lateral

               -  CBC, differential, platelets

               -  ESR

               -  Serum creatinine

               -  Glucose

               -  Bilirubin

               -  LDH

             Patients with a negative FDG-PET/CT scan do not need to have had a dedicated neck CT
             scan prior to starting the previous cycle of ABVD.

          4. ECOG Performance status 0-2.

          5. LVEF and DLCO - LVEF by ECHO or MUGA within institutional normal limits unless thought
             to be disease related. DLCO ≥ 60% with no symptomatic pulmonary disease unless thought
             to be disease related.

          6. HIV Infection - Patients with known HIV must have a CD4 count &gt; 350 and be on
             concurrent antiretrovirals. Patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any
             behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for
             exposure to the HIV virus. An HIV test is not required for entry on this protocol, but
             is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk.

          7. Pregnancy Restrictions - Non-pregnant and non-nursing. Due to the teratogenic
             potential of the agents used in this study, pregnant or nursing women may not be
             enrolled. Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an effective
             means of birth control.

          8. Age Restricitions - Age 18 - 60 years

          9. Initial Required Laboratory Data:

               -  ANC ≥ 1000/μL

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL
