      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of lung recruitment maneuver in patients
      with early ALI/ARDS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described in the medical literature
      in 1967. Patients with ARDS mostly require mechanical ventilatory support due to hypoxic
      respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation can induce lung injury (ventilator-induced lung
      injury, VILI) by causing overdistention and repetitive opening and closing of unstable lung
      units. Data from a number of randomized controlled trials indicate that a lung protective
      ventilatory strategy with small tidal volume and low plateau pressure reduces mortality in
      acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lung recruitment maneuvers
      are being used in the management of ALI and ARDS, but recruitment maneuvers are still
      controversial. Lung recruitment maneuver is aimed to open the collapsed lung and keep the
      lung open. The maneuver briefly increases the alveolar pressure to open recruitable lung,
      sustained with adequate positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEP) after lung recruitment, to
      avoid derecruitment. We want to enroll 120 patients with early ALI/ARDS in this randomized
      controlled study. The study group use recruitment maneuver and lung protective ventilatory
      strategy, and the control group use lung protective ventilatory strategy only. Concerning
      about both safety and efficacy, we design a modified recruitment maneuver protocol which has
      never been published in previous medical literature. The primary outcome is ventilator-free
      days and ICU-free days, and secondary outcomes include ventilator weaning rate, and 28-day
      mortality and cost effectiveness analysis. Since no randomized controlled trials clearly
      establish benefit from recruitment maneuvers, we hope this study would be able to provide
      some evidence on whether lung recruitment should be used in the routine management of
      ALI/ARDS.
