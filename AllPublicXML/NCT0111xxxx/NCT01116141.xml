    <textblock>
      Multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled (MTX), 3-month
      study with 4 doses of CH-4051 (0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg and 3.0 mg with 1mg of folic acid
      supplementation p.o. daily) compared to a &quot;standard&quot; dose of MTX at 20 mg per week with 1 mg
      of folic acid supplementation p.o. daily. This study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part A: Patients will be randomized to 0.3 mg CH-4051, 1.0 mg CH-4051 or MTX. Part B:
      Patients will not be randomized into Part B until the Data Monitoring Committee has reviewed
      safety data from the Part A when approximately 25 patients (10 patients in each CH-4051 dose
      groups and 5 patients in the MTX groups) have completed 3 months of treatment. At this time
      the DMC will make a recommendation whether or not to commence randomization to 3.0 mg
      CH-4051, 3.0 mg CH-4051 with 1.0 mg of folic acid.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Co-primary: Hybrid American College of Rheumatology response criteria (hACR)followed by the ACR20</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The hybrid ACR (hACR) response was developed by the American College of Rheumatology to provide an improvement measure more sensitive to change than many other currently used measures, e.g., traditional ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses, while still maintaining clinical meaning. While traditional ACR 20, 50 and 70 response criteria are dichotomous measures (responder = yes/no), the hACR is a semi-continuous variable based upon the traditional ACR response but incorporating additional information on patient response into the outcome measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The disease activity score (DAS) is a combined index that was developed in Nijmegen in the 1980s to measure the disease activity in patients with RA. It has been extensively validated for its use in clinical trials in combination with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ACR response criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACR assessment criteria is a widely accepted composite index of improvement in RA proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). ACR20 refers to a composite improvement of 20% in swollen joint count, tender joint count, and 3 or more of the following 5 measures: patient's own global assessment of RA disease activity; physician's global assessment of disease activity; patient's own assessment of pain due to RA; acute-phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or CRP); and patient's self-assessed disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morning stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Morning stiffness is a common complaint of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Severity and joints involves varies from patient to patient. Patients will be asked, &quot;Over the past 7 days, what has been the duration of stiffness of your joints in the morning?&quot; The amount of time it takes a patient's morning stiffness to subside will be captured in hours and minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability of CH-4051 in RA patients as determined by the frequency and severity of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and dropouts due to AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by physical exams, vital signs, laboratory safety (blood and urine) and AEs. Liver functions tests will be identified as laboratory values of particular interest.</description>
