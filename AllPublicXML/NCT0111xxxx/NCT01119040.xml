      The purpose of this study is to determine:

        1. Utility of urgent upper endoscopy in setting of dislodges (percutaneous endoscopic
           gastrostomy) PEG tube.

        2. Feasibility of replacing naive PEG tubes with Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic
           Surgery (NOTES) in lieu of traditional surgical methods.

        3. Efficacy of replacing naive PEG tubes with NOTES in lieu of traditional surgical
           methods.

      1. Utility of Urgent Upper Endoscopy in Setting of Naïve Dislodged PEG Tubes as defined by:

             -  Percentage of Open vs. Closed Gastrotomy upon urgent endoscopy

             -  Presence of Incidental Pathology noted on Endoscopy

             -  Complications of Urgent Endoscopy

             -  Time of Procedure

        2. Technical Feasibility of the NOTES procedure determined by:

             -  Number of Successful/Failed PEG Placements

             -  Number of Patients Requiring intra-operative conversion to laparotomy or
                laparoscopic procedure

             -  Time to Complete Procedure

             -  Presence or absence of post-procedural contrast extravasation on completion
                contrast radiographic study

        3. Efficacy of NOTES PEG Rescue compared to historical controls as characterized by the
           following post-operative criteria:

             -  Number of Patients Requiring Subsequent Medical or Surgical Treatment for
                Intra-Abdominal Abscess

             -  Number of Patients Requiring Subsequent Medical or Surgical Wound Infection within
                30 post-op days

             -  Post-Operative CT or Operative Findings consistent with abscess confirmed by
                culture positive drainage, aspiration

             -  Intra-Operative or Post-Operative Red Blood Cell Transfusion

             -  Length of Stay

             -  Antibiotics &gt; 24h Post-Op

             -  30 day Re-Admission

    <description>A new way of performing surgery is called Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery, or NOTES, for short. NOTES may allow surgeons to perform abdominal surgery without any skin incisions. By using natural openings in the body, like the mouth, surgeons can enter the stomach with a tube instead of the traditional method of making an incision in the skin of the abdomen.</description>

    <intervention_name>Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) procedures involve transmural passage of flexible endoscopes introduced via a natural orifice whereby permitting access to the peritoneal cavity while avoiding skin incisions. No clear indication due to a number of physiologic, microbiologic, immunologic, and technical limitations. The concept of NOTES PEG &quot;Rescue&quot; in the setting of a dislodged naïve PEG tube may spare individual patients the physiologic stress of traditional surgery while concomitantly providing a natural segue to further study the NOTES platform in the human setting. PEG &quot;Rescue&quot; may represent a unique, practical, and empowering application of the burgeoning experience of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Patients must meet ALL of the following criteria

          -  For prospective candidates, an initial attempt to pass a balloon tipped foley catheter
             through the external cutaneous tract into the stomach will be performed. It will then
             be followed by radiographic contrast study to evaluate for extravasation of contrast
             into the peritoneal cavity. If contrast is extravasated, this will be potential
             candidate for inclusion. If the foley catheter is unable to be passed through the
             cutaneous tract, that will also be considered someone for inclusion as this patient
             will still require an operative confirmation of the patency of the gastrotomy.

          -  For retrospective candidates, intra-operative confirmation of dislodged tube as
             reported in the medical record.

          -  The patient must demonstrate pre-operative hemodynamic and respiratory stability

          -  No overwhelming medical co-morbidities prohibitive of surgery

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older

          -  Subject or subject's legal decision-making proxy agrees to participate, fully
             understands and signs the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients must not meet ANY of the following criteria:

          -  Esophageal stricture prohibiting passage of an endoscope

          -  Any contraindication to surgery

          -  Pregnancy or actively breastfeeding women

          -  Evidence of active bowel obstruction

          -  Synchronous acute abdominal pathology warranting incision-based surgery

          <title>number of days to assure leak-proof gastrocutaneous tract</title>
          <description>Following initial placement of a PEG tube, a variable number of days is required to assure a leak-proof gastrocutaneous tract formed between the adherent stomach serosa and the parietal peritoneum of the anterior wall. In well-nourished, healthy individuals free of wound-healing impairment, a robust gastrotomy track is typically formed within 2 to 4 weeks. For PEG tubes dislodged in the first two weeks post-operatively, the risk of an incompletely formed gastrocutaneous fistula track prompts concern for intra-abdominal leakage from gastrotomy.</description>
