  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of fentanyl matrix for the treatment
      of pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of knee or hip, which was not adequately controlled by
      non-opioid analgesic (e.g. NSAIDs or COX-II inhibitors) or weak opioids [tramadol
      HClacetaminophen, tramadol or codeine (or combinations with acetaminophen/ibuprofen)].

      This study is a prospective, open-label, non-interventional study. The objective of this
      study is to investigate the utility of fentanyl matrix after 8 week treatment of fentanyl
      matrix for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of knee or hip, which was not
      adequately controlled by non-opioid analgesic (e.g. NSAIDs or COX-II selective inhibitors) or
      weak opioids [tramadol HCl with acetaminophen, tramadol or codeine (or combination with
      acetaminophen/ibuprofen)] in clinical practice according to the investigator's discretion.
      This study will investigate the usefulness of fentanyl matrix based on improvement in pain
      and function after Fentanyl matrix administration in patients who complained of pain caused
      by osteoarthritis and indicated for Fentanyl matrix administration in clinical practice at
      the investigator's discretion. This study will also measure the patients' functional
      improvement through Korean Version of WOMAC. Observational study - No investigational drug
      administered

        The study population is the patients who visit a center during the study period with the
        complaint of chronic pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, and are deemed to
        fail to control pain in a proper way and need fentanyl matrix administration according to
        the investigator's discretion
