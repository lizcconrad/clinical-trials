    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is the most appropriate treatment for postoperative recurrent carcinoma cervix.
      However it is technically difficult to deliver adequate doses of RT due to presence of small
      intestines in the radiation area; thus disease control rates are poor and complication rates
      are high with conventional radiotherapy. Use of IMRT and brachytherapy for these cases allows
      for increasing dose to the tumor while sparing normal structures. It is expected that the use
      of a combination of IMRT &amp; brachytherapy will achieve higher disease control rates and
      decrease the complication rates.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of combination of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and
           brachytherapy in delivering dose escalated radiotherapy in postoperative residual /
           recurrent cases of carcinoma cervix, in terms of local control proportion and
           progression free survival (PFS)

        2. To study the late and acute toxicities associated with this treatment.

        3. Dosimetric comparison of Tomotherapy and conventional IMRT

      DESIGN: Prospective, phase II study.

      STUDY POPULATION: All patients of age &lt; 65 years diagnosed with postsurgery recurrent
      squamous cell carcinoma cervix without previous history of radiotherapy.

      STUDY SIZE: 90 patients

      METHODOLOGY: Ninety cases of cervical cancer with postsurgery recurrence limited to the
      pelvis will be screened and taken for study if eligible after taking the informed consent.

      Patients will receive external radiation therapy using IMRT to pelvis with additional dose of
      localized radiotherapy boost with brachytherapy to the vault with weekly concurrent
      chemotherapy.

      The local recurrence rate and 5 year disease free survival rate of all the patients will be
      studied.

      PROJECT PERIOD:

      Total project period : 5 years Recruitment, Data collection : 4 years Complete analysis of
      data : 1 year

    <description>Patients will receive external radiation therapy using IMRT to pelvis. Treatment volume (CTV, vault and uninvolved pelvic nodes) will receive a dose of 50-56Gy over 25-28# and gross pelvic nodes will receive 55-62Gy over 25-28 fractions over 5 weeks. Pre RT daily MV CT imaging would be done on Tomotherapy to look and correct for any set up error or anatomic variations.
Chemotherapy will be given weekly - cisplatin 40mg/m2 with prechemo medication. After completion of IMRT all patients will be evaluated for boost to vaginal vault with interstitial template brachytherapy to a dose of 16-20 Gy with HDR in 4-5 fractions. Patients not eligible for brachytherapy will get additional boost to vault and parametrium by EBRT to a dose of 15-20Gy in 6-8 fractions.</description>
