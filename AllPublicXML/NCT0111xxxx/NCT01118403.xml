  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess whether coma patients really benefit from the use of antibiotics
      as a prophylactic for reducing the incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia in this
      population group. For this we consider the use of ampicillin sulbactam antibiotic which has a
      low ability to induce resistance, efficacy and safety observed during the time that has been
      used, even in patients with neurosurgical pathology, and to be broadly available in our
      environment.

      Our hypothesis is that neurological patients in coma state, requiring mechanical ventilation,
      the application of antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo reduces the incidence of
      early ventilator-associated pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most common nosocomial infections occur
      in intensive care units, with frequencies ranging between 15% and 45%, which determine an
      attributable mortality of 25% to 27%

      Patients with compromised state of consciousness brought to mechanical ventilation, have a
      much higher reported incidence that patients without neurological involvement, reaches
      between 44 and 70%.

      These data have led to plan the implementation of strategies to reduce the incidence of early
      pneumonia in this population group, to thereby favorably influence the high rates of
      mortality, morbidity and costs that arise.

      Then we design this study to assess whether these patients really benefit from the use of
      antibiotics as a prophylactic, considering also the high impact that this would have given
      the high incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia in this population group.
